322||"<div class=""article-body""><div class=""pull-right clear-left media_article""></div><p>If you’re like many people, most nights after dinner, you get a craving for a little something sweet. But a chronic sweet tooth - an increasing problem for Americans, who are conditioned to crave sugar because of constant exposure from processed foods - isn’t just bad for your teeth or your waistline. More and more research links excessive sugar intake to serious health issues, including <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/guide/"">type 2 diabetes</a>, blood pressure, <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/stroke/guide/"">stroke</a>, and dementia.</p><p>So how much sugar is too much sugar? The amount your body can metabolize is slightly different for everyone, but the American Heart Association recommends no more than 6 teaspoons of added sugar a day for women - less than the amount of sugar in a single 12-ounce can of non-diet soda - and no more than 9 teaspoons a day for men. A 2009 survey by the American Heart Association found that adult Americans consume an average of 22 teaspoons of added sugar daily, mostly from soft drinks. You can calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar you're getting per serving of a particular food or drink by taking the number of sugar grams in one serving as listed on the product's nutritional label and dividing it by four.</p><p><strong>A Sweet 'Drug' Habit </strong></p><p>Once you’re in the habit of eating too much sugar, it becomes harder and harder to stop. “Sugar addiction is a real phenomenon,” says Nicole Avena, PhD, a food addiction researcher and assistant professor of neuroscience at Princeton University. “Research indicates that changes to brain chemicals after sugar consumption are similar to changes seen after drug use, and constantly overeating sugar leads to addiction and <a href=""/diet-nutrition/101/benefits-of-healthy-eating/overcoming-obesity.aspx"">obesity</a>.” Sugary foods and drinks activate the “reward” centers of the brain, which lead to more cravings for the sweet stuff.</p><p>The issue isn’t limited to obviously sweet snacks like candy and soda - it’s also the sugar added to processed foods that don’t even <em>taste</em> sweet, like ketchup and salad dressing, and also those found within white starchy foods like pasta and bread.</p><p></p><p>So how do you know if your hankering for sweets is harmless, or if you’re consuming an unhealthy - and possibly addictive - level of sugar?</p><p></p><p><strong>Do You Have a Problem With Sugar?</strong></p><p>Jacob Teitelbaum, MD, author of <em>Beat Sugar Addiction NOW!</em>, is an internist who studies sugar addiction and has identified four types of sugar addicts:</p><ul><li>People who are constantly tired and turn to sugar for an energy boost</li><li>People who are extremely irritable when they go without eating for too long and turn to sugar for a quick snack</li><li>People who constantly crave “a little something sweet”</li><li>People with hormonal imbalances who turn to sugar as a way to boost their mood</li></ul><p>“Constant anxiety, fatigue, and constant sugar cravings are all signs of an addiction,” Dr. Teitelbaum says. “There’s no one amount of daily sugar that is a sign of sugar addiction, it all depends on whether a person feels poorly and exhibits the symptoms of the four types of sugar addicts. At that point, it’s time to figure out your addiction type and how you can treat it.”</p><p>If you’re constantly turning to sugar for an energy boost or craving a sweet treat, Teitelbaum says you can typically treat your addiction by drinking more water, <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/allarticles.aspx"">eating a more balanced diet</a>, eliminating soda, and sleeping more. Some addicts are triggered by stress, so identifying and eliminating the source of your stress is key. If you’re suffering from a hormonal imbalance, you might want to talk to your doctor about hormone therapy or supplements.</p></div>"|Sun Feb 17 05:45:07 +0000 2013|[]|It's more than a sweet tooth!

""The repetition of this sequence of events can lead to a disease outbreak.""</p><p>And that, Ruiz-Moreno said, is where weather comes into the picture, with computer simulations revealing that the risk of an outbreak rises when temperatures, and therefore mosquito populations, rise.</p><p>The study analyzed possible outbreak scenarios in three U.S. locales.</p><p>In 2013, the New York region is set to face its highest risk for a CHIKV outbreak during the warm months of August and September, the analysis suggests. By contrast, Atlanta's highest-risk period was identified as longer, beginning in June and running through September. Miami's consistent warm weather means the region faces a higher risk all year.</p><p>""Warmer weather increases the length of the period of high risk,"" Ruiz-Moreno said. ""This is particularly worrisome if we think of the effects of climate change over [average] temperatures in the near future.""</p><p>Ruiz-Moreno discussed his team's research — funded in part by the U.S. National Institute for Food and Agriculture — in a recent issue of the journal <em>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>.</p><p>CHIKV was first identified in Tanzania in 1953, the authors noted, and the severe joint and muscle pain, fever, fatigue, headaches, rashes and nausea that can result are sometimes confused with symptoms of <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/dengue-fever/guide/"">dengue fever</a>.</p><p></p><p>Few patients die of the illness, and about one-quarter show no symptoms whatsoever. Many patients, however, experience prolonged joint pain, and there is no effective <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/chikungunya/guide/treatment/"">treatment for chikungunya</a>, leaving physicians to focus on <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/chikungunya/guide/symptoms/"">symptom</a> relief.</p><p>Disease spread is of paramount concern in the week following infection, during which the patient serves as a viral host for biting mosquitoes. Infected mosquitoes can then transmit the virus and cause a full-blown outbreak.</p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention became aware of the growing threat of a global outbreak in 2005 and 2006, following the onset of epidemics in India, Southeast Asia, Reunion Island and other islands in the Indian Ocean. In 2007, public health concerns mounted following an outbreak in Italy.</p><p>To assess the risk of a U.S. epidemic, the authors collected data concerning regional mosquito population patterns, daily regional weather and human population statistics.</p><p>They ran the information through a computer simulation designed to conservatively crunch the numbers based on the likelihood that an outbreak would occur in the coming year after just one CHIKV-infected individual entered any of the three test regions.</p><p>The results suggested that because environmental factors affect mosquito growth cycles, the regional risk for a CHIKV outbreak is, to a large degree, a function of weather. The authors said that public health organizations need to be ""vigilant,"" while advocating for region-specific planning to address varying levels of risk across the country.</p><p>However, Dr. Erin Staples, a CDC medical epidemiologist based in Fort Collins, Colo., said that although the study was ""carefully and nicely done"" the investigation's focus on the role of temperature in CHIKV outbreak risk should not negate the importance of other key factors such as human behavior.</p><p>""We're aware of the potential introduction and spread of this virus, as well as several other mosquito-borne diseases,"" she said. ""We've been working to create and prepare a response to the risk that this virus could expand into the U.S.""</p><p>""Similar to the messages we give for <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/healthy-living/0927/west-nile-cases-rise-by-400-since-last-week.aspx"">West Nile, another mosquito-borne disease</a>, we believe that prevention is the most important thing to focus on,"" Staples said. ""That means wearing long sleeves and pants, using air conditioning or making sure your screens are intact, avoiding standing water, and using mosquito repellant. Because if [CHIKV] were to be introduced into the U.S., the best way to prevent a spread is to <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/skin-and-beauty-photos/how-to-identify-common-bug-bites.aspx"">avoid mosquito bites</a> in the first place.""</p></div>"|Sun Feb 17 05:15:06 +0000 2013|['#Mosquito']|Climate Change May Bring Another Mosquito-Borne Illness to U.S. |3.030096568072397e+17|http://bit.ly/Wo6Hqy
324||"<div class=""article-body""><div class=""pull-right clear-left media_article""></div><p>Just like adults, many kids — infants and toddlers included — are plagued with mental health problems. In fact, nearly one in five children has a <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/depression/guide/"">mental illness</a>, and for some of these youths, the disease interferes significantly with their daily lives.</p><p>But according to recent research from the American Psychological Association, young children are less likely to get mental health treatment than their grownup counterparts. Why? Too often, kids are expected to ""grow out"" of their emotional problems.</p><p>That means it's up to the parents <em>not</em> to ignore any instinctive sense that their child's emotional health is at risk. If you suspect any signs of mental illness such as <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/adhd/guide/"">ADHD</a> or depression in children, it's important to seek help from an expert in kids' psychology.</p><p><strong>What to Do When Something's ‘Off'</strong></p><p>""Most parents want to believe that their kids are doing okay,"" says psychiatrist William M. Klykylo, MD, professor and director of the division of child and adolescent psychiatry at the Wright State University School of Medicine in Dayton, Ohio. ""But if you feel that something is going on or if someone you trust — a teacher or counselor, a minister or other clergy person, or a coach — says ‘I've got a feeling about your child,' pay attention.""</p><p></p><p>The signs of mental illness in children vary by age and type of illness, with some psychiatric disorders appearing even in preschool years. However, two warning signs tend to cross over into all categories and signal that you should consult with an <a href=""/emotional-health/index.aspx"">emotional health</a> professional experienced in kids' psychology:</p><ul><li>Extremes or peculiarity of behavior for the age and gender of the child, such as being significantly more hyper, aggressive, or withdrawn</li><li>Sudden, hard-to-explain negative changes in behavior, such as a steep drop in grades</li></ul><p>But many children have more than one mental illness — which makes getting a diagnosis even more challenging.</p><p><strong>Know These Signs of Kids' Mental Illness</strong></p><p>Here are some of the <a href=""/mental-health/mental-health-issues.aspx"">signs of mental illness</a> during different age ranges.</p><p><strong>Preschool/early elementary school years:</strong></p><ul><li>Behavior problems in preschool or daycare</li><li>Hyperactivity way beyond what the other kids are doing</li><li>Trouble sleeping</li><li>Persistent nightmares</li><li>Excessive fear, worrying, or crying</li><li>Extreme disobedience or aggression. Because it's often within a child's nature to disobey or intrude on a playmate's space, an excessive degree of this behavior is what should concern you, says Dr. Klykylo, such as deliberate destructiveness or hurting peers or animals.</li><li>Lots of temper tantrums all the time</li><li>Persistent difficulty separating from a parent. Klykylo acknowledges that many children experience separation anxiety at first; there could be a problem if this goes on for months.</li></ul><p></p><p>Klykylo adds that what you might think are signs of mental illness may in fact be symptoms of another condition entirely, such as a sleep disorder, but that you should still <a href=""/emotional-health/finding-help-for-mental-health-issues.aspx"">seek medical help</a>.</p><p><strong>Grade school years:</strong></p><p>At this stage, Klykylo suggests looking at your child's relationships as a good external barometer of well-being. A child might only have one or two friends, but it's not the number of friends that you want to watch — it's the type of friends and how well your child maintains those friendships. If one drops off, that's an issue, says Klykylo.</p><p>Other possible signs of mental illness include:</p><ul><li>Excessive fears and worries</li><li>Extreme hyperactivity</li><li>Sudden decrease in school performance</li><li>Loss of interest in friends or favorite activities</li><li>Loss of appetite</li><li>Sudden changes in weight</li><li>Excessive worry about weight gain</li><li>Sudden changes in sleep habits</li><li>Visible prolonged sadness</li><li>Substance use or abuse</li><li>Seeing or hearing things that are not there</li></ul><p>Klykylo notes that from a parent's perspective, it can be hard to figure out what type of mental illness could be threatening your child. For example, he says, ""Depression in children does exist, but it is often accompanied by hyperactivity."" While depression can cause a loss of appetite, if your child is refusing to eat or only eats very limited selections, you might also be seeing the early signs of an eating disorder.</p><p><strong>Tween and teen years:</strong></p><p>The preceding signs of mental illness are still a concern, but the behaviors may be more pronounced as children get older. Look for:</p><ul><li>Destructive behavior, such as damaging property or setting fires</li><li>Constantly threatening to run away or running away, which can be a precursor to self- harm, says Klykylo</li><li>Withdrawal from family and friends</li><li>Comments or writings that suggest a desire to harm himself or others</li></ul><p>Once you seek help, your child will be evaluated. The Child Behavior Checklist, which contains more than 100 questions related to child behavior, may be used — or the kids' psychology expert you choose may refer to the DSM-IV with strict medical guidelines for diagnosing mental illnesses.</p><p>Your participation in both the evaluation and the treatment of your child could be essential, says Klykylo. Younger children are often treated with the involvement of their caregivers and family, he says. Medication, therapy, behavior change, modifications in the school setting, and other tools may be needed to help you and your child, depending on the diagnosis.</p></div>"|Sun Feb 17 04:45:08 +0000 2013|[]|The surprising warning signs of mental illness in children |3.030021138967675e+17|http://bit.ly/St50dR

<p>SUNDAY, Oct. 2 (MedPage Today) — Stepping up the intensity of a <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/weight/weight-management.aspx"">weight-loss</a> intervention only for those patients who fail to reach their goal may be a viable alternative to standard lifestyle approaches, a randomized trial showed.
</p>
<p>There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients who achieved a 10% reduction in weight after 18 months between the stepped-care group and the standard group (26% versus 32%, P&gt;0.05), according to John Jakicic, PhD, of the University of Pittsburgh.
</p>
<p>The average percent weight loss was also similar in the two groups (5.8% versus 6.8%, P&gt;0.05), Jakicic reported at the Obesity Society meeting here.
</p>
<p>""So the stepped-care approach may present an effective alternative to standard behavioral weight loss interventions,"" he said.
</p>
<p>He added that 30% to 40% of the patients in the stepped-care group remained at one of the first two steps, which involved monthly group meetings, weekly mailed lessons, and mailed feedback on a self-monitoring diary (for both steps), and one phone call per month (for the second step only).
</p>
<p></p><p>Although behavioral interventions involving lifestyle changes have been shown to be effective at getting patients to lose weight, the intensity of such approaches generally remains the same regardless of whether the participants are responding.
</p>
<p>A stepped approach, in which the intensity is increased only if the participant fails to reach a pre-specified goal, has been proposed as an alternative, but the strategy had not been compared with a standard behavioral weight loss intervention in a randomized trial, according to Jakicic.
</p>
<p>He and his colleagues designed the Step Up study, which randomized 364 overweight and obese individuals to a stepped-care or standard intervention. The mean age of the participants was 42.2 and the mean body mass index was 33 kg/m2 (ranging from 25 to 39.9 kg/m2). Most of the participants were female (82.7%).
</p>
<p>Those in both groups were prescribed dietary goals, with the aim of reducing calories and fat intake, and physical activity targets progressing to 300 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/fitness-pictures/amazing-benefits-of-exercise.aspx"">exercise</a> per week.
</p>
<p>The standard behavioral weight loss program involved group sessions weekly for the first six months, twice a month for the next six months, and monthly sessions for the final six months. The program remained consistent for all participants regardless of weight loss achieved.
</p>
<p></p><p>In the stepped-care group, however, participants were scheduled to attend one group session per month throughout the study and to receive weekly mailed lessons, as well as mailed feedback on their diaries. Those who failed to achieve various weight loss goals — 5% at three months, 7% at six months, and 10% at nine months and every three months thereafter — received more frequent contact.
</p>
<p>The intensified steps included up to two phone calls per month, up to two individual sessions to discuss weight loss per month, and the provision of meal replacements.
</p>
<p>Although participants in both groups lost weight, the absolute loss was significantly greater in the standard group for the first six months (22 pounds versus 17.6 pounds, P&lt;0.05), as was the percent weight loss (9.2% versus 7.6%, P&lt;0.01). At each time point beyond six months, however, there was no significant difference between the two groups for either measure.
</p>
<p>Jakicic said that there was more work to be done to evaluate a stepped-care intervention for weight loss, including looking at:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether any of the steps were more effective than others
    </li>
<li>Who responded to the approach
    </li>
<li>Different approaches for stepping up care
    </li>
<li>The effect of <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/allarticles.aspx"">diet</a> and <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/fitness/articles.aspx"">physical activity</a> behaviors</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, he and his colleagues will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis and examine whether the weight loss thresholds for stepping up care need to be adjusted.

Serotonin, the research team noted, is critical to the regulation of mood, appetite, sleep, learning and memory.</p><p>""We've always known that ecstasy produced transient effects, but with the suggestion that there would be recovery over time,"" explained study co-author Dr. Ronald Cowan, an associate professor of psychiatry in the department of psychiatry with Vanderbilt University Medical Center's School of Medicine in Nashville, Tenn. ""But here we find that these effects may be sustained over time with no evidence of reversal,"" he added.</p><p>""Now this is an observational study, so we can't do really any more than suggest causation,"" Cowan noted. ""But I would say that this is nevertheless the strongest evidence we have that there is chronic change in serotonin levels for those who use the drug.""</p><p>Cowan and his colleagues report their findings in the Dec. 5 online issue of the <em>Archives of General Psychiatry</em>.</p><p></p><p>The authors noted that nearly 16 million Americans aged 12 and older have reportedly used ecstasy at some point in their life.</p><p>As described by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse, ecstasy (otherwise known by its chemical name, MDMA) is a psychoactive stimulant that is similar in structure to <a href=""/drugs/methamphetamine"">methamphetamine</a> and mescaline.</p><p>The drug increases serotonin levels in the brain, and users feel a sense of euphoria and emotional warmth. On the downside, the institute notes that the drug prompts a potentially problematic increase in both heart rate and blood pressure, and can lead to sleep disturbance and lingering feelings of confusion, depression and anxiety.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, some researchers have pointed to the therapeutic potential for the controlled, clinical use of MDMA to help patients struggling with <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/ptsd/guide/"">post-traumatic stress disorder</a> (PTSD) and/or dysfunctional social skills.</p><p>Cowan's team focused on 24 women, including 14 who were described as MDMA users. The study was confined to women to avoid the complication of gender-specific serotonin level differences between men and women.</p><p></p><p>The average age of the women was 22. Cowan noted that those who were MDMA users had taken ecstasy for a period of between three to four years, with the number of pills taken ranging from just five to roughly 375 overall. At the start of the study, all had abstained from ecstasy use for a minimum of 90 days, with the average length of abstinence hovering at the two-year mark.</p><p>The team used positron emission tomography (PET) scans to assess levels of serotonin receptors in the participants' brains, noting that receptor levels are known to go up as serotonin levels go down. Those women who had a history of taking ecstasy had higher receptor levels than women who hadn't, suggesting a drop in serotonin levels among MDMA users.</p><p>What's more, the team observed a dose-dependent impact: The more ecstasy a woman had taken in her lifetime, the higher her receptor levels.</p><p>""We don't actually know what the implications are,"" acknowledged Cowan. ""There is some evidence in prior research that a drop in serotonin leads to <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/sleep-apnea/guide/"">sleep apnea</a>, depression, anxiety and memory loss. But in our work we didn't find evidence of mental health issues. No increased anxiety, impulsivity or depression. And the IQs of the women who took the drug were identical with those who had never taken it,"" he stated.</p><p>""We also have no proof that a drop in serotonin levels would be forever,"" Cowan noted. ""Animal studies have indicated that there could be as much as a seven-year duration in such dips. But we don't know. So, this work raises serious concerns and questions, but more research is needed.""</p><p>Michael Mithoefer, a clinical researcher in the field of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD, stressed ""the importance of not jumping to conclusions.""</p><p>""You have to be careful with research like this,"" Mithoefer cautioned. ""There have been some other similar studies suggesting the possibility of some long-term changes with ecstasy use. But the problem with retrospective studies based on self-report is that there are other factors at play that might not be accounted for. Did these people take other drugs at the same time? Was it really MDMA that they took? Exactly how much did they take? What really was the dose taken? That kind of thing can become very unclear when you're asking people to remember past behavior,"" he explained.</p><p>""It's also the case that in clinical research conducted with a few different doses of pure MDMA we have no found evidence of these kinds of problems,"" noted Mithoefer.</p><p>""I do, however, think it's important that people not think that MDMA is without risk,"" he added. ""Especially with recreational use in an uncontrolled setting. Whether that will lead to mental health issues or not is unclear. But it is certainly something that bears further study.""</p></div>"|Sun Feb 17 03:45:14 +0000 2013|[]|This is your brain on ecstasy: |3.0298703942558515e+17|http://bit.ly/y5eL1Z

Not for the faint of heart — the “X” stands for extreme — the 90-day cycle requires strength training, toning, and cardio workouts six days a week for an hour at a time. If you can stick with the plan, the fitness guru behind P90X, Tony Horton, says you’ll be “absolutely ripped” by the end, thanks to the plan’s rotation of 12 different types of workouts.</p><p>“There’s no way after two to three weeks that you’re not feeling stronger and you’re not seeing something happening to your body,” Beachbody co-founder Jon Congdon says. “If you’re overweight, you’ll see a quick change in your waistline.” Also, he says, P90X is convenient and affordable. “It’s a home <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/everything-you-need-know-about-fitness-why-its-about-way-more-than-hitting-gym/"">fitness</a> program so you don’t have the expense of joining a gym.”</p><p>The P90X <a href=""/fitness-pictures/make-the-most-of-your-workout-routine.aspx""><strong>workout schedule</strong></a> is intense — and it might not be suitable for people with a lot of weight to lose or certain health conditions that make exercise difficult. Before you start any exercise routine, you should check with your doctor.</p><p>If you do decide to give P90X a try, you’re buying a series of 12 workout DVDs that take you through one of 12 hour-long routines six days a week. “It works in three phases,” Congdon says. “You do three weeks of intense bodybuilding exercises, and then a week of “recover” exercises, which are easier. Then another three weeks of intense exercises and a week of recover and then another three weeks and one week of recover.” The first three weeks in each cycle include new and challenging exercises. “Each time, we introduce new moves and routines so that your body doesn’t plateau and you don’t get bored,” Congdon says, explaining the secret to the success of the P90X workout.</p><p><strong>Getting Started With P90X</strong></p><p></p><p>Anyone can follow the P90X workout schedule — you don’t have to be a super athlete or in super shape, its founders say. However, Congdon says, if you’re totally out of shape you might want to start with P90, which is a little easier, and you should always consult your doctor before starting an exercise program. Another option, he says, is if there’s an exercise or movement you can’t do, you just don’t do it.</p><p>“It’s important that you listen to your body and stop and take lots of rests,” Congdon says. The exercises are pretty intense. “Some people say they feel like they’re burning more calories just watching it.”</p><p>The videos are the same for men and women. “We have a lot of couples who have done it together,” Congdon says.</p><p><strong>P90X Nutrition</strong></p><p>The program also includes a nutritional program designed by nutritionist Carrie Wiatt. It’s not necessarily a weight-loss diet, but it teaches you what to eat to burn fat and build muscle.</p><p></p><p>Your results will depend on what shape you’re in when you start the program. If you have significant weight to lose, you will, Congdon says. More importantly, he continues, you’ll strengthen and tone your muscles and look and feel better.</p><p>“By the end of the program, you’re eating nearly 50 percent complex carbs every day because your body is such a machine and you need fuel to sustain it,” Congdon says. Nutritional supplements are part of the P90X workout program as well, but they are optional.</p><p><strong>Like Having Your Own Personal Trainer</strong></p><p>Mike Z. Robinson, an ACE certified personal trainer and owner of MZR Fitness in San Luis Obispo, Calif., agrees that the P90X workout is very popular because it’s fun, challenging, and provides results. “A lot of people get bored with their exercise regimens, so when they get something that consistently pushes them and they’re getting results, then it’s a win-win,” he says.</p><p>For most people, P90X is like having a <a href=""/fitness/benefits-of-personal-trainer.aspx""><strong>personal trainer</strong></a> at a much reduced cost. “There are several key similarities between using P90X and having a personal trainer — the workouts are constantly varied, and motivation and exercise programs are prescribed on a daily basis, just to name a few,” Robinson says.</p><p>Although at-home workouts like P90X save the cost of a gym membership, not working with a live trainer can also be a drawback. “The danger of P90X and similar programs is that there is no one to be watchful of your moves, which decreases the likelihood of your getting injured,” Robinson says.</p><p>Also, home fitness programs are only effective if you’re motivated to stick with them and make the commitment. “Accountability is one of the main things that people struggle with when it comes to fitness,” Robinson says, “and there is no accountability with these types of products. If you are consistent and do the work, then the program will be successful for you, but you must do it.”</p></div>"|Sun Feb 17 03:15:26 +0000 2013|[]|Should you try P90X? |3.0297954375972454e+17|http://bit.ly/OeODQ4

In a study of more than 16,000 South Australians, those who regularly drank soft drinks had a significantly higher chance of developing asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than those who didn’t. While the researchers point out an association between soft drink-consumption and respiratory ills, they don’t show direct cause-and-effect.</p><p>When it comes to soda and health in general, we know sugary beverages can load your diet with empty calories. It’s <a href=""/stroke/0423/killer-soda-not-so-sweet-news-for-cola-lovers.aspx"">not good for your heart or blood vessel health</a>, either. When it comes to asthma, <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/obesity/guide/"">obesity</a> can worsen symptoms due to inflammation.</p><p>But sweet, fizzy, and refreshing, a soda can sound tempting. For some, it’s not easy to stop sipping sugary drinks cold-turkey.</p><h2>Tips for Quitting Soda</h2><p>From caffeine fixes to sugar highs, it can be hard to put a cap on your soda-drinking habit. But following a focused strategy — the same way you would if you wanted to lose weight or give up cigarettes — can make the process can less painful than you might think.</p><p>Here are five steps to help you stop sipping soda:</p><ul><li><strong>Start with just one.</strong> True soda addicts may have problems going cold turkey, so if you drink more than one can a day, cutting out one soda per day is a good way to start. And you’ll boost any weight-loss goals you might have in the process. “For every one can of soda you take away from your daily diet, you could lose up to 16 pounds in a year,” says dietitian Hannah El-Amin, RD, of Northwestern Integrative Medicine in Chicago.</li><li><strong>Try sparkling water.</strong> If you’re missing the fizz, <a href=""/photogallery/soda-alternatives.aspx"">sparkling water</a> is a good, low-calorie replacement during meals or when the vending machine is calling out to you. Add flavor with a fresh orange, lime, or lemon slice.</li><li><strong>Replace the caffeine.</strong> If you experience withdrawal symptoms, like headaches, from your quest to quit soda, it’s probably tied to the caffeine content. One approach is to replace the soda with a healthier beverage that contains some caffeine, like tea. “Commercially prepared iced tea usually has less than half the caffeine of colas,” says El-Amin. “If you brew your own at home, use a short brewing time of one to two minutes to help keep the caffeine low.”</li><li><strong>Wean yourself off the sugar.</strong> Sugar withdrawal can also create cravings when you stop drinking regular soda. “Replace each soda with a piece of fruit, and then start tapering down the fruit until you’re only eating two pieces of low or moderate glycemic index fruits daily, like berries or apples,” says JJ Virgin, a certified nutrition specialist in California. “You need to shift over your body from being a sugar burner to being able to burn stored body fat for fuel.”</li><li><strong>Learn to love water.</strong> Plain old water is the healthiest alternative when you stop drinking soda. And believe it or not, there are ways to <a href=""/heart-health-pictures/ways-to-make-water-less-boring.aspx"">make it taste better</a>. “Add a fresh squeeze of lemon or carry crystallized citrus packets with you for an easy way to make bottled water more interesting,” says El-Amin.</li></ul><p></p><p></p></div>"|Sun Feb 17 02:15:14 +0000 2013|[]|Soda drinkers listen up!

href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/hepatitis-c/guide/"">hepatitis C</a> virus (HCV) may allow previously untreated patients to avoid interferon therapy, long a standard of care, researchers said.</p><p>Two phase IIa studies, reported in the Jan. 3 issue of the <em>New England Journal of Medicine,</em> found promising results with different agents, either without interferon or with reduced use of the drug.</p><p></p><p>Both studies also found less impressive outcomes among patients previously treated unsuccessfully with the standard combination of ribavirin and pegylated interferon.</p><p>The development of so-called direct-acting agents, delivered orally, has held the promise of eliminating the need for treatment with interferon, which is difficult to tolerate and must be administered by subcutaneous injection.</p><p>""The development of an interferon-free, all-oral treatment regimen would represent an important advance,"" argued researchers led by Edward Gane, MD, of Auckland City Hospital in Auckland, New Zealand.</p><p>In an open-label study, Gane and his colleagues gave the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir combined with ribavirin for up to 12 weeks to eight groups of HCV patients:</p><ul><li>40 previously untreated patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection were randomly assigned, in groups of 10, to get the combination, with three groups also getting peginterferon alfa-2a for 4, 8, or 12 weeks, respectively</li><li>two additional groups, each of 10 previously untreated patients also with genotypes 2 or 3, got sofosbuvir monotherapy for 12 weeks or sofosbuvir, peginterferon alfa-2a, and ribavirin for 8 weeks</li><li>two groups of patients with HCV genotype 1 received sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 weeks — 10 patients with no response to prior treatment and 25 with no previous treatment.</li></ul><p>Gane and colleagues have <a href=""http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/CROI/31530"" target=""_blank"">previously reported</a> some of the promising results in the genotype 2 and 3 patients but early outcomes among those with genotype 1, regarded as more difficult to cure, were disturbing.</p><p>Specifically, as they reported in the journal, 9 of 10 who had previously failed interferon-based treatment relapsed quickly after the end of treatment with sofosbuvir and ribavirin.</p><p>On the other hand, all of the patients in the first four groups achieved a sustained virologic response at 24 weeks (SVR24) – defined as no detectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after the end of therapy – which is usually regarded as a cure.</p><p></p><p>And all 10 patients who got sofosbuvir, peginterferon alfa-2a, and ribavirin for 8 weeks achieved SVR24, as did 6 of 10 who got sofosbuvir monotherapy.</p><p>Importantly, 21 of 25 previously untreated patients with HCV genotype 1 – or 84 percent — achieved SVR24 after 12 weeks of treatment therapy with sofosbuvir and ribavirin.</p><p>Taken together, Gane and colleagues concluded, the data suggest that 12 weeks of the all-oral combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin is likely to be effective regardless of genotype, as long as patients have not previously been treated with interferon and ribavirin.</p><p>The results ""potentially pave the way"" to an all-oral, short-duration regimen that does not use interferon, Gane and colleagues concluded, arguing that the combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin deserves further study.</p><p>Investigators on the second study, led by Fred Poordad, MD, of the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, came to similar conclusions about a different regimen.</p><p>In a 12-week open-label study, a combination of two direct-acting agents, along with ribavirin, yielded good results in treatment-naïve patients with genotype 1 virus, but did less well among those who had previously been treated with interferon and ribavirin.</p><p>The investigational drugs were ABT-450, an inhibitor of the viral NS3 protease, boosted with low-dose ritonavir, and ABT-333, a non-nucleoside NS5B polymerase inhibitor.</p><p>All patients got ABT-333 and ribavirin, as well as one of two doses of ABT-450/r — 250 or 150 mg daily, with 100 mg of ritonavir in either case – for 12 weeks and were followed for 48 weeks after the end of therapy.</p><p>The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who reached a so-called extended rapid virologic response, defined as undetectable viral RNA from week 4 through week 12.</p><p>By that token, Poordad and colleagues reported:</p><ul><li>17 of 19 treatment-naïve patients who got the high dose of ABT-450/r (89 percent) reached the primary endpoint</li><li>Among treatment-naïve patients, 11 of 14 (79 percent) who got the lower dose achieved an extended rapid virologic response</li><li>In those two groups, all patients who completed treatment had a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after treatment — 18 of the 19 in the first group and 13 of 14 in the second.</li><li>In the third group of therapy-experienced patients, treatment with the low dose of ABT-450/r along with ABT-33 and ribavirin led to an initial decline of viral load in all patients.</li><li>10 of 17 patients (59 percent) had an extended rapid virologic response, six had virologic breakthrough during treatment, three had a relapse after treatment, and eight (47 percent) had a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of therapy.</li></ul><p>Poordad and colleagues argued that the findings suggest the regimen will do well among previously untreated patients with genotype 1 infection, but added that larger studies are needed to confirm the results.</p><p>Source: <a href=""http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/Hepatitis/36677"">HCV Studies Give

""We always had a lot of food at home, and whenever we ate, it was like a feast,"" said Garcia.</p><p>And he said his family's food choices weren't always the healthiest either. ""My eating habits were terrible,"" he said. ""We'd have lots of flour tortillas, beans and rice.""</p><p>Over the years, Garcia's weight ballooned — to 430 pounds at his heaviest. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and put on insulin to bring down his blood sugar levels. But he had such a hard time controlling his blood sugar, he said, that he went into a coma more than once. He also had several heart attacks and lost sight in one eye. His <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health/diet-tips-to-reduce-high-triglycerides.aspx"">triglycerides, a bad type of fat in the blood</a>, were over 2,000. Doctors recommend those levels be below 150, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.</p><p>Garcia also came close to losing a foot. Though doctors told him that they might very well need to amputate his foot, the surgeons were able to save his foot but they did have to amputate two toes.</p><p>That proved to be a tipping point.</p><p></p><p>""I'd been diabetic for 15 years,"" Garcia said. ""I didn't want to lose my feet. I knew I had to change or I would die.""</p><p>Change wouldn't come easily, however. Garcia said that his doctor, who'd heard that gastric bypass surgery could successfully treat diabetes, initially suggested it. But first, to ensure that he was a good candidate for the drastic lifestyle changes required after the surgery, Garcia's doctors enrolled him in a six-month nutrition program to help people learn to control their eating. He had already <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/diet/secrets-of-weight-control/"">lost some weight on his own and was down to 370 pounds</a> when he started the nutrition program. After six months, he was down to 320 pounds — a clear sign that he was making the necessary changes.</p><p>Besides the nutrition program, Garcia said, his health-care team also recommended a 12-step program for food addiction.</p><p>""It's like being an alcoholic,"" Garcia said. ""Our thinking gets us into this situation, and that's why they have the 12-step program with the surgery, so you learn to deal with your thoughts.""</p><p>Once he had the surgery, in May 2011, he said that changes began happening immediately.</p><p></p><p>""My sugar levels came down drastically,"" Garcia said. ""I was on insulin, but now I don't have to take any medications at all.""</p><p>He now weighs 232 pounds and does 6 miles on an elliptical exercise machine every day. He's also been lifting weights and building muscles. His waist circumference, at 48 inches when he had the surgery, is now 36 inches.</p><p>""Exercise has really motivated me and changed my depression,"" Garcia said. ""It was hard having so many issues with my health.""</p><p>When first <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/guide/symptoms/"">diagnosed with type 2 diabetes</a>, Garcia's hemoglobin A1C levels (a measure of blood sugar levels for the previous two to three months) were 16 percent. Someone without diabetes generally has levels below 6 percent. His last A1C was 5.6 percent. And, his triglycerides were down to normal, at 133.</p><p>Garcia said he's still very careful about what he eats. He tries to stay away from meat and processed foods. A typical day's diet begins with a protein drink and a banana, followed by a salad for lunch and a Portobello mushroom quesadilla for dinner.</p><p>""It's a big adjustment and a lot of hard work,"" he said. ""You have to be committed. You can't just think that the surgery is going to be a miracle.""</p><p>But he said the hard work has been worth it.</p><p>""I feel like someone just turned the lights on,"" he said. ""I had a glaze in my eyes, but in the last four months I can see everything clearly again. I feel like a totally new person.""</p></div>"|Sun Feb 17 00:45:09 +0000 2013|['#BariatricSurgery']|r Texas Man, BariatricSurgery Led to a Diabetes-Free Life |3.029417208558551e+17|http://bit.ly/VobtFM

Proponents of the health benefits of apple cider vinegar cite testimonials from people who believe that drinking apple cider vinegar has helped them, but is there any evidence to back up these claims?</p><p>Alexa Schmitt, a clinical dietitian at Massachusetts General Hospital, says, ""No."" While a few studies have been conducted on the possible health benefits of apple cider vinegar, the number of people in these studies is typically small, and the evidence is not yet convincing. ""We have to look at the science,"" says Schmitt. ""One or two small studies is not enough to prove a benefit.""</p><p></p><p><strong>Sorting Out Health Benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Weight loss.</strong> According to Schmitt, the idea that apple cider vinegar somehow ""speeds up fat loss is altogether a myth."" There is no evidence to suggest that apple cider vinegar can affect <a href=""/diet-nutrition/food-and-mood/tips/boost-mood-and-metabolism.aspx"">metabolism</a>, which is the way an individual breaks down food and burns calories.</li><li><strong>Feeling full.</strong> A 2006 study found that people who took doses of vinegar while eating bread reported feeling more full than people who ate bread alone. While this study has been cited by those who believe in the health benefits of apple cider vinegar, it is important to note that it only tested 12 individuals, and the authors concluded that much more research was needed before firm conclusions could be drawn. This study did not suggest that the way these people burned <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/calorie-counter/"">calories</a> was affected.</li><li><strong>Cholesterol.</strong> Schmitt mentions a successful study that was done on rats but has yet to be replicated in humans. The study found that rats on a <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/allarticles.aspx"">diet</a> with an acetic acid supplement had lower cholesterol levels than rats without the acetic acid supplement. Acetic acid is one of the ingredients in apple cider vinegar and many other kinds of vinegar. For those who believe in the health benefits of apple cider vinegar, this study is promising. But there are other things to consider before assuming that the findings will be true in humans — primarily that there are key differences between the metabolism of rats and humans. The study authors recommend that the next trial be on hamsters, which break down fat in a way that is more similar to humans.</li><li><strong>Diabetes.</strong> A few studies have found that apple cider vinegar helped in the management of <a href=""/diet-nutrition/101/benefits-of-healthy-eating/defeating-diabetes.aspx"">diabetes</a>; however, these studies are also limited by their small size. One study, which found that taking vinegar at bedtime reduces blood sugar levels the next morning in people with type 2 diabetes, examined only 11 people. Another study found that taking cider vinegar might have some effect on insulin sensitivity in some diabetes patients, but that research, too, was limited by the small number of people being studied.</li></ul><p>Although there is not currently good scientific evidence for a health benefit of apple cider vinegar, this may change in the future. Researchers are still involved in some exciting research about apple cider vinegar, and the future is likely to bring better information.</p><p></p></div>"|Sun Feb 17 00:15:10 +0000 2013|[]|oes drinking apple-cider vinegar really help you burn fat? |3.029341757475594e+17|http://bit.ly/TeQOD5

It’s an epidemic with very serious health risks, from heart disease to diabetes to cancer. It’s also taking an incredible financial toll: Studies have put the national healthcare cost of obesity at over $190 billion a year.</p><p>Behind these staggering figures are measurement tools that the medical community uses to determine who is at risk. One of the most common is body mass index (BMI). The problem is that BMI alone doesn’t tell the whole story.</p><p>BMI is a <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/bmi-calculator/"">mathematical equation</a> — weight (in pounds) divided by height (in inches) squared, multiplied by 703 — to calculate an individual’s body fat. An adult with a BMI of 30 or higher, for instance, is considered obese. But because BMI is based on <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/14/health/coke-obesity"">body weight</a> rather than body composition, it doesn’t take into account how much of that weight is from muscle, bone or water as opposed to fat.</p><p>“BMI is a useful number in general terms, but it doesn’t tell us where the fat is distributed or distinguish between fat and muscle,” said Subhashini Ayloo, MD, a bariatric surgeon at University of Illinois Hospital. That means an athlete who has more muscle mass and strong bones could have a high BMI that would categorize them as overweight or even obese. On the other hand, older people who have lost muscle may have a deceptively lower BMI.</p><p>While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers BMI “a reasonable indicator of body fat,” it doesn’t recommend it as a diagnostic tool.</p><p>“It’s not perfect but it’s definitely a useful tool,” said Ellen Demerath, an associate professor of epidemiology and community health at the University of Minnesota. “It should be the first step in measuring an individual’s health assessment, but other tests can also be useful.”</p><p></p><p>One simple alternative to BMI is measuring <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/weight-pictures/what-your-trouble-spots-say-about-your-health.aspx#/slide-1"">waist circumference</a> which, as Demerath points out, “can be an indicator of risk for many obesity-related diseases.”</p><p>Men with a waist circumference of more than 40 inches and women with a circumference of more than 35 inches are at a higher risk for developing obesity-related conditions like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/high-cholesterol/guide/"">high cholesterol</a>. In a new study out this month, so-called “apple-shaped” people who carry more fat around their bellies are also at a higher risk for kidney disease.</p><p>“If someone has a pear shape and their weight is in the hips and thighs, which is classically a female body shape, they don’t have the same risk factors,” said Eric Westman, MD, an internist at Duke Health Center in Durham, N.C.</p><p>Another method of measuring fat that’s becoming more popular and accessible is bioelectrical impedance — a device resembling an ordinary scale that measures body composition by sending a low electrical current from footpad electrodes. “It’s a more accurate way of measuring the actual percentage of fat,” Dr. Westman said. “You see them a lot now in health clubs, and they’re available for home use.”</p><p></p><div class=""video-container""><div class=""vjs-v1"" id=""video-player0""><video class=""vjs-edh video-js"" id=""video0""></video></div><meta itemprop=""embedURL""/><meta itemprop=""thumbnail""/><meta content=""false"" itemprop=""requiresSubscription""/><figcaption class=""eh-container""><div class=""eh-media-caption""></div></figcaption></div><p>BMI is still a valid and inexpensive screening tool. But it’s just one piece of the puzzle. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommends that any weight-related health assessments should be based on a combination of BMI, waist circumference and other individual risk factors such as high blood pressure, cholesterol or physical inactivity.</p><p>“The guidelines for <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/obesity/guide/"">determining obesity</a> are not hard and fast rules, they’re a consensus that most doctors agree on,” Dr. Ayloo said. “Right now one of the criteria used is BMI because it’s easily accessible, but it’s not perfect on its own.”</p></div>"|Sat Feb 16 22:45:21 +0000 2013|[]|y your BMI isn't all it's cracked up to be: |3.029115716324598e+17|http://trib.al/P7Wq6x

343||"<div class=""article-body""><div class=""pull-right clear-left media_article""></div><p>Picture this: You're in the mall, shopping with friends, chatting and having a great time when suddenly you start to feel a bit strange. You might become irritated or nervous, your skin may feel clammy or sweaty — and your vision may even seem blurred. If you have <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/guide/"">diabetes</a>, you'll recognize these as the warning signs of <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/hypoglycemia/guide/"">hypoglycemia</a>, or low blood sugar.</p><p>“Hypoglycemia occurs when <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/diabetes/monitoring-your-blood-sugar-levels.aspx"">blood sugar levels</a> in the body drop too low,” says Kelly O'Connor, RD, a dietitian and certified diabetes educator at LifeBridge Health's Northwest Hospital in Baltimore. “Glucose [<a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/diabetes/understanding/how-sugar-is-metabolized.aspx"">sugar</a>] is your brain’s main energy or fuel source. If the level of glucose in the body is too low, it can begin to affect your brain’s functioning. The resulting symptoms are more or less your body’s warning system that you need to take quick action in order to correct the problem.”</p><h2><strong>Recognizing the Signs of Hypoglycemia</strong></h2><p>O’Connor says there are a number of warning signs that indicate you might have low blood sugar. “The symptoms can range from very mild — shakiness, clamminess, feeling irritable or jittery, and having temporarily blurred vision — to much more severe, such as [experiencing] seizures and loss of consciousness or passing out, although these are less common,” she says. These symptoms can occur because of many other circumstances, so if you are diabetic and are having symptoms that could be due to low blood sugar, check your sugar levels to see what’s going on, she adds.</p><p>Certain things can also put you at higher risk of hypoglycemia, especially if you skip or put off a meal or snack, take too much insulin, don't eat enough carbohydrates, exercise more than you regularly do, or drink alcohol. In addition, people with <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/type-1-diabetes/guide/"">type 1 diabetes</a> experience hypoglycemia more often than those with type 2.</p><h2><strong>Glucose Tablets: A Quick Fix</strong></h2><p>“If your blood sugar has dropped too low, a quick-acting carbohydrate is needed to bring blood sugar levels back up,” says O’Connor. Glucose tablets are tailor-made to help. This inexpensive fix for low blood sugar is widely available at pharmacies and large chain stores like Walmart and Target.</p><p>Usually, three to four glucose tablets are needed to bring levels back up. “We recommend that patients who are prone to hypoglycemia carry glucose tablets with them and put them in several locations in their home and car,” says O’Connor. Glucose is also sold in gel form in small packets, and as a beverage.</p><h2><strong>Low Blood Sugar: Best Bites When You're on the Go</strong></h2><p>Despite your best planning, you might find yourself experiencing low blood sugar when you're out and about, with no glucose tablets in reach. Here are tips to keep in mind:</p><p><strong>Best bites at work </strong>Smart foods to keep in a drawer at work are 4-ounce cans or cartons of any type of 100 percent juice; hard candy like peppermints or Life Savers (you’ll need to munch on four to seven pieces, depending on their size); and small boxes of raisins — the ones that contain about 2 tablespoons, says <a href=""http://www.hopewarshaw.com"">Hope Warshaw, RD</a>, a certified diabetes educator and author of <em>Diabetes Meal Planning Made Easy</em>.</p><p>If you don’t have these items on hand, head to the nearest vending machine for any snack containing carbohydrates or sugary candy — but skip the chocolate. “We do not recommend using chocolate as a treatment for hypoglycemia, despite what you might have read,” says O’Connor. She explains that the fat in chocolate slows down how fast the sugar and carbohydrates in the candy can get into the bloodstream.</p><p>If you're choosing foods to help treat hypoglycemia, you should also pay attention to where they fall on the glycemic index, or GI. The higher a food ranks on the GI, the more quickly your body breaks it down into sugar. Life Savers have a GI of 70, while raisins have a GI around 60.</p><p><strong>Best bites at the mall </strong>If you’re going to be on a prolonged excursion at the mall, plan a stop at the food court for a meal to thwart low blood sugar, but be sensible in the decisions you make, says Cecilia R. Chapman, RD, a nutritionist and diabetes educator in Chandler, Arizona. “Sometimes hours can be spent walking from store to store, and losing track of time is common,” she says. Know where the food court is, because it’s your best bet to find a sugary soda or hard candy if you feel <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/symptoms/signs-of-low-blood-sugar/"">low blood sugar symptoms</a> starting.</p><p><strong>Best bites in the air </strong>When it comes to traveling, especially in the air, it’s essential to be prepared for the possibility of a blood sugar drop. Not having what you need can become a matter of life or death. “Never place your snacks or fast-acting glucose tablets in your suitcase — always carry diabetes supplies on board,” says Chapman.

It ""offers a unique opportunity for children to experience a break from the academic demands of school as well as a forum for creative expression, social engagement and physical exertion,"" Ramstetter said.</p><p></p><p>Co-researcher Dr. Robert Murray, a professor in the department of human nutrition at Ohio State University, added that ""recess is a crucial part of a child's development. That's mental as well as social development.""</p><p>In order to learn well, children need a period of concentrated academic activity followed by a break that allows them to process information, Murray said. That's also true for adults, he added.</p><p>""Studies have shown that children do a better job of processing information if they don't move from one challenging task to the next, but rather, have a break in between,"" he said.</p><p>According to Murray, in most schools, recess lasts 15 to 20 minutes either before or after lunch. There are no data on the optimal length of recess, he said.</p><p>""All we can say is there needs to be enough time for the child to decompress,"" Murray said.</p><p></p><p>The report appears in the January issue of <em>Pediatrics</em>.</p><p>According to the group's statement, recess offers children mental, physical, emotional and social benefits.</p><p>The statement goes on to say that regular physical education is also important and recess is not a substitute for it. The authors see the free, unstructured playtime that recess offers as essential to children's overall health.</p><p>Moreover, they say withholding recess should not be a form of punishment. Recess, they added, is an important part of child development and provides social interaction that children may not get during class time.</p><p>""Schools ought to examine other discipline methods, and look for ways to provide safe and properly supervised recess for all children,"" Ramstetter said. ""Whether it's spent indoors or outdoors, recess should provide free, unstructured play or activity.""</p><p>One expert agreed that recess is an important part of a child's school experience and should be valued.</p><p>""We have been discussing the issue of unstructured play in schools for a long time,"" said Dr. Gloria Riefkohl, a <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/pediatrician/guide/"">pediatrician</a> at Miami Children's Hospital.</p><p>Since No Child Left Behind was started, a lot of schools have cut or eliminated recess to add classroom time, she said.</p><p>""It is important that kids have recess,"" Riefkohl said. ""Recess allows kids to get involved with other children that are not in their classroom and allows them to decompress.""</p><p>Time spent interacting in unstructured play helps children develop important social skills, Riefkohl said.

He was puzzled because this patient had recently passed an exercise stress test…administered by me! I was very upset by this news and rechecked the test results to see if I had made any mistakes.</p><p>After careful review, I couldn't find any errors in my analysis. The <a href=""/heart-health/pharmacologic-stress-test.aspx"">stress test</a> was normal, and the patient had shown excellent exercise capacity. I remember feeling very frustrated. We were working with the best technology available, yet it wasn't good enough to detect a heart attack that was only weeks away.</p><p>Today, we do have other noninvasive tests that are much better at predicting the likelihood of a future heart attack. A normal stress test does not mean there aren't any potentially lethal soft plaques growing inside the lining of your coronary <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/coronary-artery-disease/guide/"">arteries</a> that could rupture and cause a heart attack at any time. All it means is that the blood flow to your heart was fine on the day you took the test. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean that the blood flow will still be fine tomorrow.</p><p>Recently, I was at a dinner party when another guest, upon hearing that I was a cardiologist, turned to me and said, ""My friend just passed his annual physical with f lying colors. Two days later, he had a heart attack. How could this happen?"" I'm sorry to say that I hear stories like this almost as often today as I did 25 years ago. The fact is, back then, we had an excuse. We didn't know any better. Today, we do. We know that someone can look great on paper — pass a standard exercise stress test with f lying colors, have good cholesterol scores, and never have had a sick day in his or her life — but still have arteries that are a diseased and potentially lethal mess. Today we have access to cutting-edge diagnostic tests that can identify these high-risk people early enough to prevent them from having heart attacks in the first place.</p><p>The problem is that many patients destined for heart problems don't get the benefit of our most accurate tests (including presidents of the United States). Many seemingly perfectly healthy people are ""suddenly"" getting heart attacks because their arteries are <em>not</em> perfectly healthy and they don't know it. With the proper noninvasive tests, these diseased arteries would have been identified, and the heart attacks wouldn't have happened.</p><p></p><p>Learn more in the Everyday Health <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health/"">Heart Health Center</a><a>. </a></p><p></p></div>"|Sat Feb 16 19:45:23 +0000 2013|[]|Why perfectly healthy people can have heart attacks: |3.028662831526912e+17|http://bit.ly/yNwdcv

Although the link between omega-3s and <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health/"">heart health</a> has long been known, several new studies present even more evidence that fish high in fatty acids is essential for total-body wellness.</p><p>The good news is if you’re not a fish fan, most new research indicates that eating fish only once or twice a week can be enough to reap the benefits. Meanwhile, the National Institute of Health recommends that people consume at least 2 percent of their total daily calories as omega-3 fatty acids, which equals about 4 grams per day. One four-ounce piece of salmon (one of the highest natural sources of omega-3s) contains about 1.5 grams of the fatty acid. Other fish, such as tuna, sardines, and halibut, also contains high levels. If you don’t eat animal products or have trouble fitting fish into your <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/allarticles.aspx"">diet</a>, you can get your daily recommended amount of fatty acids through omega-3 DHA/fish oil supplements. Although new data from <em>Consumer Reports</em> suggests that more Americans are buying omega-3 supplements than ever before, the doctor-recommended way to consume the health benefits of fish is still by eating the real thing.</p><p>If the heart-health-boosting, waist-slimming properties weren’t reasons enough to eat more fish, here are seven more ways adding a dose of fish to your diet can improve your health.</p><ol><li><strong>Prevent Heart Disease:</strong> A Danish study of 49,000 women that was published Monday in <em>Hypertension: Journal of the American Heart Association</em> found that women who ate little to no fish had 50 percent more heart problems than those who ate fish at least once per week. Additionally, researchers found that women who rarely ate fish had a three-fold higher disease risk than those who ate it often. Other research has found that eating fish high in omega-3s can slash blood fat levels, which can contribute to a lower heart-disease risk.</li><li><strong>Reduce Alzheimer’s Risk:</strong> Eating fish as little as once a week can help preserve gray-matter neurons — the part of the brain linked to memory and cognition — <a href=""https://consumer.healthday.com/senior-citizen-information-31/misc-aging-news-10/non-fried-fish-might-help-ward-off-alzheimer-s-study-659235.html"" rel=""nofollow"">according to a new study</a> presented last month at the Radiological Society of North America’s annual meeting. Researchers found that people who eat baked or broiled — but not fried — fish had larger brains and larger cells in the areas of the brain responsible for memory and learning. Scientists believe the larger brain volume can help lower the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease.</li><li><strong>Improve Skin and Hair:</strong> One of the biggest drawbacks to a low-fat diet is you often deprive your skin and hair of the healthy fat it needs, leaving it dull and dry. The omega-3s in fish are exactly the type of healthy fat to eat to keep your skin looking nourished and your hair shiny. Research has also linked fish and <a href=""/weight/omega-3-fatty-acids-weight-loss-aids.aspx"">omega-3 consumption</a> to treatment of skin conditions such as <a href=""/psoriasis/guide/"">psoriasis</a>.</li><li><strong>Ease Depression:</strong> Several studies have found that when taken along with prescription antidepressant medications, the omega-3s in fish are more effective at treating <a href=""/depression/guide/"">depression</a> that just prescription medication alone. One study of 52 pregnant women found that taking a 300 mg capsule of omega-3s during pregnancy significantly reduced the women’s risk of postpartum depression.</li><li><strong>Boost Brain Development:</strong> The EFA omega-3 found in salmon and other nutrient-rich fish are essential nutrients for children because they contribute to brain development. Some studies have even found that omega-3 consumption can help soothe symptoms of <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/adhd/guide/"">ADHD</a>. Experts recommend, however, that parents ask their pediatrician before introducing supplements to a child’s diet.</li><li><strong>Dose of Vitamin D:</strong> Saltwater fish is a sun-less source of vitamin D, which scientists say can help ward off disease, promote bone health, and with the help of the omega-3s in fish, ward off cognitive decline. Just one three-ounce serving of salmon contains 75 percent of your daily recommended amount of the vitamin.</li><li><strong>Stronger Sperm:</strong> A recent study of 188 men found that those who ate more fresh fish — along with other healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains — had stronger swimmers than those who ate unhealthy diets.

One serving of popcorn would provide 13 percent of the average daily intake of polyphenols per person in the United States, the Pennsylvania researchers said in a society news release.</p><p>The levels of polyphenols in popcorn reported in this study were higher than previously believed. The levels were similar to those found in nuts and 15 times the levels found in whole-grain tortilla chips, the researchers said.</p><p>The investigators also found that the hulls of popcorn — the bits that tend to get caught in the teeth — have the highest concentrations of polyphenols and fiber.</p><p></p><p>""Those hulls deserve more respect,"" study author Joe Vinson, of the University of Scranton, said in the news release.</p><p>However, Vinson warned, adding butter, salt and other calorie-laden flavorings can turn this snack into a <a href=""/diet-and-nutrition-pictures/best-and-worst-movie-food-picks.aspx#/slide-2"">bucketful of trouble</a>.</p><p>""Air-popped popcorn has the lowest number of calories, of course,"" Vinson said.

That's up from just 7 percent in 2008.</p><p>""This survey shows a very large increase in the numbers of people using retail clinics over the last few years since earlier surveys, which used slightly different questions,"" said Harris Poll chairman Humphrey Taylor.</p><p>Younger adults were more likely to have used such a facility compared with older adults. Among the respondents, 40 percent of adults aged 25 to 29 had used a retail or work-based clinic, versus only 15 percent of adults aged 65 and older.</p><p>This is not surprising, given that older adults tend to have more chronic health problems and such ""drop-in"" clinics are geared more for acute services, said Kathleen Jaeger, a registered pharmacist and senior vice president of pharmacy care and patient advocacy at the National Association of Chain Drug Stores.</p><p></p><p>The survey found that people were most likely to visit either a retail or work-based clinic for run-of-the-mill complaints such as colds or <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/flu/guide/symptoms/"">flu-like symptoms</a>, minor cuts and wounds, and for routine needs such as flu shots, prescriptions and to check blood pressure or cholesterol.</p><p>Fewer respondents indicated willingness to use these clinics for potentially more serious concerns.</p><p>Survey respondents who had used such a clinic were generally happy with the care they received, although fewer than half said they were ""extremely"" or ""very"" satisfied.""</p><p>Notable minorities — 18 percent of those who had used retail clinics and 27 percent of those who had used work-based clinics — said they were only ""somewhat"" or ""not at all"" satisfied.</p><p>About three-quarters of those who had used a clinic were <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/health-insurance/save-big.aspx"">covered by their health insurance</a> when they used the service.</p><p></p><p>The online survey of more than 3,000 U.S. adults was conducted in early December.</p><p>Convenience was key to consumers opting for retail clinic care. The most frequent reasons cited for using either a retail or work-based clinic was that the clinics didn't require an appointment, had a convenient location, involved short waiting times, had accessible hours, and were affordable and/or accepting of the person's particular insurance.</p><p>""It's really that combination of quality, accessibility and affordability that's driven the growth of these clinics and the utilization of the clinics,"" said Web Golinkin, board president of the Convenient Care Association and CEO of RediClinic, which provides health care clinics at H-E-B grocery stores.</p><p>Also contributing to the growth is a continuing shortage of primary care physicians, added Jaeger.</p><p>Patricia McGaffigan, R.N., interim president of the National Patient Safety Foundation, said: ""The proliferation of these clinics is helping to absorb a lot of health care issues. Many [health-related] episodes can, in fact, be treated and treated very well by folks who are trained and who are following evidence-based guidelines.""</p><p>There is accreditation for the clinics, she added, although a person's primary care doctor should always be kept apprised of any visits to retail or workplace clinics.</p><p>The clinics also have the capability of taking care of marginal health issues that many people have inappropriately taken to emergency departments.</p><p>""With just over a quarter of all adults using either retail clinics or work-based clinics, they are now treating many millions of patients, many of whom might otherwise go to doctors' offices, and some of whom might go to hospital emergency rooms,"" said Taylor.

This lack of awareness, termed <em>anosognosia</em>, can be a major barrier that keeps some people with bipolar disorder from getting the treatment they need. In their minds, they're not sick, so why take medication?</p><p><strong>Anosognosia in Bipolar Disorder</strong></p><p>It is estimated that around 40 percent of people who have bipolar disorder also have anosognosia. In fact, anosognosia is the primary reason why those with this disease do not take their <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/treatment/"">bipolar medications</a>. Anosognosia is even more common in people who have delusions or hallucinations associated with their bipolar disorder. When people with anosognosia have a hallucination or delusion, they believe that what they are seeing or thinking is real, and are not convinced that an illness is causing these symptoms.</p><p>Many people with bipolar disorder have anosognosia that comes and goes, and anosognosia is often not a problem during periods of bipolar remission. But when a bipolar episode hits, they cannot grasp that they have an illness.</p><p>Anosognosia is different from denial, which is a common psychological tool people use to suppress the painful emotions associated with an illness or another stressful event. Instead, anosognosia is thought to be caused by damage to the brain, particularly the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain's right hemisphere. The right hemisphere of the brain controls thinking skills, and damage can result in a number of problems, including difficulty with reasoning and problem solving.</p><p></p><p>Anosognosia is not unique to bipolar disorder. It is also seen in schizophrenia, stroke, brain tumor, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease.</p><p></p><p><strong>Bipolar Disorder and Anosognosia: Coping Tips for Caregivers</strong></p><p>As the <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/bipolar-disorder/care-for-the-caregiver.aspx"">caregiver for someone with bipolar disorder</a>, you play a major role in your loved one's life.</p><p>The patient ""really need[s] to have a reliable care partner,"" says Gary Sachs, MD, founder and director of the Bipolar Clinic and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, and associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in Boston.</p><p>Dr. Sachs says it is critical for someone with bipolar disorder to have somebody who can help the patient follow the treatment plan, especially when he is ill and cannot do it on his own.</p><p>Here are some ways to encourage your loved one to <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/treatment/"">stick with prescribed bipolar treatment</a>:</p><ul><li>When his mood is stable, tell him that studies show that people with bipolar disorder can improve with medication. Without medication, the odds of him getting sicker increase, which in turn increases the risk of hospitalization, incarceration, suicide, violent behavior, and becoming a victim of violence.</li><li>Developing a partnership with the patient is vital. And that means listening to your loved one's fears, whether those fears revolve around the diagnosis or being hospitalized against his will.</li><li>Empathize; don't dismiss his opinions or emotions. Get the patient to talk about what is going on, person to person.</li><li>Pay more attention to what she thinks is important, not what you think. As the caregiver, you might think that the hallucinations are a huge deal, but your loved one might think lack of sleep is the biggest problem. Discuss her problem; it will help develop trust.</li><li>Together, plan how to deal with an acute bipolar episode, especially when anosognosia is an issue.</li><li>Don't get discouraged if you cannot convince her that she has an illness. Focus on helping her stick to her prescribed treatment. The patient might take the medications if you help her remember some of the negative experiences that occurred when she skipped medications before.</li></ul></div>"|Sat Feb 16 15:15:32 +0000 2013|['#bipolar']|Why many people don't realize they have bipolar disorder: |3.027983710920581e+17|http://bit.ly/GI5LoL

The story the singer and actress, 30, recounts in her new memoir <em>I Got This: How I Changed My Ways and Lost What Weighed Me Down</em> is heart-wrenching to any woman who has ever worried about being too curvy.</p><p>“Surely, she wasn’t addressing me that way,” Hudson writes. “I had the height of a supermodel, breasts that were naturally big <em>and</em> real, and a God-given shape. Why would I feel insecure about that?”</p><p>But as it turned out, the question <em>was</em> directed at her. And Hudson, a Grammy award-winning singer and Oscar-winning actress who got her start on season three of <em>American Idol</em>, was in for a surprise. Throughout her blossoming career, she was constantly hounded about her weight, a struggle she candidly details on every page of <em>I Got This</em>. A chronic yo-yo dieter, Hudson reveals that she actually gained twenty pounds for her Oscar-winning role in the 2006 movie <em>Dreamgirls</em>. When it came time to lose it and get back to what she calls her “comfortable size 10,” she did what she always did whenever she wanted to lose a few — she followed a strict plan of nothing but brown rice, broccoli, and grilled chicken and two running workouts a day. But time after time, Hudson’s restrictive crash diet didn’t transfer into long-term weight loss — or health.</p><p>“That way of eating is effective for quick weight loss,” Hudson writes. “It’s a total setup for failure because eating that way forever just isn’t realistic.”</p><p>After the birth of her son in 2009, Hudson says she tipped the scales at 237 pounds and knew it was time to make a change: “It was time to think about how I was going to lose the excess baby weight and then put that plan into action.”</p><p></p><p>And of course, we all know how that story ends: A few months later, she signed as a spokesperson for <a href=""/diet-nutrition/weight-watchers.aspx"">Weight Watchers</a> and has since shed 80 pounds on the plan, inspiring hundreds or even thousands of men and women to attempt the same. Throughout her book, her signature warm tone shines through, making readers feel like they are really getting a behind-the-scenes look at her life.</p><p></p><p>This “realness” is what has won her many fans over the years, including Tina Jensen and Alex Gonzalez, who joined Weight Watchers about the same time Hudson did.</p><p>“It just feels like Jennifer Hudson has been on this journey with us,” Gonzalez, 27, who has lost 43 pounds with Weight Watchers, says while waiting in line at a New York Barnes &amp; Noble for a signing of Hudson’s new tome. Jensen, who has lost 42 pounds on the program, agrees. “She’s a perfect inspiration because you got to see such a clear before and after with her,” she says. “She’s so down to earth, and it feels like I can really trust that she’s doing the program with us.”</p><p>Here, we share some of that Hudson's very relatable advice:</p><p><strong>1. Find a diet buddy.</strong> Hudson’s Weight Watchers coach, Liz Josefsberg, has been essential to her success. “Liz lost 50 pounds and had kept it off, which gave me a tremendous amount of confidence in her,” Hudson writes. “She knew what it was like to lose that much weight, so I could really open up to her along the way.” Whether your weight loss buddy is a coach like Liz or a friend who wants to slim down, sharing your experience with someone who can relate is key. Plus, you’ll be more likely to stay on track if a friend is holding you accountable.</p><p><strong>2. Create a flexible plan.</strong> “I had been so brainwashed into believing that dieting meant excruciating limitations that I had rejected the principles of the Weight Watchers program,” Hudson writes. Whether it’s Weight Watchers or another system, it’s important to create a plan that will work for your lifestyle — and allow a little indulgence from time to time.</p><p><strong>3. Watch your portions.</strong> Hudson says before she started Weight Watchers, she was a pretty healthy eater for the most part. “What I didn’t realize was the amount I was eating was actually detrimental,” she says. Now, she knows <a href=""/diet-pictures/secrets-to-portion-control.aspx"">what a portion really looks like</a>, and that helps keep her on track.</p><p><strong>4. Get your family on board.</strong> Hudson’s family quite literally joined her weight loss efforts — inspired by her success, her sister, aunt, and cousin have all shed weight, too. Hudson’s husband has also been a huge support. “It’s such a blessing to have a partner who shares your same beliefs in getting healthy, as opposed to sabotaging your efforts,” Hudson reveals about her husband, pro wrestler David Otunga.</p><p><strong>For more fitness, diet, and weight loss news, follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/weightloss"" rel=""nofollow"">@weightloss</a> on Twitter from the editors of <a href=""https://twitter.com/everydayhealth"" rel=""nofollow"">@EverydayHealth.</a></strong></p></div>"|Sat Feb 16 14:45:34 +0000 2013|[]|Need some weight loss-spiration?

This might be explained by the sample, which consisted of volunteers who may have been particularly motivated to participate in such a study — ""although bias is typically toward more, not fewer, with impairment,"" the researchers wrote.</p><p>Conversely, the number specifically with mild cognitive impairment was higher than would be expected, and those participants will be followed to determine their clinical course over time.</p><p>The prevalence of depression, at 24 percent, also was somewhat higher than the 15 percent usually reported for men of that age, which emphasizes the importance of screening older athletes for depression and other cognitive-behavioral problems, Hart and colleagues noted.</p><p>In addition, prospective studies will be needed to more fully elucidate the development and clinical features of depression among retired athletes, and particularly in relation to the late, severe manifestations associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy.</p><p>In an editorial accompanying the study, Ramon Diaz-Arrastia, MD, PhD, and Daniel Perl, MD, of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., also called for more epidemiologic data on the incidence on chronic traumatic encephalopathy and risk factors.</p><p>""Because the symptoms of CTE, such as irritability, depression, and cognitive problems, are protean and nonspecific, biomarkers and neuroimaging to complement the clinical examination will likely be essential and will improve the accuracy of the diagnosis during the lifetime of the individual and will be used to follow the natural history of the illness,"" Diaz-Arrastia and Perl stated.</p><p>Source: <a href=""http://www.medpagetoday.com/Neurology/HeadTrauma/36736"">Retired NFL Players at Risk of Brain Deficits</a></p></div>"|Sat Feb 16 14:15:30 +0000 2013|['#NFL']|Retired NFL players risk brain deficits |3.0278326440442675e+17|http://bit.ly/VQcplC

A person experiencing chronic pain is more likely than a well person to be depressed. And the connection runs in the other direction, too — depressed people are more likely to complain of chronic aches and pains.</p><p>Studies have found that people dealing with chronic pain run three times the risk of developing a mood disorder such as depression or anxiety. About a third of people with persistent pain experience clinical depression.</p><p>What’s more, people with depression have three times the risk of chronic pain. ""When people have chronic depression over a long period of time, about half of them will develop chronic pain problems without any clear injury to explain that pain,"" says Michael Moskowitz, MD, assistant clinical professor for the department of anesthesiology and pain medicine at the University of California, Davis and a board member of the American Pain Foundation.</p><p><strong>Pain and Depression Connections</strong></p><p>Doctors believe the structure and function of the human brain form the basis of the link between chronic pain and depression:</p><p></p><p><strong>Brain structure. </strong>There is a lot of overlap among the parts of the brain that deal with pain signals and the locations where mood disorders develop. ""If you look at the nine places in the brain where pain occurs, six of them are where we experience mood disorders like depression and <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/anxiety/guide/"">anxiety</a>,"" Dr. Moskowitz says.</p><p></p><p><strong>Brain function. </strong>Some of the neurotransmitters that the brain uses to receive and process pain signals also are used to regulate mood. These include <a href=""/serotonin/guide/"">serotonin</a> and norepinephrine. It's no coincidence that most drugs used to treat mood disorders have been found to be effective when used for pain relief.</p><p>Chronic pain and chronic depression both can alter your brain structure and chemistry, with each condition influencing the other. As Moskowitz explains, ""Your brain changes every day of your life, with connections made and broken all the time. The brain remodels all the time due to the stimulus it gets.""</p><p>""What actually happens in the brain is a kind of expansionism,"" Moskowitz continues. ""The nerve cells dedicated to pain branch into a new area when there's chronic pain. With mood and pain sharing so many areas, sometimes they're kind of encroaching into each other's areas.""</p><p><strong>How to Manage Pain and Depression </strong></p><p>How do you manage pain in the face of chronic depression, and how do you treat depression in someone who is experiencing chronic pain?

If 2014 marks the start of another year of attempted weight loss for you, set yourself up for success, and learn how to set the right kind of weight-loss goals. After all, one reason why so many dieters abandon their resolutions so quickly is because they often have unreasonable expectations for weight loss.</p><p>It’s important to remember that <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/weight/weight-articles.aspx"">losing weight</a> isn’t complicated, but shedding pounds and keeping them off takes time and serious effort. Quick-fix weight-loss programs and fad diets will try to sell you on the idea that they hold the secret to weight-loss success. In reality, there is no secret. Weight loss is just a matter of burning more calories than you take in — and it takes time and commitment, two things often in short supply.</p><p>""Fad diets and crash diets don't work because they are not designed to be maintained over the long haul,"" Kristin Kirkpatrick, RD, a nutrition specialist at the Cleveland Clinic, says. ""That means any weight you lose on a fad diet tends to come back over time.""</p><h2>Setting Reasonable Goals for Losing Weight</h2><p>Have you ever had the experience of meeting a friend and being amazed at how much weight he or she had lost, only to see the same friend a few months later and be amazed that all those pounds came right back?</p><p>""That's a common experience because when you starve yourself, your metabolism slows down to conserve fuel,"" Kirkpatrick explains. ""Your body is trying to protect you from starvation. Once you start eating normally again, you have a metabolic rebound, and your body tries to hold on to every calorie you eat.""</p><p></p><p>To prevent metabolic rebound, set a realistic goal of losing weight at a rate of about one pound a week. Remember that one pound of fat is equal to about 3,500 <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/calorie-counter/"">calories</a>, and you need to cut that amount from your diet — or burn it off through exercise — to lose one pound. ""That means if you cut back on 500 calories each day, you can lose that 1 pound a week without shocking your metabolism,"" Kirkpatrick says.</p><p></p><p>Restricting your calories further without medical supervision can be extremely dangerous, and it often doesn’t result in faster weight loss because your body will begin to store fat.</p><h2>Losing Pounds Step by Step</h2><p>Based on the one-pound-per-week benchmark, create a plan around your existing lifestyle. Don’t try to overhaul your entire routine from day one, and don’t set goals you’re bound to break, such as skipping all of your favorite foods, or getting up early to go the gym every day when you know you’re not a morning person.</p><p>Now that you know some don’ts, here are a few do’s for lasting weight-loss success:</p><ul><li><strong>Pick a weight-loss plan you can stick with for a lifetime.</strong> Most good plans are balanced and sensible and include getting most of your calories from lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. If your plan includes expensive ready-made meals or the elimination of whole food groups, you won't be able to stick with it.</li><li><strong>Keep a food diary.</strong> ""Once you have a good plan and a realistic goal, a food diary is a good way to keep yourself honest,"" Kirkpatrick says. ""Studies show that a food diary really helps, even if nobody but you sees it. Just the process of writing things down and being aware of what you eat makes a big difference.""</li><li><strong>Find a weight-loss buddy.</strong> ""Research also shows that sharing a weight-loss goal with a supportive friend or group of friends makes a big difference,"" she says.</li><li><strong>Always eat breakfast.</strong> ""The idea of starting your day and going as long as you can without eating never works,"" Kirkpatrick warns. ""Studies show this usually leads to binge eating."" Plus, eating breakfast jumpstarts your metabolism, and gives you energy for the day ahead.</li><li><strong>Eat mindfully.</strong> Don't eat to relieve stress, do pay attention to your food. Don't wait until you are starving, do eat slowly, and do stop eating before you feel full.</li><li><strong>Indulge occasionally.</strong> If your diet is so restrictive that you can't enjoy eating, your weight-loss goals will be too hard to keep. Avoid the ""all or nothing"" attitude. Weight loss is a process. Don't be discouraged if you give in to temptation once in a while.</li></ul><p>""My final tip is to treat the whole self,"" Kirkpatrick says. ""A good weight-loss goal should also include <a href=""/weight/the-hunger-and-stress-connection.aspx"">stress reduction</a> and exercise. High stress and inactivity are closely linked to obesity. Walking, meditating, and a balanced diet you can stick with for life should be your goal.""</p><p><strong>For more fitness, diet, and nutrition trends and tips, follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/weightloss"" rel=""nofollow"">@weightloss</a> on Twitter from the editors of <a href=""https://twitter.com/everydayhealth"" rel=""nofollow"">@EverydayHealth</a>.</strong></p></div>"|Sat Feb 16 11:45:12 +0000 2013|[]|Are your weight loss goals reasonable? |3.0274543943694336e+17|http://trib.al/VyZuh4

Throughout her book, <em>Living Low-Carb: The Complete Guide to Long-Term Low-Carb Dieting</em>, Fran McCullough addresses criticisms of a <a href=""/weight/cracking-low-carb-code.aspx"">low-carb diet</a> and offers ""real-life"" stories of people who have successfully made a low-carb diet part of their lives.</p><p><strong>How Does the Low-Carb Diet Work?</strong></p><p>The Living Low-Carb plan outlines an eating system designed to help people lose weight by reducing the amount of carbohydrates they consume.</p><p>The calories in the foods you eat come from a combination of protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are found in starchy and sugary (both natural and refined sugar) foods, such as bread, pasta, sweets, fruits, and vegetables. Low-carb diets, which usually require people to choose high-protein foods, such as milk, eggs, and cheese, over high-carbohydrate foods, including fruits and grains, have become more popular in recent years and have been shown to help people lose weight.</p><p>In addition to teaching you how to eat, snack, attend parties, and dine out while on a low-carb diet, McCullough provides readers with 175 simple low-carb recipes. (She is also the author of <em>The Low-Carb Cookbook</em>.)</p><p>A typical day on the diet might include:</p><ul><li>Fruit and cottage cheese for breakfast</li><li>A green salad with chicken for lunch</li><li>Fruits, vegetables, hard-cooked eggs, seeds, or other low-carb snacks throughout the day</li><li>A burger without a bun for dinner</li><li>A low-carb after-dinner treat, like raspberries with chocolate</li></ul><p></p><p></p><div class=""video-container""><div class=""vjs-v1"" id=""video-player0""><video class=""vjs-edh video-js"" id=""video0""></video></div><meta itemprop=""embedURL""/><meta itemprop=""thumbnail""/><meta content=""false"" itemprop=""requiresSubscription""/><figcaption class=""eh-container""><div class=""eh-media-caption""></div></figcaption></div><p><strong>Living Low-Carb: Pros of the Diet</strong></p><p>Some of the positive aspects of the diet are:</p><ul><li><strong>Low-carb diets can work.</strong> Studies have shown that a low-carb diet can be more effective in helping you lose weight, especially when you first start dieting. And low-carb dieters' cholesterol levels tend to improve while on the <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/allarticles.aspx"">diet</a>.</li><li><strong>Most Americans need to cut back on processed grains.</strong> ""The problem really with grain foods is just that people are eating too many processed grains,"" says Andrea Giancoli, MPH, RD, a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. Processed grains include foods like sweet baked goods, white bread, white pasta, and white rice. Katherine Tallmadge, MA, RD, national spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association and author of <em>Diet Simple: 192 Mental Tricks, Substitutions, Habits and Inspirations</em>, agrees that people who eat too many carbohydrates are likely to gain weight. ""Excess carbohydrates — excess anything — is going to mean excess calories,"" she says. And that adds up to excess pounds.</li></ul><p><strong>Living Low-Carb: Cons of the Diet</strong></p><p>Living Low-Carb, like many popular diets, has certain potential drawbacks:</p><ul><li><strong>Advocating going into ketosis.</strong> Ketosis is a condition in which there is a build-up of ketones, byproducts of fat metabolism, in your blood. McCullough says that for people who need to lose weight, it is ideal to be in ketosis. But Giancoli disagrees: ""Ketosis is not ideal — it is a survival mechanism that the body goes into when deprived of carbohydrates."" Giancoli says that when you are in ketosis, your metabolism slows, you lose muscle tissue, your body loses minerals in the blood, and your brain doesn't work as well as it should.</li><li><strong>Uncomfortable side effects.</strong> Eating too few carbohydrates has the potential to leave you feeling miserable, since low-carb eating can cause you to become constipated, nauseous, weak, and fatigued. Other side effects may include diarrhea, bad breath, headaches, or sleeping problems.</li><li><strong>Cutting out healthful foods.</strong> In addition to refined carbohydrates, the Living Low-Carb diet limits some healthful foods, including milk and high-carb fruits and vegetables like bananas and potatoes. Tallmadge recommends steering clear of diets that make people afraid of eating healthful foods for fear of gaining weight. ""You should be able to eat all of the <a href=""/diet-nutrition/101/nutrition-basics/fruits-and-vegetables.aspx"">fruits and vegetables</a> you want and still be able to lose weight,"" Tallmadge says.</li><li><strong>Risk of nutrient deficiency.</strong> When you limit the amount of fruits and whole grains you are eating, you may not be getting all of the vitamins, minerals, and fiber you need. Ask your doctor to recommend a <a href=""/diet-nutrition/vitamins-and-meds/vitamins/daily-multivitamin.aspx"">multivitamin</a> and a fiber supplement while you are on a low-carb diet.</li></ul><p>Living Low-Carb might be worth trying if you want to lose weight and cut down on carbs. Giancoli says that a low-carb diet can be healthful and balanced ""as long as people are choosing lean protein, incorporating some whole grains, and are consuming some fruits and vegetables.""</p></div>"|Sat Feb 16 10:15:15 +0000 2013|[]|ow to adopt a low-carb lifestyle for years to come: |3.027228062050099e+17|http://bit.ly/H6vvyd

Or if your husband is being honest when he says he has to work late for the fifth night in a row? The answer, experts say, is written all over their faces — you just have to know what to look for.</p><p>According to a recent study published in the journal <em>Evolution and Human Behavior</em>, you can tell someone is lying by looking at the movement of four specific facial muscles: the corrugator supercilii, which helps wrinkle the brow; the depressor anguli oris, which is associated with frowning; the zygomatic major, which is used to mask <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/dental-health-pictures/healthy-reasons-to-get-you-smile-on.aspx"">a smile</a>; and the frontalis, which runs across your forehead. The first two indicate genuine emotion; the latter two suggest deception.</p><p>“Facial cues are an important, but often ignored, aspect of credibility assessments where an <a href=""/emotional-health/index.aspx"">emotional issue</a> is in question,” study author Leanne ten Brinke, PhD, told MSNBC, adding that the stronger the underlying emotion is, the more pronounced the cues will be.</p><p>For the study, ten Brinke and her team at the Centre for the Advancement of Psychological Science and Law at the University of British Columbia-Okanagen analyzed video of 52 people making televised pleas for the safe return of a missing loved one. Half of the people they watched were eventually convicted of murdering the “lost” relative in question. By comparing their facial actions with those of the individuals in <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/emotional-health-pictures/navigating-stressful-life-events.aspx"">true distress</a>, the researchers were able to identify so-called emotional “leaks.”</p><p>Specifically, real pleaders showed more contractions of the muscles around the eyes and mouth, while liars showed more contractions of the muscles around the cheeks and forehead. Full contraction of the frontalis, in particular, suggested a failed attempt to appear sad.</p><p></p><p>“What was surprising was just how strong these facial failures were able to predict which pleaders were the deceptive murderers compared to the genuinely distressed relatives,” ten Brinke told MSNBC of her research. She cautions, however, that a wrinkled forehead isn’t necessarily a smoking gun.</p><p></p><p>“Facial analysis does not provide us with a Pinocchio’s nose,” she admitted. “Not everyone will leak their true emotions, and some people are better than others at adopting a false face — like <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/emotional-health/1130/scans-reveal-differences-in-psychopathic-brains.aspx"">psychopaths</a>.”</p><p>And that’s a different problem altogether.</p></div>"|Sat Feb 16 09:45:18 +0000 2013|[]|It's all in the muscles of the face!

368||"<div class=""article-body""><div class=""pull-right clear-left media_article""></div><p>Research has established the benefits of regular aerobic exercise: Running, swimming, and biking all can reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer, and — yes — diabetes, according to the National Institutes of Health. But now scientists believe that people with diabetes can benefit from a regular weight, or strength, training routine as well. In fact, the American Diabetes Association recommends that all people, even those without chronic illness, strength train at least twice a week. Not only can lifting weights help improve <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/"">type 2 diabetes</a> symptoms, but when part of a workout plan that includes aerobics, it can put you on the path to long-term good health.</p><h2>Reaping the Benefits of Weight Training</h2><p>Diabetes is marked by the body's inability to process glucose and use insulin efficiently, but strength training can help with those issues. Here's how:</p><ul><li>You can experience an increase in lean muscle mass, which boosts your base metabolic rate and causes you to burn <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/guide/diet/"">calories</a> at a faster rate. ""Burning these calories helps keep your blood glucose levels in check,"" notes Sherin Joseph, MPH, health education manager at Montefiore Health System's Williamsbridge Family Practice Center in the Bronx, New York.</li><li>The ability of your muscles to store glucose increases with your strength, making your body better able to regulate its blood sugar levels.</li><li>Your body's fat-to-muscle ratio decreases, reducing the amount of insulin you need in your body to help store energy in fat cells.</li></ul><p>Even better results have been observed when people with type 2 diabetes combine a weight-training routine with regular aerobic exercise, adds Joseph. The two forms of <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/hs/type-2-diabetes/managing-diabetes-start-guide-for-exercise/"">exercise</a> work together to create better health benefits than either does on its own.</p><h2>Protecting Against Complications</h2><p>Strength training also can help guard against some <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/hs/managing-type-2-diabetes/surprising-complications-pictures/"">complications of diabetes</a> by:</p><ul><li>Reducing your risk of heart disease</li><li>Helping control blood pressure</li><li>Increasing your levels of good cholesterol while reducing bad cholesterol levels</li><li>Improving bone density</li><li>Preventing atrophy and age-related loss of muscle mass</li></ul><h2>Starting a Weight-Training Routine</h2><p>A weight-training routine involves performing movements that work specific muscle groups in the body. Each workout is broken down into exercises, reps, and sets in the following ways:</p><ul><li>The exercise is the specific movement that works a muscle group. For example, a bicep curl or a chest press.</li><li>A rep, or repetition, is one completed motion. For example, one rep of a bicep curl involves lowering the dumbbell and raising it to the starting position.</li><li>A set is the number of reps performed together, and sets are separated by a short rest period.</li></ul><p></p><p>The American Diabetes Association suggests the following guidelines for a weight-training routine:</p><ul><li>Strength training should be practiced two or three days every week, with at least one day off between sessions, to allow muscles to rest and rebuild.</li><li>Strength training can include hand weights, elastic bands, or weight machines, reminds Joseph.</li><li>Perform at least 8 to 10 weight exercises per session, to work all the major muscle groups of the upper and lower body.</li><li>Exercises can be of low or moderate intensity. Low intensity involves two or three sets of 15 reps with lighter weights, and moderate intensity involves two or three sets of 8 to 12 reps with heavier weights. There should be two to three minutes of rest between sets.</li><li>The workout should last 20 to 60 minutes per weight-training session.</li></ul><h2>Practicing Common Sense</h2><p></p><p>To help ensure good results and prevent injuries, follow these common sense rules:</p><p><strong>Get your doctor's clearance.</strong> As with any exercise program, you should check with your doctor before starting a weight-training regimen.</p><p><strong>Focus on your form.</strong> Try to maintain proper posture, and perform each exercise exactly as required, even if it means you need to use less weight.</p><p><strong>Breathe.</strong> Exhale while lifting the weight and inhale while lowering it.</p><p><strong>Allow for variety.</strong> Every now and then, change the exercises in your workout, or alter the number of sets or reps you are doing. Your body adapts to exercise, and your progress can plateau if you don't keep your body guessing.</p><p><strong>Ask for help.</strong> If you need some guidance, consider working with a trainer or joining a weight-training class at your local gym or YMCA.</p><p>Always give yourself time to recuperate. Don't work out using a muscle or joint that feels painful. In other words, don’t overdo it.</p></div>"|Sat Feb 16 07:45:21 +0000 2013|[]|Weight training boosts metabolism, helps regulate blood sugar and more: |3.0268508034474394e+17|http://trib.al/4eZlmR

""Eat more fruits and veggies to improve your appearance,"" he added.</p><p>Practically, this may be a useful motivational tool for dieters, Whitehead said. ""We are currently running randomized controlled trials to investigate whether seeing the potential appearance gains on images of one's own face are sufficient to motivate dietary change. Pilot trials have been encouraging so far,"" he added.</p><p>For the study, published March 7 in the online journal <em>PLoS ONE</em>, Whitehead's group looked at the fruits and vegetables 35 people ate over a six-week period.</p><p></p><p>They found that redness and yellowness in skin increased as more fruits and vegetables were consumed.</p><p>This is due to the impact of carotenoids, Whitehead said. ""These are red/yellow plant pigments, which are distributed to the skin surface when we eat fruits and veggies,"" he said.</p><p>The changes in skin color that were associated with eating more fruits and vegetables were linked in a second experiment with increased attractiveness. This suggests that skin color reflects better health, the researchers said.</p><p>""Our study suggests that an increase in fruit and veggie consumption of around three portions over a six-week period is sufficient to convey perceptible improvements in the apparent healthiness and attractiveness of facial skin,"" Whitehead said.</p><p>""Conversely, those that worsened their <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/allarticles.aspx"">diet</a> became paler,"" he said.</p><p></p><p>The carotenoids studied included beta-carotene and lycopene. Foods rich in beta-carotene include carrots, yams, spinach, peaches, pumpkin and apricots. Lycopene is present in apricots, watermelons, tomatoes and pink grapefruits.</p><p>Nearly all of the study participants were white, so more work is needed to see how diet affects other groups, the researchers noted.</p><p>Also, the study was small, and the results merely show an association not cause and effect.</p><p>Still, other experts supported the findings. ""This is something I have been saying for a very long time,"" said Dr. Doris Day, a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.</p><p>""We are really what we eat, and it shows in your skin — and there are no shortcuts,"" she added.</p><p>There are studies that show a high-antioxidant diet — one with olive oil, nuts, more fruits and vegetables and less dairy and red meat — helps skin resist aging changes and skin cancer, Day said.</p><p>""You want to look for different colors of fruits and vegetables, because each color has its own special benefit,"" Day added.</p><p>Also, opt for the fruit itself, including skin and pulp, rather than juice. ""If you eat the whole plant, then you have the best chance of getting the whole benefit from the plant,"" she added.</p><p>""Your skin is a reflection of your overall general health,"" Day said. ""The healthier your skin is, the better it functions, the more it can help the rest of your body function; the healthier the rest of your body is, the healthier your skin is as well.""</p><p>Samantha Heller, a dietitian and nutritionist at the Center for Cancer Care at Griffin Hospital in Derby, Conn., agreed. ""Fruits and vegetables are loaded with healthy plant compounds that keep skin healthy, structurally strong and protect it from the <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/skin-and-beauty/5-surprising-sun-safety-tips.aspx"">damaging rays of the sun</a>,"" she said.</p><p>It has long been known that many plant substances, such as the carotenoids beta-carotene and lycopene, contribute to the skin color, she said.</p><p>""These compounds are also potent disease fighters,"" she added.</p><p>Only 25 percent to 30 percent of Americans eat the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables, and efforts to increase consumption have not been too successful, Heller noted.</p><p>""But once the word gets out that eating fruits and vegetables can make you sexy, attractive and maybe even look younger, hopefully, the carrots, kale and cantaloupe will be flying off the shelves and into people's meals,"" she said.</p></div>"|Sat Feb 16 05:15:18 +0000 2013|[]|The real secret to a healthy complexion?

I'm wondering if this is a safe way of dieting. Will this make it easier or more difficult to stay on the diet? What are your thoughts?</em></p><p><em>— Lindsay, Oregon</em></p><p>The diet mentality says we are either on a <a href=""/diet-nutrition/allarticles.aspx"">diet</a> or off a diet, or that if we eat something fun it is ""cheating."" This state of mind has proven time and time again to result in failure; just ask anyone who has struggled with weight. But year after year, some new, self-proclaimed diet expert writes a book that promotes this type of thinking because the idea of ""cheating"" or eating <a href=""/diet-nutrition/weight-management/specialist/apovian/how-to-control-chocolate-cravings.aspx"">""forbidden"" foods</a> is alluring — and marketable.</p><p>The truth, however, is that for more than 40 years, medical centers across the country have promoted a lifestyle-change approach to weight loss that says there are <em>no</em> foods that are off-limits. So there's no need to beat yourself up for ""cheating"" and certainly no need to plan ""cheat days."" According to this lifestyle-change philosophy, you eat according to a plan that does not eliminate foods from your diet. You simply choose nutritionally balanced, whole foods that help you control hunger, include some of your favorite (and perhaps less balanced) foods on occasion so you don't feel deprived, and always practice appropriate <a href=""/diet-nutrition/101/specialist/binks/beating-the-dinnertime-binge.aspx"">portion control</a>. If you love chocolate cake, for example, then occasionally put it in your plan and enjoy it. Just balance that out with other healthy choices and, of course, stay active.</p><p>This approach gets rid of the guilt created by negative words like ""cheating"" or ""going off your diet"" and gives you the power to include your favorite foods within a sensible plan. This way of eating can last a lifetime; diets do not.</p><p></p><p></p></div>"|Sat Feb 16 04:15:14 +0000 2013|[]|Do diets with a cheat day really work? |3.026322045703455e+17|http://trib.al/1mW7UU

Sexual dysfunction can involve pain during intercourse, an inability to maintain an erection, or difficulty experiencing an orgasm.</p><p>Though there are many causes of diminished libido and sexual dysfunction in men and women, there are also many ways to increase libido and rekindle the joy of sex once you identify the problem.</p><p><strong>Sexual Dysfunction in Women</strong></p><p>Sexual dysfunction in women is grouped into different disorders: sexual pain, problems with desire, arousal problems, and orgasm difficulty. Changes in hormone levels, medical conditions, and other factors can contribute to low libido and other forms of sexual dysfunction in women.</p><p>Specifically, sexual dysfunction in women may be due to:</p><ul><li><strong>Vaginal dryness.</strong> This can lead to low libido and problems with arousal and desire, as sex can be painful when the vagina isn't properly lubricated. Vaginal dryness can result from hormonal changes that occur during and after menopause or while breastfeeding, for example. Psychological issues, like anxiety about sex, can also cause vaginal dryness. And anticipation of painful intercourse due to vaginal dryness may, in turn, decrease a woman’s desire for sex.</li><li><strong>Low libido.</strong> Lack of sexual desire can also be caused by lower levels of the hormone estrogen. Fatigue, depression, and anxiety can also lead to low libido, as can certain medications, including some antidepressants.</li><li><strong>Difficulty achieving orgasm.</strong> <a href=""/sexual-health/the-female-orgasm.aspx"">Orgasm</a> disorders, such as delayed orgasms or inability to have one at all, can affect both men and women. Again, some antidepressant medications can also cause these problems.</li><li><strong>Pain during sex.</strong> Pain is sometimes from a known cause, such as vaginal dryness or endometriosis. But sometimes the cause of painful sex is elusive. Known as vulvodynia or vulvar vestibulitis, experts don't know what’s behind this mysterious type of chronic, painful intercourse. A burning sensation may accompany pain during sex.</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Sexual Dysfunction in Men</strong></p><p></p><p>The types of sexual dysfunction men may experience include:</p><ul><li><strong>Erectile dysfunction (ED).</strong> <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/erectile-dysfunction/guide/"">ED</a> can be caused by medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, or by anxiety about having sex. Depression, fatigue, and stress can also contribute to erectile dysfunction.</li><li><strong>Ejaculation problems.</strong> These include premature ejaculation (ejaculation that occurs too early during intercourse) and the inability to ejaculate at all. Causes include medications, like some antidepressants, anxiety about sex, a history of sexual trauma (such as a partner being unfaithful), and strict religious beliefs.</li><li><strong>Low libido.</strong> Psychological issues like stress and depression, as well as anxiety about having sex also can lead to a decreased or no sexual desire. Decreased hormone levels (particularly if testosterone is low), physical illnesses, and medication side effects may also diminish libido in men.</li></ul><p><strong>Dealing With Sexual Dysfunction</strong></p><p>All couples should be able to enjoy a healthy sex life — an important part of a relationship. If you are experiencing sexual dysfunction, bring up your concerns with your doctor. You can often correct your problem by:</p><ul><li>Getting an accurate diagnosis and the proper treatment of any underlying medical condition</li><li>Talking to your partner openly about your sexual relationship</li><li>Avoiding alcohol, smoking, and drug use</li><li>Managing stress, anxiety, and depression</li><li>Getting creative and re-energizing your sexual routine</li></ul><p>Good communication can unlock closed doors in the bedroom, so start by talking to your partner about physical and emotional intimacy. And, if you suspect a medical condition, talk to your doctor about what could be going on with your body.</p><p>Learn more in the Everyday Health <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/sexual-health/basics.aspx"">Sexual Health Center</a>.</p></div>"|Sat Feb 16 03:30:08 +0000 2013|['#healthy']|Sexual dysfunction can take many forms, but shouldn't prevent a healthy sex life: |3.026208550437806e+17|http://bit.ly/XLI0bM

While men and women are equally narcissistic, study authors said, the cortisol stress response was not noted in female participants.</p><p>""We generally see narcissism as a personality trait that's bad for others but not narcissists. It's bad for people in relationships with them,"" said study co-author Sara Konrath, an assistant research professor at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research. ""This study was a way of getting under their skin to see if there are physical consequences.""</p><p>The study is published Jan. 23 in the journal <em>PLoS ONE</em>.</p><p>Konrath and her colleagues administered a 40-item questionnaire to 106 college students that measured five components of <a href=""/bipolar-disorder/bipolar-disorder-vs-narcissistic-personality-disorder.aspx"">narcissism</a>, which is also characterized by self-absorption, overestimations of their uniqueness — attractiveness or intelligence, for instance — and a sense of grandiosity. They also measured cortisol levels twice in the students' saliva to assess baseline levels of the hormone, which signals activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), the body's key stress response system.</p><p></p><p>Three of narcissism's five personality components are considered useful or healthy: leadership/authority, superiority/arrogance and self-absorption/self-admiration. Konrath also noted that narcissists tend to be creative people with low levels of depression, but their fragile views of themselves can lead them to react defensively and resort to aggression when their sense of superiority is threatened.</p><p></p><p>The authors found elevated levels of cortisol only in the men with unhealthy narcissism, and they speculated that in these men the HPA axis is chronically activated.</p><p>While study data didn't explain why only men seem to suffer from a higher stress response to narcissism, Konrath speculated that societal definitions of masculinity that overlap with the trait — such as arrogance or dominance — may leave men particularly vulnerable physiologically.</p><p>""They're at especially high risk because someone who admits they're stressed out is going to get help, but they're not likely to,"" she said. ""There may be a cost to this jerkiness. It's a little sad they're a group that wouldn't get help if they needed it.""</p><p>While the study ""invites people to look at this issue in a more comprehensive way,"" it did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between narcissism and the body's stress response, said Dr. Mark Russ, director of psychiatric services at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, N.Y.</p><p>""People with narcissism may be type-A, very driven, perfectionistic and seek high-stress situations, and the cortisol levels may be measuring that,"" Russ said. ""There may be an overlap.""</p><p>Konrath said future research will focus on the reason women don't respond physiologically to narcissism as men apparently do. Narcissism levels have increased in both genders in recent years, she said, perhaps as a byproduct of the so-called ""self-esteem movement,"" which emphasizes praise for children over criticism.</p><p>""It could be a change in the educational environment,"" she said. ""I think it's nice we're trying to be thoughtful and careful of people's feelings, but we may err on the side of not being [constructive].""</p></div>"|Sat Feb 16 02:45:14 +0000 2013|[]|Self-centered?

Considering the <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/guide/"">number of people with diabetes has doubled</a> in the past two decades, the finding is a positive one.</p><p>But while a growing number of people with diabetes are able to meet their recommended goals in all three ABCs — A1C (blood glucose), blood pressure, and cholesterol levels — the news isn't all rosy. Many people with diabetes don't have a handle on their condition. According to the report, each individual ABC goal was met by more than 50 percent, but 81.2 percent still failed to achieve all three ABC goals. Some groups show more room for improvement than others.</p><p>""Although our results showed a dramatic increase in the proportion of people with diabetes who met the ABC goals, there is still much room for improvement,"" says the paper's first author, Sarah Stark Casagrande, PhD, an epidemiologist from Social &amp; Scientific Systems Inc.

Young people and some minority groups, however, were less likely to achieve the optimal blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels.</p><p></p><p>Mexican Americans were less likely to meet A1C and LDL (bad cholesterol) goals, and non-Hispanic blacks were less likely to meet blood pressure and LDL goals compared to non-Hispanic whites, the study authors report online today in <em>Diabetes Care</em>. Younger individuals (those between ages 20 and 49) were less likely to meet blood sugar and cholesterol goals.</p><p>For the study, researchers with the NIDDK analyzed data from several National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys ranging from 1988 to 2010.</p><p>""It is particularly disturbing that good control was seen less frequently in young people,"" said Judith Fradkin, MD, director of the NIDDK Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Metabolic Diseases, in a release from the NIH/NIDDK. ""Research has shown that good diabetes control early in the course of disease has long-lasting benefits reducing the risk of complications. For people with long life expectancy after diagnosis of diabetes, it's especially important to focus on meeting diabetes management goals as early as possible, because with that longer life comes a greater chance of developing complications if they do not control their diabetes.""</p><p>The noted improvements in diabetes control can likely be attributed to better therapies, such as <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/statins/guide/"">cholesterol-lowering statins</a>, and education programs that tout the benefits of eating right to control blood pressure and blood sugar to prevent complications, according to the report.</p><p>""Improvements in ABC control are likely a result of new and improved medications and monitoring devices, increasing research from several landmark studies that showed the importance of managing diabetes, and better communication and translation of this information to people with diabetes and their medical practitioners,"" Dr. Casagrande says.</p><p>Still, there is more work to be done by way of better access to care and education, and research into new therapeutic approaches.</p><p>""As the U.S. population ages and <a href=""//www.everydayhealth.com/diabetes/type2/the-diabetes-epidemic-in-a-nutshell.aspx"">diabetes prevalence increases</a>, it becomes increasingly urgent to find ways to overcome barriers to good diabetes management and deliver affordable, quality care so those with diabetes can live a longer and healthier life without serious diabetes complications,"" the study authors write.</p><p>""We are hopeful that diabetes control will continue to improve,"" says Casagrande, citing increases in the proportion of people taking blood pressure and cholesterol medication, and the effectiveness of new glycemic medications.

The story the singer and actress, 30, recounts in her new memoir <em>I Got This: How I Changed My Ways and Lost What Weighed Me Down</em> is heart-wrenching to any woman who has ever worried about being too curvy.</p><p>“Surely, she wasn’t addressing me that way,” Hudson writes. “I had the height of a supermodel, breasts that were naturally big <em>and</em> real, and a God-given shape. Why would I feel insecure about that?”</p><p>But as it turned out, the question <em>was</em> directed at her. And Hudson, a Grammy award-winning singer and Oscar-winning actress who got her start on season three of <em>American Idol</em>, was in for a surprise. Throughout her blossoming career, she was constantly hounded about her weight, a struggle she candidly details on every page of <em>I Got This</em>. A chronic yo-yo dieter, Hudson reveals that she actually gained twenty pounds for her Oscar-winning role in the 2006 movie <em>Dreamgirls</em>. When it came time to lose it and get back to what she calls her “comfortable size 10,” she did what she always did whenever she wanted to lose a few — she followed a strict plan of nothing but brown rice, broccoli, and grilled chicken and two running workouts a day. But time after time, Hudson’s restrictive crash diet didn’t transfer into long-term weight loss — or health.</p><p>“That way of eating is effective for quick weight loss,” Hudson writes. “It’s a total setup for failure because eating that way forever just isn’t realistic.”</p><p>After the birth of her son in 2009, Hudson says she tipped the scales at 237 pounds and knew it was time to make a change: “It was time to think about how I was going to lose the excess baby weight and then put that plan into action.”</p><p></p><p>And of course, we all know how that story ends: A few months later, she signed as a spokesperson for <a href=""/diet-nutrition/weight-watchers.aspx"">Weight Watchers</a> and has since shed 80 pounds on the plan, inspiring hundreds or even thousands of men and women to attempt the same. Throughout her book, her signature warm tone shines through, making readers feel like they are really getting a behind-the-scenes look at her life.</p><p></p><p>This “realness” is what has won her many fans over the years, including Tina Jensen and Alex Gonzalez, who joined Weight Watchers about the same time Hudson did.</p><p>“It just feels like Jennifer Hudson has been on this journey with us,” Gonzalez, 27, who has lost 43 pounds with Weight Watchers, says while waiting in line at a New York Barnes &amp; Noble for a signing of Hudson’s new tome. Jensen, who has lost 42 pounds on the program, agrees. “She’s a perfect inspiration because you got to see such a clear before and after with her,” she says. “She’s so down to earth, and it feels like I can really trust that she’s doing the program with us.”</p><p>Here, we share some of that Hudson's very relatable advice:</p><p><strong>1. Find a diet buddy.</strong> Hudson’s Weight Watchers coach, Liz Josefsberg, has been essential to her success. “Liz lost 50 pounds and had kept it off, which gave me a tremendous amount of confidence in her,” Hudson writes. “She knew what it was like to lose that much weight, so I could really open up to her along the way.” Whether your weight loss buddy is a coach like Liz or a friend who wants to slim down, sharing your experience with someone who can relate is key. Plus, you’ll be more likely to stay on track if a friend is holding you accountable.</p><p><strong>2. Create a flexible plan.</strong> “I had been so brainwashed into believing that dieting meant excruciating limitations that I had rejected the principles of the Weight Watchers program,” Hudson writes. Whether it’s Weight Watchers or another system, it’s important to create a plan that will work for your lifestyle — and allow a little indulgence from time to time.</p><p><strong>3. Watch your portions.</strong> Hudson says before she started Weight Watchers, she was a pretty healthy eater for the most part. “What I didn’t realize was the amount I was eating was actually detrimental,” she says. Now, she knows <a href=""/diet-pictures/secrets-to-portion-control.aspx"">what a portion really looks like</a>, and that helps keep her on track.</p><p><strong>4. Get your family on board.</strong> Hudson’s family quite literally joined her weight loss efforts — inspired by her success, her sister, aunt, and cousin have all shed weight, too. Hudson’s husband has also been a huge support. “It’s such a blessing to have a partner who shares your same beliefs in getting healthy, as opposed to sabotaging your efforts,” Hudson reveals about her husband, pro wrestler David Otunga.</p><p><strong>For more fitness, diet, and weight loss news, follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/weightloss"" rel=""nofollow"">@weightloss</a> on Twitter from the editors of <a href=""https://twitter.com/everydayhealth"" rel=""nofollow"">@EverydayHealth.</a></strong></p></div>"|Fri Feb 15 23:45:20 +0000 2013|[]|Need some weight loss-spiration?
