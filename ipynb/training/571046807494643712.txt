The enterovirus infections that have sprung up in the Midwest have brought the words wheezing and respiratory distress into the mainstream But how as a parent do you know if your child is wheezing And when is it bad enough to contact a doctor or seek care Parents of asthmatics become adept at recognizing breathing difficulties But enterovirus D is also affecting children who have never before experienced respiratory distress In serious cases its landing them in intensive care Parents are finding themselves in a tough position trying to evaluate their childs symptoms in light of a serious health threat while wondering if theyre overreacting to a common cold  Doctors too are still finding their feet amid the recent influx of cases As time goes on and more cases are treated we probably will come to a better understanding of those children at greatest risk said Dr Paul Krogstad a professor of pediatrics in the infectious diseases division at Mattel Childrens Hospital UCLA  We may find a way to distinguish D versus another trigger for respiratory distress But presently were not there Lab testing alone to detect a viral trigger is rather slow Krogstad told the LA Times A throat or nose swab is used to detect the virus and it takes many hours or days to get results So as is frequently the case when your child is ill you watch out in case things get worse and do your best to cope While youre busy with that here are a few things to consider A wheeze classically is a sort of continuous sound with a buzzing quality to it Krogstad said It can affect the entire chest or just part of it But dont be surprised or dismissive if you hear nothing Wheezing may not be audible without a stethoscope Doctors will use that instrument to listen for the characteristic continuous noise and delayed expiration Some children of course dont have wheezing that you can hear with a stethoscope when in the midst of a very severe attack he added Air flow may be so low  you dont generate a noise So its not just the presence or absence of wheezing but the total degree of respiratory distress Look for faster breathing Are there visible retractions Thats when the skin can be seen   between the ribs for instance When breathing difficulty is more severe retractions may be visible just above the breastbone and collarbone Take into account complaints about breathing or discomfort And if your child is too young to talk look for persistent coughing and fever  Babies in respiratory distress often appear uncomfortable and have trouble eating If your child has asthma and becomes ill see if the usual treatments work Krogstad said If an inhaler that normally helps with intermittent asthma doesnt seem to make a difference seek a doctors advice The same goes if signs of distress return very quickly after the inhaler is used When symptoms are mild you can go with fluids rest and medicines to reduce fever and discomfort But if symptoms get worse or dont improve within a week or if there are signs of respiratory distress get your child to the doctor Severe breathing difficult or blue lips are reason to head for the closest emergency room experts said
