Childrens cartoons often seen as innocent films about royalty and furry animals are rife with onscreen death and murder a new study finds The significant characters in kids animated films are  times more likely to die than those in adult dramas researchers found And the victims of those deaths in cartoons are five times more likely to be parents Just because a film has a cute clownfish a princess or a beautiful baby deer as its main character doesnt necessarily mean that there wont be murder and mayhem said the studys lead researcher Ian Colman an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Ottawa in Canada Colman decided to analyze cartoon fatalities after realizing that many of the cartoon movies he watched with his young children had troubling deaths he said   For instance in The Land Before Time an animated film about dinosaurs the mother of the main character gets savagely attacked and killed by a   in the first  minutes Colman told Live Science At that point my daughter was completely hysterical and was begging me to stop the film Colman and his colleagues identified the  childrens animated films with the highest box office grosses and recorded how long into the films the key characters died their roles in the movie and how they died For comparison the researchers matched each cartoon with the two topgrossing films for adults from the same year including horror films such as The Exorcism of Emily Rose and What Lies Beneath and thrillers including Pulp Fiction and Black Swan Cartoon characters have lousy life expectancies they found Twothirds of the cartoons   compared with half of the adult dramas In cartoons most characters die from animal attacks and falls from high places whereas common causes of death in other films were gunshots car accidents and illnesses But not all deaths were accidental Cartoon characters were  times more likely to be murdered than their counterparts in films for adults the researchers found Many of those deaths happen to parents   Colman found But that could be a useful plot point he added
