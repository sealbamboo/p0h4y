The fraud scheme began to unravel last fall with the discovery of a   and a suspicious spike in Medicare drug spending tied to a doctor in Key Biscayne Fla Now its led to two guilty pleas as well as an ongoing criminal case against a pharmacy owner Last year   had led to rampant waste and fraud in Medicares prescription drug program known as Part D As part of that series we wrote about   a kidney specialist whose Part D prescriptions soared from  in  to  million the following year The value of her prescriptions rose to nearly  million in  the most recent year available But no one in Medicare bothered to ask her about the seemingly huge change in her practice OrtizButchers attorney said She stumbled across a sign of trouble last September after asking a staffer to mail a fanny pack to her brother Instead of receiving the pack he received a package of prescriptions purportedly signed by the doctor lawyer Robert Mayer said last year OrtizButcher immediately alerted authorities Since then investigators have uncovered a web of interrelated scams that together cost the federal government up to  million documents show In February the US attorneys office for the Southern District of Florida   who had been a secretary at OrtizButchers Island Clinic from March  to September  with  counts of conspiracy fraud and aggravated identity theft Suero subsequently   to two counts of conspiracy and identity theft In a recounting of her wrongdoing called a factual proffer   to create fraudulent scripts for numerous Medicare beneficiaries The prescriptions falsely represented that the Medicare beneficiary was seen by OrtizButcher and that the listed prescriptions were medically necessary Suero acknowledged that she was paid  for each prescription she generated Local pharmacies then billed Medicare for filling the prescriptions which were sometimes never dispensed The false claims resulted in losses to Medicare of at least  million the proffer said In March the US attorney   Milagros Matias Ortiz with two counts of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and aggravated identity theft   acknowledging in her proffer that   from March  to August  She was paid  for each prescription Ortiz and Suero are set to be sentenced this month Sueros lawyer Rene Palomino Jr said the doctor had no knowledge of what was going on Believe me if she had any knowledge about this her name would have been in an indictment he said Ortizs lawyer Joseph Tesmond said his client has accepted responsibility for her very minor role in this He said she continued working at the clinic after she withdrew from the scheme resigning in March before she was charged She has been cooperating with the government since the beginning Tesmond said The first time that they came to speak to her she spoke to them at length without legal representation In May   Luisa Isabel Vega with conspiracy and fraud relating to Medicare claims linked to OrtizButcher Vegas AB Pharmacy in Miami was overpaid  million by Medicare from April  to November  according to the indictment  Daniel Crespi a special agent with the Health and Human Services Inspector Generals office said several Medicare beneficiaries whose prescriptions were supposedly filled by AB Pharmacy denied receiving most or all of the medications The beneficiaries further admitted that they had been paid kickbacks by patient recruiters for allowing AB Pharmacy to submit fraudulent claims to Medicare utilizing their personal information Crespi wrote Crespis affidavit says he interviewed a physician ProPublica data show it was OrtizButcher who purportedly sent prescriptions for  Medicare patients to AB Pharmacy but it turned out that only  of them were actually patients of hers The physician concluded that hisher signature on the prescriptions were being forged and fraudulently utilized at AB Pharmacy Medicare data show that  prescriptions attributed to OrtizButcher were filled at AB Pharmacy in  more than any other doctor The second highest Medicare prescriber for AB Pharmacy was Miami physician   whose tab jumped from  million in  to  million the next year It was  million in  His mostprescribed drugs like OrtizButchers read like a shopping list of the brandname pills that are most valued in scams In an interview last year Dr Ortiz couldnt recall whether the prescriptions were his but later said hed been aware that some bogus prescriptions had been written using his name He has not been charged Vega the pharmacys owner has pleaded not guilty Her lawyer declined to comment saying the case is pending A spokeswoman for the US attorneys office said other cases related to prescriptions attributed to OrtizButcher are under investigation Criminal cases also were brought against officials at two other pharmacies that filled the doctors prescriptions though they began before she uncovered the scam The Suero and Ortiz cases are somewhat unique because we charged the individuals creating the fraudulent scripts spokeswoman Michelle Alvarez wrote by email Most of our cases focus on those who are more directly involved in billing Part D ie pharmacy owners and those who recruit and pay patients needed to bill the Part D program The larger question may be why Medicare didnt spot the spike in OrtizButchers supposed prescribing and inquire about it Aaron Albright a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said he cant discuss individual cases but said the agency has beefed up its oversight of the prescription drug program including its use of proactive data analysis The agency recently issued a new regulation giving itself the authority for the first time to kick abusive prescribers out of Medicare In a brief interview OrtizButcher said she was happy the case was being investigated and acted upon but the effect on her has been profound When you trust people in your life to work with you and that trust is violated it leaves a sense of emptiness thats insurmountable and also makes it very difficult to trust again she said Thats pretty much where Im at right now
