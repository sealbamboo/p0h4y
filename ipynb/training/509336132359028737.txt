T.J. Roberts is an early-to-bed, early-to-rise kind of guy. Often, he's in bed by 9 p.m. and up before dawn to hike, run or go fishing.. His wife, Morgan, often stays up working past midnight on weekdays. Then she hits snooze repeatedly until 7:40, when she crawls out of bed to get the children to school. On weekends, she sleeps until 11. (Now that she is expecting the couple's third child, she says this remains her pattern, unless she is too tired to stay up late.)
