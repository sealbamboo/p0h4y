Children who lead inactive lives are likely to grow up to become middleaged couch potatoes a study suggests  Researchers compared the TV viewing habits of more than  British people born in a single week in  at the ages of  and   Parents should increase childrens physical activity to ensure they become fit and healthy adults the University College London authors conclude  Do something active to displace TV advised coauthor Lee Smith  In the evening time when families tend to sit down and watch TV they should try to go for walks instead  If you cant go outside try active computer games anything that gets people up and expending energy rather than sitting down and snacking said Dr Smith of the UCL epidemiology and public health department  The authors acknowledge that for todays children TV viewing is often replaced by time on computers smartphones or tablets  But Dr Smith stressed the issues are the same that computers and phones are just a different way of sitting down and relaxing and parents need to encourage children to be more active  The study draws the   which gathers information on the economic circumstances health physical educational and social development of people born in England Scotland and Wales in    When they were  their parents were asked how often the children watched TV and played sport  Their height and weight were recorded as were their parents occupations  At age  they were asked how much time they spent watching TV and on a range of physical activities and sports  They were also asked to assess their health and weight  The study shows that the children who watched a lot of TV aged  were  more likely to spend more than three hours a day in front of the screen as adults than those who watched relatively little television in childhood  The yearolds who watched TV for at least three hours a day were more likely to be in only fair or poor health and to rate themselves as either overweight or obese They were also more likely to have had fathers who were overweight and in routine or manual jobs   The sons and daughters of manual workers were twice as likely as managers children to watch more than three hours of TV a day at  even after their own educational qualifications had been taken into account Parents who are manual workers are more likely to be physically active at work and may compensate for this by spending more time sitting down during their leisure hours suggests another of the researchers Dr Mark Hamer   Their children may then model their mothers and fathers leisure activity patterns It is important that children keep active And if they can be encouraged to participate in sports so much the better The authors believe this is the first study to use a large representative birth cohort to correlate childhood and adult TV viewing habits and health  Our work indicates that parents healthrelated behaviours may at least partly influence childrens TV viewing habits more than three decades later said Dr Hamer
