For older Americans  is a fact of life By one common estimate more than  percent of those over age  contend with it That means medication to lower blood pressure has become a fact of life too Diuretics beta blockers calcium channel blockers the unpronounceable reninangiotensin system blockers  in   with hypertension more than  percent were taking at least one of these classes of blood pressure drugs Most took two or three or more They did so because randomized clinical trials the supposed gold standard of medical research have shown that these drugs reduce heart failure heart attacks and stroke without scary side effects The prevailing notion is that these medications are safe with very few adverse effects said Dr Mary Tinetti chief of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine and lead author of the study  But the people enrolled in clinical trials she pointed out are typically healthier than older adults in general Investigators often exclude people who have other medical problems  comorbidities in doctorspeak  or who are taking several other medications Yet the great majority of the older people who show up at doctors offices do have multiple chronic conditions and are taking lots of prescription drugs So Dr Tinetti and her team have been looking into whether antihypertensive drugs might be causing problems in the real world beyond clinical trials They followed those   older people average age  with hypertension for up to three years and the results of their study are disturbing The risk of serious fall injuries  fractured bones brain injuries or dislocated joints  was significantly higher among those who took antihypertensives than among those who didnt Over the threeyear followup  percent of the subjects were badly hurt by falls which can have a devastating effect The outcomes are just as serious as the strokes and heart attacks for which we give these medications Dr Tinetti told me in an interview Serious fall injuries are as likely to lead to death or lasting functional disability More than half of the people in the study group were classified as moderate users of antihypertensives based on the number and doses of the drugs they took In that category serious fall injuries were  percent higher than among people who didnt take antihypertensives  In the group considered highintensity users serious injuries from falls were  percent higher than among nonusers And the risk more than doubled among drug users whod already had a serious fall injury in the previous year Although this study doesnt prove that taking the drugs led to the falls antihypertensive medications are among the logical suspects They can drop peoples blood pressure too much when they stand Dr Tinetti said They can make them fatigued confused dizzy Those are all risk factors for falls Medical authorities already advise   among older patients The most recent guidelines from an expert panel say that patients over age  with hypertension but without diabetes or kidney disease should aim for  The previous recommendation had been  but more recent research suggests that was unreasonably low  though patients who reached those numbers without problems need not change their regimens The  target holds for those with diabetes or kidney disease The Yale findings which were published this month in JAMA Internal Medicine mean that blood pressure management enters one of those increasingly common medical gray zones in which individuals and caregivers have to ask a lot of questions and balance the tradeoffs Do you avoid a heart attack by using drugs associated with an almost equal risk of breaking a hip or injuring your brain Especially since another Yale study using the same sample found that use of antihypertensive drugs didnt reduce the rate of cardiovascular events though it did reduce mortality among those who suffered them The Yale team actually asked that leading question of a small group of  people over age  who had high blood pressure and were at risk for falls Given that doctors could not magically reduce their cardiovascular risk without increasing fall risk and medication side effects what was most important to them About half the group said their   The other half placed greater importance on fewer falls and side effects Its a question millions of older people now have to ask themselves and not only themselves Its time to ask your doctor Knowing all my other conditions and my fall risks do I need all these medications Dr Tinetti said Are they doing me more harm than good I wondered aloud how many physicians were prepared to have this possibly lengthy discussion Dr Tinetti answered Its really up to patients and their caregivers to make it clear This is something important to me
