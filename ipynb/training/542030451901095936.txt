Nearly  percent of the births covered by Medicaid  or about  each year  were elective deliveries before  weeks of gestation Early deliveries like those can lead to worse health outcomes for mothers and children and higher costs according to   The research conducted by AcademyHealth and two state Medicaid medical directors found the early elective delivery rate for  states in which trend data were available had fallen from nearly  percent in  to  percent in  But looking at the latest available data from  to  the average rate was  percent according to the study in  Previous research has shown an overall national rate between  and  percent Still researchers and advocates say the rate should be zero A risk is being taken that doesnt need to be said lead researcher Tara Trudnak Fowler formerly of AcademyHealth and now with Altarum Institute in Alexandria Va Nonmedically indicated Csections and inductions performed less than  weeks are dangerous Since  the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists   or induced labor before  weeks unless there are medical reasons such as the mothers high blood pressure or diabetes or signs the fetus may be in distress For decades studies have shown that babies born earlier than  weeks are more likely to die and have feeding breathing and developmental problems Women undergoing induced labor are twice as likely to need a cesarean section which carries numerous surgical risks according to the March of Dimes Medicaid pays for  million births a year or nearly half of all US births The researchers analyzed data from  states and found early elective deliveries ranged from  percent to  percent As a condition of participating in the study states declined to allow their individual rates to be published The analysis which used information from birth certificates and Medicaid administrative data is the first largescale study specifically looking at Medicaid births These results are dramatic but not surprising said Cynthia Pellegrini senior vice president for the March of Dimes who was not involved in the study Since  some private and government insurers   and hospitals for delivering babies early without cause Two state Medicaid programs  in Texas and South Carolina  have stopped reimbursing providers for performing early elective deliveries In  UnitedHealthcare one of the nations largest private health insurers began paying hospitals more money if they took steps to limit early deliveries without medical cause and show a drop in their rates The goal wasnt only to limit risks to mothers and children but to save money by reducing costly care in neonatal intensive care units While only two state Medicaid programs have stopped paying for early elective deliveries more than  have established programs or strategies to discourage their use These include educating doctors and working with hospitals to implement hard stop policies that prohibit the scheduling of deliveries before  weeks of gestation without formal documentation of medical necessity the study said The study found that  percent of the Medicaid births were delivered early for no medical reason before  weeks and  percent were delivered before  weeks Pellegrini said the babies born before  weeks are at even higher risk of health problems Matt Salo executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors said all states should consider banning payment for early elective deliveries but he doubts that will happen Even so he said of the study This is good news and this is a trend we expect to continue
