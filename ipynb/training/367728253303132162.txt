Changing attitudes about weed are part of a larger shift in the countrys collective thoughts on federal drug policy Just this week on the heels of CNNs Sanjay Gupta   Attorney General Eric Holder announced an initiative to curb mandatory minimum drug sentences and a federal judge called New York Citys   unconstitutional  Between Attorney General Holders announcement the decision made on stopandfrisk and Dr Gupta coming out with his documentary it was a big week for drug policy Kilmer said  Peruse the   and youll see decrying pot prohibition is no longer confined to the convictions of Cheech and Chong Todays debate involves an unlikely alliance that unites conservatives Pat Robertson and Sarah Palin with rapper Snoop Lion aka Snoop Dogg blogger Arianna Huffington and Jon Stewart of The Daily Show In June the US Conference of Mayors cited organized crime a national change in attitude the efficacy of medical marijuana and exorbitant costs to local governments in its resolution supporting   a stance similar to the one endorsed by the National Lawyers Guild and the Red Cross Im surprised by the longterm increase in support for marijuana legalization in the last six or seven years Its unprecedented It doesnt look like a blip said Peter Reuter a University of Maryland public policy professor with  years experience researching drug policy Reuter who cowrote the book   said he believes two factors are spurring the shift in national opinion Medical marijuana has reduced the stigma associated with the drug making it less devilish and the number of Americans who have tried the drug continues to rise  When    with strict controls by established state agencies and a coherent tax structure  opponents werent able to raise the money to fight the initiatives which Reuter considers an important signal that the country is no longer willing to fight this battle As important as the lack of resistance Reuter said is the subsequent response Though he doesnt see federal legalization on the horizon he noted that the White House could easily shut Washington and Colorado down either via a Justice Department crackdown or an IRS prohibition on tax deductions for the purchase of marijuana which Reuter said would be a killer for the industry Instead this week saw Holder make his mandatory minimum announcement without so much as a word about whats happening in the states  Likewise Congress has been reticent Reuter said  It may be that everyones waiting to see what happens he said I take their silence to be some form of assent In  a Gallup poll showed  and it estimated that same year that  Last week Gallup reported that number had   Gallup Pew and   polls conducted in the past three years indicate a nation evenly divided and Guptas documentary plants him among a loud chorus that has sung the drugs praises since California approved medical marijuana in   Since then  other states and the District of Columbia have passed similar laws while Colorado and Washington state have legalized it for recreational use  a move Alaska California Nevada and Oregon   according to the National Conference of State Legislatures  Sixteen states have decriminalized possession of personal amounts of marijuana since  including Colorado which approved decriminalization  years before voters legalized cannabis in  according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws   Mark Kleiman a UCLA public policy professor who has been tapped to mold Washingtons legal pot industry noted that even in states where recent ballot initiatives were shot down there are telling results Perennial red state Arkansas medical marijuana vote in November for example was a squeaker failing  to  When  of voters in Arkansas are voting for legal pot we arent in Kansas anymore said Kleiman who cowrote   with Kilmer  The tone of the debate is also a sign that the country is nearing a tipping point at which public opinion effects political change Rather than engaging in a simple yesvsno debate about legalization proponents are asking more nuanced questions Should grows be large or small What should the tax structure look like Should potency be limited Will the model involve forprofit companies How will weed be distributed The discussion over time  and I think its for the better  the discussion is starting to focus more on the details Kilmer said Before nobody has ever really had to confront those decisions  Those decisions are really going to shape the cost and benefits of policy change President Barack Obamas drug czar Gil Kerlikowske said in    an assertion the Office of National Drug Control Policy says holds true today The office emphasizes that the administrations  drug policy takes a new tack with the realization that America cant arrest its way out of its longtime drug epidemic The White House policy announced in April favors prevention over incarceration science over dogma and diversion for nonviolent offenders the office says Arguments for marijuana legalization however   the Office of National Drug Control Policy says The federal government may have a difficult time maintaining its stance experts predict John Kane a federal judge in Colorado said in December he sees   in the s Toward the end of Prohibition Kane explained judges routinely dismissed violations or levied fines so trivial that prosecutors quit filing cases The law is simply going to die before its repealed It will just go into disuse Kane said Its a cultural force and you simply cannot legislate against a cultural force Kleiman who is also chairman of the board for BOTEC Analysis Corp a think tank applying public policy analysis techniques to the issues of crime and drug abuse said the federal government may have tripped itself up in the s by classifying marijuana as a Schedule I drug with no medicinal use and a high potential for abuse If the government had made it Schedule II the classification for cocaine and oxycodone  years ago it would be easier today to justify a recreational ban he said Kleiman said the infrastructure he is helping establish in Washington could provide a model for other states but ideally hed prefer a model that involved federal legalization and permitted users to either grow their own marijuana or patronize coops All the stuff I want to do you cant do as long as its federally illegal Kleiman said By the time we get it legalized federally there will be systems in place in each state which will make uniform controls at a national level tricky The push for legalization has gained momentum though he said and he doesnt foresee it moving backward In  years proponents might even move politics at a national level he said though predictions are problematic so long as pot prohibition endures Its sustained right now Whether its going to be sustained is another question he said  In the meantime states are expected to continue to lead the charge Alaska could put a legalization ballot before voters next year while Maine Rhode Island California and Oregon may give it a shot in  when the presidential election promises to bring younger voters to the polls I think a lots going to depend on how legalization plays out in Colorado and Washington  also how the federal government responds Kilmer said We still havent heard how theyre going to address commercial production facilities in those states The next White House administration could easily reverse course just as it could on mandatory minimums Kilmer said but while pots future is nebulous the nations change in attitude  not only since the s but even since a decade ago  is clear That makes proponents hopeful if reluctant to make predictions I didnt see this shift in opinion coming and I think thats true of my collaborators Reuter said So much for experts
