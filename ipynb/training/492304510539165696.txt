Serious enough to make her a sixtime world lumberjack champion  and give her a serious sixpack Verstegen became a professional lumberjill when she was  and has spent the last decade and a half traveling the world competing in lumberjack competitions  Next up is the   in Hayward Wisconsin this week  Shell be competing in the logrolling and boom run events In logrolling two lumberjacks fight to roll their opponent off a log that is  to  inches in diameter depending on the competition Evenly matched pairs can stay on for more than seven minutes Verstegen says  You need every single muscle in your body  if you get tired your technique goes out the door she says One little misstep and its over  In the boom run competitors race across logs chained together on the water Youre allowed two falls in the timed event Its one of the more dangerous lumberjack sports  Logrolling Verstegen says is one of the safest   There are programs dedicated to the sport   and in other states such as Minnesota Michigan and Oregon Verstegen coaches hundreds of children each year The kids dont realize theyre exercising theyre having so much fun she says And theyre doing something totally unique   Its a way for Verstegen to give back Her mother was diagnosed with   a degenerative brain disorder when Verstegen was  years old Her parents wanted to keep life as normal as possible so they told her to pick a few sports from a YMCA catalog Logrolling became Verstegens escape from being a caregiver  I was allowed two to three hours every day after school to just do sports and to be myself and to not think about my moms sickness   It was never ever about winning It was that time to go there to be with my friends to be stupid to get yelled at by my coach  That kept me going through all those tough years During competition season Verstegen is on the water nearly every day She also does resistance training several times a week and hill sprints to increase her endurance and speed She sticks to lean meats produce and good carbohydrates to stay energized  Verstegen knows not every child will fall in love with lumberjack sports like she did The key to fighting childhood obesity she says is to find something that inspires them whether its logrolling rock climbing or ballet  When they see fitness they immediately think of lifting weights running marathons  doing things they dont enjoy But the options are endless
