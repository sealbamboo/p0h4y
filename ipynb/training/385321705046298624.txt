Many Americans got please wait messages Tuesday when they tried to start shopping for health coverage on the federal governments new health insurance website   A series of technological glitches delays and crashes kept people from getting to several of the  state exchanges too Like every new law every new product rollout there are going to be some glitches in the signup process along the way that we are going to fix I have been saying this from the start President Obama said at the White House The technological system powering the new health care marketplace is the first of its kind Nothing similar exists anywhere in the world according to administration health officials Systems of this scale are very difficult You know Facebook wasnt built in a day said Frank Febbraro chief technology officer for Phase  Technology which has built systems for the White House Homeland Security and other agencies Hes not working on the health exchange system but Febbraro knows the challenge IT administrators face This new system is particularly hard he says because it has to fetch data from several agencies to find out which plans and tax credits consumers qualify for So when you have so many people hitting the site all at the same time each asking a question that is basically unique you require a lot of horsepower to be able to process that for each individual he says A few major projects were implemented at the same time Sixteen states built their own insurance exchange sites The federal government built and is running healthcaregov for states without their own exchanges And programmers created a massive federal data hub That hub is the system that computers from state exchanges and the federal marketplace have to connect with to link up with agencies like the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security The data check is necessary to verify who you are and your income as you sign up for coverage so it can spit out the menu of insurance options and federal credits youre eligible for All of that data verification needs to happen within seconds It also takes a long time to answer that request So things start to stack up pretty quick says Febbraro But a lot of folks trying to sign up on Tuesday didnt even get that far in the process Hawaiis exchange didnt go up and Marylands site was intermittent throughout the day For millions relying on the federal site just getting to a registration form was impossible Were still blocked out We cant even get in at this point said Travis Middleton a Houstonbased insurance agent who was trying out the healthcaregov site The system was swamped Health officials blame unexpectedly high traffic for the long wait times and crashes   million people visited healthcaregov between midnight and  pm ET on Tuesday health officials said The agency overseeing the exchange system says its implementing fixes as quickly as possible We did two things We added capacity and we made some adjustments to the system to handle that and I think youll find it much improved said Marilyn Tavenner the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services But most of the real work of making these systems work is in the hands of contracted computer programmers Its such a difficult time Especially if youre involved building these systems and the cars screaming down the highway and theres pieces falling off of it Its really tempting to panic and try and make changes to these systems and hopes and the only thing I can recommend is to be calm Febbraro says Thats the message from the government too Were in a marathon not a sprint and we need your help said Tavenner Consumers have until Dec  to enroll if they want health coverage that would begin on Jan   The agency says the sites should be running more smoothly between now and then
