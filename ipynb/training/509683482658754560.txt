Here are three words you dont often see in close proximity  Yet there they stand united in the headline for an essay in the   this month  The essay was written by   assistant professor of clinical emergency medicine at Indiana Universitys School of Medicine and   an assistant dean at the Indiana University School of Nursing They pay tribute to a Liberian colleague   director of the emergency department at Monrovias John F Kennedy Memorial Medical Center Theyd worked closely with Sam Brisbane on a disastermedicine program He was a memorable character they write at once caring and profane  his laugh was best described as a giggle and he swore frequently And he was terrified by Ebola Dr Brisbane was a wreck they recall When they asked how they could protect themselves he told the authors Leave Monrovia This summer Dr Brisbane treated a patient with suspected Ebola A few days later the yearold doctor came down with symptoms of the virus He died on July  With apologies to his wife and family who saw him die horribly and unjustly Mugele and Priest conclude we believe our friend died a good death  as did all the nurses and doctors who have sacrificed themselves caring for patients with this awful disease We spoke with Mugele and Priest about the idea of a good death Mugele Dr Brisbane was an older gentleman he had a coffee plantation he had a wife and children He didnt have to treat these patients He didnt have to be a doctor at that stage of his life And he kept doing it even though he knew Ebola was very contagious and he had a high likelihood of getting it Dying was a selfless act on his part Priest We were out in Liberia in  conducting a hazard vulnerability analysis for the hospital The hospital there is a really dangerous place Things catch on fire you dont have good water And he tells us What Im scared of is if theres ever a viral hemorrhagic fever like Ebola that gets here then were all dead Mugele He would be really pissed off Mugele He would appreciate the irony I think And he would at least have wanted to be made coauthor Mugele Were talking about two separate issues here a good death in terms of doing something in service to humanity and a good natural death Especially in emergency medicine we have this concept of doing everything for a patient  even if everything is kind of futile  Mugele Most clinicians if they get a terminal disease would rather go home and be with family than go to the hospital Maybe were doing too much at the end of a life spending too much money and too many resources for very little return Mugele We saw a woman about  she probably had cancer probably had a blood clot in her lungs We couldnt tell we didnt have diagnostic equipment We knew she was dying In the US we would have been putting tubes in her putting her on ventilator giving her a lot of aggressive medications We knew she wasnt able to get that kind of care in Liberia The best thing we did for her was to turn the monitor off and let her family come to the bedside Mugele We have so much in the US We have defibrillators and ventilators and all sorts of blood pressure medicine And we can keep people alive for a long long time Whether theyre comfortable or responsive to their loved ones or enjoy that extra time is the question Priest I think a good death is not about how you die Its about the quality of the life you left behind And thats not an endoflife discussion Its a beginningoflife discussion
