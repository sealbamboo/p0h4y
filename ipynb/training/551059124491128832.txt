ts pm on New Years Eve and the streets of Liverpool are bubbling with the anticipation of seeing out  with a bang For most people the evenings consequences will be no more severe than a hangover and the material for a few funny stories But for the staff arriving at the accident and emergency department at the Royal Liverpool the citys main hospital New Years Day wasnt such a cheerful prospect The hospital based in the heart of the city is usually the first to deal with the overindulgence of the city centres revellers and paramedics waiting for callouts in the ambulance bays are apprehensive about the night ahead When I return at am on New Years Day every bed is full and the bays are empty A girl in a long black dress hitched above her knees limps through the main entrance helped by two friends Minutes later a young man stumbles through the gates and blearily asks where the entrance to AE is Blood is streaming from his nose and he is holding his left arm close to his chest He stops to throw up before crossing the car park to the entrance and a member of staff guides him through the doors Half an hour later an ambulance pulls into the bay and as the back doors open the slurred and expletivefilled demands of a man on a stretcher can be heard Alcoholrelated admissions put AE departments under severe pressure Recent estimates have suggested that up to three in every  patients attending AE in the UK are there because of alcohol  more at weekends Now some people are suggesting that more radical action needs to be taken Last Saturday Dr Cliff Mann president of the College of Emergency Medicine told the Observer that the   If more people knew that if they got drunk they were going to be arrested they wouldnt drink in the first place he said At the Royal Liverpool a paramedic waiting in the early hours for his next call attests to the scale of the problem A lot of people coming in now have been found drunk in the centre he says Theyve had accidents got into fights or most likely drunk so much they just cant control themselves Often they dont need AE help  they just need to sleep it off But then theyre drunk so they dont know what they need and just call us That kind of misuse of the emergency services has become a huge issue A lot of people treat the ambulance like a free cab service says Ged Blezard director of emergency services for the North West Ambulance Service citing a man in Manchester who rang to ask if he could book an ambulance for  in case he needed one due to drinking too much We definitely have our regulars says the paramedic outside the Royal Liverpool who asks to remain anonymous You can often guess from the area who its going to be and were on firstname terms with them They get absolutely hammered every weekend and thats normal for them Increasingly taxi drivers say they too are being asked to take partygoers to AE because of the waiting times for ambulances Dave Henley a blackcab driver in Liverpool is working on what will be his fifth New Years Eve Ive become a bleeding ambulance service over the past few years for drunk people whove just lost the plot he says as we drive down Dock Road towards the hospital early in the evening Ive literally had to scrape people up off the pavement and carry them to the hossy doors He recalls one incident when he was hailed by a girl sitting outside a pub She was absolutely hammered and started throwing up She was too drunk to tell me her address and seemed in a really bad way so I took her to AE as she would have had nowhere else to go Its always the same Early on they all come in me cab looking a million dollars with bottles of bubbly in their hands and then after midnight theyre falling over themselves getting into fights he says Several initiatives have sprung up over the past few years to provide temporary shelter for the intoxicated who are only in need of minor attention allowing AE to concentrate on more pressing cases In Cardiff city centre a chapel has been given over to a team of nurses and street pastors on Friday and Saturday nights over the past year to care for those found drunk on the streets In the seaside town of Southport in Merseyside an alcohol recovery centre known as the drunk tank led by   Southport and Formby clinical commissioning group has been set up to run over the festive season It can take up to  patients and is equipped with showers beds and health professionals Dr Alan Owens AE consultant and alcohol lead at Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust who helped to launch the centre says Its hard to say how much this has helped at this stage But the centre has been regularly taking drunk and disorderly people off the streets and if that means a few less drunk people in AE thats a good thing In my experience drunken people in AE can be among the most timeconsuming patients The verbal and physical abuse many AE staff face from drunken patients was one of the triggers for Manns proposal By the time most people are waking up on New Years Day five paramedic teams from the North West Ambulance Service have been assaulted by drunk patients This takes paramedics off the streets as they need to recover and speak to the police which then affects how we respond to more needy patients later on Blezard tells me Not long ago one paramedic was off work for several months with a fractured skull following an attack by abusive drunk patient One young man who asked not to be named had to be rushed to a London AE last weekend with a broken wrist after falling down the stairs at his friends house The following day he was shocked to discover that he had called a nurse trying to bandage his arm a bitch and refused to cooperate with doctors trying to xray his arm Its embarrassing and I feel really ashamed he said I have no idea how I got like that Ive never really been violent when drunk before so I dont why I lashed out that night Its scary He felt so bad about his behaviour that he called the hospital and asked if he could apologise to the nurse The level of abuse from some patients requires police intervention During the past few festive seasons the AE department at Manchester Royal Infirmary has had a police officer on site to deal with difficult behaviour because of the large number of times staff were having to call the police due to drunk patients being abusive or violent Jonathan Smith matron for emergency services in central Manchester said the officer had provided a huge source of support More than anything I think it was simply the presence of a police uniform that helped Its sad that you need a police officer to prevent people treating staff badly but this was the case and any difficult behaviour was dealt with much more effectively Lack of funding means the service is no longer operating and Smith is anxious about how the department will cope with difficult patients Although we have gone through training to deal with challenging behaviours there are some situations we just cant deal with Smith recalls incidents in which patients have thrown furniture at staff and threatened to hurt other patients or colleagues These are the times when we need police help Often the police dont respond fast enough to deal with the issues so they easily escalate While services decide how to cope with increasing numbers of drunk AE admissions many health professionals are urging individuals to take responsibility The people Mann is talking about are those who go out in the evening become appallingly drunk and need AE attention because they fell over choked on their own vomit or fell asleep and got hyperthermia says Dr Katherine Henderson an AE consultant at St Thomas Hospital London and a registrar at the College of Emergency Medicine who works closely with Mann Although she supports his proposal that more drunk people should be arrested she believes the key is for people to take responsibility before the emergency services become involved It often feels that people are not prepared to make any plans at the end of the evening to get safely home look after their friends and take control The existence of the AE as a safety net means people are not so careful We would plead with patients to ask themselves How can you control yourself How can you get home If you know you become aggressive and get into fights when you drink too much then dont do it It shouldnt be an excuse for bad behaviour A whole department can be deeply disrupted from just one drunk patient The aim is to stop people getting to that stage and that is the responsibility of the individual and their friends Weve had patient monitors smashed and staff threatened If you get to a stage where you hit a nurse in a hospital you should not drink like that again But for doctors the more serious issues around drinking are not focused on New Years Eve  or even the disorder often seen in city centres on Saturday nights Ninety per cent of hospital admissions related to alcohol are not weekend bingedrinkers but individuals with longterm problems caused by chronic consumption such as cirrhosis of the liver Professor Sir Ian Gilmore is a leading expert on liver disease and a former president of the Royal College of Physicians He says liver disease is one of the biggest health issues the NHS is facing and cause of an increasing proportion of deaths Most of that harm is being done behind closed doors at home he says not on the streets on Saturday nights Hours before the flood of drunk patients filled the Royal Liverpools AE I meet a yearold man sitting in the stillquiet ward after being treated for alcohol withdrawal symptoms John called an ambulance when his body began to shake so badly that he was unable to move He lives alone and has been off alcohol for two weeks although has suffered from alcohol dependence for almost  years and has had five visits to AE in the past year  the most recent being for a pulmonary embolism John is an example of the many patients for whom alcohol is part of a much more deeply rooted problem Gilmore says One of the challenges in AE is to distinguish between someone who is simply drunk and someone who has been drinking but also has a serious medical problem There is a tendency to blame every drinker for their predicament but there are  million people in this country dependent on or addicted to alcohol  which is an illness   may be legal but it is a drug of dependence and how we use it is a huge issue affecting society According to Gilmore alcohol is the single biggest factor in young men dying between the ages of  and  whether it be through accidents suicide or violence Weve got this macho drinking culture in this country where consuming huge amounts is often considered in some way heroic We do need a culture change but nobody has a magic bullet The easiest and quickest way to bring about a cultural shift is to get rid of cheap supermarket drink at pocketmoney prices and stop drink being available and heavily marketed  he says Peter Howarth is the manager of Dr Duncans a public house in Liverpool named ironically after William Henry Duncan the UKs first medical officer of health who was appointed to the role on New Years Day  From my experience alcohol is generally something people enjoy and use to relax and have fun There are the odd customers who get aggressive but as a manager you try and monitor people and intervene before they get to the stage of being disorderly As a city centre pub we have a nice mix of a hardcore regular crowd and also people merely passing through the city Most of them seem to just have fun When taxi driver Dave Henley picks me from AE at am we drive back through the Waterloo area down South Road a popular local runway of bars bordering the mouth of the Mersey It is hard to draw any firm conclusions from the scene that we find one man grapples a paramedic trying to remove him from the aftermath of a fight while a group of girls with their heels in their hands are huddling around a friend being sick But against the backdrop of blue flashing lights and loud music others are dancing and laughing When I get out at the end as the road meets the water a group of revellers are linking arms and happily singing Auld Lang Syne when their chants are cut short by the sight of a man shivering Unable to ascertain where the mans friends are someone starts to call  but then decides it would be quicker to take back him back down South Road where more ambulances are arriving
