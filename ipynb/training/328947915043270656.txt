Americas  million aging baby boomers are heading into retirement with more than their considerable wealth health and education They are also bringing into their golden years   that has yet to be recognized according to a recent Institute of Medicine report The notion that the elderly might be abusing or addicted to alcohol illicit drugs or prescription medications may strike some as improbable After all the common notion is that alcohol and substance abuse are for young people Dead wrong Baby boomers who came of age in the s and s when experimenting with drugs was pervasive are far more likely to use illicit drugs than previous generations For example a  study by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that among adults aged  to  the rate of current illicit drug use   Aside from alcohol the most commonly abused drugs were opiates cocaine and marijuana To get a sense of the magnitude of this looming mental health crisis consider that in  the best estimates are that six to eight million older Americans  about  percent to  percent of the overall elderly population  had   The number of adults aged  and older is projected to increase to  million from  million between  and  and the numbers of those needing treatment stands to overwhelm the countrys mental health care system Detecting drug or alcohol problems in the elderly is difficult in part because family members and clinicians alike are reluctant to ask about it Perhaps its just a form of ageism but drug abuse is not the first thing that pops into the mind of physicians when they encounter an older patient   Even when they make the connection doctors may fail to realize that even modest amounts of alcohol or drugs can be problematic Older patients have a significantly reduced ability to metabolize these substances as well as increased brain sensitivity to them And the cognitive impairments common with advancing age make selfreporting  as well as selfmonitoring  unreliable Not long ago a medical colleague referred a yearold woman to me with mild depression weakness and complaints of shortterm memory loss Her physician told her there was no clear medical explanation for her symptoms given that her physical exam exhaustive lab tests and brain MRI were all normal The problem I soon discovered was that her alcohol consumption had tripled since the death of her husband a year earlier She did disclose to her internist that she drank but minimized the amount She had turned to alcohol selfmedicating her grief but it only worsened her mood and impaired her memory typical of alcohols effects on the brain Numerous surveys document problematic drinking among the elderly For example a  National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that  percent of adults  and older reported binge drinking defined as having four or five drinks on one occasion in the past month while the rate of heavy drinking was  percent Given the increased sensitivity to the harmful effects of alcohol with aging the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommends that men and women aged  or older have no more than three drinks on any day and no more than seven drinks per week If you are curious if you might have a drinking problem you can take   Although alcohol is clearly the most commonly abused drug in the elderly nonmedical use of prescription drugs is a rapidly growing threat Some studies estimate that up to  percent of the elderly misuse prescription drugs with serious abuse potential most often antianxiety benzodiazepines like Klonopin sleeping pills like Ambien and opiate painkillers like Oxycodone   when it comes to nonmedical use of prescription medication  percent of women versus  percent of men  The elderly rarely use alcohol or drugs to get high drug or alcohol use that begins after age  appears fundamentally different Typically those who start use as teenagers or young adults tend to be sensationseekers with significant rates of psychiatric disorders and antisocial traits In contrast the elderly turn to alcohol and drugs to alleviate the physical and psychological pain from the onslaught of medical and psychiatric illness the loss of loved ones or social isolation  The problem is that these psychoactive drugs are all addicting and can impair cognitive functioning cause depression increase the risk of falling and interact dangerously with other medications Moreover drug and alcohol abuse in older patients occurs alongside other medical and psychiatric illnesses You cannot treat either problem in isolation  There is little doubt that we face a looming public mental health crisis in the aging population The question is whether we can meet this daunting challenge with the investment in research and mental health services it deserves
