With twothirds of American adults considered overweight a lot of people are trying to shed pounds It can be a challenging journey and many folks find that they get tripped up by a major obstacle themselves Here are some common ways dieters sabotage their own efforts We tell ourselves were either dieting or not and we veer from starving to overindulging The more you live in the extremes of all or none good or bad the more likely thats going to get you into difficulty says Gary Foster chief scientific officer for Weight Watchers International The key is that this is a lifestyle When its an onoroff diet or a boot camp mentality thats a shortterm behavior Its destined not to work out very well Sometimes when we overeat on a Friday night we figure weve blown the entire weekend This inevitably leads to a very remorseful and grumpy Monday morning Is there a better way I have my patients picture meals as individual bubbles throughout the day Pop them as you go along One isnt dependent on the other and you can keep your overall plan in place says Kelly Allison associate professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvanias Center for Weight and Eating Disorders When its a forbidden food youre more likely to overeat once you do have it says Foster A different approach is to figure out a way to incorporate that food into your life in moderation Keeping a stash in your kitchen may not work Even if say the cookies are doublewrapped in the freezer theyre going to call out to you when youre most vulnerable Instead when a craving hits try another tactic such as visiting the best bakery in town and savoring one or two cookies with a good cup of coffee If you give yourself permission but in reasonable portions and frequency thats where you strike a nice balance says Foster Theres nothing like a wedding or a school reunion to inspire a diet Often however as soon as the event is over we go back to an unhealthful eating pattern These shortterm changes produce shortterm weight loss Typically they involve more extreme forms of food restriction that cannot be maintained a sprint instead of a marathon which is what a healthier lifestyle really is says Allison Youre doing all the right things but when you stand on the scale the number makes you feel like a failure The solution here is simple Weigh in only once a week Your weight can fluctuate for a variety of reasons and checking it every day may not give you an accurate assessment Are your clothes getting looser Do you have more energy These are positive indicators that you are succeeding Let the scale be a guide but its not a judge Its not an arbiter of your success especially in the short term says Foster Being sleepdeprived appears to change how our brains respond to food Judgment and decisionmaking brain regions become blunted by sleep deprivation when making food choice decisions says Matthew Walker a psychology professor and sleep expert at UC Berkeley He explains that with too little sleep the brain structures that control our impulses and desires get out of whack Leave behind the oldfashioned notion of plain steamed undressed vegetables as the best way to go Thats boring and borders on punitive says cookbook author Mollie Katzen The Heart of the Plate Vegetarian Recipes for a New Generation She advises being creative Brush veggies with olive oil and singe them on the grill or roast in the oven Flavor them with sauces made from pulverized nuts herbs or roasted red peppers Add caramelized onions fresh lime juice garlic or chile peppers for more flavor Food needs to be delicious and desirable If the emphasis is simply on healthy people who are skeptical wont be pulled in says Katzen Brenda Davy a nutrition professor at Virginia Tech conducted a study with  middle aged and older adults dividing them into two groups on lowcalorie diets One group was instructed to drink two cups of water before meals We were interested in whether or not that would help them eat less and lose more weight over  weeks And in fact it did says Davy That group lost about  more pounds than the other group Most of us were taught to clean our plates when we were kids and the pattern has continued into adulthood A recent Cornell University study found that adults eat nearly all the food they serve themselves At restaurants ask for a togo box right when the meal is brought to the table and save half the food for another time At a buffet sample mini portions of a variety of dishes At home consider using a smaller plate You can fill it up and eat everything  without guilt Sometimes the people you live with and love are not thrilled when you start losing weight They might be afraid that your relationship will change If someone is tempting you with trigger foods you need to speak up says Allison Is there anybody who is bringing home doughnuts and waving them in front of your face How can you address that If they want those foods they can have them outside of the house There is some evidence to suggest that we dont want to be eating a lot late at night but that is very different from saying you cannot have a snack says Allison However she cautions that eating after dark may lead to a slippery slope Emotionally and physically were tired at night and were looking for comforting things Were more likely to choose the highercalorie foods than we are during the day Thinking ahead and portioning them out becomes really important
