The NHS needs to get better at highlighting the dangers of screening for diseases such as cancer say MPs  Screening picks up diseases early to improve the odds of survival or improve quality of life But the practice also leads to overdiagnosis and people having treatment for conditions which would never have caused harm  The Science and Technology Committee accused the NHS of poor communication on the issue Breastcancer screening became hugely controversial in    was set up to settle a fierce debate about whether the measure did more harm than good It showed that for every life saved three women had treatment for a cancer that would never have proved fatal As a result the leaflets given to women offered a mammogram included more information to give them an informed choice  However the Science and Technology Committee argues the lessons have not been learned by those overseeing other screening programmes  Andrew Miller the committee chairman said While screening can increase the likelihood of curing preventing or delaying the progression of disease for some patients for others it may lead to false results misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment   More needs to be done to ensure that both the benefits and risks are clearly and evenhandedly communicated so that people can make an informed choice about whether screening is right for them Conditions screened for include There are also newborn screening programmes including hearing checks as well as Downs syndrome and foetal anomaly screens during pregnancy Mr Miller continued Producing accurate concise and accessible public information on screening will always be challenging but the UK National Screening Committee must ensure there is standard process across the NHS for achieving this and facilitating informed choice There are hopes that screening could be extended to other diseases such as   and eventually prostate cancer  However the committee said the barriers to new screening programmes should remain high due to the delicate balance of risk and benefits  Prof Kevin Fenton director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England which oversees the NHS screening programmes said We welcome the findings of the Science and Technology Committees report which has identified a number of recommendations  We will now consider these recommendations in full The British Medical Associations Dr Richard Vautrey said Many GPs will share the Science and Technology Committees concerns about health screening As the BMA has repeatedly warned it is vitally important that people being invited for screening fully understand the pros and cons of the procedure  Patients must also be aware that there is a risk that false positive results could lead to unnecessary and potentially harmful further investigations Cancer Research UK was involved in the independent review of breastcancer screening  Jessica Kirby from the charity said Its vitally important that all screening programmes are based on the best possible evidence so people can be confident that screening is only offered where the benefits outweigh the harms  The report highlights the importance of ensuring people get the best possible information so they can make the decisions that are right for them
