People who think they didnt get sick from a nationwide meningitis outbreak caused by contaminated steroid injections used to treat back pain may want to think again Doctors at hospitals in Michigan did MRI scans of people who had been given tainted injections but didnt report symptoms of meningitis afterwards About  percent of the  people tested had suspiciouslooking MRIs and  ended up needing surgery to treat fungal infections in or around the spine The patients had gotten steroid injections about three months before the MRI in mid to late  Even though some of the people had increased back pain and other problems after the tainted injection quite a few hadnt gone to the doctor to report the symptoms before the researchers contacted them about getting an MRI The researchers think thats partly because people werent able to tell if the pain was caused by the back problems that led them to get the injection or from something new It may also be because the first people who got sick from the contaminated shots came down with   an inflammation of the tissue that wraps the brain Its the kind of lifethreatening illness thats hard to ignore At least  people died As the number of meningitis cases waned and people started coming down with spinal infections instead Its as if the meningitis cases were on a fast boil and the spinal infections were simmering on a back burner This screening method isnt perfect  percent of the patients screened had equivocal MRIs But screening with MRI may be a better option than treating all exposed people with high doses of antifungal medications according to an accompanying   Toxic effects of treatment include altered mental states hallucinations and liver damage The Food and Drug Administration   people who may have been exposed to medicines produced at the New England Compounding Center after May   to be alert for headaches fevers chills and other symptoms The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   MRIs for people who received contaminated injections and who had symptoms at or near the injection site The company produced about  different drugs most of which were injectables But the study authors who work at St Joseph Mercy Hospital the Veterans Affairs An Arbor Healthcare System and the University of Michican Medical School think that it would be better to screen all patients at risk whether theyve got symptoms or not The   were reported in   the journal of the American Medical Association
