Almost all companies that make animal drugs have agreed to change their labels to curb the use of antibiotics in cattle, pigs and other farm animals, the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday.. The move by the animal-drug industry complies with a voluntary initiative issued in December by the FDA. The agency took its action to stem the rise of dangerous drug-resistant bacteria, which have proliferated because of the drugs' overuse in hospitals and on farms, doctors say.
