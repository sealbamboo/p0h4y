The General Medical Council is to review an investigation into a senior executive at NHS England Dame Barbara Hakin   She has faced claims she endangered patients by ordering a hospital trust to meet performance targets whatever the cost while she was head of the East Midlands Strategic Health Authority Dame Barbara now national director for commissioning operations was cleared by the GMC in  after an investigation But that will now be reviewed Allegations of bullying and endangering patient safety had dogged Dame Barbara since  when she ran the East Midlands authority They relate in particular to the treatment of the former chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals turned whistleblower Gary Walker who lost his job after being told waiting time targets had to be met despite his concerns over patient safety A yearlong GMC investigation cleared Dame Barbara of  separate allegations in  all of which she had denied That investigation is now being reviewed but the GMC says Dame Barbara is not facing a fresh inquiry Documents seen by the BBC suggest the decision may in part be materially flawed  including concerns that the evidence gathered did not go far enough in relation to the allegations around patient safety  and say a review is in the public interest A General Medical Council spokesperson said We dont comment in detail on individual doctors But we can confirm that Dame Barbara Hakin is not under investigation by the GMC  We are however reviewing a decision made as part of our original investigation This process known as Rule  enables the GMC in certain circumstances to review a decision previously made
