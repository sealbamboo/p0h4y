Should so many women be taking statins  issued late last year   the number of Americans who are told to take these  lowering drugs But the recommendations dont distinguish patients by gender and a small increasingly vocal group of cardiologists believe thats a mistake Far too many healthy women are taking statins they say though some research indicates the drugs will do them little good and may be more likely to cause serious side effects in women If youre going to tell a healthy person to take a medicine every day for the rest of their life you should have really good data that its going to make them better off said Dr   a cardiologist at the University of California San Francisco and the editor of JAMA Internal Medicine Lowering cholesterol should not be not an end in itself she added and cholesterol may not play the same role in heart disease in women as in men You can have high cholesterol and still be really healthy and have a low risk of heart disease she said Although women represent slightly more than half of the population they have been vastly underrepresented in clinical trials of statins As a result evidence on the benefits and risks for women is limited Women tend to develop heart disease about  years later in life on average than men womens risk begins to equal that of men when they reach their mids Studies have found that healthy women who took statins to prevent cardiovascular disease did experience fewer episodes of   and had fewer treatments like stents and bypass surgery But statins didnt prevent healthy women from having their first heart attacks and didnt save lives  which included  women age  and older found a significantly lower risk of socalled soft endpoints like hospitalization for   among healthy women taking statins But the absolute number of these health setbacks was small and there was   in heart attacks strokes and deaths among these women By contrast male participants on statins had significantly fewer heart attacks and strokes The data are underwhelming to say the least said Dr   author of The Truth About   Risks and Alternatives to CholesterolLowering Drugs and an associate professor of medicine at Brown University Women who are healthy derive no benefit from statins and even those women who have established heart disease derive only half the benefit men do  director of the   at the CedarsSinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles disagreed We havent shown that we can prevent deaths because we just havent enrolled enough women and thats a crime she said But the absence of data is not the same as negative data In the meantime she said we can either sit on our hands or use our best judgment to make an educated guess and can decide to treat Dr Bairey Merz has had financial relationships with drug companies including Abbott Vascular BristolMyers Squibb and Gilead The debate has taken on added urgency because of the risks associated with statins which often are supposed to be taken daily for the rest of ones life The drugs have long been known to cause   in some people and more rarely liver and   as well as cognitive side effects like   and confusion In  Johns Hopkins researchers discovered that statins could in rare instances make the body produce   against its own proteins engendering a painful and debilitating muscle disease that actually   But the most common side effect is   In  researchers published a study showing that postmenopausal women who took part in the Womens Health Initiative  and diabetes itself increases the risk of heart disease considerably Despite the concerns women are heavy users of statins especially in midlife  when the gap in heart disease risk between men and women happens to be greatest Some  percent of women ages  to  take statins compared with  percent of men Over all  percent of men  and over take statins compared with  percent of women though   Even critics of statin use in healthy women say they would not hesitate to prescribe the drugs to patients with established heart disease But since cholesterol readings are increasingly used as quality indicators to rate physicians and health plans many younger adult women may feel pressured to take the medicine even though they are in good health some doctors say I have women come to me who were put on statins in their s by their physician because their cholesterol was a point or two above whats said to be normal Dr Roberts said This is insane But some healthy younger women certainly will go on to develop cardiovascular disease Dr Bairey Merz said and statins may help prevent it Im driving in my car Im perfectly healthy Why do I have my seatbelt on she asked To some extent the differences represent different philosophies Although the new treatment guidelines recommend lifestyle changes for lowering cholesterol Dr Bairey Merz said I think they should probably go out the window We have yet to find any kind of lifestyle change intervention that actually helps people live longer But Dr Roberts advises women that they can reduce their heart risk by watching their weight exercising and following a diet rich in fish fruits and vegetables nuts and olive oil  and if theyve never had heart trouble forgetting statins We know you can get the benefit and relative risk reduction from adhering to a Mediterraneanstyle diet she said
