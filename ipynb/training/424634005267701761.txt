In the quest for new treatments US researchers are looking to traditional Chinese medicines some of the oldest remedies in the world A recent discovery resulted in a better treatment for a type of leukemia that strikes about   in the US Another   found a potential new painkiller in Chinas medicine chest Other researchers are studying a traditional medicinal plant called thunder god vine for its anticancer properties The approach has already had some success The Chinese herbal medicine   for instance has gone on to become the most potent antimalarial drug available Not all the leads have panned out of course But the old field has shown enough potential to keep interest high A better leukemia treatment drawn from an ancient medicine should give us hope for developing anticancer drugs says   a   and professor of medicine and cancer specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital It gives a lot of optimism of seeking other types of cancer medicines in the Chinese pharmacopedia which many people are looking into Waxman says The treatment uses arsenic trioxide which has traditionally been used in Chinese medicine The US Food and Drug Administration approved arsenic trioxide sold as Trisenox here as   and later   that patients who received standard chemotherapy followed by arsenic trioxide did better than patients who just received standard chemotherapy But a   recently found that the drug in combination with alltrans retinoic acid  another drug commonly used to treat    turned out to be more effective than the usual chemotherapy That results means arsenic trioxide should become the new standard for patients that can use it says   director of the adult acute leukemia program at the DanaFarber Cancer Institute So this was a cure for leukemia without chemotherapy really for the first time in a large randomized trial says Stone Weve got a patient in the hospital right now whos receiving that very therapy He says there are still side effects from the new regimen affecting the skin and heart but for most people theyre less of a problem than the hair loss vomiting and diarrhea that can come with chemotherapy The arsenic trioxide treatment was developed by a Chinese doctor working in northern China during the Cultural Revolution according to Mount Sinais Waxman This doctor couldnt use much Western medicine so to treat his APL patients he started giving them arsenic trioxide intravenously He kept a journal for  years and noticed that it worked remarkably well He   with other collaborators That was one of the first examples of a targeted treatment in all of cancer Waxman says Other researchers are also   a natural product of a traditional Chinese medicinal plant called   or thunder god vine as a possible anticancer drug The product was   and scientists in the West are now studying exactly how it works says   one of the researchers and a professor of pharmacology and molecular sciences at Johns Hopkins University Traditional medicine will always remain a useful source of new drugs The question is to what extent Liu says Drug discovery and development is a very lengthy and costly process and there are always failures Research into Chinese medicine is no different Cancer reseachers at the University of Minnesota recently   to study a drug that was developed from triptolide for treating pancreatic cancer says   associate professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota He points out it took millions of dollars just to get to this point Its easy to think and normal to think that if people are using it already then it shouldnt require a lot to develop it into a useful product The problem is that our standard for what is safe and effective is very high appropriately Greeno says It looks like a pretty straight path but what you dont see are all the false starts and wrong turns that we make along the way Studying Chinese medicine for new treatments has had its share of wrong turns Western scientists previously looked into treatments for the     and   but concluded they werent particularly effective But the failures dont mean we should give up says   a professor of medicine at the University of Maryland who served as the principal investigator of two Chinese medicine research initiatives funded by the National Institutes of Health Chinese medicine is one lead to consider especially for chronic diseases that have yet to be cured The advantage you have when you look at some of the Chinese medicine therapies is that by and large they are safe as long as what youre getting doesnt have added ingredients Berman says We need to look at what other cultures have to offer and then we need to put them through a scientifically rigorous test
