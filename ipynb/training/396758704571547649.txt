Abuse of prescription painkillers is a   according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention On Oct  the Food and Drug Administration recommended putting new   sold as Vicodin and other brand names Dr Andrew Kolodny believes the restrictions are necessary and will prevent new people from developing addiction But he says there are millions who already have the disease and need access to effective treatment If they dont have access to legal sources for painkillers many of them will turn to the black market he tells NPRs Arun Rath And if they cant find blackmarket pills theyll buy heroin on the black market So while the abuse of painkillers has become a focus for concern the corresponding rise in heroin use is also prompting calls for action The number of people reporting heroin use in the previous year increased between  and    Meanwhile federal data from  finds that   of people who had used heroin in the past year had also previously abused prescription painkillers classified as opioids Opioids  derived from opium  include morphine oxycodone hydrocodone as well as heroin says Kolodny who is the chief medical officer for the national drug treatment network   and president of   Opioids share a similar molecule he says and when they attach to the brains opiate receptor they all cause a very similar effect They give both a positive reinforcement  the effect when you take the drug  but also very strong negative reinforcer which is that youll feel very sick when you dont have the drug he says Those two factors together make opioids extremely addictive Several years ago John Nygren says his teenage daughter started having trouble She would not come home in the evenings at times She was not going to school There were incremental steps along the way where we saw there were problems he says Nygren is a fourthgeneration Wisconsinite from the small town of Marinette He now represents the town in the   His daughter Cassie Nygren became addicted to the prescription painkiller OxyContin Eventually she was drawn to heroin  and overdosed on it in  Her mother found her on the bathroom floor struggling to breathe John Nygren says A needle was still in her arm Cassie Nygren hadnt been alone in that bathroom but those who were with her left when she overdosed Nygren says that was probably because they were afraid of the authorities getting involved The paramedics arrived in time to save her life but she has continued to battle addiction Shes been in and out of treatment and is currently serving time in county jail Now John Nygren is using his position to change things in Wisconsin He has   to give people legal protection when calling  about an overdose Its part of a package of bills to cope with the opioid crisis in his state According to the CDC the amount of prescription painkillers sold to pharmacies hospitals and doctors offices across the US   With the increase in prescribing what weve seen is that its led to parallel increases in rates of addiction and increases in rates of drug overdose deaths Kolodny says And its gotten so bad that the CDC is now telling us there are more people in the United States dying each year from drug overdoses than car crashes The United States is completely alone in this trend Kolodny says The United States has about  percent of the worlds population and   more than  percent of the worlds oxycodone supply Were also consuming more than  percent of the worlds hydrocodone he says In many cases the prescriptions are entirely legitimate says Dr Elinore McCanceKatz who specializes in addiction psychiatry and is   at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Opioid medications are effective pain relievers and used by the majority of people for that purpose Individuals do not become addicted to these medications when used as clinically prescribed she says But there are people who have vulnerability to addiction McCanceKatz says that opioid addiction is a chronic illness but fortunately very treatable As people get treatment  and that treatment includes medication and psychosocial treatments  they do recover she says In Glendale Calif yearold Preny Ebrahimi is on the other end of treatment In her familys apartment with her mother looking on she says she struggled in school with attention deficit disorder Around the time she was  or  Ebrahimi says she fell in with the wrong crowd First there was marijuana Then there were the prescription painkillers which were easy to find Then there was methamphetamine and one day she tried smoking heroin After that day I just fell in love with the feeling and the numbing pain and I just kept doing it and doing it and doing it she says And it just ate away at my life She says she was using every day every hour for about  months Eventually Ebrahimi bottomed out She had stopped using heroin on her own but that brought on withdrawal She stole her fathers car to meet a dealer and nearly ran over her father driving away When she got home her family confronted her Everybody was just trying to talk to me and I was going crazy because I didnt want to talk I just wanted to go be alone and do it she says They were like We dont know what else to do You need to stop  The pain became too much Ebrahimi says  for her family and for herself The high itself that numbing pain it was just not worth it anymore to put my family and myself through And I just wanted to stop she says Ebrahimis parents had her placed in juvenile detention and a judge mandated residential drug treatment at Phoenix House She stayed there for five months It has been a long road  one that has clearly taken a toll on her family But Ebrahimi has been clean and sober for almost three years She has a job now and plans to start college in the spring These years sober have been the best years of my life Ive gained so much trust back she says Its a feeling like no other honestly going through all that and being here right now a place youd never thought youd be
