This months government shutdown grew out of Republicans insistence on a budget that defunded the Affordable Care Act That didnt happen but Republicans still detest the law  and now theres a movement underway to oust Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius Whats unexpected is that the effort is being led by a senator from Sebelius home state Kansas Republican Pat Roberts  someone shes long had close family and professional ties to Sebelius had served six years as governor of Kansas before she came to Washington at the start of the Obama administration When she did so no one seemed prouder than Roberts It is a special and great opportunity for  a Kansan to be represented as a member of the presidents Cabinet Roberts said at Sebelius confirmation hearing in  Roberts described their special relationship going back decades But now more than four years later his tone has changed In a YouTube video last week Roberts responded to the troubled rollout of the new health insurance exchanges and the technical problems people have encountered while trying to sign up online Enough is enough he said Today I am calling on Kathleen Sebelius to resign her post as secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Sebelius has had three and a half years to launch Obamacare and she has failed Now its hardly news that a Republican member of the Senate is criticizing a Cabinet official from the Obama administration Whats interesting here is that Roberts is showing such animosity toward someone with whom he has had such a close relationship Its one that goes back to before either held public office says University of Kansas political scientist Burdett Loomis Theres this combination of the personal and the political Loomis says Pat Roberts began his political career working for Keith Sebelius congressman from western Kansas He subsequently succeeded Keith Sebelius in that job And Keith Sebelius a Republican is the fatherinlaw of Democrat Kathleen Sebelius As officeholders Loomis says Kathleen Sebelius and Roberts have long worked well together But he also notes that as Kansas has become a reliably red state its Republican Party has gotten much more conservative He adds that Obamacare is extremely unpopular there so theres plenty of motivation for Roberts to distance himself from  and even lead the effort against  an old friend Hes moving with the times Loomis says Hes doing what savvy politicians do And I think that as he approaches this next term  hell be  when he runs for reelection  I think that he doesnt want to have any impediments in his way Roberts does have a primary opponent in   Milton Wolf a Tea Party candidate who happens to be President Obamas second cousin As   Wolfs mother was Obamas grandmothers cousin and Wolfs and Obamas mothers were childhood friends in Kansas Wolf is considered a long shot but Loomis says Roberts appears to be taking no chances in the wake of Tea Party defeats of other veteran Republican senators such as Richard Lugar of Indiana Sebelius meanwhile has not responded to Roberts She has acknowledged that the launch of the HealthCaregov exchange website was rockier than we would have liked There was lots and lots and lots of interest and difficulty getting people on the site and getting them to the plans she said in Cincinnati this week But Sebelius got   from the White House And adding to her job security is the fact that nominating a new Health and Human Services secretary would mean another confirmation hearing  and another avenue for Republicans to attack the health care law
