Across the world the excessive consumption of sodiumhiding in breads soups and snack foods and beckoning from salt shakers everywhereis the cause of some  million deaths by heart disease and strokes yearly including roughly  premature deathsthose before the age of says a comprehensive new study Globally new research concludes that one in  cardiovascular deaths can be attributed to excessive sodium consumption and one in five of those among people younger than  The   conducted by an international team led by Dr Dariush Mozaffarian of Harvard Universitys School of Public Health was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine An invited   touted the study as a herculean effort to glean the effects of excess salt consumption in a broad population But citing the findings of two studies published alongside the global assessment University of Alabama vascular expert Dr Suzanne Oparil declared it too early for public health officials to take up the cudgels against dietary sodium Daily sodium intake averaged  grams per day across the globe and ranged upward to  grams Mozaffarians team found That level of consumption is well above the range that experts for the have concluded is idealas little as  grams per day for those with high blood pressure as well as diabetics African Americans and those  and older and as much as  grams for all others Diets high in sodium claimed their highest tolls in a band stretching from the countries of Georgia and the Ukraine and across Central Asia to Russia Mongolia and China with slightly lower death rates throughout Asia the study found It was lowest in Central America and the Horn of Africa The United States Canada and Europe where public health campaigns aimed at reducing sodium in foods are already underway lay roughly at the global midpoint with just more than  deaths per million attributed to high sodium intake The studys seemingly dramatic findings however belie continuing controversy over the value of efforts to reduce sodium intake across whole populations Among the points of contention is whether diets high in salt cause healthy people to develop high blood pressure or merely exacerbate the condition in those who have it In contemplating measures to reduce the sodium content in everyday foods public health officials are also wary of causing harm to patients including those with heart failure diabetes or chronic kidney disease for whom a diet very low in sodium can cause complications and lead to death Clinical trials have demonstrated that subjects who reduced their sodium intake lowered their blood pressure But despite extensive research debate and efforts at expert consensus the value of broad sodiumreduction campaignsas well as the targets such campaigns should aim to reachremain controversial A pair of studies published alongside the global assessment underscore the suspicion that in broad populations the relationship between sodium intake hypertension cardiovascular disease and death may be quite complicated  published Wednesday found a tenuous connection between sodium intake and hypertension A   found that over a roughly   year period those ingesting between  and  grams of sodium dailya span that reflects the global range of sodium intakewere less likely to die or suffer a heart attack or stroke than were those who consumed diets higher or lower in sodium In addition both studies suggested that for some dietary intake of the mineral potassium may play a role in reducing excessive sodiums ill effects The two studies appearing alongside the global assessment were conducted by researchers at McMaster Universitys Population Health Research Institute in Ontario Canada Both measured by indirect means the sodiumintake levels of more than  people from at least  countries In the first of those studies the link between levels of sodium intake and hypertension was most evident in older subjects in those who had the highest sodium intake and in subjects who had hypertension But in people who fell outside of these groups researchers found little discernible pattern a diet that was moderately high in saltjust under  grams a daywas not clearly linked to high blood pressure in this study And those consuming between  and  grams of sodium daily were only slightly more likely to have hypertension Those findings led Dr Oparil writing in the New England Journal of Medicine to conclude that more study is needed before public health campaigns aimed specifically at reducing sodium intake can be safely launched The three articles highlight the need to collect highquality evidence on both the risks and the benefits of lowsodium diets Oparil wrote in an editorial published by NEJM Wednesday Until clinical trials better flesh out the relationship among dietary sodium potassium hypertension and cardiovascular disease she wrote the results argue against a reduction of dietary sodium as an isolated public health recommendation That conclusion drew criticism from one public health expert who has worked with food manufacturing giants to reduce sodium content in widelyconsumed processed foods Given the very clear relation between sodium intake and higher blood pressure and evidence that reducing intakes reduces risk of cardiovascular disease I think the new findings do not change the basic conclusion that we should be moving toward lower sodium intakes said Dr Walter Willett of Harvard Universitys School of Public Health who was not involved in any of the newlypublished studies The exact optimal intake is not clear There is no question that some sodium is essential Willet added As a result he said while we move toward lower intakes we should be conducting additional research to better define the optimal level
