Shirley Mierzejewski was very upset when she found out her Medicare health insurance premiums will nearly double next year  I cannot afford that I cannot said Ms Mierzejewski  who lives in Euclid Ohio and works part time as a receptionist at a local college She has a private Medicare Advantage policy from Anthem which provides drug and medical coverage  So I started thinking about the marketplaces she said referring to the online insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act Maybe I could find something cheaper there  But after attending a Medicare meeting this month at the Euclid Senior Center she learned that the plans available on the exchanges are    and that includes those with Medicare   While thousands of Americans are trying to sign up for insurance on the exchanges Medicare counselors like Semanthie Brooks who spoke at the meeting Monday in Euclid are trying to steer seniors away They worry that Ms Mierzejewski and other older adults may not realize that Medicare is a pretty good deal compared to exchange policies and may try to buy one anyway   Exchange plan enrollment began on Oct  and runs through March The enrollment period for next years Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans  many offered by the same companies selling marketplace coverage  starts Tuesday and ends Dec   People are going to be inundated with marketing materials and commercials around both said Ms Brooks director of community advocacy at the Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging a social service agency in Cleveland She has been crisscrossing northeastern Ohio helping elderly residents sort out the differences when she visits community centers highend assisted living facilities and subsidized senior apartment complexes  They all want to know the impact of Affordable Care Act on Medicare she said  They want to know Should we sign up  To clear up confusion in Montgomery County Md officials held meetings at six centers for the elderly They want to know if they are better off in the exchange than in Medicare said Leta Blank director of the Montgomery County State Health Insurance Assistance Program Everyone is looking for a less expensive way to get health care  Finding the right drug or Medicare Advantage plan can be   Dozens of plans offer different benefits and cover different drugs from different pharmacies at different prices And you are supposed to review new plan offerings every year    So in a year in which the insurance market is being turned upside down here are some shopping tips for people with Medicare and caregivers  Are the exchange plans worth looking into if youre enrolled in Medicare      No with a few exceptions more about that later The state insurance exchanges are intended for people without health insurance those who might qualify for financial assistance subsidies or tax credits owners of small businesses and people who buy their own insurance The authors of the Affordable Care Act did not anticipate that anyone with Medicare would be interested in exchange coverage Medicare beneficiaries already get a pretty good deal said Joe Baker president of the Medicare Rights Center in New York City  The vast majority of Medicares  million beneficiaries pay no premium for Part A which covers hospitalization and other care Premiums for Part B for doctor visits and other outpatient services cover only  percent of the programs annual cost When the socalled doughnut hole or gap in drug coverage is finally closed for Part D Medicare beneficiaries will pay only  percent of the average bill for prescriptions  Do the exchanges sell Medigap plans    Alfredo Cuellar a retired overseas development specialist in Washington has Medicare and a supplemental or Medigap policy that fills in the gaps that Medicare doesnt cover including copayments and some deductibles His Medigap premium is going up  percent next year so he wants to look for a cheaper policy on the exchanges  He wont find one said Mila Kofman executive director of the District of Columbia Health Exchange Authority Exchanges dont sell Medigap policies They sell comprehensive insurance that covers medical and drug costs along with other essential health benefits required under the Affordable Care Act  Its never going to be less expensive than what a person gets under Medicare Part A and Part B said Ms Kofman the former insurance commissioner of Maine  Does Medicare coverage meet the Affordable Care Acts requirement that most adults have health insurance in      Yes and no  People enrolled in premiumfree Part A or a Medicare Advantage plan meet the requirement But the relatively small number  of Medicare beneficiaries who do not qualify for Part A  and have Part B only  do not meet the requirement   In order to receive premiumfree Part A coverage you must have worked at least  quarters  Recent immigrants or someone who is not eligible under another persons work history like a spouses will not be covered under Part A Part B coverage alone does not meet the criteria for health insurance  Can Medicare beneficiaries buy a plan on the exchange     No said Leslie Fried policy and programs director at the National Council on Aging in Washington It is illegal for someone who knows you have Medicare to sell you duplicate coverage The ban applies to the vast majority of people who have full Medicare coverage as well to those who have only Part A or only Part B  But there are some exceptions plans on the exchange can be sold to disabled people who are eligible for Medicare but have to wait two years for coverage to kick in Exchange plans can be sold to the very small number of people who currently pay Part A premiums however an exchange plan probably will ultimately cost more And should they decide later to rejoin Medicare these people may be subject to late enrollment penalties To further complicate matters there is nothing in most insurance applications on the exchanges to prevent someone with Medicare from buying coverage And there is nothing in the paper application not even a warning urging Medicare beneficiaries to think twice  I am very worried that without the right information people will drop Medicare and sign up Ms Kofman said The District of Columbia will be changing its eligibly screening system to prevent people with Medicare from buying coverage on the exchange but the fix will take a while to put in place Medicare beneficiaries who fill out New Yorks online exchange application will see a special message saying they will not be eligible for premium tax credits although other financial assistance may be available That doesnt mean you will be sold a policy Once the application is received it will most likely be rejected   Do people with Medicare need to reenroll or get new Medicare cards  No but some scammers have been telling the elderly that the Affordable Care Act requires them to do so In Ohio the state attorney general has received dozens of complaints about attempts at identity theft related to the ACA and aimed at Medicare beneficiaries said Kate Hanson a spokeswoman for the office   So should seniors just ignore the exchanges    No Ms Fried said They are a great excuse to call your grandchildren she said Tell them to get health insurance if they dont have it  For more information about the exchanges visit   or call  For
