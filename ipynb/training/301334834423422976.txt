When it comes to talking to teens about sex parents and teachers arent the only ones who are hesitant to broach the subject  doctors also tend to shy away from the sex talk In fact less than twothirds of physicians discuss sexual issues with their adolescent patients and even when they do the conversation only lasts for about  seconds according to   The study also found that female patients are twice as likely as male patients to discuss sexual matters with their doctors This may come as no surprise since girls talk to their doctors about matters like menstruation and pregnancy prevention as soon as they hit puberty while boys dont have a similar reason to see a doctor As a result men and boys get very little info about sex from their healthcare providers says   director of Mens Health Boston and associate clinical professor of urology at Harvard Medical Schools Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston This impacts their sense of masculinity their relationships sense of self and enjoyment of life Plus it puts them at a higher risk of STDs and accidental pregnancies So why arent doctors talking to boys and men about sex Here are three common reasons plus five things boys and men   know about hitting the sheets Our culture including doctors is still uncomfortable and awkward when it comes to discussing sexuality says Morgentaler So unless the patient brings it up the doctor likely wont mention it  young women between the ages of  and  are more likely than young men of the same age to see a doctor regularly And that trend continues as boys get older Men tend to only see their doctors if theyve broken something says Morgentaler The reason may have something to do with outdated gender beliefs According to  men who hold traditional masculine views including that they should be selfreliant are less likely to get help for medical problems than guys with more modern views Teaching young men about what to expect sexually and whats normal or not isnt a standard part of medicine says Morgentaler Theres now an attempt to get human sexuality into the medical curriculum but its relatively new not well funded and not a high priority for medical students As a result its more common for the sex talk to happen in school But research shows that there are gaps in this education For example only about half of adolescent males receive instruction about birth control in their schools sex ed courses according to   Whether youre  or  heres what you   know about getting it on Males start getting erections as early as when theyre in the womb says Morgentaler And normal healthy young men get three to five erections per night Its easy for guys to watch porn and then feel like they dont measure up in the bedroom but its important to remember that in real life people dont look talk or behave like the actors in these movies says Morgentaler Men have just as many emotional and psychological needs as women Once a man has feelings for his partner he cares deeply for that person and he cares as much about being a good sexual partner as he does about his own pleasure says Morgentaler If youre in a situation where you feel nervous or anxious you may not be able to get an erection  and thats quite common says Morgentaler So its a good idea to wait until you feel comfortable with your partner before having sex Male sexuality is a beautiful thing says Morgentaler And the more you learn about it the more you can walk through life feeling good Â
