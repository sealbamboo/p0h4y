A Mississippi baby who was infected at birth appeared to remain clear of the virus for nearly two years even though she was not taking prescribed antiretroviral drugs Although medical staff called it a   when they learned earlier this year that the virus had returned to detectable levels the young patients experience seemed to suggest a possible weakness in the virus Specifically the use of a powerful threedrug cocktail very soon after birth appeared to substantially reduce HIVs infamous   and slowed its ability to gain a foothold On Monday the National Institutes of Health announced the start of a global clinical trial in which newborns infected with the virus that causes AIDS will be given medication within two days of birth The Mississippi baby received antiHIV therapy  hours after birth The childs mother stopped treatment after  months After two years the infected youngsters will be taken off the medication and stay off it for as long as the virus remains undetectable in their blood They will be closely monitored through at least age  Our hope is that some of them or perhaps one of them will stay in remission or be cured said Dr Yvonne Bryson a pediatric infectious disease expert at the David Geffen School of Medicine and Mattel Childrens Hospital at UCLA and a cochair of the trial Even if we find that a lot of these babies might have the virus rebound well learn a lot about how long its been gone and also whether or not we would add in a vaccine or another drug to make the remission even more prolonged The exact reasons why some HIVinfected mothers give birth to infected babies while others dont remains unclear  especially when those infections occur in the womb According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expectant mothers who have HIV can reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to their babies to less than  if they take antiretroviral medication However not all infected women realize they have the virus Others may suffer substance abuse mental illness or limited access to healthcare that prevents them from taking medication experts say In those cases roughly  in  of their offspring will also become infected with HIV The trial which is being conducted by the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Group will involve up to  babies and their HIVinfected mothers Participants are being enrolled in at least nine nations including the United States Argentina Brazil Thailand Haiti and South Africa The trial called IMPAACT P is jointly funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development both parts of the NIH It is much better to prevent a baby from being born with HIV than to treat a baby who is born infected said NIAID Director Dr Anthony Fauci in a prepared statement The global health community has proven strategies for preventing mothertochild HIV transmission but unfortunately they have not yet been implemented or adopted universally That is why we must conduct this trial Infants can become infected prior to birth during birth and afterward  usually as a result of nursing or prechewing food for the infant Researchers know least about how HIV infection occurs prior to birth Although one of the purposes of the placenta is to defend a fetus against bloodborne pathogens HIV somehow gets through in a small number of cases Bryson said that infants most likely become infected during birth because they are swallowing infected fluids during delivery The amount of virus in the mothers system was also a key factor influencing newborn infection The more virus the mother has the more likely shell infect the baby Bryson said Thats for sure We know that According to the NIH the study team will separately track babies who are breastfed and those who are formulafed due to the potential of reinfection from nursing The Phase III proofofconcept trial was modified only slightly after researchers detected the virus in the Mississippi baby Bryson said We made some very minor changes in the study design Bryson said Even though people were disappointed that the Mississippi baby rebounded the fact that the child was off antiretrovirals for  months was unheard of Early treatment of that baby still made a tremendous difference on the amount of virus in the body
