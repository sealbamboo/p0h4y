If you're sneezing and sniffling, you could also have a problem eating some fruits and veggies. It's called .  (OAS), and the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America estimates up to a third of pollen allergy patients may be affected. You can blame a protein found on the surface of some raw produce, including apples, tomatoes, and cantaloupe, though each pollen allergy has its own set of . . "Pollen and food proteins are like first cousins," says Cliff Bassett, MD, founder of Allergy and Asthma Care in New York City. "So your body thinks you're swallowing pollen." This usually leads to bothersome symptoms, like an itchy throat and mouth as well as cough. Peeling produce may help to reduce your reaction, Dr. Bassett says. Even cooking the produce may help. Just be careful—research shows about 2% of people with OAS have symptoms than can progress to potentially life-threatening anaphylactic shock, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America..

Soft contact lenses especially are prone to absorbing airborne irritants, like pollen or smoke, because they're permeable. A soft lens lets more oxygen through but can absorb anything in the tears, says Steven Shanbom, MD, a board-certified ophthalmologist out of metro Detroit. If you're set on wearing contacts and don't like hard lenses, you may want to look into disposable ones you can throw out daily to prevent pollen buildup..

You're not alone. . , and red wine in particular, can make allergies go haywire. "Some people are very sensitive to the sulfites, and it makes their allergies a lot worse," Dr. Rosenstreich says. These compounds occur naturally in both beer and wine. A Danish study in .  found that women who had .  were 78% more likely to develop a perpetually stuffy nose compared to women who drank less.. Walking down the allergy meds aisle at the pharmacy can prove overwhelming—there are dozens of drugs to choose from and they all promise to cure your sniffles and sneezing. But most of them can be lumped into one of two categories: antihistamines and decongestants. The trick is knowing which .  will best treat your symptoms. An antihistamine typically relieves sneezing, itchiness, and runny nose, while decongestants combat congestion from swollen nasal passages. Some drugstore options may come packaged with both, but you would only need to use a decongestant if your nose is stuffed up in addition to your other symptoms.

"Chlorine is an irritating gas and will do the same thing that fumes will," Dr. Rosenstreich says. "If you can smell it, that means it's getting in your body." Indoor pools are worse than outdoor ones because the chlorine is contained to a smaller space..

                  .  . That delicate wool sweater you wear three times before washing? It's terrible for your allergies. Clothes—especially those made from rough or sticky fabrics like wool—cling to dust and pollen. Washing after every wear is essential during allergy season, says Dr. Rosenstreich, so you'd be better off stocking up on duds made from cotton or other easily cleaned materials. You may also consider washing your wardrobe in hot water—people who .  had fewer allergens on their clothes than those who cleaned items in colder water.

                  .  . Pollen doesn't just cling to your clothes. It also sticks to skin and hair. "The tiny particles land on you like dust," Dr. Rosenstreich says. "The problem with pollen is that you can't see it in the air." If you're waking up stuffed every morning, taking a shower before bed will help wash away the allergens attaching to your body.

Drizzly and overcast days can also be an allergy foe: .  in the air, causing it to rupture and disperse the tiny particles. Stormy days are the most friendly to allergy sufferers: the heavy rain washes the pollen out of the air, providing temporary relief..
