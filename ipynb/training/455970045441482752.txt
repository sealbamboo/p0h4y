Weve all heard the advice to eat more whole grains and cut back on refined starches And theres good reason Compared with a diet heavy on refined grains like white flour a diet rich in whole grains  which includes everything from brown rice to steelcut oats to    is linked to lower rates of heart disease certain cancers and Type  diabetes   So when it comes to choosing bread experts say you want to move away from the white loaves in the grocery aisle Thats because white flour is a    like sugar That white bread is going to digest much more quickly leading to a surge and crash in blood sugar that may stimulate hunger later in the meal but also raise risk for diabetes and heart disease says physician   of Boston Childrens Hospital As I   in a recent series on fat refined carbohydrates like white flour can worsen blood cholesterol levels compared with saturated fat But when you start looking for alternatives its worth noting that not all loaves labeled whole grain or whole wheat are created equal And thats because wheat is milled in different ways Most wheat is processed into refined flour That means its three main components are separated out The starchy endosperm ends up as the flour The germ and bran are discarded and used for other things Many whole wheat and whole grain breads are made from this kind of flour  with some or all of the bran and wheat germ added back Technically as long as the three parts are present in the flour in the same relative proportions as in the intact grain its considered a whole grain Heres the official   from the Food and Drug Administration But wheat can also be milled in a way that leaves fragments of the whole grain intact  think traditional grinding stones And theres a difference between how your body metabolizes grains that are still intact and grains that have been refined and reassembled Experts say its certainly better to opt for any kind of whole grain loaf over white bread But if bread lovers want to put the brakes on the rise and fall in blood sugar perhaps the best options are loaves that contain chunks of grain still intact  like bits of wheat kernel rye or millet Often when it comes to processing foods less is more Ludwig tells us Whole foods minimally processed foods certainly whole grains take awhile to digest They have to travel down the intestinal tract and the sugars are slowly absorbed out of that whole grain so that blood sugar and insulin levels rise only modestly he says He points to one small   published back in the late s where researchers found that increasing the proportion of whole grains or coarse cracked wheat in breads led to a more favorable glucose response in people with diabetes And over the long term eating whole grains instead of highly refined grains may help reduce the risk of Type  diabetes Artisanal bakers like Dan Gottfredson who operates a   bakery in Rockville Md is well aware of the trend toward more whole foods And he says bread fits into this trend So its not a surprise that his bestselling breads of the day are crunchy highfiber loaves such as his whole wheat   which is loaded with sunflower seeds pumpkin seeds and wholegrain millet If you listen to my story youll hear that increasingly there are more whole grain options in the grocery aisle too Examples include grain breads rye breads or loaves topped with cracked oats
