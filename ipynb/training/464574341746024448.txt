A key difference in the brains of male and female MS patients may explain why more women than men get the disease a study suggests Scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in the US found higher levels of protein SPR in tests on the brains of female mice and dead women with MS than in male equivalents  Four times more women than men are currently diagnosed with MS  Experts said the finding was really interesting  MS affects the nerves in the brain and spinal cord which causes problems with muscle movement balance and vision It is a major cause of disability and affects about  people in the UK  Abnormal immune cells attack nerve cells in the central nervous system in MS patients  There is currently no cure although there are treatments that can help in the early stages of the disease  looked at   where people have distinct attacks of symptoms that then fade away either partially or completely About  of people with MS are diagnosed with this type Scientists studied the blood vessels and brains of healthy mice mice with MS and mice without the gene for SPR a blood vessel receptor protein to see how it affected MS severity   They also looked at the brain tissue samples of  people after they had died  They found high levels of SPR in the areas of the brain typically damaged by MS in both mice and people  The activity of the gene coding for SPR was positively correlated with the severity of the disease in mice the study said  Scientists said SPR could work by helping to make the bloodbrain barrier in charge of stopping potentially harmful substances from entering the brain and spinal fluid more permeable  A more permeable barrier could let attacking cells which cause MS into the central nervous system the study said Prof Robyn Klein of the Washington University School of Medicine said We were very excited to find the molecule as we wanted to find a target for treatment that didnt involve targeting the immune cells  This link between MS and SPR is completely new  it has never been found before Prof Klein said she did not know why the levels of SPR were higher in women with MS adding she had found oestrogen had no acute role  She would be looking at taking her findings to clinical trials in the next few years she added  Dr Emma Gray of the MS Society said We dont yet fully understand why MS affects more women than men and its an area thats intrigued scientists and people with MS for many years  A number of theories have been suggested in the past including the influence of hormones or possible genetic factors  and this study explores one such genetic factor in further detail which is really interesting  She said understanding the causes of MS was a priority for the MS Society in the UK and could be crucial in finding new treatments  The research was published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation
