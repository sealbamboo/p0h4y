Watching action films may make you more likely to pile on the pounds according to US researchers Previous studies have suggested a link between television and obesity but the team at Cornell University tried to establish which genres of television were worst  The findings   showed people snacked far more during action films  The authors said people should avoid snacking while watching television TV   because of junkfood advertising sedentary behaviour and distracting people so they do not realise how much they are eating  The study followed  students who were given bowls of chocolate biscuits carrots or grapes while watching television The scientists then compared how much food was consumed during the  action movie The Island with a show based on onetoone interviews  They demonstrated that people had nearly had twice the amount of food by weight and consumed  more calories during the film  The difference was more pronounced in men than women The report says TV may lead distracted viewers to mindlessly eat past the point at which a person would usually stop When counselling patients physicians should stress the dangers of overeating while watching TV They may want to warn in particular against the potential effect that highly distracting content such as action movies may have on overeating When watching highly distracting TV content it may be best to avoid snacking
