Medicare spent more than  million in  on questionable HIV medication costs the inspector general of the US Department of Health and Human Services said in an investigation published Wednesday The possible fraud schemes were all paid for by Medicares prescription drug program known as Part D Among the most egregious The inspector generals   raises new questions about Medicares stewardship of Part D A ProPublica series last year showed that Medicares lax oversight enabled doctors to prescribe     and   Part D cost taxpayers about  billion in  Previous inspector general reports have criticized the way Medicare oversees doctors and pharmacies but this one focuses on patients who are not usually the focus of inquiries into fraud and abuse The investigation flagged  Medicare beneficiaries who received HIV medications worth  million in  This figure does not include beneficiaries who appeared to be taking the drug Truvada for HIV prevention More than half the patients identified had no diagnosis of HIV had no records of laboratory tests to monitor the use of the drugs and had not received any medical services from any of the prescribers Two pharmacies both in Miami dispensed drugs to  of the beneficiaries Most of them were women with an average age of  two decades older than the typical patient who received HIV drugs in Medicare These two pharmacies collected more than  for the drugs the inspector general reported While some of this utilization may be legitimate all of these patterns warrant further scrutiny the report says These patterns may indicate that a beneficiary is receiving inappropriate drugs and diverting them for sale on the black market They may also indicate that a pharmacy is billing for drugs that a beneficiary never received or that a beneficiarys identification number was stolen The analysis did not say if beneficiaries were complicit in the questionable activity or if their IDs had been used without their knowledge or permission Medicare places a premium on getting patients their medications in a timely way particularly for conditions such as HIV HIV drugs pose a thorny problem for Medicare Under the programs rules the drugs are a protected class Insurance companies paid to administer Part D for the government must cover them without exception and cannot require prior approval for patients Insurers are freer however to manage other drugs and can impose restrictions to control spending prevent overuse and spot fraud The unscrupulous have tried to exploit the special status of HIV drugs leading to a number of recent prosecutions against pharmacy owners and others Sometimes pharmacies bill for the drugs do not dispense them and then bill Medicare or private insurers for them again Beneficiaries may be misusing HIV drugs too the inspector general noted that some medications have psychoactive effects or enhance the effects of painkillers The amount of suspicious activity involving HIV drugs is small relative to the overall usage of these medications Medicare paid  billion to supply HIV drugs to  beneficiaries in  In addition to patients receiving HIV drugs without a history of HIV other areas of possible fraud include patients receiving excessive doses of HIV drugs patients receiving an excessive supply of an HIV drug patients whose prescriptions were filled by a large number of pharmacies patients receiving prescriptions from multiple prescribers and patients taking HIV drugs that are not supposed to be taken together Fully  percent of beneficiaries with questionable utilization patterns lived in Miami or New York a rate three times higher than the percent of patients receiving HIV drugs who live in those cities One yearold in Miami received  in HIV drugs in  He received  different HIV medications in a single month Several times during the year he received these drugs from two different pharmacies on the same day the report says The inspector general recommended that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services take steps to rein in fraud and abuse of HIV drugs including using prescription data to look for aberrant behavior among beneficiaries The report says health plans should be required to conduct reviews looking for unusual patterns of HIV medication use It also encourages Medicare to expand the ability of health insurers to put controls in place and restrict certain beneficiaries to a limited number of pharmacies or prescribers Officials at CMS said they generally agree with the recommendations and said it would be up to Congress taking steps to limit the number of pharmacies or prescribers for beneficiaries who appear to be abusing drugs or engaging in fraud
