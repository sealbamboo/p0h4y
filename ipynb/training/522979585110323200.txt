 the most decorated US Winter Olympian of all time was practicing for the  Games when he learned he had exerciseinduced  It obviously didnt destroy the sporting career of the eighttime medalist And now he is the public face of a program to raise awareness about the condition which affects more than  million Americans I was always active as a child My dad tried to place me in every sport imaginable I had so much energy he wanted to push me in a direction where that energy was used appropriately to keep me out of trouble and focused while I was in school I was an avid swimmer and was state champ at age  I wanted to play football or be a boxer but my dad didnt want that because of all the impact But in  I was watching short track and it was obscure but they looked like superheroes in their tight outfits and I thought it was amazing I wanted to do that I made the national team at  Id always been competitive when it came to crunch time I always wanted to win and Ive been a racer at heart Being next to someone else pushes me to go above and beyond what I thought possible I never had one day that I didnt want to be on the ice because I always had an objective for that day I had a rigorous plan and schedule in place that I had to adhere to It was a stepbystep process of slowly but surely inching toward the Olympic Games and using every day as a series of goals to be accomplished Anything that I do I pursue  I cant help but give it my all And it was great to win because it was something that was totally out of my element I was being judged for the first time in my life not just questing for the fastest time I think my athletic conditioning helped You dance with your partner six to  hours a day every day The training made that easier to tolerate It somewhat came out of the blue I was diagnosed in  Id already been competing but didnt even know I had it until the team doctors told me A lot of the symptoms I had I attributed to me just training hard every day I had tightness of my chest difficulty breathing and decreased endurance The coughing was an issue as well Im using an inhaler now and it works as a preventive measure It boosted my confidence because then I knew I could work at the best of my ability About  million Americans have EIB and dont even know it The program is called EIB All Stars   and we want to encourage people to go to the website to get more educated about what it is There is a contest running until Feb  for people to tell about how it has affected their lives and the winner is flown to LA to have dinner with me We want to encourage people to effectively reach for their physical activity goals I love seeing people who are active and want to help promote that Im proof that you dont have to let something like this hold you back
