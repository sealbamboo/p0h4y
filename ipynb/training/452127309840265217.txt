
 Fruit compotes make great compromise desserts theyre sweet but not as sweet as sorbets and like sorbets they dont require flour butter or pastry skills I didnt develop any kind of knack for pastry until I began collaborating with pastry chefs on their cookbooks but for years I managed to round out my dinner parties with fruitbased desserts  though the children of my friend Clifford Wright used to roll their eyes when I brought dessert  She doesnt bring dessert she brings fruit theyd say  I revisited some of those desserts this week particularly various fruits poached in wine and  I still find them delightful I find that Im sometimes negligent about eating fruit in the colder months but not when I have some winepoached pears bananas or prunes in the refrigerator I am as likely to stir the fruit with its luscious syrup into my morning yogurt as to eat it for dessert and the compotes are good keepers Early spring is an inbetween time for fruit Stone fruits arent ready yet and its not really apple pear or citrus season either though all of those fallwinter fruits are still available I poached pears in red wine and bananas in white wine and used dried fruits for two of my compotes prunes poached in red wine and a driedfruit compote to which I also added a fresh apple and pear For the last compote of the week I combined blood oranges and pink grapefruit in a  refreshing citruscaramel syrup and topped the fruit with pomegranate seeds Even if my friends kids wouldnt agree this was definitely dessert  Reducing the soaking time in this French bistro classic saves flavor  Dont overcook the bananas in this easy dish and youll be rewarded with a fragrant delicious dessert  A classic French dessert with liqueur that adds a deep berry essence  An alcoholfree compote with a variety of dried fruit and a bright flavor  A refreshing dessert that keeps well for a few days
