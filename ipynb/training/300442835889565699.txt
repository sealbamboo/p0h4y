challenging causal inferences Sanjay Kaul MD and George A Diamond MD of CedarsSinai Medical Center in Los Angeles wrote in an invited commentary A recent crosssectional study suggested a possible link between neovascular agerelated macular degeneration and routine aspirin use but other studies have yielded conflicting findings To prospectively examine this potential link Wang and colleagues analyzed data from the Blue Mountains Eye Study which included  Australians ages  and older Retinal examinations were done every  years and lesions classified as neovascular or wet macular degeneration or geographic atrophy also known as dry macular degeneration Aspirin use was reported on a structured questionnaire and information on relevant risk factors was obtained during physical examination and history reports A total of  participants were regular aspirin users Compared with nonusers they were older and more often had conditions such as diabetes cardiovascular disease or elevated blood pressure During  years of followup agerelated wet macular degeneration was identified in  individuals Among regular users the cumulative incidence was  percent  percent and  percent at years   and  while the incidence among nonusers was  percent  percent and  percent respectively The incidence of neovascular macular degeneration rose with more frequent aspirin use increasing from  percent in those who never took aspirin to  percent for those who used it only occasionally and  percent for those who took aspirin routinely Aspirin use was not associated with risk for geographic atrophy Additional secondary analyses found that the risk was four times higher in patients with a history of CVD and in those without a polymorphism on   a gene involved in the complement pathway that has been linked with macular degeneration The researchers also considered whether other medications often taken by aspirin users such as acetaminophen and betablockers might influence risk and the results were negative These results create a quandary for the many patients using aspirin particularly those taking the drug as secondary prevention of CVD according to Wangs group Aspirin is one of the most effective CVD treatments and reduces recurrent CVD events by onefifth they observed However significant adverse events can occur such as cerebral and gastrointestinal bleeding Our present study now raises the possibility that the risk of neovascular agerelated macular degeneration may also need to be considered they stated Nonetheless they conceded that the risk is small at slightly under  percent over  years and the evidence is thus far insufficient to support a change in practice away from widespread aspirin use except for patients at very high risk for macular degeneration Any riskbenefit analysis also must consider the availability of effective  but expensive  treatments for neovascular agerelated macular degeneration Any decision concerning whether to stop aspirin is thus complex and needs to be individualized they wrote Limitations of the study included the possibility of confounding by indication and a lack of information on the reasons why participants were taking aspirin In their invited commentary Kaul and Diamond wrote These findings are at best hypothesisgenerating that should await validation in prospective randomized studies before guiding clinical practice or patient behavior They also advised that the choice of whether to use aspirin should focus on whether the indication is for secondary CVD prevention where the benefits of aspirin are indisputable and greatly exceed the risk or for primary prevention where the evidence is less clear as well as the extent of the persons risk for macular degeneration and bleeding In the final analysis decisions about aspirin use are best made by balancing the risks against the benefits in the context of each individuals medical history and value judgments they added Other experts such as Shawn Wilker MD of University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland agreed on the importance of individual risk I think a reasonable circumstance when you could ask a patient not to take aspirin might be one in which there is a very low risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease or if that person is at very great risk of losing vision from macular degeneration Wilker said in an interview Journal editor Kenneth E Covinsky MD also weighed in in an editors note stating that as with many good studies the data are not definitive enough to suggest changes in clinical practice Rather we hope the study galvanizes more research on the relationship between aspirin and macular degeneration Covinsky wrote Source
