More than a halfmillion Americans every year have an   the most common form which disrupts blood flow to the brain And at least a quarter of these cases have no apparent underlying cause Now two major studies suggest that many of these strokes of unknown origin  up to a third  may stem from atrial fibrillation a common irregularity of the heartbeat that often goes unrecognized The findings are likely to encourage doctors to look more aggressively for signs of atrial fibrillation in patients who suffer strokes of unknown cause After such strokes doctors usually prescribe a mild blood thinner such as lowdose aspirin But aspirin alone may not be enough to prevent additional strokes in patients with underlying atrial fibrillation These patients generally require more powerful anticoagulant medications to prevent clotting that can lead to additional strokes Stroke patients are generally screened with electrocardiographic monitoring for  hours to rule out atrial fibrillation But the new studies published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine suggest that some patients may need their hearts monitored much longer to detect abnormal rhythms One of the   which was funded by the Canadian Stroke Network and known as the   found that atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in five times as many patients who wore special heart monitors for  days compared with those who underwent conventional hour testing The second   led by researchers in Italy and carried out at clinics in the United States and other countries found that a third of patients who had had strokes of unknown cause and were followed for up to three years experienced at least one episode of atrial fibrillation  and in most cases there were no obvious symptoms In both studies the longer monitoring periods resulted in significantly more patients being prescribed anticoagulants to lower their risk of another stroke If more patients with atrial fibrillation can be detected then more patients can receive appropriate stroke prevention therapy and the hope is that more strokes deaths disability and dementia can be avoided said Dr David Gladstone an associate professor in the department of medicine at the University of Toronto and the lead author of the Embrace trial Some medical centers monitor patients beyond the usual  hours and in May the American Heart Association   to say it was reasonable for patients with unexplained strokes to be monitored for  days But longer monitoring hasnt been the standard of care said Dr Hooman Kamel a neurologist at the Brain and Mind Research Institute at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York who was not involved in the new research I think these two studies are really what was needed to put it on very firm footing and to make it more widespread Dr Gordon F Tomaselli the chief of cardiology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a past president of the heart association said the findings would reinforce the notion that if you dont have a good reason for a stroke you really need to take a pretty intensive look for atrial fibrillation Nationwide about three million Americans have a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation which occurs when erratic electrical signals cause the hearts upper chambers the atria to contract abnormally The fluttering can cause blood to pool in the atria forming clots that can then travel to the brain At least one in six strokes are attributed to atrial fibrillation and they are often more debilitating and deadly than strokes stemming from other causes But atrial fibrillation can be difficult to detect The episodes are typically sporadic coming and going unpredictably and lasting minutes or days at a time Some people experience heart palpitations shortness of breath and dizziness But many experience no symptoms at all What we are learning is that many patients have clinically silent atrial fibrillation said Dr Gladstone who is also a scientist at Sunnybrook Research Institute in Ontario Often the first manifestation is when it leads to a stroke In the Embrace trial which was carried out at  medical centers in the Canadian Stroke Consortium Dr Gladstone and his colleagues followed  people who had had either a stroke or a ministroke whose cause remained unclear after a battery of diagnostic tests About half of the patients wore a conventional device known as a Holter monitor which recorded their heart rhythms for an additional  hours But the rest were assigned to wear a new chest electrode belt for  days after they went home Atrial fibrillation was detected in just  percent of the patients monitored short term and in  percent of those who wore the new device for one month Among the patients monitored for  days was William Russell  a retired businessman from Collingwood Ontario Mr Russell suffered a major stroke two years ago during a ski trip with his family in Calgary There was no prior warning  it just hit he said My left side became completely paralyzed and my speech was slurred Fortunately my daughter noticed it immediately and called  At the hospital doctors gave Mr Russell a powerful clotbusting drug that reversed his stroke But their next challenge was to find what had caused it They took scans of his heart and his brain and did an electrocardiogram to measure the electrical activity of his heart but the cause remained unknown Mr Russell was enrolled in the study and after a month of wearing the electrode belt day and night his doctor was able to make a proper diagnosis His heart monitoring revealed that he was having silent episodes of atrial fibrillation Dr Gladstone said As a result weve been able to treat him with anticoagulant medication Mr Russell said that he was doing well on his new medication and had returned to hiking cycling and playing golf Wearing the monitor for  days was a bit of a pain he said But it was worth it Well worth it
