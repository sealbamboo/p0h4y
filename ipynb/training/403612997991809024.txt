The patient lean and in his s was in the hospital for the second time in a month with blood sugar levels that were out of control and he was not happy Despite the nurses earnest attempts to cheer him up he scowled and insisted that all he needed was for us to fix it so he could go back home  We have to keep looking because you may have other serious problems that caused your blood sugar to go up I said preparing to rattle off a list of potential causes You bet I have other problems Doc he growled back I watched the color in his face rise as he described the death of one of his adult children in a car accident several years earlier His mouth quivered as he spoke of another child who had became seriously disabled while fighting in the military And his eyes teared up as he described losing his job as a custodian at a local office building  I cant pay for my medications I cant do enough for my son and I miss my baby he said now weeping At that moment I knew that I could diagnose as much as I wanted prescribe operate and enlist the help of an army of primary care and specialty colleagues but he would be back Whatever the reason for his elevated blood sugar levels this time sooner or later his grief would envelop him he would be overwhelmed with his caretaking duties or he would run out of money for his medications and he would be back at the hospital once more What I could take care of was only the tip of his health care concerns  I remembered this patient and many more like him that I have encountered in practice while reading a new book   have shown that despite spending enormous sums on health care Americans are less healthy than their counterparts in other developed countries In the most recent studies comparing the United States to  other wealthy industrialized nations including France Japan Canada and Britain Americans had a shorter life expectancy higher rates of disease the highest rates of infant mortality and the     These dismal findings have so befuddled health care experts policymakers and politicians that they have come to be known simply as the American health care paradox or among the more candid the US healthcare disadvantage Some experts have attributed the abysmal outcomes to the greed waste and inefficiency of the payment system practitioners and the pharmaceutical industry Others have postulated that the lack of patient access and the American desire for the most sophisticated and newest therapy are the reasons Still others have pointed to the American malpractice system as a key culprit 
But in  in a   and   Dr Elizabeth H Bradley director of Yale Universitys Global Health Leadership Institute Lauren A Taylor a former program manager at the institute and their colleagues offered one of the most compelling and cohesive explanations yet As with other researchers they had found that the United States spends a significantly higher percentage of its gross domestic product  as much as  percent more than other developed countries  on health services like acute hospital care rehabilitative care diagnostic imaging laboratory tests and health insurance But when that percentage is combined with the much smaller amounts spent on education old age pensions disability and sickness benefits family support and employment programs unemployment benefits and housing support the United States ranking drops precipitously to one more in line with its poor health care outcomes  In other words the reason the richest country in the world doesnt have the best health is because it takes more than health care to make a country healthy Now in their new book Dr Bradley and Ms Taylor expand on these findings And while a page book based on a sixpage journal article might seem like the literary equivalent of a onesong band The American Health Care Paradox has enough intellectual heft to bring an opera house to its feet Drawing on data from dozens of international and domestic site visits wideranging scholarly studies and indepth interviews with patients practitioners health care administrators and social service staff from all over the world the authors tackle the unenviable task of explaining why we think of health care the way we do  to the near total exclusion of social services  And they manage to do it with astonishing clarity conciseness and narrative ease In a single chapter for example the authors review the critical historical and cultural turning points of American medicine and social services and show how in the United States these two sectors developed along markedly different paths Health care became a profitable industry with powerful special interest groups battling each other for the spoils Social services on the other hand fell into the domain of government agencies and a handful of nonprofit organizations utilized by only those who couldnt afford care otherwise In a country that continued to cling to the ideal of rugged individualism reliance on such services came to be seen as evidence of a persons weakness and a sign of financial and moral impoverishment As the authors remind us Ronald Reagan once famously declared the nine most terrifying words in the English language as being Im from the government and Im here to help   While chapters of the book are devoted to reallife patient stories descriptions of innovative American programs that manage to integrate health and social services and yes the recounting yet again of the successes of Scandinavian countries in balancing the two the most thoughtprovoking writing focuses on Americas previous attempts to integrate social services and health care delivery It is a sobering list of nearmisses and whatifs testimony to the intractable power of cultural attitudes  Among the casualties described are the neighborhood health centers envisioned in the s and early s as a flexible communitybased center of comprehensive care where all Americans could receive their health care and if needed access housing agencies job training and other support services too The centers were an astounding success but that success quickly drew the attention then ire of the American Medical Association and of politicians and policymakers who warned that such governmentsupported centers were intruding on individuals private lives Powerful lobbying groups eventually exerted enough political pressure to force politicians to cut the centers funding to the point where they became nothing more than dispensaries of medical care primarily for indigent people  These complex histories reveal an American tendency to funnel resources earmarked for health toward medical care the authors write And these historical realities make clear that Americans have been complicit in the creation of the current approach  American health care history abounds with examples of this complicity lost opportunities and health care gone wrong and Dr Bradley and Ms Taylor make no effort to adorn the dismal details They offer no straightforward solutions and after finishing the book it is hard not to throw ones hands up in defeat But it is also hard to ignore the enormous funding and reimbursement disparities between hightech diagnostic procedures like MRIs and intensive care on the one hand and housing support education and job training on the other It is difficult to accept all the lost potential for an inclusive and holistic approach in policy proposals and health care plans And it becomes clearer than ever after reading the book how even in our own lives doctors medicine and all the latest treatments are   the only things that keep us healthy And that may just be the point
