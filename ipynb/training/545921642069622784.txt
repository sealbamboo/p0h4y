A Japanese stem cell scientist at the heart of a scandal over false claims and fabricated research has resigned Dr Haruko Obokata published supposedly groundbreaking research showing stem cells could be made quickly and cheaply There were irregularities in data no other group in the world could repeat her findings and her own university concluded it could not be done In a statement Dr Obokata said I even cant find the words for an apology Stem cells can become any other type of tissue and hold great potential in medicine  They are already being investigated to heal the damage caused by a heart attack and to restore sight But they are expensive and difficult to produce and one source  embryos  raises serious ethical questions  Dr Obokatas scientific paper   claimed that stem cells could be produced from normal adult cells by dipping them into acid for a minute shock period The announcement of the creation of these Stap cells stimulustriggered acquisition of pluripotency sent shockwaves around the world They were described as a major scientific discovery and a game changer by respected scientists in the field  However the findings were too good to be true The work was investigated by the Riken Institute the centre that conducted the research and was   in July amid concern that some of the results had been fabricated Dr Haruko Obokata was later   Riken has been attempting to reproduce the results but this week announced it had been unsuccessful Shinichi Aizawa from the university said We have conducted verification experiments but cant repeat the Stap phenomenon As a result we will terminate the verification experiments In her resignation announcement Dr Obokata said I worked hard for three months to show significant results but Im so exhausted now and extremely puzzled I am keenly aware of my responsibility for troubling a number of people because of my inexperience I even cant find the words for an apology Riken has accepted her resignation  Prof Chris Mason from University College London told the BBC There were serious problems with the whole thing Theyve given her a chance which is right but she didnt manage to reproduce the results I dont think it has damaged science there have been some really solid breakthroughs this year and the focus is on truly transformative therapies
