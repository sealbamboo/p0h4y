A study confirming a link between atmospheric pollution and heartattack risk strengthens the EU case for tougher cleanair targets experts say  Research in the BMJ looking at longterm data for  people in five European countries found evidence of harm even at permitted concentrations  Experts stressed that the risk to an individual was still relatively small And some argued the results were not conclusive as they did not take account of previous exposure to higher levels  Other factors such as smoking or having high blood pressure contribute more to a persons risk of heart attack than pollution from traffic fumes and industry they say But repeated longterm exposure to air pollution  living next to a busy road in a city for example  does take its toll the research involving a collaboration of European universities and institutes reveals  The BMJ study found that for each  gm increase in annual exposure to fineparticulate PM  air pollution  thought to be the most damaging type as smaller particles can penetrate deep into the body  there is a  relative increase in the incidence of heart attacks even after taking into account other risk factors such as smoking Similarly rising levels of largerparticulate air pollution PM  were also linked to heartattack risk  And these associations remained even when exposure concentrations were below the current European limits  Authors of the study  the largest ever looking at the impact of pollution exposure in European people  says its results support the case for lowering EU limits for particulate matter air pollution Current EU legislation sets the annual mean limit on PM  at twice that recommended by the World Health Organization Jon Ayres professor of environmental and respiratory medicine at the University of Birmingham said There is no doubt that further reduction of PM levels would result in improvements in cardiac health in Europe   One can only hope that our European politicians will be persuaded of the importance of these findings and reassess their position on air pollution in Europe Prof David Coggon from the Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine at the University of Southampton was more cautious  This study adds to the evidence that particulate air pollution is a cause of heart disease but it does not establish that there are important health risks from levels of exposure below current exposure limits he said  This is because the differences in risk that were observed may have been a longterm effect of exposures in the past when levels of pollution were higher UK estimates suggest nearly  people die prematurely each year as a direct result of exposure to air pollution which has been linked to asthma and other lung diseases including cancer as well as heart problems A   on the issue says evidence suggests that there is no safe limit for exposure to PM  and that this type of manmade pollution cuts the average life expectancy of people living in the UK by seven to eight months A Defra spokeswoman said Air quality has improved significantly in recent decades and the UK currently meets the EU limits for this type of pollution We want to keep improving air quality and reduce the impact it can have on human health and the environment
