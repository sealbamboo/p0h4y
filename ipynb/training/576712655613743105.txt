It is am when the phone rings Its the hospitals maternity team telling me one of my homebirth mums has gone into labour I used to worry about waking up when I first joined the team but am instantly awake like someones flicked a switch I pull on my blue scrubs go downstairs and ring the mother and hospital to say Im on my way Im joined by a second midwife at the mothers home as we always work in pairs  is a very intuitive profession and on arrival I gauge how the mother is feeling both mentally and physically  is the most natural thing in the world and things unfold at their own pace at home whereas hospital deliveries can take place in a more pressured environment The fastest birth has been  minutes after Ive arrived and the longest more than  hours Once the baby is delivered I put her skintoskin with the mother and give mum and dad some time alone I later offer the father the option of cutting the cord although some mums do it themselves Its a beautiful time I always feel elated after a birth Its a real privilege to be part of the most intimate and lifeaffirming moment of a womans life I help mum have a shower and get into bed with her newborn I always stay for a couple of hours to make sure there is no further bleeding and mum passes water I then head back to the hospital restock the car with any materials and spend around oneandahalf hours writing up my notes and booking an appointment for the newborn Its only a fiveminute drive home My son is interested in what I do and always asks how things have gone and whether his earlier prediction of whether it is a boy or girl is right Hes got a pretty good average of  I came to midwifery relatively late after spending most of my nursing career in intensive care I had to retrain and took a considerable pay drop but it was well worth it People often procrastinate about a career change later in life but to do something you really love is well worth a leap of faith The biggest challenge is juggling my role as a midwife and advocate of the mother with that of the obstetricians who often prefer births to take place in the controlled environment of a hospital Hillingdon hospital delivers around  babies a year but only a fraction of these are home births What is important is to give the mother the choice of where she wants to give birth Every mum is told about our team when they initially book with our hospital for a checkup and make a decision from there If they agree to a home birth they come under our care for the duration I am right where I want to be at the moment and love what I do In future I would probably like to be a private midwife Its not like you are ever going to be out of work I always reflect on my days work and ask myself how it went what I have learned and what I can do better next time The birth of a child is the most important event in an adults life and I want to help mum and dad have the best possible experience
