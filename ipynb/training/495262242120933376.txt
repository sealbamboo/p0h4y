Older adults contemplating suicide do not cite depression as the primary reason according to research presented recently at the annual meeting of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry More often they blame their struggles with illness disability financial concerns family difficulties and bereavement for their suicidal thoughts All of these factors may contribute to depression But the finding suggests that treatment of depression alone may not be sufficient to reduce suicide rates among the elderly  We need a broader approach that encompasses these psychosocial concerns said   director of geriatric psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and a lead investigator with the New York City Neighborhood and Mental Health Study   As my colleague Paula Span wrote last year suicide rates among people  years and older   and elderly white men  especially those over the age of   have the highest rates of all Previous research suggests that up to  percent of seniors who end up taking their lives     But those statistics were drawn from research on older people after they had actually committed suicide The new report focused on seniors who acknowledged thinking of it but chose not to follow through  It asked seniors directly what they were feeling rather than relying on retrospective efforts to understand their mental state In the new study Dr Kennedy and his colleagues screened nearly  New Yorkers between age  and  for symptoms of depression such as apathy hopelessness negativity and reduced appetite  One of the questions asked was In the last two weeks have you felt at times that you would be better off dead or harming yourself in some way Dr Kennedy called every survey participant who responded positively to that question and asked a series of followup questions of those who were willing to talk  Some werent The answers allowed him to identify a subgroup who had clearly contemplated suicide   people in all He then tallied the reasons these people cited for their despair About threequarters blamed illness financial concerns pain family difficulties bereavement or other problems such as landlords who harassed them Depression was named by  percent of them Dr Kennedy also asked this group what convinced them to put aside suicidal thoughts  Forty older adults said family relationships were a definitive factor twenty referred to their faith  When the doctor inquired about the adequacy of social support  seniors said they were satisfied while  said they were not Dr Charles Reynolds a professor of geriatric psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who wasnt involved in this research discounted the notion that depression isnt involved in older adults thoughts of suicide  In the vast majority of cases he said thoughts of suicide signal a significant distortion of mood Yet Dr Reynolds agreed that focusing on depression alone is not sufficient for older adults who might be mulling taking their own lives   Its only when we take context  the kinds of issues the person is struggling with  into account that we can arrive at a sense of why the person is so distressed and how we can be helpful he said
