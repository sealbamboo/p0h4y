Nearly everyone has made New Years resolutions and nearly always they do not survive January Thats often because we tend to overreach The truth is real change is often subtle gradual the way leaves slowly come out in spring So in  try to act like the leaves with ideas for gradual changes that can have a big effect on your life With nearly twothirds of Americans overweight or obese its hardly surprising that weight loss is among the most common New Years resolutions Its also one of the most commonly abandoned Why Generally people make unrealistic  and sometimes unhealthful  weight loss resolutions The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that a person lose no more than  or  pounds per week It also recommends that this take place through modest calorie reduction moderate but consistent exercise and longterm lifestyle changes One problem with fad diets is that often what you are losing is water weight Once you return to a normal diet the weight generally will be regained Another problem is that fad diets often are nutrientpoor and can cause longterm health problems such as muscle wasting if followed for too long Many of them can also be too lowcalorie for diabetics Of course the problem with the slowandsteady method of weight loss is that its slow It takes time patience and commitment However the more slowly you lose the weight the more likely you are to keep it off Detoxing is incredibly popular nowadays and there are certainly arguments for why detoxifying the body is so good for your health It can help rid the body of pesticide residues and heavy metals resulting from exposure to environmental toxins in our air water and food It can improve liver function and thus result in both improved digestion and a more effective immune system to ward off illness and disease It can also help with weight loss though it should not be seen as a substitute for healthful living The problem is that many of the detox diets being offered are quickfix schemes that can be harsh or dangerous to the system Like many fad diets they are again nutrientpoor generally unsafe for diabetics and can cause more health problems than they claim to cure Electrolyte imbalances dehydration nausea diarrhea and abdominal pain are common complaints of people on radical detox programs Also if these detox programs also call for enemas there is a danger of a perforated colon which is considered a medical emergency A healthier sustainable alternative is a daily detox This can be as simple as drinking green tea water with lemon juice or diluted apple cider vinegar Drinking six to eight glasses of filtered water a day still remains one of the best ways to flush the system out It can also mean eating foods known for their detoxifying properties high fiber beans lentils and other legumes as well as cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli or kale and highpectin fruits like apples Foods rich in antioxidants such as berries are also considered to have strong detoxifying properties These foods also will help with general health in other ways and provide you with a wealth of minerals vitamins dietary fiber and phytonutrients that can help strengthen immunity improve digestion increase energy levels and even prevent chronic conditions like diabetes heart disease or cancer A frenetic pace seems permanently built into American culture Unfortunately the resulting stress is a great and silent killerlinked to conditions including heart disease high blood pressure depression weight gain and sleep disorders to name a few One of the healthiest and most doable resolutions you can make for  is to take  minutes out of each and every day to simply be Yoga is a great discipline for lowering stress levels and many websites have suggestions for minute routines that require only a few poses A brief walk through a park or garden is another way to let the stress simply roll away And taking  minutes out of the day for a contemplative activity such as meditation or prayer can also recharge your emotional batteries and leave you more relaxed and productive
