Is everything OK the Petersens asked  No the technician answered and walked out of the room  Nearly two years after the state of Washington was alerted to a possible cluster of babies born with severe birth defects experts are speaking out criticizing the state health department for not doing enough to save babies lives  For four years in a row from  through  the rate of babies born with a brain defect called anencephaly  a type of neural tube defect  in one rural area of Washington has been more than four times the national rate The defect is always fatal  The Washington Department of Health has steadfastly refused to interview the parents of these babies and has failed to accept offers of help from worldrenowned anencephaly experts  It really looks like theyre dragging their feet said Richard Finnell a pediatric geneticist and birth defect expert at the University of Texas  He said that to find the cause of the cluster state investigators need to speak with the parents of children with birth defects in the threecounty area to see whether they might have something in common But the state has not contacted these parents   This is the highest rate of anencephaly since a cluster in Texas back in the s and they should get in there and figure it out But they dont seem very excited about it Finnell said  That Texas outbreak was found to be associated with moldy corn consumed by the mothers A team of experts on this mold offered help to Washington investigators back in February but hasnt received a response  Were frustrated that theyre not moving more quickly to find the cause said Janee Gelineauvan Waes one of the mold experts and an associate professor of pharmacology at the Creighton University School of Medicine in Nebraska  The Washington Department of Health   to the high rate pointing out that it did a review of the mothers medical records and this month created an advisory committee to help with the investigation A state epidemiologist Juliet VanEenwyk said that at some point investigators hope to work with the mold experts  If all of that isnt enough of a response thats partly because the states epidemiologists believe the increased rate could be random VanEenwyk said Though it is indeed high the number of anencephaly cases is so small    per  births  that next year the rate could be back in line with the rest of the country The national rate is  cases per  live births Clusters come and go said VanEenwyk This could possibly be a statistical blip  But Finnell and others say they think a fourfold increase is no blip   With anencephaly the baby is born without a fully formed brain Theres no chance of survival Research has suggested that pregnant women are at higher risk of neural tube defects if their intake of folic acid is low before and during pregnancy The United States has seen a  drop in such case since it started fortifying grains with folic acid When the ultrasound tech walked out the door the Petersens were left alone Erins stomach still exposed with the ultrasound gel on it  Its OK her husband kept repeating but Erin couldnt even look at him She just stared at the wall listening to the sound of her own heart beating louder and louder  The tech returned with the doctor  He told us our baby had anencephaly and had no chance of survival He was surprised hed made it this long Erin said He went to the computer and brought up a picture of a deceased baby with anencephaly and there was no skull past the eyebrows It was horrifying The image is seared into my head forever   The Petersens scheduled a pregnancy termination for two days later on June    In the meantime they went home to wait  I was inconsolable Erin said I had a baby inside me that was living and his heart was beating but I knew I would have to say goodbye in a couple of days The day before the termination Billy Petersen found a red marker and drew a heart on his wifes stomach  I knew our baby was in there and I was showing him that I love him he said It was our last night with him  This kind of emotion is one of the reasons why the Department of Health has decided so far not to interview families like the Petersens  Its very intrusive to start knocking on doors of people whove had a pretty major trauma in their lives VanEenwyk said  Thats the lamest excuse Ive ever heard said Billy Petersen reflecting the viewpoint of several families interviewed by CNN whose children have neural tube defects  We want to talk to them he said Wed do anything to help find out why our baby died and help other families We dont want anyone else to go through what weve been through  VanEenwyk said its not clear what investigators would ask these parents The medical records review showed they had nothing obvious in common  Unless we really think were going to learn something that will help us prevent neural tube defects weve said that thats not the route to go yet  All the Petersens can do now is grieve without answers  A few weeks after they terminated the pregnancy the couple found outthat  their baby had been a boy They named him Oliver Michael and got tattoos in his memory  Billys tattoo on his collarbone has a babys hand and the letters AIMH for Always in my Heart Erins tattoo on the inside of her wrist has the same baby hand  Godspeed it reads Sweet dreams
