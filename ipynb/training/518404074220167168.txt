In whats being hailed as a huge step in fertility and reproduction science doctors in Sweden say a woman has given birth to a baby boy less than two years after she received a uterus transplant The new mother  had been born without a uterus so another woman  donated her womb several years after she had gone through menopause The successful birth was reported by Dr Mats Brannstrom of the University of Gothenburg where a research program has performed uterine transplants on nine women The programs findings are being published in the British medical journal  The recipient had intact ovaries and was able to produce eggs which were then fertilized using IVF before the transplant NPRs Patti Neighmond reports The resulting embryos were transferred to her uterus Doctors were concerned about compromised blood flow to the fetus but it turned out blood flow was normal The baby was delivered by cesarean section in September after his mother developed preeclampsia in the st week of the pregnancy He was sent home  days after being born The baby is fantastic Brannstrom   But it is even better to see the joy in the parents and how happy he made them The parents havent been identified but the AP spoke with the babys father who said of his son Hes no different from any other child but he will have a good story to tell The parents will have to decide whether they want to try for another baby During pregnancy the mother took triple immunosuppression medications tacrolimus azathioprine and corticosteroids according to the   site To avoid longterm damage from those medications  reports theyll need to either try for another pregnancy or have the womb removed  about the uterine transplant project the researchers say Five of the donors are mothers of the receivers the remaining four a close relative The researchers say that a livedonor uterus transplant is low risk despite extended surgery duration with donor surgeries ranging from  hours Of the nine women who received the transplants two later had to have the procedure reversed in one case due to blood clots and in the other due to a chronic infection The idea to transplant a uterus first came from a patient Brannstrom   Recalling a conversation that took place back in  the doctor said he had removed a womans uterus as part of treating her for cervical cancer Brannstrom then explained to the woman that she still had ovaries egg cells and hormones  but wouldnt be able to have a baby But isnt it possible to transplant a uterus the woman asked My mother or older sister could give me a uterus This patient is mad Brannstrom recalls thinking But he talked about the prospect with other doctors and another transplant breakthrough the same year  that of a human hand  made him start working toward making the idea into a reality
