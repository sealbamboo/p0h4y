The mocked obesity excuse of being born with a slow metabolism is actually true for some people say researchers  A team at the University of Cambridge has found the first proof that mutated DNA does indeed slow metabolism The researchers say fewer than one in  people are affected and are often severely obese by early childhood The findings   may lead to new obesity treatments even for people without the mutation  Scientists at the Institute of Metabolic Science in Cambridge knew that mice born without a section of DNA a gene called KSR gained weight more easily  But they did not know what effect it may be having in people so they analysed the DNA of  severely obese patients  Some had mutated versions of KSR  It had a twin effect of increasing their appetite while their slowing metabolism You would be hungry and wanting to eat a lot you would not want to move because of a slower metabolism and would probably also develop type  diabetes at a young age lead researcher Prof Sadaf Farooqi told the BBC She added It slows the ability to burn calories and thats important as its a new explanation for obesity KSR is mostly active in the brain and it affects the way individual cells interpret signals such as the hormone insulin from the blood This in turn affects the bodys ability to burn calories Prof Farooqi said the metabolism argument had been derided by doctors as well as wider society due to a lack of evidence that metabolism was slowed in obese patients In many cases obese patients have an elevated metabolism to cope with fuelling a much larger body She said less than  of people had mutated versions of the gene and some would be a normal weight but about  of children who were obese by the age of five would have the mutated gene  However if drugs could be developed to target problems with KSR then it might be beneficial to anyone who is too fat  Other genetic disorders such as in blood pressure have shown that even where theres a normal gene targeting the pathway can still help Prof Farooqi said The amount and types of food eaten as well as levels of exercise directly affect weight but some people at more risk of becoming obese that others  Obesity can run in families The other obesity genes that have been discovered tend to affect appetite  People have two copies of the FTO gene  one from each parent  and each copy comes in a high and a lowrisk form Those with twohigh risk copies of the FTO gene are thought to be   than those with lowrisk genes It makes fatty foods more tempting and alters levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin Dr Katarina Kos from the University of Exeter Medical School said It is an exciting and interesting breakthrough this is a new pathway predisposing people to obesity But it does exist in obese and lean people so you still need the obesogenic environment
