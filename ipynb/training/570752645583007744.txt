Attention pilots and flight attendants For your safety please fasten your seat belts note the location of the aircrafts emergency exits  and be sure to apply plenty of sunscreen to reduce your risk of melanoma When it comes to the risks of flying skin cancer may not be the first health hazard that comes to mind But a new   in JAMA Dermatology says that pilots are  times more likely than folks in the general population at large to be diagnosed with melanoma For members of the cabin crew the risk was  times greater  is the sixth most common cancer in the United States according to the National Cancer Institute Although other types of skin cancer are diagnosed more frequently melanoma is more likely to be   the American Cancer Society says An estimated  Americans will be diagnosed with melanoma this year and about  will die from it Dozens of studies have examined melanoma risk in flight crews since working at  feet means greater exposure to cosmic rays and ultraviolet radiation For the new study researchers from UC San Francisco combed through data on  participants in  published studies to see whether the danger was real  and if so how big it was They found that for both pilots and flight attendants the risk of developing melanoma was more than double the risk seen in people who worked on the ground However only pilots faced an increased risk of death from the cancer  their mortality risk was  greater than for those in the general population For those who worked in the main cabin the risk of dying from melanoma was actually  lower The study authors noted that exposure to cosmic radiation is not likely to be a factor for melanoma Many studies have measured the cosmic radiation that finds its way into a plane and the amount is consistently below the allowed dose limit of  mSvy or  millisieverts per year A typical American is exposed to about  mSv per year according to this   from the Environmental Protection Agency UVB radiation probably isnt the culprit either since fewer than  of this radiation can penetrate aircraft windshields the researchers wrote  on the other hand can penetrate glass and the higher a plane flies the more intense UVA radiation becomes When planes fly above clouds or snowcovered mountains they are exposed to even more UVA reflected from below the researchers wrote Studies of cells in lab dishes and in animals show that UVA damages DNA causing the mutations that can lead to cancer Its possible that when they are on the ground pilots and flight attendants are bigger fans of activities that would increase their risk of melanoma such as frequenting tanning salons So far theres no hard data suggesting that this is the case the UC San Francisco researchers wrote Instead they noted that multiple studies have   that the more hours a member of the flight crew spends in the air the more likely he or she is to be diagnosed with melanoma
