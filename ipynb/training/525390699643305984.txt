Tuesday night on radio host Diane Rehm's website.. Dr. Ira Byock, of the Providence Institute for Human Caring, . r that Maynard is “being exploited” by a nonprofit advocating for death-with-dignity laws. “Perhaps most disturbingly, Byock claimed that Compassion & Choices had somehow taken advantage of me through ‘exploitation’ and that I feel compelled to die now based on public expectations,” Maynard wrote. “I DO NOT, this is MY choice, I am not that weak.
