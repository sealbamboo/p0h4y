Women who get chemotherapy for breast cancer may end up unemployed for a very long time researchers reported on Monday A few may lose their jobs because they cannot work consistently  although its usually illegal to fire someone for being ill But many may underestimate just how much chemotherapy can take out of you doctors said Dr Reshma Jagsi of the University of Michigan Health System and her colleagues studied  women in the Los Angeles and Detroit areas diagnosed with breast cancer between  and  They spoke with more than  of them four years later About  of the women were under  and interviewed both times and of them  percent had paid jobs before they were diagnosed The women who got chemo were less likely to still be working four years later they reported in the journal Cancer The researchers found that  percent of the women who got chemo were jobless four years later versus  percent of the women who skipped chemo And some lost their jobs or stopped working soon after diagnosis Two years after they were diagnosed  percent of the women who got chemo were unemployed compared to  percent of the women who did not The findings suggest that even though women want to get back to work as soon as they can chemo may be changing their lives more than they think Jagsi said We also need to ensure that patients who are deciding on whether to receive chemotherapy understand the potential longterm consequences of receiving treatment including possible implications for their employment and financial outcomes she said Most didnt quit on purpose Of the  women who had not worked since they were diagnosed more than half said it was important for them to work and  were actively looking for a job the researchers wrote It happened to Kris Snow of Ann Arbor Michigan She was diagnosed with Stage III breast cancer in  and her doctors recommended chemotherapy before she had surgery to help shrink her tumor and make it easier to remove You send an army in to weaken it and beat the crap out of it and then surgically take it out So I said OK Snow told NBC News At first it wasnt so bad Other than being extremely fatigued I didnt get that nauseous Snow said When they started taxol immediately I got numbness and tingling in my fingers and toes and hands she added Snow a former scientist had reinvented herself as a home remodeler but couldnt set up contracts because of the sideeffects I couldnt work I was weak and tired she said The tiles and boards I picked up were heavy  I couldnt even do painting because I was too tired And clients were demanding the work be done immediately Now Snow who is  and who has a yearold son is on disability Basically I lost my business she says The findings dont surprise breast cancer experts For the vast majority of patients side effects are manageable and they can improve after but some patients dont feel fully functional for the long term said Dr Jennifer Litton a breast oncologist at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston So I think its really good that the study looked at employment as long as four years after diagnosis Sideeffects include     thats been documented  and neuropathy which is a numbness or pain in the arms legs and feet that can affect a persons ability to do some jobs such as driving I can think of a patient of mine a nurse who had chemotherapy she felt foggy and she felt unsafe dispensing drugs to her patients so we had to go back and forth talking to her and her employer Litton told NBC News I sometimes have to advocate for longterm disability on behalf of my patients People who are in poor health   because their illness has affected their ability to work says James Smith chair of labor markets and demographic studies for the think tank RAND Corp
