If youve felt smug and safe using builtin voicecontrolled technology for text messages email and phone calls while driving forget it There are some sobering findings about the risk of distraction from the American Automobile Association and the University of Utah The proliferation of handsfree technology is a looming public safety crisis AAA CEO Robert Darbelnet says Its time to consider limiting new and potentially dangerous mental distractions built into cars AAA commissioned a study by a   that has focused on distracted driving The report can be found   These new speechbased technologies in the car can overload the drivers attention and impair their ability to drive safely says psychology professor   Dont assume that if your eyes are on the road and your hands are on the wheel that you are unimpaired Strayer and his team tracked eye and head movements charted brain activity and measured driver reaction time while test drivers in simulators and on the road listened to the car radio talked on a cellphone both handheld and handsfree or listened to and responded to voiceactivated email features We found that interacting with the speechtotext system was the most cognitively distracting Strayer reports Voiceactivated features increased mental workload and distraction levels and heightened risk says Peter Kissinger of the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety which funded the study Test drivers experienced a type of tunnel vision or inattention blindness where motorists dont see potential hazards right in front of them he says Strayer says that an unintended consequence of trying to make driving safer  by moving to speechtotext invehicle systems  may actually overload the driver and make them less safe AAA urges the electronics and auto industry to limit voiceactivated technology to core drivingrelated activities such as climate control windshield wipers and cruise control The group wants car companies to disable voicetotext email texting and social media while driving The   prefers to wait for other academic studies so that a complete body of research drives policy spokesman Wade Newton says We will need to review the AAAUniversity of Utah study but we are extremely concerned that it could send a misleading message since it suggests that handheld and handsfree devices are equally risky Newton says The AAA study focuses only on the cognitive aspects of using a device and ignores the visual and manual aspects of handheld versus integrated handsfree systems The most distracting task for test drivers in the study involved remembering words while solving math problems while driving The researchers dont actually believe thats a realworld problem Its what they came up with to provide a benchmark for the most severe distracted driver reactions In you case you were wondering the researchers took care to make sure that the drivers they were distracting werent in danger The cars used in road tests were outfitted with redundant brakes that researchers riding along could use if necessary They also could warn drivers about imminent hazards
