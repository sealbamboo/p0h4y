Drinking lots of milk may not lower the risk of fracturing bones a study in the British Medical Journal suggests  The research conducted in Sweden showed women who drank more than three glasses a day were actually more likely to break bones than those who had less The researchers cautioned that their work only suggested a trend and should not be interpreted as proof that high milk consumption caused fractures Factors such as alcohol and weight were likely to play a role they said  Milk has been recommended as a good source of calcium for many years but studies considering whether it leads to stronger bones and fewer fractures have had conflicting results A team of scientists in Sweden examined the dietary habits of  women in  and  men in  and then monitored their health for years afterwards  Participants were asked to complete questionnaires on how frequently they consumed common foods such as milk yoghurt and cheese over a oneyear period  Researchers then tracked how many developed fractures and how many participants died in the years afterwards  In the year followup period in which the women were monitored those who drank more than three glasses or ml of milk a day were more likely to develop fractures than those who had consumed less The highintake group had a higher risk of death too  Prof Karl Michaelsson lead researcher at Uppsala University said Women who drank three or more glasses a day had twice the chance of dying at the end of the study than those who drank less than one glass a day  And those who had a high milk intake also had a  higher risk of hip fracture Men were monitored for an average of  years after the initial survey and the results showed a similar but less pronounced trend  When fermented milk products such as yoghurt were considered the opposite pattern was observed  people who consumed more had a lower risk of fractures  Prof Michaelsson says the findings could be due to sugars in milk which have been shown to accelerate ageing in some early animal studies Our results may question the validity of recommendations to consume high amounts of milk to prevent fragility fractures The results should however be interpreted cautiously given the observational design of our study Dietary advice should not be changed until more research had been conducted he said Prof Sue LanhamNew from the University of Surrey said the study was of limited use We do not have a feel for the influence of physical activity or other lifestyle habits important to bone or overall mortality And the effect of increasing body mass index has not been fully investigated in this study Milk and dairy products in the UK provide  of the calcium in our diet We know that low calcium intake less than mg a day is a risk factor for osteoporosis Individuals should still be encouraged to consume a balanced diet from the five key food groups of which milk and dairy are key
