Thanks to goldstandard tuberculosis treatment and prevention programs cases of TB in the United States have declined every year for the past two decades  to the   ever But TBs course through the Williams family in Boston shows that no nation can afford to relax its efforts to find treat and prevent TB Its just too sneaky and stubborn an adversary Onethird of the human race is infected with   a persistent public health problem that kills  million people a year The Williams family story begins in late  when Judy Williams lost her appetite and energy and began to lose weight at a great rate She was the matriarch of a large extended family with three generations under one roof and many friends and relatives who often dropped in Thats an important element of our story Her son Robert says Judy Williams would always cook for people invite people into the house Like the homeless  she let them stay there with the family and all She was just very kind to everybody And that may be how she got TB She may have had a silent noncontagious infection for years Judy Williams seems like an unlikely case of TB infection For the last three decades of her life she rarely ventured outside the family home Robert thinks its because she was afraid of street violence Her daughter Michelle thinks she had a mental disorder  a fear of the outside world that doctors call   Whatever the reason her reclusiveness would seem to put Judy Williams at very low risk of getting TB As much as she took care of others Judy Williams never took care of herself She smoked and at one point she weighed close to  pounds But then she stopped cooking and retreated to her room Her weight dropped  pounds over a few months That can be a sign of active TB Finally Michelle forced her to go to the doctor If it wasnt for me taking her nobody would have ever known she had TB because she wasnt going to go she says Still weeks would pass before the diagnosis was made Doctors at   recognized right away that Judy Williams had severe untreated diabetes And they suspected TB because a chest Xray showed suspicious shadows on her lungs But it could have been lung cancer They scheduled a followup CT scan But Judy who had a terrible fear of doctors and hospitals skipped the appointment At one point a visiting nurse called the hospital from the Williams home Boston public health nurse Michael Malone says he warned the doctors that theres a lot of people in and out of this household  so if this is TB theres going to be a long list of people exposed to Judy Judy Williams TB didnt get diagnosed for another month or so after she was rushed to the hospital by ambulance in a diabetic crisis While she was there doctors established without a doubt that TB had eaten a large   in her left lung That suggests her TB had been active and unchecked for an extended period of time nurse Malone says It also made her maximally contagious And then there was a slipup Once she was past the diabetic crisis Judy Williams was sent home She should have been quarantined at a TB treatment center until she was no longer contagious But she was discharged over Martin Luther King weekend  and public health officials didnt get notified in time They had the legal power to require her to stay in the hospital for treatment Another factor Judy Williams was a strongwilled woman who made it very clear she had no desire to stay in the hospital A month later she began coughing up copious amounts of blood at home The family called  and Judy was rushed to the hospital but it was too late I knew she was dead says daughter Michelle I seen my mother  I hate talking about it  when I went to the hospital  just laid up on life support After a week she authorized the doctors to pull the plug Her mother was  years old Robert who was especially close to his mother was so distraught he couldnt bring himself to go to her funeral As soon as Judy Williams was diagnosed with TB Boston public health workers began testing the family to see if shed infected others Around  people in the extended family were tested Malone says and about half of those showed evidence of TB infection All were in the  or early stage of infection which means they had no symptoms and couldnt pass TB to anyone else Thats one of the hallmarks of TB Most people who get infected go a lifetime without ever getting active contagious disease But if left untreated when something happens to lower their immunity the infection can roar to life attacking lungs kidneys spine brain or other parts of the body In Judy Williams case it was probably her untreated diabetes that lowered her immunity and gave the TB germ its chance All but one of the people identified as TBinfected after Judy Williams death completed a voluntary ninemonth course of medicine to prevent the infection from progressing At this point the public health people thought theyd done their job So they were shocked when last October  months after Judy Williams death her yearold nephew came to the hospital with advanced TB It was a very painful discovery Malone says Hed had two skin tests which pointed away from any infection He was never offered prevention medicine because there was no indication for it And yet he obviously had been infected Then a month later a yearold man came to the hospital with active TB  the boyfriend of one of Judy Williamss granddaughters Meanwhile Judys son Robert had been losing a lot of weight Around Thanksgiving of last year he felt he couldnt breathe TB had eaten a large hole in his lung Robert went willingly to a state hospital for two months of quarantine until he was no longer infectious to others and remains on outpatient treatment DNA testing showed all three men were infected with the same strain of TB as Judy Williams  meaning they got it from her But all three men had tested negative for TB on two successive skin tests done weeks apart back in  We thought it had to be a fluke really an outlier that someone would have negative skin tests and be infected with TB Malone says But that is one of the limitations of the test Some people just dont respond Unfortunately a nonresponse is more likely when someone has active TB or lowered immunity for some reason such as HIV infection And sometimes the results can be wrong when health workers dont wait long enough between the first and second skin tests We may have done our second round of testing too quickly in this case Malone says The public health nurse whose fulltime job is battling TB in the community says the Williams familys story is a sobering reminder of how challenging it can be to track TB infection and prevent its spread After the three new cases of active TB popped up another round of testing revealed three more infections  all in people who had tested negative in early  They include daughter Michelle her first husband and her yearold granddaughter So now more than two years after TB was first diagnosed in the Williams family theyre still struggling with the disease Every day Robert takes a bus to the Boston Medical Center where a nurse watches him take a handful of pills If he starts missing doses he could develop a resistant form of TB thats more dangerous and difficult to treat Michelle makes sure that she and her granddaughter Ayniah dont miss a dose of medicine or a monthly checkup I take mine every day Michelle says I saw what happened to my mother I dont play with it Since my mother passed its just too scary for me Within a few months everybody in the Williams family will finish treatment Then they can finally put TB behind them
