The Amish countryside in central Ohio looks as it has for a hundred years There are picturesque pastures with cows and sheep and big red barns dot the landscape But something changed here when on an April afternoon an Amish woman walked to a communal call box She picked up the phone to call the   She told a county worker she and a family next door had the measles That call spurred nurse Jacqueline Fletcher into action The very next morning we were out to collect samples collect nasal swabs and also draw blood And it was just textbook   says Fletcher A nurse in Knox County for nearly three decades Fletcher had never seen the illness but she knew the symptoms The rash They had the conjunctivitis in the eyes their eyes were red she says They dont want the light they sit in the darkened room wear dark glasses I mean they were just miserable High temperatures   temps So this was the measles The   of measles in recent US history is underway Ohio has the     confirmed and eight hospitalizations The virus has spread quickly among the largely unvaccinated Amish communities in the center of the state Fletcher collected samples the afternoon she arrived A county worker drove them immediately to the state health department and quickly confirmed the measles The next day Fletcher says she was on a call with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention I remember the first conversation we had with the CDC she says The fellow said You have to get ahead of this  Fletcher started organizing doortodoor vaccinations and set up vaccination clinics at various locations On a Wednesday in midJune her clinic takes place in a store that usually sells construction supplies A steady stream of people come throughout the day After the workday ends Amish families form a line out the door while buggies continue to roll into a nearby parking lot Most of the children are barefoot not needing to wear shoes until they work out of the home The girls wear darkcolored homemade dresses and bonnets The boys pressed trousers and buttonup shirts Inside the clinic most people are calm but the younger ones are scared Ervin Kauffman reassures his six children as they squeeze into a small back office for their second shot for mumps measles and rubella since the outbreak began While many Amish are not against vaccines in principle many including Kauffmans children have never had shots I guess there was no scare to us before Kaufman says I guess we were too relaxed Kauffman says the outbreak has changed other customs too Were just now starting with weddings he says Spring is the Amish wedding season a time when hundreds come together often traveling from other states and sometimes Canada Those weddings were postponed Church services typically held in family homes were also curtailed We didnt have church for almost two months because of the measles so we wouldnt spread them so we kind of tried to put the clamp on them he says Knox County Health Commissioner Julie Miller came out to visit Fletchers clinic to lend support to the vaccination effort She has no idea how many are still at risk of contracting the illness Its hard to answer that because we still dont know what the number is of who has the potential to be sick she explains Thats because theres simply no official count of how many Amish live in Ohio Researchers at Ohio State University   that there are about  Amish living in the sixcounty area where the outbreak began At last count  people in those counties had been vaccinated But Miller fears the measles will continue to spread because there is still resistance to vaccinations Paul Raber  is one of those who are skeptical He decided to get the measles vaccine for himself and his family But the father of  isnt sure if he or his family will get other shots We might we might he says sounding doubtful Meanwhile the virus is spreading with more cases being reported in nearby Holmes and Stark counties
