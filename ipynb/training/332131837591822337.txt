When it comes to health care the biggest of the big data are all about Medicare So its kind of a   deal when the government releases what individual hospitals charge Medicare  and what they actually get paid  for the most common diagnoses and treatments In a first the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services   A quick spin through the data shows that what hospitals in the same town or state charge for the same procedure is often very different And as previous studies of anonymized data have shown there are big variations from one part of the country to another Now it must be said that what a hospital charges Medicare isnt what the government pays Medicare and private health insurers get discounts and dont pay anything near the hospital   The uninsured may pay something closer to these master prices though because they dont have bargaining power If youre uninsured theyre going to ask you to pay   director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Hospital Finance and Management     But the Medicare data that were just released includes the amount of money the government actually forked over Take Hartford Conn for instance health insurance capital of the US   the biggest one in town charges a tad over  to treat a Medicare patient diagnosed with chest pain and receives  for the service Little   in nearby Torrington charges Medicare about  and receives  Medicare pays teaching hospitals a little more to compensate them for that work And hospitals in places with higher costs get more too So for the first time anybody can get an idea of what their hospitals are billing Medicare for something and how much the government is paying The database such as it is isnt very friendly But with the data now public look for outsiders to make it easier to sort and analyze  has already taken a crack at it A handy   lets you look at charges by state for some of the most common medical conditions including heart failure joint replacement and pneumonia So how useful is the information If youre a nerd maybe quite useful But the data are a slog CarnegieMellons   a professor of economics and health policy applauds the move while saying the numbers only tell us part of the story Charges are list prices he says Theyre sticker prices The data on what Medicare actually pays show less variation and he says thats expected given that administrative formulas dictate the amounts Data on what private insurers pay would help even more and thats something hes working on through the   Still he says theres no harm and maybe some good to be had from the Medicare data dump Just sort of getting information out there even if its not exactly what you want it may have some use he says It may make hospitals think a little bit harder about what theyre doing In some places the details on charges could spark conversations or pushback about how well nonprofit community hospitals are doing at their public missions he says
