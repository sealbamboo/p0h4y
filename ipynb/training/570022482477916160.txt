A scheme to match dementia researchers with members of the public who are willing to take part in studies has been launched The online and phone service in England Scotland and Wales helps people find the projects that most suit them  It is funded by the Department of Health and NHS England  Experts say a lack of access to volunteers has hampered critical research into the illness Dementia affects more than  people across the UK  According to government figures fewer than  of people with the condition currently take part in studies  Researchers are calling for patients carers and anyone over  who is interested in participating  whether they have been affected by dementia or not  to sign up  By registering with   people give permission for scientists to contact them with studies that fit their profiles Projects vary from trials of new dementia treatments to surveys looking at how to improve patients quality of life There is no obligation for people to take part and volunteers can opt out if they want to  The scheme has already been piloted across north London for the last six months with more than  people signing up to show interest  Some  have participated in studies so far  Hilary Evans of Alzheimers Research UK said We know there is a strong appetite from the public to play a role in dementia research but until now there hasnt been an easy and coordinated way for people to register their interest Sue Boex one of the carers who helped design the initiative said This is a very exciting initiative and one we really need people to get behind  Because studies have very specific criteria we need lots of people signing up in order to find the right people for the right study at the right time Prof Martin Rossor of the National Institute for Health Research said The government and charities have increased funding for dementia research over the last few years meaning more studies are being done than ever before but it is often difficult to find willing volunteers at the right time Growing the number of willing research volunteers will help push forward research to make advances in treatment prevention and care  Join Dementia Research is a collaboration between the National Institute for Health Research Alzheimers Research UK Alzheimers Society Alzheimers Scotland and UCL Partners
