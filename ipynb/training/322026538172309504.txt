The patent medicines sold in days gone by may contrary to the name not have had real government patents But that didnt stop their makers from claiming the concoctions could cure ailments ranging from indigestion to jaundice and fever Now researchers have put some of these old elixirs and pills in the  s large collection of patent medicines to a modern test They found a mix of potentially harmful metals like lead and mercury along with benign ingredients including calcium and iron Library research only goes so far in understanding the oncepopular medicines They can find out what they were supposed to cure they can find out based on old newspapers what they caused says chemist   who led the research for the Dearborn Mich museum But they cant necessarily find out what was in them Hundreds of these patent medicines were sold in stores by mail order and from traveling medicine shows in the late th and early th centuries They were called patent medicines because people put their names on them Take for instance Hollisters Golden Nugest Tablets and Dr Sawens Magic Nervine Pills Before the   of the Food and Drug Administration in the early s people could claim to cure anything and they didnt have to list what was in them says Mary Fahey chief conservator and head of preservation at the museum Benvenuto and seven of his students at   analyzed studied  medicines using energydispersive Xray fluorescence to identify metals and nuclear magnetic resonance to look at all compounds including carbonbased chemicals or organics So did the analysis find any of the ingredients actually listed on the label Its tough to make that call with the organics Benvenuto says None of them were nice clean and pure for just one compound So by NMR youre going to see all the compounds at once And the other thing is these things have been sitting in a bottle for  years  organics tend to break down Because the mixture of organic substances proved to be a challenge research on them is ongoing The preliminary results were recently presented at the American Chemical Societys   in New Orleans For now the researchers focused on identifying elements first because they are much less ambiguous I found a lot more iron calcium and zinc than I did mercury and lead Benvenuto says For example the team found iron calcium and a little bit of silver and copper in Reynold  Parmelys Female Health Restorative The pill claimed to contain coffee ceratrum nux vomica pulsatilla cocculus cimifuga and chamomile But just because the researchers werent able to discern the listed organics in their analysis doesnt mean they werent originally included And then there was PPP Parsons Purgative Pills which was said to contain aloes colmel powdered colocynth gamboge soap mandrake root and peppermint oil That actually had a significant amount of mercury in them When they first found mercury in a couple of them they were reminded that medicines containing the metal were a common treatment for syphilis It kills the   Benvenuto says It almost kills you but it kills the spirochete Some patent medicines were known to contain other risky ingredients like cocaine and heroin The modern chemists arent able to determine a drugmakers motive I dont know if people were in it just to sell stuff or actually thought they had something that would solve a problem Benvenuto says But if you stop and think about this what we were analyzing here is kind of a first step into where weve come to today If you go back to the year  the way people got rid of ailments was a lot of home remedies In hindsight we can say someone had a virus and their body would have dealt with it regardless of what they ingested he says So taking a patent medicine and then getting better was just coincidence You and I might say they didnt really do a controlled study on this sort of thing but no one had really conceived of controlled studies back then Benvenuto says That doesnt mean they cured nothing
