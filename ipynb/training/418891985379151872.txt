In  welltraveled freelance photographer Kristie McLean arrived in Ethiopia her first trip to the country She was there to photograph women with an injury that can happen when a baby gets stuck during childbirth obstetric fistula Its a condition common in rural Africa and Asia where women give birth far from hospitals and Csections arent readily available The injury is caused by prolonged obstructed labor Fistula can also happen in cases of rape Often the baby dies A hole  called a fistula  forms between the womans birth canal and her bladder or rectum leaving her incontinent leaking urine or feces or both Typically their husbands and their families reject them McLean says Theyre completely shunned from society Fistula can often be fixed with a simple surgery but women who are shunned by their families have little means of raising the money for treatment They can be weakened physically and mentally So when McLean and another photographer on the trip were introduced to a new patient in Ethiopias   they were cautioned not to extend their visit past  minutes Those  minutes came and went but McLeans partner kept shooting The fistula patient was cowering and was clearly not comfortable McLean says And I said as much to my partner and her response was Dont tell me what to do I paid thousands of dollars of my own money to be here and Im going to get the shot I went outside and was just wondering what the hell am I doing here If this is what its like to be a professional photographer Im in the wrong place McLean stumbled out into the hospital parking lot There she met a young man covered with dust Tsega was an engineer who built grain mills in faroff villages In his travels he heard stories about fistula patients and was inspired to do something to help them So once a month he volunteered with a church group to transport Muslim women with fistula three at a time from their remote villages to this hospital in the capital Addis Ababa The journey was two days each way Tsega pointed to his dusty clothes and car Very bad roads he said Very slow driving Then Tsega told McLean a story The story he told as McLean recounts it years later was that he always traveled with three women but on this particular day there were only two women available There even was some question whether to make the trip or to wait for a third because petrol is expensive But they decided to go anyway because the women were extremely ill On the drive they encountered a crowd blocking the road And Tsega got out of the car and asked someone on the side of the road whats going on whats happening Kristie recounts And someone said Theres a woman whos hanging from a tree And shes trying to kill herself The woman had fistula Shed been chased from her home by her husband and family and she had nowhere to go And Tsega was able to say Come down from the tree and come with us and we have room for you in the car Were going to the fistula hospital McLean says The woman was  Her name was Ajayibe In the Oromo language that means amazing The name Tsega means grace Even today McLean cannot tell the story without choking up I dont know what it was specifically about that story because I had interviewed other really interesting really lovely women she says But I heard that story of Ajayibe and it changed something in me Back home in Seattle McLean told the story to anybody who would listen strangers on airplanes or next to her in the supermarkets frozen food section Obstetric fistula affects up to  million women and girls around the world And there are a number of fistula organizations already But McLean collected enough money on her own to set up a new project in Western Ethiopia in the region where Hijaibe lives to help women support themselves after surgery On her fourth trip back to the country McLean took along a tape recorder Three years had passed since shed heard the story in the parking lot and shed come to celebrate Shed raised enough funds to help Tsega build a special grain mill that would benefit women with fistula The proceeds from the mill allowed women to own livestock She interviewed Ajayibe who was ecstatic about her six sheep Ajayibe was still living with the symptoms of her injury There was too much scar tissue to fix the hole in her birth canal For the first time Ajayibe told McLean the story of her attempted suicide how she felt completely out of options out of hope McLean says She found some rope and had strung it through the tree Except McLean now learned that the person who rescued her wasnt Tsega the man named Grace It was one of Ajayibes neighbors Tsega didnt enter the story until two months later when he heard about Ajayibe from villagers On the phone from Addis Ababa Tsega confirmed Ajayibes story They were talking about Ajayibe and I tell them please bring this woman to me I will take her to hospital he said McLean wondered how she could have misheard such an important detail Perhaps it was pure interpretation she says We were talking about a woman on the tree and then theyre telling me that they brought this woman and that they had one spot left so Im not even realizing that theres a twomonth gap Or maybe she heard the story she needed to hear That day in the hospital parking lot McLean was in a profound state of doubt about her life and career The story she thought she heard suggested that the unlikeliest rescue can come exactly at our lowest moment of despair Theres times in our lives where were that person hanging from the tree she says You could say this story rescued McLean gave her a purpose Intellectually she knows that the true version is not that different The pain is the same and I think the sense of hope is the same she says Just that miraculous cinematic timing  potentially a valuable fundraising tool  is gone Emotion is what moves people to action she admits Thats the tender spot Now that shes met Ajayibe and the other women and seen their lives up close McLean no longer needs a supernatural coincidence to be moved to compassion But if back then in the parking lot shed heard the real story she might have just shaken Tsegas hand and walked away never becoming any more than a stranger
