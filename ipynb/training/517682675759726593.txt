Health officials say theyre still figuring out whats going on The bug that appears to be causing most of the concern has a typically arcane name  Enterovirus EVD  but many of its symptoms are very common Heres what you need to know about the virus Enteroviruses which bring on symptoms like a very intense cold arent unusual Theyre actually very common  When you have a bad summer cold often what you have is an enterovirus said Mark Pallansch a virologist and director of the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Division of Viral Diseases There are more than  types of enteroviruses causing about  to  million infections in the United States each year according to the CDC They are carried in the intestinal tract and often spread to other parts of the body The season often hits its peak in September as summer ends and fall begins Whats unusual at the moment is the high number of hospitalizations The virus has sent more than  children a day to a Kansas City Missouri hospital where about  of the youngsters were placed in intensive care officials said Its worse in terms of scope of critically ill children who require intensive care I would call it unprecedented said Dr Mary Anne Jackson a director for infectious diseases at Childrens Mercy Hospital where about  children were recently treated Ive practiced for  years in pediatrics and Ive never seen anything quite like this she said An analysis by the CDC showed at least  of the Kansas City children tested positive for EVD Missouri health officials said Its a type of enterovirus thats uncommon but not new  It was first identified in the s and there have been fewer than  reported cases since that time But its possible Pallansch said that the relatively low number of reports might be because EVD is hard to identify EVD was seen last year in the United States and this year in various parts of the world Over the years clusters have been reported in Georgia Pennsylvania Arizona and various countries including the Philippines Japan and the Netherlands Experts say they dont know why its flared up this time around Why one virus or another crops up in one part of the country or another part of the country from one year to the next is inexplicable said William Schaffner head of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University Its a mystery to me The virus can start as just a cold Signs include coughing difficulty breathing and in some cases a rash Sometimes they can be accompanied by fever or wheezing Respiratory problems appear to the hallmark of EVD according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services Most enteroviruses cause either a little bit of a cold or a diarrheal illness  a few cause meningitis said Schaffner This one is the if you will odd cousin It causes prominent respiratory symptoms Why it does that were really not sure The good news is that enteroviruses usually arent deadly  All of these folks are going to get better said Schaffner Some of them have more severe illness such as these children who have developed asthma and are hospitalized But they should all get better Many of the EVD infections will be mild and selflimited requiring only symptomatic treatment the Missouri health agency said Some cases could in theory contribute to death but none of the Missouri cases have resulted in death and no data are available for overall morbidity and mortality from the virus in the United States the agency said Beyond the surge in infections in Missouri there are signs of a possible regional outbreak of EVD Colorado Illinois and Ohio are reporting cases with similar symptoms and are awaiting testing results according to officials and CNN affiliates in those states The  states that have reached out to the CDC for assistance are Colorado North Carolina Georgia Ohio Iowa Illinois Missouri Kansas Oklahoma and Kentucky The unusually high number of hospitalizations reported now could be just the tip of the iceberg in terms of severe cases said Pallansch of the CDC Like other enteroviruses the respiratory illness appears to spread through close contact with infected people That makes children more susceptible Theres not a great deal you can do health officials say beyond taking commonsense steps to reduce the risk Wash your hands with soap and water for  seconds  particularly after going to the bathroom and changing diapers  Clean and disinfect surfaces that are regularly touched by different people such as toys and doorknobs  Avoid shaking hands kissing hugging and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick And stay home if you feel unwell Theres no vaccine for EVD
