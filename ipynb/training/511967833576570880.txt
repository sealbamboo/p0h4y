Genes dont operate by themselves Dr C Robert Cloninger one of the studys senior authors explained in the statement They function in concert much like an orchestra and to understand how theyre working you have to know not just who the members of the orchestra are but how they interact   is a chronic brain disorder that affects about  of the population according to the American Psychiatric Association Symptoms can vary from hallucinations to disordered speech to attention and decisionmaking problems Past studies done on twins and families have shown that about  of the risk for schizophrenia is inherited the study authors say   published in July showed as many as  genes may be tied to the mental health disorder But scientists have had trouble identifying specific genetic variations that put people at risk  The Washington University researchers looked at instances where a single unit of DNA was altered which is known as a single nucleotide polymorphism or SNP  Then they identified  interactive SNP sets that significantly increased peoples risk of schizophrenia according to the study  In other words if study participant Bob had Gene Cluster X he was  more likely to have schizophrenia than study participant Fred who didnt have that cluster of genes In some cases certain gene clusters were matched with close to a  increase in risk In the past scientists had been looking for associations between individual genes and schizophrenia coauthor Dr Dragan Svrakic said in the statement What was missing was the idea that these genes dont act independently They work in concert to disrupt the brains structure and function and that results in the illness The idea that schizophrenia is not one single disorder is not really new says   a professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona Its similar to the way doctors use the term breast cancer to describe   that cause tumors in the breasts Schizophrenia is probably  different diseases Raison says All psychiatric conditions likely share this heterogeneity There are only so many ways that certain malfunctions in your genetic code can manifest Raison says There may be  separate gene mutations but they might only express themselves as one or two symptoms So whats causing hallucinations in one person might be different than whats causing them in another  So why are scientists trying to separate out the different schizophrenia disorders Two reasons Raison says to help predict who might get schizophrenia and to help treat it more efficiently  Take for example   which is a condition where the liquid around your lungs becomes inflamed Several things can cause pleurisy including a viral infection pneumonia or cancer If you have a drug that treats pneumonia its going to help only a certain percentage of patients with pleurisy But if you know that your patients pleurisy is caused by cancer youll find a different course of treatment  The same could hold true for schizophrenia and other mental health conditions Raison says  In psychiatry land were still stuck with pleurisy he says Theyre descriptions of symptoms and we only have a vague idea of the underlying causes
