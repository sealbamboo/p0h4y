Fifty years ago this month Dr Luther L Terry issued the first Surgeon Generals Report on Smoking and Health which cited smoking as a cause of lung   in men The hefty report landed like a bombshell on a complacent public bombarded daily by tobacco advertising and surrounded at work home and play by people who smoked On Friday Dr Boris D Lushniak the acting surgeon general   applauding a halfcentury of progress during which smoking rates have fallen by more than half Still he lamented that smoking remains the leading preventable cause of premature disease and death in the United States Kathleen Sebelius the secretary of health and human services noted in a statement that this year alone nearly onehalf million adults will still die prematurely because of smoking The new report greatly expands the list of disorders now known to be causally linked to smoking to include agerelated         tuberculosis   cleft palate     inflammation and impaired immune function Exposure to secondhand smoke is now deemed a cause of stroke In  smoking seemed like the thing to do socially and legally accepted nearly everywhere If you were not around back then youd be shocked by what it was like Every car was a smoking car On flights passengers inhaled recirculated smokefilled air The aroma of exquisite restaurant meals were tainted by tobacco smoke  Hospital visitors smoked in patients rooms as did many patients themselves Movies were watched through a smoky haze Cigarette samples were widely distributed on college campuses and students smoked freely in their dorms  Young people associated smoking with glamour and sophistication I tried it in college myself but quickly gave it up deterred by the odor the eye irritation and the nagging worry that my mothers fatal   might have been related to this terrible habit Although the surgeon generals report prompted Congress in  to pass a cigarette labeling and advertising law it took six years for that famous warning  The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health  to appear on packs Cigarette advertising was banned on radio and television whereupon the ads moved to magazines  I was a cub reporter at The Minneapolis Tribune when the historic report landed in the newsroom I was assigned to interview the smoking man in the street to assess his reaction to the news that what many nonsmokers viewed as a noxious habit was actually a killer  Several told me theyd cut back and a few thought they would try to quit But the overwhelming majority defended their right and intent to continue smoking As more than one put it By the time I get lung cancer theyll know how to cure it  Well a halfcentury later we still dont know how to cure lung cancer and we may still not know in another  years Furthermore in the decades since the  report damning evidence for the health hazards of smoking has continued to mount The consequences include damage to nearly every organ in the body one in three cancer deaths risk to the health and lives of unborn babies and disease and death among nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke Smoking causes one in five deaths in the United States more than  each year according to the   Tobacco is in a league of its own in terms of the sheer numbers and varieties of ways it kills and maims people Dr Thomas R Frieden the CDC director    And as millions of women came a long way baby  egged on by this slogan for Virginia Slims and a desire to control their weight and achieve gender equity smokingrelated risks caught up to them More women now die each year from lung cancer than    about  more though annual walks runs or ribbons devoted to conquering this runaway killer are lacking Many women were misled by a prevailing belief that they were somehow protected from smokings health effects In fact the risk of death for women who smoke parallels that of male smokers and is  percent higher than the estimates reported in the s Dr Steven A Schroeder    The good news is that weve made dramatic progress in curbing this huge contributor to disease disability and death and in reducing billions of dollars in health care expenditures and lost productivity from smoking  Smoking prevalence is down to  percent today from  percent of adults  years ago Smoking is banned in public buildings on public airplanes trains and buses inside restaurants hospitals and most workplaces and even banished from most private homes  From  to  eight million premature deaths have been prevented because of tobacco control measures Theodore R Holford a Yale statistician and his

manufacturers say they do nothing to attract young smokers they have managed to infiltrate smoking into movies popular among teens subliminally suggesting that this is socially desirable behavior  While teen smoking has declined still nearly one in five teens is a regular smoker Feeling invulnerable teens often ignore warnings about health risks wrinkles and premature death decades in the offing And though told repeatedly that smoking is addictive many still believe they can quit whenever they want  Of the nearly  million Americans still hooked on cigarettes about   Many have tried quitting one or more times without success Some experts believe that those who still smoke represent a particularly challenging group of committed smokers But Ive known several hardcore smokers who

twoweek hiatus following a cardiac scare Richard resumed smoking He finally quit once and for all at age  after one session with a hypnotist and a few sticks of   gum He then became an ardent
