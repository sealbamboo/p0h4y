  Heres another compelling reason to think twice before lighting up a joint Smoking pot may more than double your risk of   according to a new study being presented here today at the International Stroke Conference In the New Zealand study people aged  to  who had a stroke were  times more likely to test positive for   in their urine than those who didnt have a stroke The study doesnt prove that smoking pot will cause a stroke But it provides the strongest evidence to date that a lifestyle that includes cannabis use is closely associated with a doubling of stroke risk says study lead author P Alan Barber MD PhD a professor of clinical neurology at the University of Auckland Dr Barber says he became interested in the topic after treating a young man with none of the traditional   such as   The patient admitted he was smoking pot when the symptoms began That stimulated us to look at the medical literature where we found a sprinkling of case reports of one to three patients with no typical risk factors who were smoking cannabis at the time of their stroke Among them was a patient who recovered and then had a second stroke when again smoking cannabis he says Barber and his colleagues then decided to test young stroke patients admitted to their hospital for the presence of cannabis in their urine The current study included  patients  of them men with ages ranging from  to  years Only about  percent to  percent of all stroke victims fall into this age category most are older Barber notes Most patients  percent had an ischemic stroke  percent had a transient ischemic attack often referred to as a TIA or ministroke The results of their marijuana tests were compared to those from a control group of  patients matched for age gender and ethnicity The control group had not had a stroke but had urine tests for various other reasons Results showed that  percent of stroke patients tested positive for cannabis compared with only  percent of patients who had not had a stroke We were fairly surprised that one in six stroke patients had recently used cannabis Barber says Given the findings we strongly advise that young stroke patients who smoke marijuana dont use it again The researchers also performed a second statistical analysis that took into account a patients age sex and ethnicity The only factor associated with increased risk of stroke or TIA was the use of marijuana It raised risk by fold A major problem with the study was that the researchers had no information on the traditional stroke risk factors in the comparison group That proved particularly problematic when it came to smoking cigarettes  a known stroke risk factor We know that all but one of the stroke patients who were cannabis users also used tobacco We do not know how much  if at all  people in the comparison group used tobacco Barber says However he says he believes the stroke risk is from marijuana use and not tobacco For starters this is a young age group to be having strokes and many didnt have any of the traditional risk factors And some patients had a stroke while actually smoking cannabis he says It also makes sense from a physiological point of view Barber says We know cannabis can cause changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are associated with increased stroke risk Importantly it can also cause heart palpitations which can be a sign of atrial fibrillation And   is very strongly associated with stroke The findings are especially important he adds given that smoking pot may be considered relatively harmless for your health  safer than drinking alcohol or using other drugs Add to that the fact that more than a third of states have   in one form or another and its imperative to know the risks says Barber Other research has linked marijuana to lung disease heart attacks and problems with brain development he says But proponents of marijuana note that other studies show no such links and that still other work has shown marijuana to have medicinal uses ranging from alleviating nausea to managing chronic pain This is a very interesting and important observation says American Stroke Association spokesperson Lee H Schwamm MD director of stroke services at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study The real question he says is whether marijuana is the cause of stroke or representative of another risk factor For example the impact of cigarette smoking may or may not be relevant we simply dont know Dr Schwamm says Barber says his next step is to conduct a similar study where he gathers and takes into account information on tobacco use and other stroke risk factors in a larger control group Research presented at medical meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peerreviewed journal
