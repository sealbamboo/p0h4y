A wine bar is being prosecuted under Health and Safety laws after an 18-year-old woman who drank a cocktail containing liquid nitrogen needed to have her stomach removed.. Gaby Scanlon, from Heysham, Lancashire was celebrating her birthday at Oscar's Wine Bar in Lancaster in October 2012.. After drinking two Nitro Jagermeisters, she said her stomach started to expand..
