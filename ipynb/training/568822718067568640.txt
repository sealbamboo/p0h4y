It stands to reason that when a hospital emergency room closes people in the surrounding neighborhood suffer But how much A new study quantifies the impact in California finding that patients affected by ER closures were  more likely to die after being admitted to a hospital than were patients who didnt lose an ER in their neighborhood The authors of the   published Monday in the journal Health Affairs couldnt say exactly how the disappearance of emergency rooms translated into higher mortality for hospital patients Fewer ERs leads to longer wait times for treatment It also means patients have to travel farther to get emergency room care and it may prompt some to simply stay home All of these factors force patients to wait longer  and perhaps get sicker  by the time they are admitted to a hospital Understanding the implications of ER closures is important since they have been disappearing for years The number of hospital emergency departments in the United States fell from  in  to  in  a  decline Meanwhile the number of patient visits increased from  million to  million a  increase Figures like these prompted the Institute of Medicine to declare that emergency departments were   back in  For the new study a trio of researchers from Harvard Medical School UC San Francisco and the Ecologic Institute in San Mateo Calif examined data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development to see how many hospital emergency rooms were in operation and what happened to the patients they treated From  to   California hospitals that had emergency rooms shut down and another  closed their emergency rooms but remained open according to the study Each of those  hospitals affected a geographic area that the researchers defined by the ZIP codes of the patients who used the facilities During the years studied more than  million patients who visited California ERs were admitted to the hospital A whopping  of themÂ  were from neighborhoods affected by an ER closure and  were not Emergency rooms are required by law to treat all comers regardless of how sick they are or whether they can pay for their care Overall patients who were African American Latino women or adults under the age of  were more likely to have suffered the loss of an ER in their community the researchers found So were patients who were uninsured or were covered by Medicaid the federal insurance program for lowincome Americans The impact of ER closures was greatest on nonelderly adults those between the ages of  and  Among patients in that age group those who lived in an affected area were  more likely to die after being admitted to the hospital compared with patients who didnt lose an ER Elderly patients those  and older appeared more likely to die after being admitted to a hospital if they were from an affected area but the difference wasnt large enough to be statistically significant When the researchers focused on patients from neighborhoods that lost an ER within the previous two years they found that affected patients were  more likely to die during their hospital stay than were patients who hadnt lost an ER so recently The study authors also did a separate analysis of patients who went to an ER because they were suffering from a timesensitive medical emergency Among heart attack patients for example those who were from a region that lost an ER were  more likely to die in the hospital among patients who had a stroke those affected by an ER closure were  more likely to die in the hospital and among patients suffering from a lifethreatening infection causing   those who lost an ER in their community were  more likely to die after being admitted to the hospital Losing an emergency department did not increase the risk of nearterm death for patients who went to an ER seeking treatment for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the researchers found Overall the researchers found nothing good about the disappearance of hospital emergency departments or EDs Disproportionate numbers of ED closures may be driving up inpatient mortality in communities and hospitals with more minority Medicaid and lowincome patients they concluded Our findings regarding the ripple effect of closures on surrounding communities suggest that it may be time to reassess the extent to which market forces are allowed to dictate ED closures and access
