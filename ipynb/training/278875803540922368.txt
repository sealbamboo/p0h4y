Nobody likes to see a baby in pain But its been surprisingly hard for doctors to figure out how to make shots and other medical procedures hurt less The solution might be as simple as giving a baby a bit of sugar water before the shot Or it might not be so simple at all How do we know when a babys hurting A parent might be able to tell the difference between a cry of pain the wet diaper cry and the boy Im tired cry Doctors and nurses lack that intimate knowledge One of the things were struggling with is measures of pain says   a pediatric pain researcher at Connecticut Childrens Medical Center in Hartford With babies I joke that they just refuse to tell us how much theyre hurting Over the past decade sugar has become the gold standard for pain relief from needle sticks in babies under age  More recently that standards been questioned because of disagreements over how to measure that pain A roundup of the medical evidence by the   on using sugar for pain relief reflects that struggle giving sugar a less enthusiastic thumbs up than an earlier Cochrane analysis There is insufficient evidence to confidently judge the effectiveness of sweettasting solutions the reviewers wrote The treatments do however appear promising Most of the studies the Cochrane crew reviewed used the amount of time a baby cries as a measure of pain But quite a few studies have used sugarcoated pacifiers to deliver the sugar Babies typically dont cry when theyve got a pacifier But does that mean theyre not in pain If you were screaming and I put a piece of duct tape over your mouth I wouldnt hear you screaming any more Manworren says Can I say youre not in pain The conflict over measuring babies pain accelerated in  when British researchers   the nerve circuitry of babies given sugar to alleviate pain They saw no change in brain activity But its not clear that thats a good measure of infant pain either It may be better to think of sugar as a compensating pleasure rather than an analgesic that removes pain according to an   published earlier this year in the  e Fascinating as this may be for pain researchers it leaves parents asking if sugar will help ease their babys pain for immunizations and other painful routine procedures What do we have available Manworren replies when asked by Shots Research has shown that acetaminophen isnt very effective and ibuprofen isnt recommended for small babies We still have individual studies that show strong evidence for sugar at least up till age one The other thing absolutely is to use topical anesthetics she says like lidocaine Im a believer that more is better as long as youre attacking the pain pathways in separate ways
