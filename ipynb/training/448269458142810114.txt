A new website is being launched to help adults spot the warning signs of mental health problems in children In Scrubbing Up this week child psychiatrist Dr Raphael Kelvin  who led the project  says if were to really support children with mental health problems we need to more aid  including in the classroom  There are at least  children in the UK with a diagnosed mental health condition and the figure may well be rising  Yet  do not receive the support they are entitled to and need  We are albeit unwittingly condemning thousands of the countrys most vulnerable children to years of distress and lost opportunities Why On the one hand many mental health services for children and young people are underdeveloped and often underfunded   But theres another key problem Many healthcare professionals teachers police volunteers and others who come into contact with them do not know what a mental health condition looks like or how to approach the issue So what needs to be done  There are an estimated m children in the education system making schools a vital place to start   When we polled the public on the issue  said they supported the notion that every school should have a dedicated member of staff on site for children to approach about mental health and wellbeing issues   Nearly twothirds  also felt it was important that every school has regular interaction with a specialist from mental healthcare services   And perhaps most striking is that  would turn to a teacher for help and advice if they suspected a child had a mental health issue  So we need to be supporting schools to be able to identify refer and support those children who show signs of mental ill health and make sure they get the appropriate help quickly  Without investment in school mental health provision were missing a real opportunity to have an impact Beyond the school gates where else should these priorities lie   This is complex topic and it includes further improvement and development of a range of important services  Getting it right online has to be a key focus as thats where many people turn for information first  The same poll highlighted that over a third of adults would not know how to spot a child with a potential mental health issue   Many werent aware that poor appetite and weight loss could be a symptom of depression over half werent sure if waking earlier than usual could be a sign of mental health problems  and excessive boredom and poor concentration can be causes for concern    And when people dont know one of the first places they look is the internet In fact nearly three quarters of adults polled say theyd use the internet for advice on child mental health issues There are a lot of good online resources offering advice and information and numerous discussion forums for sharing experience of mental ill health  But with professionals and volunteers who come into contact with children identified as key in spotting the signs of mental problems and as with physical illness the earlier these conditions are identified the better  a targeted resource for them is needed MindEd an online tool launching today contains bitesize learning  individually tailored to equip any one of the one million professionals and volunteers working with children and young people  including teachers sports coaches police healthcare professionals social workers and many more  with the skills to support and identify children with mental health conditions  It aims to speed up the time it takes to identify a child with a mental health problem and put them on the path to the most appropriate support and where necessary the right treatment  Its free available to everyone and easy to use All too often I see children and young people who enter the health system when theyve been struggling with a mental health problem for a long time   Better support early on  including specific mental health leads in schools and tailored online support for professionals  could be key to catching issues early  And in a world of squeezed budgets and resource pressure we need to make sure resources are being directed in the right way including into the classroom and onto the web
