For months journalists and politicians fixated on the number of people signing up for health insurance through the federal exchange created as part of the Affordable Care Act It turned out that more than  million people signed up using HealthCaregov by April  But perhaps more surprising is that according to federal data released Wednesday to ProPublica there have been nearly  million transactions on the exchange since then People are allowed to sign up and switch plans after certain life events such as job changes moves the birth of a baby marriages and divorces The volume of these transactions was a jolt even for those who have watched the rollout of the ACA most closely Thats higher than I would have expected said   senior vice president for special initiatives at the Kaiser Family Foundation There are a lot of people who qualify for special enrollment but my assumption has been that few of them would actually sign up The impact of the new numbers isnt clear because the Obama administration has not released details of how many consumers failed to pay their premiums and thus were dropped by their health plans All told between the federal exchange and  state exchanges more than  million people signed up for coverage by April  A big question is whether new members will offset attrition ProPublica requested data on the number of daily enrollment transactions on the federal exchange last year under the Freedom of Information Act because the Obama administration had declined to release this information a key barometer of the exchanges performance to the public The administration also has not put out any data on the exchanges activity since the open enrollment period ended The data show socalled  transactions which insurance companies and the government use to enroll new members change a members enrollment status or disenroll members The data cover the  states using the federal exchange which include Texas Florida Illinois Georgia and Michigan When HealthCaregov rolled out last fall   was replete with errors creating a crisis at the backend of the system Between April  and July  the federal government reported sending  socalled  transactions to insurance companies each report can cover more than one person in the same family That includes  for the rest of April  in May  in June and  in the first  days of July The daily rate has been fairly stable over this period It wasnt immediately clear how many of the records involved plan changes or cancellations and how many were for new enrollments An insurance industry official estimated that less than half of the transactions are new enrollments The rest are changes When an existing member makes a change to his or her policy two s are created  one terminating the old plan and one opening the new one Charles Gaba who runs the website acasignupsnet that tracks enrollment numbers estimates that between  and  people have signed up for coverage each day on the federal exchange after the official enrollment period ended Gabas predictions were remarkably accurate during the open enrollment period That doesnt account for attrition That doesnt mean that they paid Gaba said Thats been based on limited data from a half dozen of the smaller exchanges extrapolated out nationally The federal data obtained by ProPublica confirm some other facts about the rollout of HealthCaregov which was hobbled initially by technical problems The slowest day was Oct  when no  transactions were sent That was followed by Oct  the day the website launched when a grand total of six records were sent to insurers By contrast the busiest day was March  which was supposed to be the end of open enrollment when  of the socalled  reports were sent to insurers The entire last week in March was busy About  percent of those who signed up for coverage on the federal exchange were eligible to receive government subsidies to help lower their monthly premiums Those subsidies are being challenged by lawsuits in federal court contending they arent allowed by the Affordable Care Act Two federal appeals courts came to conflicting decisions Tuesday on the permissibility of the subsidies one said yes the other no They will remain in effect as the cases proceed in the courts the Obama administration said The next time that the general public can sign up for coverage through the exchanges is from November  to February   Click   to download the data released to ProPublica under the Freedom of Information Act Read ProPublicas previous coverage of the   and
