As New Years resolutions go cutting back on food and drink are right at the top of the list And while those resolved to change their eating habits may cut the carbohydrates or say a sweet   for regular drinkers the tradition may involve whats known as a dry January giving up booze for a month But could such a shortterm breakup with alcohol really impart any measurable health benefits Recently the staff at the British magazine   decided to find out using themselves as guinea pigs The findings of their small but intriguing   suggest the answer is a resounding yes Fourteen healthy   employees filled out lifestyle questionnaires underwent ultrasounds and gave blood samples Then  of them gave up alcohol for five weeks while four of them continued drinking normally Normal drinking for the   group ranged from  units of alcohol per week  the   of about eight ounce bottles of regularstrength beer  to  units or  beers per week Those numbers may seem high but in Britain where drinking is a national pastime the groups supervising doctor told them none were problem drinkers Incidentally Britains National Health Service   no more than  to  alcohol units per week The results of these changes were significant enough to make you put down your pint and take notice Dr Rajiv Jalan a liver specialist at the   analyzed the findings They revealed that liver fat a precursor to liver damage for all of those in the study who gave up drinking fell by at least  percent and almost  percent for some Abstainers also saw their blood glucose levels  a key factor in determining diabetes risk  fall by an average of  percent Its the first study to show such an immediate drop from going dry says Dr James Ferguson a liver specialist at   in England who was not involved in the experiment Overall Ferguson says the evidence is convincing but not all that surprising If you take time off from alcohol its going to be beneficial for your liver from the reduction of fat he tells The Salt People always forget the amount of calories in alcohol so if you take a month off and you usually consume  units youre going to lose weight and fat Its a massive reduction in calories  The main causes of   are obesity and excessive alcohol consumption Alcohol changes the way the liver processes fat resulting in more fat cells that can cause inflammation leading to liver disease But Ferguson warns that a dry January could trigger the same sort of negative boomerang effect as do restrictive diets First you abstain then you binge to make up for it He questions whether a dry January leads to a wetterthannormal February Beyond that theres the question of whether and how much these improvements last in the long run Ferguson takes a sobering view I dont think taking one month a year off alcohol makes any difference he says Its more important to cut back generally In fact The British Liver Trust doesnt endorse a dry January saying the tradition is medically futile and encourages alcohol abuse the rest of the year Instead the Trust suggests staying off the sauce   allowing the liver to recover regularly
