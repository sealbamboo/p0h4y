KATY Tex  Like many parents of children with   Nicole Brown feared she might never find a dentist willing and able to care for her daughter Camryn Cunningham now a lanky yearold who uses words sparingly Finishing a basic cleaning was a colossal challenge because Camryn was bewildered by the lights in her face and the odd noises from instruments like the saliva suctioner  not to mention how utterly unfamiliar everything was to a girl accustomed to routine Sometimes shed panic and bolt from the office Then in May Ms Brown  a juvenile supervision officer found Dr Amy LuedemannLazar a pediatric dentist in this suburb of Houston Unlike previous dentists Dr LuedemannLazar didnt suggest that Camryn would need to be sedated or immobilized Instead she suggested weekly visits to help her learn to be cooperative step by step with lots of breaks so she wouldnt be overwhelmed Bribery helped If she sat calmly for  seconds her reward was listening to a snippet of a Beyonc song on her sisters iPod This month Camryn sat still in the chair hands crossed on her lap for no less than  minutes through an entire cleaning  her second ever  even as purplegloved hands hovered near her face holding a noisy tooth polisher At the end Dr LuedemannLazar examined Camryns teeth and declared her cavityfree and ready to see an orthodontist It was like a breakthrough Ms Brown said adding Dr Amy didnt just turn her away Parents of children with special needs have long struggled to find dentists who will treat them In a   nearly threefifths of  randomly chosen general dentists in Michigan said they would not provide care for children on the autism spectrum twothirds said the same for adults But as more and more children receive diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder more dentists and dental hygienists are recognizing that with accommodations many of them can become cooperative patients Researchers are studying how to overcome dental fears and sensory challenges in children with autism And continuingeducation programs are helping dentists and their staffs supplement what they learned in dental school  or more likely didnt learn  about treating children with special needs Dr John S Rutkauskas the chief executive of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry said its members were growing more interested in learning such skills but he added Its still a relatively small pool of practitioners Dr Elizabeth Shick a pediatric dentist who helped write  for Autism Speaks an advocacy organization agreed With the increase of autism spectrum disorder patients out there there are not enough pediatric dentists to see everyone she said The page kit has been downloaded more than  times since its release in  Autism Speaks also has a   with  dentists referred by parents up from  in  its first year Other kinds of help are available too Dr David Tesini a dentist in Sudbury Mass recently released   that teaches professionals how to familiarize an uncooperative child with a dental cleaning The first DVD has long been used in some pediatric dental practices  including Dr LuedemannLazars Dr Tesini said he developed the program in part because very often parents believe that their child is not ready to go to the dentist and has behavioral problems that the dental team wont be able to manage Its wrong he continued Thats the message we have to get out More than  dental professionals have completed a   in treating patients with autism Of more than  offerings on the site  from primers on   to piercings  the threehour lesson has been the No  monthly course nine times since  The instructor is Josalyn Sewell a dental hygienist whose yearold son has autism and was once sedated to fill a cavity She calls herself a mom on a mission There are children who are completely nonverbal she said and if they have a toothache it completely shuts them down For some children with autism a first visit to the dentist may not occur until age  or  mouth care goes on the back burner until theres a potential emergency Its overwhelming to have so many needs finding a special school and special services said one mother Shoshana Handel who works at the University of New Mexico If the kids mouth isnt bleeding Im not worried about a dentist When her nonverbal son Aodhan was  she finally took him to the dentist because she worried he had a painful cavity He didnt thankfully But experts say children should start   as toddlers  long before there are   to be drilled and filled  for the same reasons early intervention is important in areas like walking talking and interacting with others It allows us to train a child to their highest potential said Dr Cavan Brunsden a pediatric dentist in Old Bridge NJ If the first visit does not take place until theres an emergency he continued we need to fix their decayed teeth and then also train them to become a compliant patient for life Another issue is general   which requires a specialist to administer and may entail hospital costs so its generally not recommended for routine care like a cleaning It also has risks including   and nausea and in very rare cases brain damage or death A   of roughly  patient charts in The Journal of the American Dental Association found that children with autism spectrum disorder were more likely than others to be uncooperative and to be put under general anesthesia Preventive care to ward off decay can reduce that likelihood Dr Brunsden said adding that if you see a child when theyre super young and train them properly to experience preventive   general anesthesia becomes unnecessary Mrs Sewell the hygienist urges fellow parents to push for regular cleanings What kills me is maybe they tried to go to the dentist once it didnt go well and everybody throws their hands up she said Because no two children are alike dentists and parents are finding a variety of accommodations to make visits go more smoothly A   with  participants at Boston Childrens Hospital found that for some children video goggles that show a favorite movie helped reduce stress during cleanings for example I could probably do any dental procedure I needed to do including a filling and giving local anesthesia said Dr Linda P Nelson the senior dentist on the study which included cleaning visits only But the goggles made a few children even more anxious At the University of Southern California researchers are studying whether sensory adaptations can reduce distress For their pilot study  children  of them with autism were given dental cleanings in a darkened room with colored lights projected on the ceiling and a weighted vest that delivered soothing pressure Leah I Stein an occupational therapy researcher at the universitys dental school said that every patient was able to finish a cleaning even those who in the past had required general anesthesia or immobilization on a socalled papoose board We found a reduction in behavioral distress physiological distress and child report of pain she added This fall Karen Raposa a dental hygienist in Raynham Mass and a coauthor of a  book Treating the Dental Patient with a Developmental Disorder plans to give six   at continuingeducation conferences There is a lot more awareness about autism in the dental community which is driving dental professionals to seek more information and want to take more continuing education to learn how to provide care for this population she said Ms Raposa whose son has profound autism noted that it takes extra time to get these kids to trust you and that costs chair time  that costs the dentist money But Dr LuedemannLazar said that in her office desensitization visits were usually delegated to her hygienist and assistant though a room needs to be set aside From the dentist perspective once you learn the DTermined program and train your staff its not that different she said You go in and do an exam at the end Dr Robert Rada a specialneeds dentist with a solo practice in La Grange Ill says children with autism need time and flexibility to settle into the routine He invites parents into the treatment room because they can translate for nonverbal children But the extra work is not only rewarding its also financially so he said Once you capture that kid as a patient you have the whole family and a bunch of referrals coming to you About the grateful parents he added They talk you up and it goes a long way Â
