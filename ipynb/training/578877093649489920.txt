Fast food has gotten a little better for you over the last  years  except in cases where its gotten worse Among  menu items subjected to scrutiny by Tufts University researchers eight of the offerings contained fewer calories in  than in  and nine contained more In addition five of the  items tested for sodium content had less of it at the end of the year period and seven had more The researchers looked up nutritional information for all of the cheeseburgers French fries grilled chicken sandwiches and nondiet sodas sold between  and  at three leading fastfood chains The restaurants werent mentioned by name but one of them was the top restaurant on the basis of sales  a designation that describes McDonalds The other two chains had similar menu items a national presence and were in the top  for total US sales revenue  attributes that   Burger King and Wendys The researchers from Tufts Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging and the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy declined to confirm or deny these identities In general the calorie content of similar items varied from chain to chain the researchers found For instance an order of small fries at one of the chains packed  more calories than an order of small fries at one of the other chains The one exception to this trend was largesized orders of fries The calorie content of foods also varied over time An order of small fries at the top chain contained  calories more in  than it did in  At the other two chains the calorie count for small fries rose by  and  during the same period The story was about the same with   which varied by chain for all menu items except for the small cheeseburgers If you ordered large fries in  for example you could be served anywhere from  to  milligrams of sodium per  calories of potatoes the researchers discovered All three restaurants saw the amount of   in French fries plummet to undetectable levels between  and  That was due to a   launched by New York City officials against partially hydrogenated oils and to the people who followed their lead These oils are handy for food producers because they have a long shelf life but theyre bad for the body because they raise levels of LDL cholesterol the bad kind while lowering levels of HDL cholesterol the good kind A typical meal  a large cheeseburger large fries and large drink  at a one of the fastfood joints would make it pretty difficult for a wellmeaning person to stick to sensible diet limits the researchers demonstrated If you were trying limit yourself to  calories per day in  that meal would have accounted for well over half of your daily calories no matter which of the three restaurants you patronized Depending on the chain those three items would add up to between  and  of your recommended daily calories the researchers calculated The US Department of Agriculture has somewhat detailed calorie recommendations based on age and gender online   The   from the USDA and the US Department of Health and Human Services advise people to eat no more than  to  milligrams of sodium per day depending on age and health history If you ordered your cheeseburger meal at the lowestsodium chain youd be consuming  to  of your daily sodium in a single sitting In the highestsodium chain that meal would account for  to  of your allowable sodium The cheeseburger alone would account for about  to  of your daily sodium the researchers reported Fastfood chains may seem like an easy target for nutrition experts but the researchers said their investigation was warranted because Americans eat more than onethird of their calories away from home and about  of those calories come from fastfood establishments The results appeared in a pair of reports published Wednesday in the journal   which is published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
