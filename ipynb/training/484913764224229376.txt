
 John Ash the renowned cooking teacher chef and James Beard Awardwinning author  sometimes assigns this  wonderful exercise to  his students adopt a bean and cook  with it  I decided to do just that this week I spent a lot of time perusing the website of Rancho Gordo the  purveyor of amazing heirloom beans in Napa Calif  I ordered five  varieties of beans and Ill be bringing you recipes over the coming months You dont have to use the heirlooms  which do average about  a pound as opposed to supermarket varieties that usually sell for under  Ill give you alternative supermarket beans to use in the recipes But the textures and colors of the heirloom varieties are  extraordinary This week I cooked up two  simple pots of beans using two varieties a somewhat large roundish dark reddishbrown mottled bean called Good Mother Stallard  and a gorgeous black and white mottled  bean a little larger than standard black beans called vaqueros All I did was add a quartered onion a few minced cloves of garlic and plenty of salt to the soaked beans I didnt even saut the onion and garlic first  I cooked the beans in their soaking water simmering them for about one and a half to two  hours and ended up with deeply flavored plush beans that really could have stood alone In fact the following day  and beans are always better on the following day  I just snipped a little bit of cilantro into the broth and enjoyed them just so  they were even good cold  Heres what Rancho Gordo has to say about the Good Mother Stallards Just this bean some onion some garlic and a splash of olive oil are all you need for cooking and the result is a luscious bean fiesta  But I couldnt help going ahead and using them in other dishes summer dishes that dont require a lot of fuss  About vaqueros Rancho Gordo says A really lovely cousin to the Anasazi beans vaqueros have intriguing black and white markings not unlike an appaloosa horse might don The flavor is somewhat like the Anasazi but its a little lighter The real fun is the inky black pot liquor  There is a similar looking bean called the orca but Rancho Gordo says many mottled black and white beans are called orcas and that vaqueros really look more like horses than whales Rancho Gordo  recommends as pot beans for chili and for stews I used them for tostadas and pot beans The pot liquor is indeed irresistible especially with a handful of chopped cilantro added to it The beans can break apart a little but they dont break down the way starchy beans like large white  limas and dried fava beans do   This is the most amazing version of tuna and bean salad Ive ever tasted thanks to Good Mother Stallard beans  This version of succotash is limabeanfree with a kick that is a lively contrast to the sweet corn  Refried heirloom vaquero beans add a special touch to these tostadas but black beans work too  Canned beans can also be used in this composed salad with a base of sweet corn and pungent arugula  Once the beans are done this pasta dish takes only  minutes
