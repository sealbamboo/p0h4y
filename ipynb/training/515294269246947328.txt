Nearly one in seven antibiotic treatments given out by GPs for common infections over the last two decades in the UK have failed researchers say The Cardiff University study assessed nearly m prescriptions handed out between  and  to establish the level of antibiotic resistance Overall researchers found the drugs failed in just under  of cases But they said the rise seen over the year period  from  to   was not as great as they had expected Report author Prof Craig Currie said while this was not quite the cliff that many people had feared it was still concerning Given the lack of new antibiotics being developed the growing ineffectiveness of antibiotics is very worrying indeed There is a mistaken perception that antibiotic resistance is only a danger for hospital patients We need to ensure that patients receive the appropriate medication of their condition and minimise any unnecessary or inappropriate treatment which could be fuelling resistance prolonging illness and in some cases killing people During the study which was funded by drugs firm Abbott Healthcare Products and is published in the British Medical Journal researchers looked at patients given antibiotics for infections ranging from skin and ear complaints to those affecting the chest throat and sinuses To establish which prescriptions were failing the team looked at which patients needed an alternative treatment within  days of the prescription being issued or if the patient was admitted to hospital or died with an infectionrelated illness  This is not proof of resistance developing but it is considered a reasonable way of estimating it The period which saw the biggest increase in antibiotic failure   to   was also the period when more patients began to be treated with the drugs Between those years the proportion of patients with infections who were given antibiotics rose from  to  Edinburgh University infectious disease expert Prof Mark Woolhouse said the research was welcome because while antibiotic resistance was a huge concern there was a paucity of hard data available We are increasingly reliant on a dwindling arsenal of drugs That supports calls to develop new drugs but also and probably even more importantly in the long term to reduce usage and develop alternative therapies Prof Mark Fielder of Kingston University agreed adding There is a continued need for education across the spectrum with both patients and medical professionals being aware of the importance of this issue
