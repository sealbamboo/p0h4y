Theres been a lot of talk recently about an old malady that seems to be on the rise Its called Chagas disease and its transmitted by the socalled kissing bug a bloodsucking insect that bites your face and lips Health economists have now put a price tag on the global cost of   and the illness is taking a heavier toll than previously appreciated Chagas costs the world about  billion annually says the analysis just   in the   Thats more than the global cost of cervical cancer or cholera Most Chagas cases occur in Latin America but the disease is spreading northward About  Americans mostly Texans are thought to carry the Chagas parasite  Those US infections could be running about  million each year in health care costs and lost productivity the study estimates Of course all these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt Theyre rough approximates based on computer models for how much it costs to treat Chagas and losses incurred when sick people cant work or die prematurely  two things that are really tough to nail down The main thing is to view the order of magnitude   of the University of Pittsburgh tells Shots The numbers are based on some assumptions but we tried to be conservative and underestimate the costs These high costs could offer some incentive to pay more attention to Chagas   who also worked on the study tells Shots Hotez thinks of Chagas as the   of the Americas Theyre both chronic conditions that require longterm treatment and they get transmitted through blood transfusions and during pregnancy he says But the parallels dont go much further than that If caught early Chagas is curable and many people infected show few or no symptoms Chagas does cause serious heart problems in about  to  percent of cases Once the heart symptoms appear they often are irreversible Hotez says The drugs are toxic and they dont work very well Kissing bugs are widespread in Texas he says and a high percentage of them carry   But right now doctors in the US arent looking for Chagas So its tough to say just how common it is Theres an astonishing lack of awareness with doctors about this disease Hotez says They misdiagnose it as a form of cardiomyopathy Unless you specifically look for it you wont find it
