Just last week a friend told me about a gel polish manicure that stayed flawless through two weeks of mucking out stables and dish washing Since Im lucky if I get through a day without ruining polish this seemed like a technological breakthrough Then I saw a   in Wednesdays   investigating whether the ultraviolet light used to dry gel nails causes skin cancer I decided Id better find out a bit more before I paint This isnt a totally loony question In  the same journal   that two women got skin cancer on the backs of their hands they both used UV nail lights But theres no evidence that the lamps caused their cancers No one had actually studied the lamps themselves Dr Lyndsay Shipp the lead author of this weeks report and a dermatologist at Georgia Regents University in Augusta told me We thought we could add something to the puzzle Shipp measured the amount of UV coming out of nail dryers at  different salons Overall the amount of UV was very low but it varied a lot from one machine to another It also varied within the devices My pinkie finger might be getting a different amount than my thumb Her conclusion Because of the low UV levels the skin cancer risk even from repeated salon visits remains small But that doesnt mean the polishes get a free pass according to   a clinical assistant professor of dermatology at NYU Langone Medical Center The problem is theres no regulation of nail lamp exposure Adigun told me For patients who arent concerned about the melanoma risk do know about the photoaging that comes from UV exposure In other words my nails might look great now but extra UV exposure speeds my hands toward wizened lizard status Adigun knows that even the threat of lizard claws probably wont discourage women from gel manicures Last year she gave a lecture on health issues with gel nails at the American Academy of Dermatology meeting and the nail industry was not amused It caused a whole hullabaloo Her mother wasnt amused either it turns out shes a major gel polish fan To protect the hands Adigun recommends wearing sunscreen during UV nail sessions as well as photoprotective gloves with the fingertips snipped off Thats what I gave my mom for Christmas UV exposure is a bigger issue for people who work in nail salons because theyre there all day And that applies not just to skin but also to eyes Ultraviolet exposure is a main cause of cataracts and probably contributes to   which is a leading cause of blindness in older people Thats why   a consulting professor at the Duke School of Medicine and a dermatologist in High Point NC thinks that when youre at the salon you should wear appropriate eye protection such as sunglasses that provide protection from ultraviolet Then theres what happens after that superdurable polish comes off which requires soaking in acetone for  minutes The polish blocks oxygen transfer through the nail and nails can emerge discolored and thin Draelos says she has seen cases where a persons nail has separated from the nail bed or has turned green due to infections that were hidden by the polish Thats true for artificial acrylic nails too Draelos says I tell my patients to never wear them for more than three months consecutively she says That allows oxygen transfer to be reestablished and improves the health of the nail Once the polish comes off the doctors recommend using protective ointments to help nails recover Still none of the dermatologists said that gel manicures should be avoided completely Rather they said be sure to take breaks and be prepared to give nails some extra love Its the manicure for the working woman it really is Adigun says Im very sympathetic to making this manicure work in womens lives
