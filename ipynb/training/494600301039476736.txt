Drugresistant malaria is spreading in South East Asia and has now reached the CambodiaThailand border according to a study Radical action is needed to prevent further spread of malaria parasites resistant to key drugs say scientists The spread could undermine recent gains in malaria control they report in   No evidence was found of resistance in three African sites  Kenya Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo The study analysed blood samples from more than  malaria patients in  countries across Asia and Africa It found the malaria parasite had developed resistance to frontline drugs known as artemisinins in western and northern Cambodia Thailand Vietnam and eastern Burma also known as Myanmar There were signs of emerging resistance in central Burma southern Laos and northeastern Cambodia Of particular concern was the corner of Asia on the CambodiaThailand border where resistance to other antimalarial drugs has emerged in the past Resistance is now present over much of South East Asia said lead scientist Prof Nicholas White of the University of Oxford Its worse than we expected We have to act quickly if we are going to do anything Prof White said it might be possible to prevent further spread but conventional malariacontrol approaches would not be enough We will need to take more radical action and make this a global public health priority without delay he added Meanwhile a separate study also published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported early results of an antimalarial drug in the pipeline  Commenting on the research Dr Brian Greenwood from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said The emergence of artemisininresistant parasites is a major threat to further advances in malaria control  Every effort needs to be made to contain their spread while at the same time pushing forward with the development of effective alternative treatments that are almost certainly going to be needed in the future
