Four generations live under one roof in the Jackson household in Sacramento Calif  yearold Loretta and her husband her daughters and granddaughter her sister and her yearold father There are a lot of breakfasts to prepare and Loretta usually starts the laundry and other chores at about  in the morning Part of her daily routine is working with Shirlene Lorettas yearold sister who suffered a stroke in  that left her partially paralyzed and unable to speak She couldnt say nothing Loretta says Nothing at all The doctors and therapists didnt give Shirlene very good odds for recovery They said Well weve pretty much done all we can do Its not going to come back  says Loretta That didnt stop her from trying to help her sister heal Loretta and Shirlene grew up in Hope Ark in a family of six siblings Loretta felt stuck in Arkansas and moved to California in the s But she went back for Shirlene after the aneurysm and brought her into her home even leaving her job to care for her sister full time She and her husband Milton built a new bedroom and bathroom onto the back of their home where Shirlene now spends much of her day Every morning after breakfast with the morning game shows running on her TV Loretta and Shirlene work on a daily routine of physical and speech therapy Shirlene practices writing lefthanded now and pronouncing several useful words  like apple and buttons  that she keeps nearby on a paper list Loretta massages and stretches Shirlenes legs to improve her circulation She flexes and rubs her hands and arms particularly the right hand which when left alone will twist itself into a knot And slowly but steadily as Loretta improvised these therapies with her sister Shirlenes ability to move came back She has learned to stand and move around slowly with a cane She can now tie her shoes and even sew with her left hand and teeth She can also write a little and has regained a bit more of her ability to speak Loretta Jackson also provides aroundtheclock care to her father Theodis Turner who came to live with the family five years ago after he was diagnosed with dementia His symptoms can make him erratic at times and even routine things like bath time can become a struggle You have those days where hell say OK Im in the tub and hell get in fully dressed Lorretta says And if he gets in fully dressed youve got to try to get his clothes off He wont get out of the tub  with the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health says Loretta Jacksons experience is emblematic of the struggles of the sandwich generation of caregivers  people who are squeezed between balancing the needs and demands of aging parents and their own children or in Lorettas case a disabled sister The experience for these caregivers is quite burdensome emotionally and physically Hoffman says The work these family caregivers are doing would be enormously expensive if their loved ones were instead in nursing homes or other institutions Hoffman says But the caregivers also often find they must cut their hours at work or as in Lorettas case give up outside jobs in order to care for their relatives In effect Hoffman says we are taking care of the most vulnerable in our society  aging adults who have chronic care needs  by placing the burden on the backs of some of the people who can least afford to do  those who are themselves economically fragile and vulnerable In California Lorettas dad and sister get assistance from the state which allows them to pay Loretta about  an hour to work as their caregiver But the state Legislature is considering changes to the program that could limit her hours and reduce that income The burden is not just financial Loretta Jackson says the daily grind of running a household and providing care to her sister and dad can sometimes take its toll on   health too Some days I sit down and I cant move Loretta says Its like my body just will go into a spasm Then I go to the doctor and she will say Well we cant find anything Youre OK maybe you were just overtired or overexhausted Maybe so but I couldnt move I couldnt do anything Loretta also worries about how her family would get by if anything happened to her I am their backbone she says If I go down and I cant provide for them and I dont have anyone that can step in they probably would go down as well Or have to be placed in a nursing home or other facility And Im praying that never has to happen Loretta and Shirlene likely have many years ahead of them  together It wont be easy but what keeps Loretta going is her belief that one day Shirlene will be able to more easily walk and talk again
