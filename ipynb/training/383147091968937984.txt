In Pennsylvania more than a halfmillion people who dont have insurance are waiting to hear whether the state will take advantage of a Medicaid expansion thats part of the Affordable Care Act The federal law would allow people earning up to   to sign up for Medicaid But a Supreme Court ruling that largely upheld the law gave states the choice whether to expand their Medicaid programs About   with the Obama administration Pennsylvania falls into that latter category leaving the states working poor in limbo for now Substitute teacher Susan Mull says she has lived without insurance for  years At age  that would be stressful enough but Mull also is HIVpositive She was diagnosed  years ago I never thought that I would become a grandmother says Mull We were told in the early s that we simply wouldnt live long Because of how little Mull and her husband earn they could qualify for Medicaid under an expansion The annual income limit for a couple is  Mull says shes never been sick and receives lowcost care and free HIV medication through government programs But she says full health care coverage  including checkups eye exams and dental visits  would bring a level of security she hasnt known for a long time Ill be able to embrace that whole part of the system that I have been away from for  years says Mull While Republican governors in neighboring New Jersey and Ohio have agreed to expand Medicaid Pennsylvania Gov Tom Corbett hasnt yet Earlier this month he proposed the   which includes a Medicaid overhaul It still taps into the billions of dollars in federal Medicaid expansion money available to states but it also asks the federal government to approve significant changes in how the program is run Part of the proposal is similar to those in Arkansas and Iowa New enrollees would get coverage from  health insurance companies through health exchanges Corbett also wants new beneficiaries to look for work and pay a premium of up to  a month Its a Pennsylvaniabased plan that is based on commonsense reforms creates real health care choices reduces government bureaucracy and provides a pathway to independence for all Pennsylvanians said Corbett in announcing his proposal The US Department of Health and Human Services says it needs more detailed information before approving the proposal HHS is committed to supporting state flexibility and working with states to design Medicaid programs that work for them within the confines of the law says agency spokesman Fabien Levy Advocates for expanding the Medicaid program in Pennsylvania say theyre encouraged the governor has proposed something But theyd prefer a plan that doesnt place new burdens on beneficiaries The work requirement provision we obviously have concerns about  we dont want to see more barriers created for folks to access care says Antoinette Kraus director of the Pennsylvania Health Access Network Insurance companies and the health care industry are pleased Corbett wants to pursue federal funds to expand Medicaid The more people that walk through the doors of hospitals  who are insured  the better off our hospitals are says Curt Schroder regional executive of the Delaware Valley Healthcare Council Still Schroder says there are many details to work out That means those who could benefit from a Medicaid expansion like Susan Mull will have to wait While some states begin signing up Medicaid beneficiaries on Oct  it could be months before that happens in Pennsylvania
