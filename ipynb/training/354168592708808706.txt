If youre having chest pain your doctor can test you for a heart attack If youre having hip pain your doctor could test for osteoarthritis But what if youre depressed Or anxious Currently there are no physical tests for most disorders that affect the mind Lab tests like these could transform the field of mental illness So far efforts to come up with biomarkers for common mental health disorders have proved largely fruitless That doesnt stop people from trying Doctors are looking to create them and patients are taking them too even though they know that existing biomarkers  for Alzheimers disease for instance  have serious limitations Six years ago Robin Jones of Menlo Park Calif found himself in a parking lot He had no idea where his car was That was unlike him A yearold scientist who worked on nuclear energy plants he was good with details It was you know I cant believe this Jones says now I can always remember where the car is At work he had a hard time finding the right words Hed come home and tell his wife Anne Somethings different Robin Jones made an appointment at the   where he went through the standard cognitive evaluation for Alzheimers disease  memorizing lists of words and so on Jones did pretty well on the tests Better says Stanford neurologist   than youd expect from someone in the early stages of the disease He didnt fit neatly into this classic presentation of Alzheimers disease Greicus says and thats one of the reasons we talked fairly early on about looking at biomarkers When Greicius says biomarkers hes referring to a very new thing in Alzheimers disease and a very old thing in many other diseases objective lab tests Those are physical measures that can help doctors understand what is going on in a patients body One Alzheimers test checks spinal fluid for proteins that are signatures of the disease Another uses a PET scan to look for physical evidence of brain changes Jones chose the spinal fluid test It seemed to me it would sharpen up my understanding of what was happening he says These tests dont offer the certainty of say a pregnancy test Some people who test positive for the Alzheimerslinked proteins show no outward signs of the disease But a positive result in combination with symptoms like Jones experienced is a pretty definitive diagnosis of Alzheimers Greicius says Researchers say the Alzheimers tests limited as they are give a hint as to what may be ahead with other mental disorders like bipolar disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD As evidence they point to the transformation thats happened with biological tests for disorders like heart disease and cancer When I was a medical student  years ago patients would come in with chest pains and we would spend a lot of time talking to them says   a professor in radiology and biomechanical engineering at the University of California San Francisco Nowadays you draw blood enzymes Weiner says And if a person has a rise in certain enzymes that come out of the heart we say they had a heart attack And if theres no rise in the enzymes we say you didnt have a heart attack These days Weiner is looking for patterns in brain imaging to see if the scans can reveal PTSD or traumatic brain injury But the brain is vastly more complicated than the heart And it is taking Weiner and others much longer than many might have hoped to find biomarkers for mental disorders Weiner shows three MRIs of three different people One is a healthy yearold man Another is a yearold man who has quite severe PTSD The third is of an older woman with Alzheimers disease He points in each scan to a part of the brain called the hippocampus thats involved in memory He says this part of the brain tends to be smaller in people with Alzheimers and PTSD than in healthy people Thats true when groups of people are averaged together But when it comes down to individuals its impossible to tell whos in trouble and whos not he says Heres the hippocampus in a healthy person and heres a hippocampus in the person with PTSD Weiner says and they both look pretty much the same Despite the difficulties scientists are still hunting mental health biomarkers that would be clearcut and simple  similar to the kind of blood and urine tests were all familiar with One multimilliondollar effort funded by private foundations and the US military is looking for biomarkers for PTSD and traumatic brain injury the idea is to explore whether changes in certain brain chemicals like cortisol and norepinephrine which have been associated with anxiety and fear could be signals of PTSD according to   head of psychiatry at New York University Langone Medical Center who is leading the   There is a biological footprint of learned fear Marmar says The question is he adds are there downstream effects If there were it would be easier to identify soldiers with PTSD and get them treatment In the case of Robin Jones he and his wife were just looking for a clearer diagnosis Anne Jones was the first to find out the results of her husbands Alzheimers test The spinal tap test came back positive for tau and amyloid proteins both suggestive of Alzheimers disease Sad yes there was sadness she says But there is a certain amount of relief Theres relief knowing why your arm hurts or why you have a bad cough Knowing how to sort of chart out the rest of our time together The test helped the couple realize that soon he was going to need her in ways he hadnt before They decided she should take a trip by herself to Florence Italy to see the great works of art she had studied in college And when she came back she felt refreshed she says and ready for the challenges ahead
