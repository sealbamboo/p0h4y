When my partner Cheryl was dying from respiratory complications related to treatment for Hodgkins lymphoma she was in so much physical distress she couldnt bear to be touched The only contact she could stand  one of the few ways I could share my love with her  was for me to rub her feet As I stood at the foot of her hospital bed doing just that a scrubclad figure we had never seen before poked her head in the door curled her lip and demanded What is your relationship The question was clearly directed at me but my girlfriend reached through her druginduced hypoxic haze to respond with her New Yorker toughgirl attitude Really Whose feet do you rub like this What the hell are you the relationship police The Scrub Clad Phantom scampered away and we never saw her again Although a curled lip seems to be the universal sign for You disgust me we werent at all sure that the question was motivated by homophobia Scrubclad figures poking their heads into hospital rooms and asking random questions without so much as a word of introduction isnt a problem just for people in the LGBT community If youve been hospitalized youve probably had a similar experience But LGBT people have been so systematically discriminated against misunderstood and at best ignored within the health system that when we walk into a practitioners office or a hospital room we dont assume that were starting at neutral in the interaction because we know better Consider the stories just within my social circle Its possible that because I was the caregiver to two partners who died of cancer I know I know dont stand next to me in a lightning storm and because I am a nurse in our very underserved communities I am exposed to more of these types of stories than the average person But even though the federal government just recently admitted   we do know that significant health disparities exist lesbian and bisexual women are  gay men especially gay men of color are  Bisexual women have  screening than straight women or lesbians  one in five transgendergender nonconforming respondents reported postponing or not using health care in the previous year because of prior experiences of mistreatment in health care settings Additionally much of the community carries with us the trauma of the early years of the AIDS crisis when the American government and much of the American healthcare system ignored  or was even overtly hostile to  a community in the midst of a devastating crisis of health Not exactly a condition conducive to trust It would take the systematic dismantling of entrenched societal institutional and familial homophobia biphobia and transphobia in order to completely address the health disparities that the LGBT community faces which I suppose is a bit of a tall order for a Friday afternoon So the Association of American Medical Colleges  earlier this month urging integration of culturally competent LGBT health care across the med school curriculum is a great start Even if the guidelines are universally adopted it will be years before well see their impact on practice but some of the simple yet important changes the report is championing could easily be put to work today What if providers asked every patient if they had a preferred gender pronoun or if they had a name a rather than the one on the insurance card that theyd prefer to go by While this is an important safety concern especially for people of trans experience many people experience discomfort using their legal name My grandma cringed at hearing her given name Viola while in the hospital rather than the name she was known as at home Though after she had a beloved grandchild named after her she didnt mind so much And even beyond being inclusive isnt Who do you have to support you a much more relevant question in health care than asking what kind of romantic partnership a patient is involved in When the uninformed wonder why LGBT people need special health care with lines such as Is there such a thing as a lesbian knee theyve misunderstood not so much the LGBT community but the nature of health care There is no such thing as a lesbian knee or a lesbian armpit or a lesbian neck  at least Ive never dated one  but each human being comes to health care with a context and a story and they both are vitally important
