Imagine that scientists wanted to take Ebola virus and see if it could ever become airborne by deliberately causing mutations in the lab and then searching through those new viruses to see if any spread easily through the air Would that be OK The question was posed by   a microbiologist at Stanford University at a twoday   being held at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington DC to discuss whether some experiments with germs are so risky that the dangers arent worth the potential benefits Researchers call these gainoffunction experiments Take a bug thats bad and give it some genes that just might give the microbes new abilities The work has   Some of the most prominent figures in this saga showed up at the historic National Academy of Sciences building this week to have another go at it The controversy   a few years ago with some experiments that took a bird flu virus and altered it so that it spread easily between ferrets the lab standin for people Critics said the scientists had created a superflu that could cause a pandemic in people if it ever got out of the lab but the researchers said their work was essential to understanding how flu viruses can jump from animals into people and start devastating flu pandemics This disagreement rumbled along until this summer when some highprofile lab mishaps with other infectious agents prompted the government to temporarily   certain federally funded research projects that might make three viruses  influenza SARS and MERS  more pathogenic or contagious Officials said they wanted to reassess the risks and benefits and the meeting that started Monday is part of that effort We want to provide a neutral venue for open discussion said   president of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences The one thing that almost everyone seemed to agree on is that they hate the term gainoffunction saying that it doesnt meaningfully describe the kinds of experiments that have some people worried I think the term gainoffunction is being misused more than the viruses said   a microbiologist with the University of Michigan Medical School Id rather that we just take each individual case and call it what it is   of the National Institutes of Health whose lab works on all three pathogens said the term is vague and unsatisfactory Virologist   of the University of Wisconsin Madison whose lab did one of the flu experiments that caused such controversy said his work convinced government agencies that they needed to spend the money to replenish the emergency vaccines that have been stockpiled for this particular bird flu virus because it does indeed seem capable of mutating in ways that could start a pandemic This information is important for policymakers he said adding that such experiments allow scientists to obtain information that we could not obtain by other methods unless it actually occurred in nature Relman in response said that we already knew enough to be very concerned and motivated to do something and suggested that if additional motivation was needed it could have been achieved through experimental approaches that carried less risk Meanwhile scientists who study MERS and SARS like the University of North Carolinas   came to the meeting and argued that they werent doing anything worrisome with these viruses But they had been dragged into the discussion and had their work halted only because they study respiratory viruses that can be highly pathogenic in people The governments review process is expected to last about a year with another conference planned at the National Academies to discuss draft recommendations on how the government should weigh the risks and benefits of this type of work Those recommendations will be developed by an advisory committee called the   which will also be holding public meetings
