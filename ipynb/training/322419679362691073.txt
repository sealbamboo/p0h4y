What do animals do when they get sick They cant go to the doctors office They cant go to the pharmacy Heck they cant even go online Nevertheless a surprising number of wild creatures have figured out ways to use herbs resins and even alcohol and nicotine for healths sake Scientists   the ranks of animal pharmacists in the latest issue of  First on the list primates who are particularly good at exploiting the medicinal properties of plants Chimpanzees bonobos and gorillas have all   that swallowing rough leaves can purge their intestines of parasites And chimps plagued by roundworm infections have been known to eat   with antiparasitic properties despite their bitter flavor and lack of nutritional value These primates seem to know what theyre doing says   an assistant professor of biology at Emory University and lead author of the article Primates are not so different from us de Roode tells Shots They can learn from each other and they can make associations between  taking medicinal plants and feeling better But de Roode points out that not all animals selfmedicate consciously Sometimes the behavior is innate  the result of natural selection People used to believe that you had to be very smart to selfmedicate says de Roode But even insects use substances to keep themselves and their offspring healthy he says De Roodes team studies the behavior of infected monarch butterflies When given the choice these infected butterflies will   on antiparasitic milkweed thus protecting their offspring from infection Healthy butterflies dont display this preference I wouldnt say its a conscious choice but its a choice says de Roode Plenty of other insects employ strategies to avoid and treat infection Take the woolly bear caterpillar for example which   that are toxic to parasites Or the wood ant which   antimicrobial resin into its nests And dont overlook the crafty fruit fly which   in alcohol from fermented fruit to protect its little ones from parasitic wasps Birds have a few medicinal tricks up their sleeves too In cities house sparrows and finches have been known to   to their nests which can help to reduce mite infestations Nicotine is an effective bug repellent According to de Roode its important for scientists to understand how animals defend against parasites It can affect how we model diseases in wildlife populations It can also affect human food production For example some bees stay healthy by   in antimicrobial tree resin But beekeepers tend to weed out these messier resincollecting bees thus potentially decreasing the overall health of the hive And of course understanding how animals medicate themselves could also lead to insights for human health It may actually open our eyes to finding drugs that we could potentially use says de Roode After all animals have been studying medicine much longer than we have
