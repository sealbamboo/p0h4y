My patient came to me for advice His cardiologist was recommending that he get an ICD a type of defibrillator implanted in his heart My patient hadnt suffered any abnormal heart rhythms but his heart was enlarged and he was at risk  If malignant heart rhythms arose he could die if there wasnt immediate defibrillation available An ICD could shock his heart back into a normal rhythm However putting in an ICD is an invasive procedure with definite risks  
My patient wanted me his internist to tell him whether getting an ICD was worthwhile I remember the feeling distinctly a dense cloud of agita settling over me a needling sensation of entering a gray zone of medical decisionmaking This was not a straightforward situation  wed have to weigh the risks and benefits and wed have to probe carefully into what he valued in life Was he a risk taker who would gamely try any medical intervention that might offer benefit Or was he riskaverse believing it better not to fix what aint broke As a group doctors dislike ambiguity We pride ourselves in the scientific girders of modern medicine We are most comfortable when we are dispensing medical care to our patients that comes from a doubleblind clinical trial that fits into a validated clinicalprediction rule that derives from an accepted algorithm and has Level  evidence behind it But very little of medicine falls into that absolute category Many of our treatments havent been rigorously studied and even if they have large swaths of the population are woefully underrepresented in clinical trials  the very old the very sick women members of racial and ethnic minorities children pregnant women and those low on the socioeconomic scale Much of the time therefore we function in an ambiguous zone without clearcut answers My patient didnt fit perfectly into the highrisk category and he was from an ethnic minority that wasnt well represented in the ICD trials  Tolerating ambiguity and uncertainty is a profoundly frustrating experience for most people but especially for doctors Living with uncertainty is like being on a slowmoving carousel with that vague unsettling sensation permeating your body And then in that state doctors are asked to make serious and profound decisions ones that may gravely affect the life of a human being Some doctors try to fight off that horrid feeling of unknowing with solid verdicts of certainty From experience Ive learned to be wary of answers that sound too good to be true The cardiologist told my patient in no uncertain terms that he needed the ICD ASAP The certainty of that recommendation unsettled me I knew the cardiologist was recommending what he thought was best for the patients heart but I wasnt sure he was considering the rest of the patient  The patient and I discussed the risks and benefits which was in itself a complicated discussion since the risks of the procedure would be more immediate while the benefits might not be felt for some time In fact if he were destined never to have a lifethreatening rhythm disturbance then he would never experience the benefits at all In the end we decided to go forward with the ICD If there was a chance to prevent sudden death we decided it was worth it since he still had many good years ahead of him The procedure though invasive was relatively simple and lowrisk Lowrisk however isnt the same as norisk and my patient had the bad luck to fall into that small group with bad outcomes  Right away the ICD didnt function well shocking his heart at all the wrong times and making my patient feel as if he were being struck by lightning over and over His heart rate skyrocketed and the cardiologist had to pile on medication after medication to slow it down One medication caused constipation another caused swollen legs another caused fatigue depression and impotence The lowrisk overnight elective procedure turned into a week of misery that aged my patient by a decade Finally he insisted the cardiologist turn off the ICD So in the end he received none of the benefit and all of the risk It was a horrible experience for everyone involved It took my patient almost a year to recover For me it took even longer Besides the human tragedy it was an object lesson that every decision has risks and consequences and that nothing can be taken for granted even lowrisk procedures It also gave me enhanced respect for ambiguous situations and increased wariness of simple answers  When faced with ambiguous situations most of us  quite humanly  want to run for the tantalizing veneer of the certain No doctor wants to give a murky answer and sound stupid We want to give the sure and absolute pronouncement about what is the right thing to do Medicine strives to be a rigorous science But it is more often as Dr Sherwin Nuland called it an uncertain art We have piles of data at our disposal but how to use this information is not always clearcut Owning up to this uncertainty  to ourselves and to our patients  is not easy but it is the more honest approach The only thing certain about ambiguity is that it is a fixed part of medicine  Dr Danielle Ofris newest book is   She is an associate professor of medicine at NYU School of Medicine and editor in chief of the
