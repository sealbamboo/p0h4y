Bilingual education in schools has long been a political hot potato  it was banned in California by a  ballot measure which the state Senate is now   But politics aside theres an increasing amount of scientific support for the benefits of knowing at least two languages Now a new study published by the Annals of Neurology finds that you dont even need to learn that second or third or fourth tongue at a very young age Picking up a new language even a little later in life can have serious cognitive benefits for the aging brain Many recent studies have pointed out that bilingualism seems to be good exercise for the brain and later in life might even   But what if its a selfselecting crowd What if the people who learned two languages are just smarter to begin with To help rule that factor out researchers at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland studied  people who first took an intelligence test in  when they were about  years old as part of a group called the Lothian Birth Cohort  and retested them again around  to  when they were in their early s Reflecting the society of its time the study authors wrote the cohort is remarkably homogenous they are English native speakers of European origin born raised and living in and around Edinburgh None was an immigrant That was good for the study given that it mostly wipes out potentially confounding differences such as ethnicity and immigration status that might complicate the relationship between bilingualism and cognitive decline A total of  of the septuagenarians roughly a third of the study group reported having learned at least one language other than English enough to communicate in it Of those  said they learned it before age   said they learned it thereafter Its unclear what happened to the remaining two people Also few participants seemed to have learned their second language in early childhood  of the under crowd said they learned it before age  The researchers gave the participants a battery of cognitive tests including tests of their verbal reasoning their vocabulary and reading abilities their verbal fluency and their ability to process information quickly They found that bilingual speakers performed much better than expected from their baseline cognitive ability particularly in reading and in general intelligence And those who knew three or more languages performed even better Bilingualisms effects were comparable to factors such as the effect of variation in the gene for apolipoprotein E physical fitness and not smoking the authors wrote Learning a language seemed to make as much difference in peoples laterinlife cognitive decline as a gene thats been tied to risk of Alzheimers disease and smoking or nonsmoking habits These participants mostly learned their second languages after age  So the researchers couldnt study the perfect early parallel acquisition of both languages what they call the classical scenario But in this way the results actually make a very compelling point  you dont have to be a fluent speaker of a language to get the benefits and you can start later in life too Millions of people across the world acquire their second language later in life in school university or work or through migration or marriage to a member of another linguistic community Many never reach nativelike perfection the study authors pointed out For this population they continued our results are particularly relevant bilingualism in its broad definition even if acquired in adulthood might have beneficial effects on cognition Maybe its time to blow the dust off of that Spanish textbook or dig up that Mandarin audio CD and learn something new
