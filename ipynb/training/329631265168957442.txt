Dr George Fielding a pioneer of weight loss surgery in Australia remembers how patients treated him in the late s when his weight reached  pounds on his sixfoot frame He would meet new patients dressed in Armani suits and feeling on top of the world and then be abruptly upended Theyd say Mate Youre sitting there telling me   need it   need to have your surgery  Despite being an internationally recognized expert on lap band and gastric bypass surgeries Dr Fielding knew that his appearance was dissuading some patients from using his services And years of yoyo dieting and extreme exercise hadnt helped him keep the weight off People would come for consultations and say they would do it and then they didnt come back said Dr Fielding who now works at New York Universitys Langone Medical Center I knew they were probably thinking Wow hes fat Is he any good  So Dr Fielding wasnt at all surprised by the results of a   showing that patients secretly  or not so secretly  look with disdain on doctors who are overweight or obese Just as overweight people are stigmatized in an array of professional and personal settings overweight doctors are seen as less credible than normal weight doctors and patients are less likely to follow their medical advice the study found The studys stinging conclusions resonated too with Dr Deep Ramachandran a pulmonary critical care and sleep doctor at Genesys Regional Medical Center in Grand Blanc Mich After administering tests exploring his patients breathing irregularities he often has to tell them a blunt truth they need to lose weight That can be a particularly tough message for this messenger to deliver Dr Ramachandran  says he has a body mass index of  and should lose at least  pounds  Its easy for doctors to assume that once we put on the white coat patients will listen to what we say he said But this study says the white coat doesnt protect you You have to own your problems and communicate with patients in ways they can understand So he often tells patients that he too struggles with weight loss and knows how hard it is How do we deliver a message that may be seen as hypocritical I dont know the answer Dr Ramachandran said But doctors are human beings first and scientists second We are subject to the same maladies as the rest of society Its an incredibly difficult problem and a challenge The bias against overweight people is so socially accepted said Dr Rebecca M Puhl the lead author of the study and the director of research and weight stigma initiatives at Yale Universitys Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity that despite all the doctors training and expertise it can jeopardize the doctors ability to have a conversation about health care with the patient Patients seem to hold doctors to a stricter standard If youre a health professional people think you shouldnt be struggling with weight said Dr Puhl who is a clinical psychologist and has conducted extensive research into weight stigma For the study the Yale researchers randomly assigned  participants  about  percent female and  percent Caucasian with an average age of   to complete one of three online surveys about a hypothetical doctor responding to questions like whether they would choose the doctor as a provider follow the doctors advice about exercise and losing weight or consider the doctor credible and trustworthy The only difference among the versions  indeed the only identifying characteristic about the genderneutral doctor  was whether the doctor was normal weight overweight or obese  The researchers also included a widely used fat phobia list of  pairs of adjectives that ranks the respondents perceptions on a scale Typical pairs include lazyindustrious good selfcontrolno selfcontrol and attractiveunattractive Those who answered the surveys about doctors described as overweight or obese were significantly more likely to change providers than those with doctors described as being of normal weight regardless of the weight of the patient The higher respondents fat phobia scores the more likely they were to place their trust in a physician of normal weight  Dr Fielding the Australian bariatric surgeon knows firsthand the change in attitudes that can occur in patients and colleagues when they deal with doctors of different weights Since having lap band surgery  years ago at age  he has maintained his weight at  pounds following a regimen of regular moderate exercise and  calories a day I was treated completely differently by patients and doctors he said They werent distracted by the fact that I was fat He acknowledged that the respect now automatically conferred on him sometimes ignited an ancient flicker of resentment Im the same guy still George he said Dr Puhl suggests that medical professionals have a frontline position to change the bias against people who are overweight and should make sure that patients understand the many factors that contribute to excess weight including genetics food chemistry and the biology of satiety  Then shift the conversation from weight loss to health behaviors that patients can improve regardless of body weight she said Ive met enough people who are thin and unhealthy because of drinking or smoking or are overweight by the BMI but are very healthy And that is true for doctors as well as patients
