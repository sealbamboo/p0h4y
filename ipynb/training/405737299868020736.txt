I have always found it reassuring to see New Jersey Transits striped Access Link vans motoring around my suburban town and to spot New York Citys AccessaRide vehicles crisscrossing Manhattan Elderly and disabled people I know have used them and while they have sometimes grumbled about having to wait too long for pickups the vans have taken them where they needed to go More than  years have passed since the Americans With Disabilities Act required public transit operators to provide paratransit doortodoor services for people whose disabilities mean they cant use conventional buses If I am no longer a safe driver when I get older I have told myself thats how Ill get around too A recent conversation with Sandra Rosenbloom disabused me of this rosy picture though A longtime transportation scholar and head of the Urban Institutes Innovation in Infrastructure program she published an analysis this spring with a discouraging headline   Dr Rosenbloom quickly ticked off a number of problems with paratransit First the transit operators are interpreting disability requirements so strictly that they bar many older people from using it A lot of things that make you not a competent driver arent serious enough disabilities to qualify she pointed out If you are in a wheelchair you can sign up But if you shouldnt drive because your reaction time is too slow or you cant turn your head enough to see behind you or you have trouble reading road signs none of those things qualify you for ADA paratransit Even if you do qualify the law mandates paratransit only within a mile corridor threequarters of a mile on either side of an existing bus route I happen to live and work in communities well served by mass transit so it is easy to forget how many places arent rural areas most suburbs plenty of those  active senior communities miles from anywhere Somewhere between a third and twothirds of older Americans dont live along a paratransit corridor But even those who do rarely seem to take advantage of the service judging from the limited ridership data available A few people ride a lot but most people who are eligible dont ride at all Dr Rosenbloom said The services are just not good enough Seniors may dislike the need to make appointments ahead of time to wait for pickups to have to block out half a day because by regulation paratransit companies must arrive only within a twohour window Theres no spontaneity Dr Rosenbloom said Older people also tell her they worry about telling anyone that their houses will be empty for hours Ridership has grown nonetheless rising  percent between  and  But costs have risen far more steeply Paratransit has become shockingly expensive an average oneway trip cost more than  in  the Urban Institute analysis found on average riders paid  percent of that Strapped transit systems dont want to foot that bill and have been cutting back not only by adopting stricter eligibility requirements but by declining to provide service outside the required corridors as they sometimes used to do Lawsuits by disability advocates have also made operators less willing to be flexible For all these reasons paratransit doesnt appear able or willing to keep the growing number of older Americans mobile in the years ahead Dr Rosenbloom advocates expanding paratransit to areas where disabled seniors are aging in place but she also points out that we will also need other kinds of demandresponsive services for those not disabled enough to qualify along with cars made safer for older people  or anybody  to drive Otherwise by the time a yearold is  or  there will be nothing out there for them Dr Rosenbloom said People have to start working on this now
