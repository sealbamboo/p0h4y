Why when the calendar turns to a new year and we proclaim our most virtuous intentions to eat right and lose some weight do we so often fail A new study finds that come January our resolve to eat healthfully may run headlong into a runaway train of our own making a holiday foodbuying binge that doesnt end with the holidays but continues to pick up steam well into the new year In January American food shoppers returned to their supermarkets to buy large stocks of healthful  foods  and purchases of that food boosted their weekly food bill more than ninefold over spending seen in the holiday period But while they were there shoppers picked up roughly the same quantities of the calorierich special foods that had boosted their spending and their calorie intake during the period between midNovember and January The result Family food shoppers in January more than doubled the calories worth of food items purchased over the alreadybloated levels achieved during the holiday season And  of that average calorie boost in foods purchased over the preNovember period came not from nutrientrich healthful foods but from foods laden with added fat calories sugar and salt The authors of the new research suggested that Americans spurred by family traditions and prospects of shared feasts begin to escalate their shopping just before Thanksgiving and continue it as Christmas and New Years arrive By January  with football still on TV a long winter ahead and bathing suit season a distant prospect  they appear to have established a new status quo in terms of the money they will spend and the calories theyll buy at the supermarket People are habituated to new baseline purchasing patterns and may have trouble reverting to their early fall less calorific purchasing they wrote Compared with our JulythroughOctober purchases the groceries we lug home in January boosted the average calories available to each household member weekly by an average of  Food shopping during the holidays began that runup in calories available per person During the period between midNovember and the end of December added food purchases had already boosted the average number of calories available per person by  each week Instead of throttling back our food purchases or stocking up largely on healthful foods in the holidays wake we seem to double down No wonder then that the average American gains between threequarters of a pound and  pounds during the holiday season and never seems to take it off The result is a runup in weight that we may blame on age and faltering metabolism but which is in fact a testament to the holiday we have packed literally under our belts To glean these findings researchers at the University of Vermont Cornell Universitys Food and Brand Lab and Ohio State University tracked the grocerystore purchases of about  households from July  to March  After recruiting shoppers researchers had supermarkets supply their subjects weekly grocery receipts directly and used the supermarket chains system of food labeling to distinguish healthy foods from those considered less healthy The study was published Tuesday in the journal PLoS One Whats a postholiday shopper to do Recognition comes first but once you detect the pattern the studys authors offer a few recommendations After the holidays consumers should use written grocery lists to deter impulsive purchases of calorieladen treats and substitute as much junk food as possible with fresh produce and nutrientrich foods Shoppers could split grocery baskets visually to ensure nutritious foods represent at least half of their purchases Leave the cookies crackers chips and sodas on the shelves and fill your cart with wholegrain  breads and cereals fresh fruits and vegetables and sparkling water said the authors The calories will add up slower and youll be more likely to meet your resolutions and shed those unwanted pounds said coauthor Drew Hanks of the Ohio State University who worked on the study as a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell
