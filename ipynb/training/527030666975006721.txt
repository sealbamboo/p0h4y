They tend to be young male thrill junkies craving purpose glory camaraderie and a fresh identity Theyre apt to be narcissists without fans They hunger for significance even infamy Some barely understand the Islamic faith And many are just plain bored That in the simplest terms is the psychological profile of Americans and other Westerners who seem most susceptible to radicalization from afar  via YouTube or other social media  by a terror group like ISIS three leading experts assert Such traits often are found in the personalities of US citizens lured by jihadist recruiters including homegrown lone wolves and those who join Muslim extremists in battle But the big problem with that psychological portrait It fits tens of thousands of American somethings who never think once about attacking their own countrymen Weve come to the rather uncomfortable view that theres something about an individuals unique psychology that makes them want to respond to circumstances in a violent way said Jamie Bartlett director of the center for the analysis of social media at Demos a British think tank But were talking about a few hundred people so its hard to get good data added Bartlett who authored   examining domestic Islamist terrorists Fifteen years after  were still trying to understand what it is that drives some people to join these violent groups and we still dont know precisely During the past two weeks six Westerners  converts to radical Islam or at least drawn to that movement  killed or injured fellow citizens in their homelands or were nabbed while traveling to join ISIS in Syria Meanwhile   have been identified as already fighting with that terrorist group overseas Such incidents ultimately may help experts zero in on which Americans may be most susceptible to buying what ISIS or other terror groups are selling from across the planet Some personality types are more prone to radical ideologies said Arie Kruglanski a psychology professor at the University of Maryland He coauthored   in January analyzing the phenomenon Radical ideology promises glory and significance therefore people who are more motivated toward glory and significance are more prone to accept those ideologies But ones environment including stressful stretches also may fuel latent rage  and trigger the desire to link up with foreign forces seeking to harm Westerners For instance humiliation and loss of significance induce a quest for significance hence proneness to radical ideologies an opportunity to gain significance  through fighting and violence against others Kruglanski said The psychological path toward radicalization may be marked by sweeping beliefs like rabid antigovernment anticapitalism views But those broad leanings tend to mask hidden smaller reasons for such massive mental transformations  like the notion for some that ISIS offers a chance to fulfill personal fantasies for adventure or to create a new persona said John Horgan a criminology and justice professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell Those sorts of temptations can be potent to restless people who tend to self identify as being trapped in uneventful lives Horgan said Never overlook the mundane The ISIS adventure is the ultimate relief for boredom  and for those who feel ISIS offers them a chance to be something theyll never be if they remain here Horgan said British researcher Bartlett said that in his study he discovered that radicalization often takes just weeks or months Most experts had long believed such psychological shifts involved lengthy periods during which a person gained initial interest in Islam then beccame devout over several years until at some point leaping into a violent interpretation of the religion In fact many of the radicalized Western converts studied by Bartlett had only a shallow understanding of Islam  didnt take time to consult religious scholars or read the Koran They simply were smitten with the murderous acts carried out by farflung terrorists in the name of that faith he said Case in point Two British men both  who allegedly fought with jihadists in Syria for eight months Before exiting England for the war however they had purchased the books   and Arabic for Dummies They were arrested in January Part of the appeal for many of these young men was that radical Islam ideology has an infamy about it that young men throughout the ages have searched for  whether to be part of gangs or radical anarchy or communism Bartlett said Theres a certain thrill that comes with being part of those movements This is an extremely important part of the appeal for al Qaeda and ISIS is the same
