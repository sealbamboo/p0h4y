So did Grandma ever have a Pap smear A strange question for a son to ask his mom as I did last Thursday but it came to mind because of careHPV The careHPV test is a quick simple DNA test for the primary cause of cervical cancer  human papillomavirus HPV  could overcome serious obstacles to screening for cervical cancer in developing countries Rather than visit a doctor who prods the cervix and swabs it for tissue specimens women conduct their own careHPV tests at home in minutes Trialed in seven countries since  careHPV eliminates the need to expose ones private parts to a stranger  a tremendous barrier in some cultures My moms answer to my question was no primarily because she and her mother grew up in rural Nigeria In developing countries like Nigeria fewer than five percent of women go for screening for the third leading cause of cancer in women Of the  women around the world who develop cervical cancer each year  percent live in developing countries or rural settings In the US by comparison women are predominately screened by Pap smears  every  to  years  even though the test isnt very good at its job of finding cervical abnormalities Pap smears only detect HPV or other signs of cervical cancer about half the time Still reliance on frequent Pap smears has helped cut US   by identifying women who need treatment But Pap just hasnt worked for developing countries says Scott Wittet an advocate for   a Seattlebased nonprofit organization that worked with the biotech company Qiagen and the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation to develop careHPV A multicountry study   found careHPV was more effective than Pap smears at detecting potential cases of cervical cancer Vaginal careHPV caught  percent of cases across clinics in India Nicaragua and Uganda while the accuracy of Pap smears ranged from  percent to  percent The problem with Pap in this study is the lack of labs and technicians to complete errorfree Pap smears Even then weeks can pass before results are available For women in developing nations who live in villages far from health centers or hospitals attending a followup appointment may not be an option   in Latin America and the Caribbean found that followup rates ranged from  percent in Chile to as low as  percent in Mexico Another benefit of careHPV is that it tackles the cultural resistance that often surrounds Pap smears In conservative regions husbands may balk at the idea of their wives being examined by male doctors One idea has been to send female health workers to rural regions but theyre often scarce in these countries Weve had this experience in Central America especially with indigenous populations says Jos Jernimo senior adviser on womens cancers at PATH Next year PATH will send  careHPV tests each to Nicaragua Guatemala and Honduras The  tests will be provided free of cost While vaccination against HPV helps prevent cervical cancer it must be done when girls are young Women whove never been vaccinated must be screened In Kampala Ugandas capital gynecologist Carolyn Nakisige has fieldtested careHPV at her clinic at the Mulago Teaching and National Referral Hospital Most women reported a preference for selftesting rather than a doctors exam Nakisige used pictures and videos to show patients how to conduct the test With three quick turns of a soft brush they can collect vaginal tissue samples We allowed them to feel the brush in order to alleviate fears of hurting themselves says Nakisige Then the samples are dropped into a plastic test tube with a liquid that preserves the cells A technician with basic training can deposit the specimen into a shoeboxsized machine that delivers results within in three hours The test can be deployed in farflung places too We envision a mobile clinic could drive to a rural village and collect  to  samples in just a few hours says Wittet So far its been used by PATH in China Guatemala Honduras India Mexico Nicaragua and Uganda And the biotech company Qiagen careHPVs developer will provide the screening machine for free to any hospital or health organization that continues to buy the  specimen collectors Using CareHPV offers a chance to diagnose HPV identify potential cancerous lesions and provide treatment all in the same day Doctors can check for those lesions by using   and can quickly treat and remove the harmful tissue By pinpointing patients with cancercausing strains of HPV as careHPV does the test can help doctors devote time to the women who need care the most Like the Pap test careHPV tests are most effective if they are repeated every year But even screening a woman one time can have a huge impact says Leslie Bradford a gynecologic oncologist at UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester Studies   that just one screening in a womans lifetime can reduce her chance of dying from cervical cancer by  percent My grandmother was lucky she never developed cervical cancer In fact she lived to be  CareHPV may help other women in developing nations have a chance at a long life too
