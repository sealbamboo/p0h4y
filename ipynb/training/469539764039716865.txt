For the first time in decades researchers trying to develop a vaccine for malaria have discovered a new target they can use to attack this deadly and common parasite Finding a target for attack is a far cry from having a vaccine And the history of malaria vaccines is littered with hopeful ideas that didnt pan out Still researchers in the field welcome this fresh approach Over the past four decades researchers have developed about  potential vaccines for malaria The best of the bunch is still only modestly successful in children who are at greatest risk for the disease The mosquitoborne parasite kills more than  children a year mostly in Africa So   at the Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University decided it was time for a fresh start He had developed a severe case of malaria while he was an undergraduate studying abroad in Kenya And he learned just   not only killing young children but causing hundreds of millions of cases of debilitating illness every year Kurtis and his colleagues started with samples of blood that had been methodically collected from children in Tanzania by Drs Michal Fried and Patrick Duffy at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Kurtis team carefully examined those samples to find small but crucial differences between children who got infected but didnt fall seriously ill and children who developed a severe case of the disease Were finding the rare needle in a haystack Kurtis says Were finding the rare parasite protein that generates a protective immune response Earlier vaccine efforts have produced antibodies that target proteins on the malaria parasite that it uses to break into red blood cells  the parasite reproduces inside those cells But the particular parasite protein that Kurtis isolated from the blood of these children wasnt part of that invasion pathway Our parasite protein is critical for the parasites escape from the red cell he says And it needs to escape from the red cell if its going to go on and infect other red cells and multiply When Kurtis looked at children who had been infected with the malaria parasite but didnt get seriously ill he discovered that their young immune systems had produced antibodies that attack this escape protein In this group of children not one of them developed serious illness from malaria which is sort of astonishing actually Kurtis says He and his colleagues   in the latest   magazine But this is just the beginning of the story This is a long way from a vaccine that can be used in humans says   at the Harvard School of Public Health But I do think this addresses what I feel is one of the problems with the current malaria vaccine approach Wirth says And that is the field seems to be focused on molecules that were discovered decades ago This really is a fresh idea she says championed by a scientist who is not personally invested in the molecules discovered long ago Since even the best of those earlier molecules is only partially effective the field could really use some new ideas For his part Kurtis isnt promising that his discovery will be the beall and endall for malaria prevention It would ludicrously fortuitous to think that this would be a standalone vaccine he says But if it works even partially it could eventually be used in combination with other malaria vaccines to deliver a onetwo punch against the parasite Theres a lot more testing to do The potential vaccine will be tried in monkeys and if it looks promising there Kurtis can start the long and challenging process of testing it in people
