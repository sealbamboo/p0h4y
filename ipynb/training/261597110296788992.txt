Researchers largely agree that about half of Americans are probably not getting enough vitamin D from the places weve traditionally gotten it food and sunlight And thats a problem because vitamin D keeps calcium from leaking out of our bones too little vitamin D can also be a factor in kidney disease and skeletal problems Public health institutions have debated how much is enough and when to add supplements to the diet Two years ago the IOM   that having about  nanograms per milliliter ngmL of vitamin D in your bloodstream was sufficient about  units per day Meanwhile hormone specialists at the Endocrine Society   consumers to stick with the old cut off  ngmL Doctors arent sure whose rules to follow A new   supports the IOM guidelines for a lower minimum vitamin D requirement vitamin D supplements The study led by   a nephrologist at Loyola University Medical Center found that mortality rates dont change much whether you have levels of  ngML or  ngML in your bloodstream on a daily basis Kramers findings out this week in   also suggest that supplements may not necessary for the  million Americans who meet that  ngmL level and taking a bigger pill could be overkill Check with your doctor to see if you qualify There are a huge number of people who lie in that border zone says Kramer Kramer and her colleagues came up with the conclusion after examining  years of vitamin D level data from  people who didnt have kidney disease and  people who did using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey or   Then they checked it against mortality statistics from the same years  to  They also factored in age gender race smoking status medications that could influence vitamin D levels and the individuals history of cancer heart disease or stroke Based on measured vitamin D blood levels the researchers put people in six groups ranging from less than  ngmL or less to more than  ngmL Then they crunched the numbers on mortality rates Surprisingly mortality rates didnt change significantly for people with vitamin D levels between  to  ngmL We know that being very very deficient is bad but I think the body can make up for low vitamin D levels up to a point says   a nephrologist and associate professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York That point seems to be around  ngmL So is more vitamin D really better Probably not Supplements have also been linked to a higher risk for   and   and   cancers The enthusiasm for vitamin D is outpacing the evidence says   an endocrinologist at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston who heads the   a clinical trial of  people looking at whether high levels of vitamin D can prevent cancer cardiovascular diseases and other illnesses Potentially its sort of like Goldilocks says Melamed Not to little not too much just right
