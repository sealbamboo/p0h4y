Weve been reporting a lot lately on the troubled rollout of President Obamas signature health care law But at the same time there are rumblings of a major shift in the way companies offer  health insurance to workers It involves what are called private health care exchanges These are similar to  but completely separate from  the public exchanges youve heard so much about Some experts say this new approach soon could change how millions of Americans receive their health care Dean Carter is the chief human resources officer for Sears Holdings which means he has shifted more than  employees onto this new kind of health care system And he thinks this is the future In my  years of HR and working with benefits Dean says this fundamentally changes the game  The change Dean is talking about is kind of like what happened when most companies stopped offering pensions Instead many just contribute money to their workers retirement accounts With health care now some companies are saying Heres  to  a paycheck Go use that toward buying insurance on a private exchange  For years at big conferences attended by benefits managers there has been talk about private health care exchanges with four five or six different carriers competing on price to offer people insurance But it seemed to be something maybe  years in the future Then the Affordable Care Act passed And that made exchanges seem more doable right away for the private sector too When we began to look at it and it looked like it was a good idea for our associates and Sears Holdings we leaned in fast says Carter In the past the whole company was essentially trapped in a health plan for several years with one insurance company says Carter For two to three years the entire employee population would be locked in to using that carrier alone  If that carrier decided there would be cost increases year on year you were basically loaded into those cost increases But in private health care exchanges every year multiple insurance companies have to compete on the exchange And individual employees shop for the various plans and select an insurance company based on the price they offer for benefits We believe the competitive nature enables us to save on costs and our employees to save on costs says Carter Akshay Kapur a principal with the consulting firm Booz  Co studies   and   And he says these exchanges reduce costs both through competition and by changing employee behavior Once you give a fixed amount of money to employees they will make health care choices that are appropriate or optimal for themselves and their family says Kapur Kapur says that will mean fewer healthy people going to the doctor too frequently For example some plans have premiums as low as  a paycheck but with a  deductible That might be a good option for someone who is healthy and doesnt expect to go to the doctor Most plans though also offer some free checkups to make sure people are going to the doctor enough to catch any health problems early on In theory these new private exchanges might sound good But there are problems Christine Trapp  has been battling advancedstage breast cancer She also works for a major retailer thats switching to a private exchange which she says has been having the same kind of problems as the public exchanges The website wouldnt work and she couldnt get help on the phone Trapp says calling it very overwhelming and confusing And she says contacting the company to get answers was very difficult    minute wait times As it turned out her employer is chipping in  per paycheck And with that she could have gotten a similar plan to the one she had before for a few dollars less per paycheck But she couldnt figure that out So she signed up for the most expensive platinum plan because she was scared about losing her doctors and fouling up her cancer treatment Thats going to mean a  percent cut in her takehome pay She makes  a year and has two kids in college So for now Trapp says shes going to try to save money however she can Going forward as more companies make this shift will competition rein in rising health care costs for workers Or will workers end up paying more anyway because employers keep making them shoulder more of the health care burden In recent months NPR staff has published a series of questionsandanswer stories related to the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare Now weve compiled them into an   so you can explore answers that are most relevant to you There are nearly  questions ranging from whos eligible to how much insurance might cost among two dozen topics Filter the list by selecting categories or asking questions Did we miss an important question
