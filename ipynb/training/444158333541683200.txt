Angry enough to have a heart attack It might actually happen A new analysis has found that outbursts of anger can significantly increase the risk for irregular heart rhythms angina strokes and heart attacks  Researchers combined data from nine studies of anger outbursts among patients who had had heart attacks strokes and related problems Most of the studies used a widely accepted anger assessment scale one depended on a questionnaire administered to patients They found that in the two hours after an outburst of anger the relative risk of angina and heart attack increased by nearly five times while the risk of ischemic stroke and cardiac arrhythmia increased by more than three times The   The researchers stressed that the actual likelihood of having an angerinduced heart attack remains small Still for people with other risks for heart disease any increase in risk is potentially dangerous  The senior author Dr Murray A Mittleman an associate professor of medicine at Harvard said that little is known about ways to prevent anger from causing heart problems Are there specific behavioral interventions that would be effective Medicines he asked There have been proposals for both he added but we need more and better research
