On Saturday night the emergency room staff knows all too well whats coming  people showing up with a broken jaw a knife wound or a bashedin face often after too many hours in a pub Doctors at the emergency department in Cardiff Wales realized that many of the people who were injured in fights never reported it to the police That realization led to a simple program that has radically reduced the toll of violence The hospital already had information on where and how people in the emergency room had been injured  which bar which club which street which park which school says   a professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery at Cardiff University and an author of the study Many people who are injured in a fight never reported it to police it turned out That was particularly true with fights happening inside pubs and clubs They dont know who the perpetrator was so whats the point of going to the police Shepherd tells Shots And theyre afraid of having their own conduct scrutinized If its a fist fight or gang related or drug related nobodys going to want to go to the police So the hospital started sharing its information with the police after removing names and other identifying information With that anonymous information authorities found they could do a much better job of targeting violence hot spots That and other measures reduced the social and economic costs of violence in Cardiff by about  million in  according to the  which was published in the journal   That includes lower costs of health care and criminal justice The program itself costs the city about  a year including datamanagement costs and prevention efforts Some of those prevention efforts were novel indeed After it became clear that a lot of people were getting injured in fights inside pubs and bars the establishments were required to switch from glass to plastic cups The number of people injured with a broken bottle or glass dropped by  percent A section of the Cardiff city center rich with nightlife was blocked off to cars on weekend nights making it less likely that revelers would run afoul of a motor vehicle And some bars that proved to be big trouble spots were closed An earlier  of the Cardiff experiment found hospital admissions reduced by  percent compared to cities without the reporting plan and preventive efforts and a  percent reduction in wounding recorded by police Word on the success of the reporting system spread By mid onethird of emergency departments in England had implemented it in full and almost all were well on their way to doing so Shepherd says In the UK gun violence is very very rare Shepherd says There are some years when the local police force here doesnt have one firearms offense to deal with That means the focus shifts from gun violence to knife violence and fistfights But he says that this same approach could be useful in addressing gun violence as well
