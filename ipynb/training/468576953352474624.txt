The combination of olive oil and leafy salad or vegetables is what gives the Mediterranean diet its healthy edge say scientists  When these two food groups come together they form nitro fatty acids which lower blood pressure they told PNAS journal  The unsaturated fat in olive oil joins forces with the nitrite in the vegetables the study of mice suggests  Nuts and avocados along with vegetables should work too they say Inspired by traditional cuisine of countries such as Greece Spain and Italy the Mediterranean diet has long been associated with good health and fit hearts Typically it consists of an abundance of vegetables fresh fruit wholegrain cereals olive oil and nuts as well as poultry and fish rather than lots of red meat and butter or animal fats  While each component of the Mediterranean diet has obvious nutritional benefits researchers have been puzzled about what precisely makes the diet as a whole so healthy Prof Philip Eaton from Kings College London and colleagues from the University of California in the US believe it is the fusion of the diets ingredients that make nitro fatty acids In their study partfunded by the British Heart Foundation the researchers used genetically engineered mice to see what impact nitro fatty acids had on the body Nitro fatty acids helped lower blood pressure by blocking an enzyme called epoxide hydrolase  Prof Eaton said Humans have this same enzyme so we think the same happens in people This explains why a Mediterranean diet is healthy even though it contains fat he says With the fats in the Med diet if taken together with nitrates or nitrites theres a chemical reaction and these combine to form nitro fatty acids Its natures protective mechanism If we can tap into this we could make new drugs for treating high blood pressure and preventing heart disease he said  He said human trials were planned  Dr Sanjay Thakrar of the British Heart Foundation said This interesting study goes some way to explain why a Mediterranean diet appears to be good for your heart health The results showed a way in which a particular compound could combat high blood pressure which is a major risk factor for heart disease However more work is necessary as these experiments were conducted in mice and this compound could also be having its effect through other pathways
