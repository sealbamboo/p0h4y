Declining to have a child immunized may become more difficult for Californians in  Last year Gov Jerry Brown signed AB  which requires parents and a licensed healthcare practitioner to sign a form before a child can be exempted from getting required vaccinations because of personal beliefs On Wednesday the states Department of Public Health made the new   available By completing the singlepage document a parent or guardian vouches that the the parent has received from a health practitioner information about the benefits and the risks of immunizations  or that religious beliefs prohibit seeing an authorized practitioner The new law applies to all public and private schools in the state and to childcare facilities Licensed doctors osteopaths nurse practitioners physician assistants naturopathic doctors and school nurses are all authorized to sign the form In past years a parent could obtain exemption from one or more vaccinations for a child by submitting a brief note or signing a standard exemption statement on the back of the school immunization record But over time theres been a gradual increase in the number of kindergartners who are exempted from vaccines in California said Dr Mark Sawyer a pediatrician and infectious disease specialist at the UCSD School of Medicine and Rady Childrens Hospital Around the county  and increasingly the world  outbreaks of preventable diseases  have also been on the rise In many cases Sawyer said the decision against getting vaccinations is rooted in misconceptions about their safety The idea behind the new law is to make sure parents who opt not to immunize their children have access to good information Sawyer said Our observation is that parents get bad information and run with it In the San Diego region Sawyer said parents who have chosen to exempt their kids from immunizations tended to be educated uppermiddleclass people and tended to cluster in the same schools day cares and communities When vaccination rates fall too low in a local pocket and herd immunity is lost he added infections  including measles which Sawyer called the poster child  have an opportunity to spread rapidly Dr Jonathan Fielding director of Los Angeles Countys Department of Public Health said he considered the rule an important step in the right direction because it raises the bar and makes people take a careful look before checking a box to opt out of immunization He added that his agency will monitor vaccination rates closely in the coming months to assess the new laws effects The California Department of Public Health offers more information about the law at its   website
