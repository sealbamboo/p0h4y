On a night several months ago the digital clock blinked  My husband was asleep so I crept down the hall only turning on a light when I got into my study On a sheet on the floor were fabrics laid out for a new quilt in the tumbling block pattern Pictures of my friends kept me company but there was no photo of the woman over whom I was grieving  One of my former graduate students was dying of lung cancer and no she did not smoke Her name was Susan too In my email to her I closed with Susan which quickly became S  She signed Susan Also which quickly became SA  Students are supposed to outlive their teachers SA had heard the sentence from an oncologist that I expect eventually to hear I have nothing else to offer you Weakened by metastases she had asked her partner to call hospice for help at home   SA is the third of my former graduate students to receive a cancer diagnosis When many of them convened on the occasion of my retirement one had already died in her s from breast cancer A speaker invited to that event a younger colleague from another university could not attend because she was sick with what turned out to be endometrial cancer Another who did attend has subsequently had to undergo surgery for ovarian cancer   We Americans are assured by experts that cancer accounts for one of every four deaths because of our aging population But these women who led healthconscious lives were all under the age of  as I was when I received my diagnosis I gazed at a photograph on my desk of Ilinca who died at  Could this epidemic I wondered be caused by hazardous additives in our food pesticides in the air soil water or pollutants in our houses parks office buildings   I remembered a few especially colorful plates in a graphic memoir called   which I found in a pile of books Yes there was the Postit on the page where Marisa Acocella Marchetto has drawn a picture of herself alone at night in her study She is considering all the supposed factors that may contribute to a breast cancer diagnosis   the pill hormones in beef dairy and poultry radiation overeating This list could go on into infinity she writes What the hell are we doing to ourselves On the bottom of the next full page Marisa looks up from her drawing desk into a starry night in which crowds of children and adults speak to her from cloud banks They identify themselves One speaker acknowledges that the links between these environmental issues and cancer was never proven but their posthumous voices ask Arent we enough evidence I closed the book gazed at the tumbling block quilt on the floor and then emailed SA explaining that I could bring my quilting and sit with her No need to talk We might just keep each other company Or she could snooze while I sewed   The assembled blocks resemble cubes stacked up one on top of the other Separated each looks like what it is three diamond swatches of different cottons Pieced or sewn together however they become precarious steps as if the removal of one would bring the whole structure toppling down which of course it would if they were the real blocks children play with Their interconnection makes the pattern     I know that some cancers are caused by genetic mutations others by reckless personal behavior But it is not always enough to get the blood test or lay off cigarettes and red meat We are all connected  as are our genes  within the environment we have made for ourselves   In   the science journalist George Johnson argues that the appearance of cancer clusters is a statistical illusion Still why are the people I am thinking about so young and why are there so many This cannot should not be happening to my students  When I got up to turn off the light I remembered an assistant professor who enrolled in a faculty summer seminar with me decades ago We were studying women writers but she went on to investigate cancer prevention through environmental change  maybe because she had dealt with bladder cancer when she turned    I determined to check out Sandra Steingrabers   as I groped my way back to bed not that her advocacy as a selfdefined carcinogen abolitionist will salvage my beloved dying and dead Those people cannot be pieced into the pierced pattern of my life May your memory be a blessing dear Susan Moke
