ne of the most dispiriting things for an onduty emergency medic is the queue of people who do not need to be there Figures from the Department of Health show that   of all admissions to AE result in no treatment Its not only drunks elderly people are particularly likely to call into AE without having to be there out of fear or infirmity The extent to which charities and social enterprises can help alleviate this problem is seldom considered Yet across the country independent organisations are already reducing the amount of time older people spend in AE wards and helping them stay out when they leave The level of this activity in any one area is variable dependent on the imagination of a hospitals management  and of course its finances As winter pressures mount it may be time to consider these approaches in more detail and their potential to be deployed at scale Three kinds of charitable service can reduce pressure on AE The first is when an older person calls an ambulance Trained volunteers come to understand the patients condition and medication support them at home where they can and bypass the AE stage by moving them directly to primary care where appropriate Where necessary they provide ambulance support and assistance to the professionals to help things run smoothly The second is on hospital wards Charity workers and volunteers who know their beneficiaries who have been trained and managed by professional managers to take instruction from clinicians can help doctors and nurses with hydration and feeding as well as provide a familiar face The latter is of course a small thing but it can make all the difference while improving recovery time and ultimately freeing up beds The third is once the patient is discharged Often there may be no clinical need for people to remain in hospital but the question lingers as to whether they will be appropriately cared for at home The   currently has support at home schemes in  locations in the UK They act as GP liaisons meet and talk through the patients recovery and help with everyday tasks The   has been working at Royal Free hospital in London on integrating clinical and voluntary care even more closely than that Patients who are ill but stable  people with longterm conditions  stay under the formal direction of a hospital consultant but remain at home They receive extra nursedirected support for several days and help with matters such as washing and dressing Since the introduction of this scheme readmission rates have fallen from about  to  For years medics and officials have been trying to outline the idea of care in the community These services are the substance of it they also provide the space for more of it Alongside them are services that run in the background They connect the frayed lines of communication in a large complex system There are charities working with local doctors and clinical commissioning groups to catch older people who are habitual visitors to AE and users of bluelight services  often because they are lonely or feel isolated Local branches of   work with GPs to identify atrisk elderly people and pay a visit ensuring they are safe and ready for winter that their homes are as fallproof and energy efficient as possible Some of the UKs major charities have been working for a year with government on a   to target the  most under pressure accident and emergency units and connect the response to winter pressures more effectively They fight perverse incentives and producer interest hospitals are paid according to how many patients they see not how many they do not see so community care costs individual hospitals money Without carers the NHS would suffer In fact they   almost as much as the entire cost of the NHS research shows Such services offer a humane way to help treat those at their most needy or frail and thats why we need more of them Winter pressures may be a perennial adjunct to cold weather but we can make life easier on medics and patients by adopting a more charitable approach to the problem
