Hospitalacquired infections continue to be a big problem in health care with  percent of patients getting a new infection while hospitalized a study finds And  percent of those infections turn deadly Its the first time that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has attempted to catalog all hospital infections not just the infections with germs on their watch list Researchers surveyed  hospitals nationwide emphasizing smaller community hospitals Although there has been some progress today and every day more than  Americans with health careassociated infections will die during their hospital stay said the CDCs director Dr   That translates to more than  deaths a year caused by hospital infections The finding suggests that hospitals could reduce their pneumonia rates by doing more to prevent patients from inhaling food particles a known cause of the lung ailment So there are clues in this study that can improve treatment But the overall numbers show theres still a long way to go The  survey published Wednesday in the   found that  percent of people hospitalized picked up an infection and of those about  percent died One of the most common things affecting patients in the survey was pneumonia says Dr Michael Bell deputy director of the division of health care quality promotion at the CDC The centers had already been tracking pneumonias that occur in people who are on mechanical ventilators But it turns out a good proportion of it was pneumonias in patients who were not in the intensive care unit Some gains have been made in certain procedures Bell says  for example when physicians or nurses insert a catheter tube By doing things right when you put the catheter in he says we can drive down infection rates because of those catheters by  percent But those specific improvements still leave hospital patients at significant risk Its sobering to realize that despite all those efforts we still have this level of problem says Dr   at the HarborUCLA Medical Center And it wont be an easy fix he says If we depend on changing human behavior as the only implementation tool to prevent infections were going to plateau Instead Spellberg argues we need new germkilling technology including new vaccines that target common hospital infections We need to be much better as a health care delivery system in this country at preventing hospital admissions and getting people out of hospitals much faster Spellberg says because if youre not in the hospital you wont get a health careassociated infection He congratulates the CDC for finally finding the money to do a broad survey like this But Europe he notes conducts this kind of survey on an ongoing basis Patients as well as health care researchers can go online any time to   for hospital infections He says thats what we need in the United States Meanwhile Americans can get some information about infection rates at specific hospitals via this   Select a particular hospital and then click on the tab that says Readmission complications  deaths Click on Healthcareassociated infections for basic information and on the Show Graphs button for further details
