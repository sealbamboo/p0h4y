I recently stumbled upon a description of research out of Yale that suggested there was a link between lefthandedness and psychotic disorders like schizophrenia Forty percent of those with psychotic disorders are lefties one of the researchers   That startled me Only about  percent of people in the general population are lefthanded Im one of them Ive often read that Im going to die earlier Also Im bad with scissors And now it seemed Im at high risk for mental illness Was my hand preference a lifelong curse The short answer No After getting both my hands on the   I found that the work while intriguing falls far short of being conclusive The study published in the journal   looked at the prevalence of lefthandedness among people with mood disorders like depression and those with psychotic disorders Researchers collected data from  psychiatric patients in an outpatient mental health clinic for people with low incomes Only a third of the people or  had a psychotic disorder All in all thats not necessarily representative of the general psychiatric population  and its a pretty small sample from which to draw a potentially big conclusion The researchers on this study acknowledge that its  percent finding is high compared to other research Previous estimates on lefthandedness in those with schizophrenia range from a low  percent  less than the prevalence in the general population  to  percent the study says And theres one other thing To determine if patients were lefthanded the researchers asked just one question Which hand did people prefer to write with Psychiatrist Jadon Webb the lead author and a clinical fellow at Yale School of Medicine tells Shots that this simplicity helped the researchers get a higher participation rate But other researchers say handedness is too ambiguous to determine reliably with that question alone Finding links between lefthandedness and mental disorders is nothing new In fact lefties have gotten bad press for centuries The words left and lefthand in almost all the worlds languages have negative connotations  from sinister in Latin and Italian to dishonest in Mandarin   Howard Kushner a public health professor at Emory University who studies the medical and cultural implications of handedness In the early th century an Italian criminologist connected lefthandedness to feeblemindedness and criminality Since then Kushner wrote researchers have proposed links between lefthandedness and learning disabilities autoimmune disorders autism and dyslexia among other ailments Theres a year history of trying to connect lefthandedness to every pathology they can think of   a psychology professor at Penn State Erie tells Shots One of the issues  is the following notion Everyone should be righthanded and if not theres something wrong with the brain One claim that keeps popping up is that lefties die earlier which two researchers in Canada posited in  Forget that one Thats a theory that has been discredited for  years in the scientific community Porac says Other health claims like the link between lefthandedness and schizophrenia continue to be debated in scientific research One study finds a link another doesnt  and when you look at it all Porac says it kind of evens out Why is it so difficult to come up with a scientific consensus First lefties are remarkably inconsistent when it comes to hand use Some write with their left and throw with their right some use their right hand for everything but writing and some dont write with their left hand because they were trained not to Definitions of what it means to be lefthanded can vary among studies making it hard to draw broad conclusions Second handedness is often used as a proxy for   or which side of the brain does what People often assume that lefthanders are predominantly rightbrained and righthanders are the opposite But thats not always true Emory Universitys Kushner tells Shots In fact he says language and speech are localized to the right side of the brain in only  percent of lefties The more accurate way to tell where language functions reside is to do a brain scan And finally Kushner says many studies on schizophrenia link the disease to weak brain lateralization or mixedhandedness as some researchers call it not even to lefthandedness specifically In Poracs opinion at least theres no reason for lefties to worry Ive interviewed hundreds of lefthanders she says and theyre all pretty much OK
