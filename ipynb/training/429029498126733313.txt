Gradual exposure to peanut protein powder over six months helped more than half of kids with peanut allergies learn to tolerate the equivalent of about  peanuts per day according to the results of a new clinical trial The Phase  trial also found that the overwhelming majority of kids who tested the experimental therapy were able to eat the equivalent of about five peanuts each day without having an allergic reaction This led to significant improvements in the quality of life for the families of these children according to   published Thursday by the Lancet Experts estimate that  million Americans and another  million Europeans are allergic to peanuts and most of them are children Among food allergies reactions to peanuts are the most common cause of severe and fatal allergic reactions the study authors wrote As many as half of all kids with peanut allergies wind up eating them by accident over the course of a year and the constant fear of eating hidden peanuts is a big drag on the quality of life for these kids and their families A group of researchers from the UK has been experimenting with oral immunotherapy as a way to desensitize kids to peanuts Their regimen involves feeding kids increasingly higher doses of a finely ground peanut protein powder mixed in with their regular food It starts with a dose of  milligrams of peanut protein powder per day then building to a daily dose of  mg  mg  mg  mg  mg  mg and finally leveling off at  mg Oral immunotherapy or OIT has been tested for allergies to eggs and milk as well In the peanut study the first exposures to each dose occurred at a clinical research facility after that kids were able to eat at home The trial known as STOP II involved kids between the ages of  and  After six months  of the  kids who tried OIT were able to tolerate  milligrams of peanut protein each day for a success rate of  the researchers found Those  mg are the equivalent of eating about  peanuts  more than someone with allergies is likely to eat by accident In addition  of the kids were able to tolerate a daily dose of  mg of peanut protein at the end of the sixmonth period Thats roughly the amount of protein found in about five regular peanuts according to the study The average amount of peanut protein that kids could tolerate without having an allergic reaction was  times greater than it was before they began the sensitization protocol Meanwhile none of the  kids in the control group were able to tolerate either level of peanut exposure after following their usual routine of simply avoiding peanuts as much as possible Making matters worse the average amount of peanut protein that they could tolerate fell slightly over the sixmonth period according to the study In the second phase of the trial the kids in the control group were invited to try OIT Six months later  of them were able to handle  mg of peanut protein powder each day and  could tolerate a daily dose of the  mg the researchers reported Most of the side effects of the therapy were mild and they included itchy mouth abdominal pain nausea and vomiting according to the study A total of  of study participants experienced wheezing though that occurred after only  of the doses administered One study volunteer had to use a device like an EpiPen No one was admitted to a hospital as a result of peanut exposure Quality of life improved for kids in both groups as they stopped having to worry so much about the negative consequences of accidental exposure to peanuts the study authors reported The families involved in this study say that it has changed their lives dramatically study leader Dr Andrew Clark of Cambridge University Hospitals said in a statement To maintain the benefits seen in this study kids would have to keep eating peanut protein powder for as long as several years the study authors noted In past studies subjects who stopped OIT after nine months saw their allergies return The results from STOP II are exceptionally promising Dr Matthew Greenhawt research director of the University of Michigan Food Allergy Center wrote in   that accompanied the Lancet study However he cautioned that OIT as a treatment for peanut allergies remains experimental More studies are needed  especially ones involving larger groups of patients younger children and kids with severe reactions to peanuts  to to determine whether OIT is safe and costeffective he wrote The therapy is years away from routine clinical use Greenhawt wrote The additional research needed must be done without added pressure or heightened expectations to quickly produce a marketable therapy The study authors echoed his concerns warning patients and their families not to try OIT on their own Because of the significant risks involved OIT should be restricted to specialist centers they wrote    and like   on Facebook
