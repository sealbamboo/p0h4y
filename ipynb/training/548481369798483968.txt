Dec   was a good day to sit down with Lindsey Vonn Her return to competition after a knee injury that crushed her Sochi Olympic dreams in February saw the star skier lead an American sweep in the World Cup downhill in Lake Louise Canada on Dec  Vonn a gold and bronze medalist in the Vancouver  Olympics started her career in Minnesota a state not known for its long ski runs But a move to Colorado and later making friends with her physical therapist has kept this yearold downhill racer in the snowy spotlight I grew up skiing I started when I was  because my dad was a ski racer so growing up I was always skiing I started at a place called Buck Hill in Minnesota which was only  vertical feet They had to landfill to make the vertical I started racing when I was  years old and by the time I was  my dad said I had a lot of talent So we moved out to Vail Colo when I was  The first injury in February  was an MCLACL tibial plateau fracture torn knee ligaments coupled with a knee fracture and the second the following November was ACL meniscus One was during the World Championships and the other was right before the Olympics To miss out on a race that happens once every four years is extremely disappointing Psychologically I didnt have any doubts after the first injury because I knew I had enough time to get back for the  Olympics But then with the second injury which happened right before the Olympics it was a lot more difficult to overcome mentally It took me quite a few weeks to get over that hump and focus more on the positives and the future and my goals for my career I think it was a lot of things that enabled me to bounce back It was conditioning and hard work and good physical therapy and a little bit more patience There is a lot that goes into coming back from injury and Im thankful I had the right people around me to help me get strong again I owe a lot to Lindsay Winninger my physical therapist We are like sisters You have to build the strength back I had no muscle it had severely atrophied I started off with just trying to walk It took me a few weeks just to get off of crutches I didnt start doing the stationary bike until the second week There were also things like leg extensions and singleleg squats anything to get the muscle to build up as fast as possible Singleleg squats are possibly the best thing to do because you have to make the muscles rebuild If the muscles arent strong enough they wont be able to support the new ligament I feel great It couldnt have gotten any better today than it did It was pretty much perfect for me And to have the second race back to win and have my teammates on the podium with me was a really amazing moment And Im really thankful for everyone supporting me Being able to get back here so quickly after the second surgery is pretty awesome Im exciting for the rest of the season and slowly building my way back into the World Cup
