  From now on right through October you should be seeing an array of peppers in your farmers markets Theyre piled high at mine all different colors mostly sweet ones but hotter chiles as well They are a treat and if youre used to supermarket peppers the intensity of the farmers market peppers  will be a revelation Supermarket peppers are pretty yes but theyre fleshy and dull Those firm thinfleshed peppers my local farmers grow are intensely sweet if theyre red orange or yellow and wonderfully grassy if theyre green When you roast them they sweeten even more and thats what I did for most of this weeks recipes I looked to the Mediterranean for inspiration and made dishes with North African Turkish Italian and Provenal flavors If you buy a few pounds of peppers at a farmers market or get them in your communitysupported agriculture  basket and youre not quite sure what to do with them I recommend that you   They will keep well once roasted and you can use them in a number of  ways I did use one new product Ive been finding in supermarkets   minipeppers These are small thinfleshed bell peppers that are  great for stuffing especially when you roast them briefly to soften and sweeten them a bit Theyre sold in bags of about a dozen usually with a mix of red yellow and sometimes green If you can find lipstick peppers at your farmers market  you could substitute them theyll have more flavor When I was a dieting teenager from time to time Id go on green pepper diets These were as ridiculous as any other fad diet  I think the idea got in my head  that peppers required more calories to digest than they  had in them Eating a whole green pepper for lunch is no longer my idea of a meal but I was onto something as far as the low calorie content of peppers one cup of sliced raw red pepper has only about  calories They are packed with nutrients  the red and orange ones are high in lycopene that carotenoid that tomatoes also have that has shown antioxidant properties in studies and with vitamins C A and B Theyre also a  good source of potassium and vitamin K
