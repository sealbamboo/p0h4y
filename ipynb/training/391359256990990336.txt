A babys first smile is an exciting moment But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent  From the week scan right through the early years monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern  Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles squeals and laughter  the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it  But is it all just wind Apparently not as researchers now think that laughter and games like peekaboo could be telling us something more and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds Laughter and smiles start incredibly early just like tears says Dr Caspar Addyman a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London   So this leads us to think that its a form of communication he told the BBC  Dr Addyman has collected nearly  questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world  He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected which can be as young as one month old Soon after that at between two to four months social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget  Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult see box In the earliest months of life Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping shaking and sucking  With each experience he concluded children gradually build up a picture of how the world works  a kind of nave physics But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding  You cant laugh at something until you get the joke so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world says Addyman As a result of having experienced so little small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible   Dr Addyman who sports a crop of bright blue hair sees this regularly with his young volunteers Young babies would never laugh at my hair But older children realise theres something wrong and that makes it funny  The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side Dr Addyman believes acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains  The Baby Laughter Project which has surveyed parents from more than  countries has shown that games like peekaboo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development  object permanence   The term describes the understanding that an object still exists even if you cant see it  Very young children dont know this which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peekaboo  They think that not being able to see mum or dads face means that theyve actually disappeared making their sudden reappearance come as quite a surprise  However once a child understands at around six to eightmonths old that their parent is just hiding then peekaboo becomes all about the anticipation of when theyre going to come back Peek a boo is all the best things Its mummy reappearing but its also about shared communication says Dr Addyman You cant help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people A potential link between laughter and language development suggests weve thus far underestimated babies sense of humour   Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction like imitation and eyecontact Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games says Dr Addyman  In fact smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language   Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing says Dr Katie Slocombe a primate cognition specialist at the University of York  Its been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play and we cant rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding When a chimp laughs it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them   just like a baby keeping an adults attention for longer she told the BBC  So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution Historically weve certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at and its a constant danger when doing this kind of research he says You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand whats going on in their heads
