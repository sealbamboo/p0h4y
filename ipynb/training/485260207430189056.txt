A study of 24,000 Medicare patients found that testosterone therapy didn't increase the risk of heart attack, contrary to several earlier studies, and that it even lowered the risk of heart attack by about 30% in the group of men judged most likely to have one based on other factors.. The findings are a boost for proponents of testosterone therapy, but still aren't likely to settle the long-standing debate over testosterone safety any time soon.
