Like me thousands of Mumbaikars didnt see Lakhan Kale who suffers from cerebral palsy on the pavement According to the last census conducted in  around  million people are in living with disabilities in India Thats  of the population of more than  billion Other bodies including the World Bank say the figure is much higher However many of disabled people like Lakhan are allowed to quietly fade into the background in a populous country wracked by poverty where the worth and survival of many depends on their ability to work Let me tell you Lakhans story In addition to cerebral palsy the general term for a group of neurological conditions that affect the bodys movement and coordination Lakhan is deaf and mute He was fine when he was born in fact he was a chubby baby his paternal grandmother Sakubai recalls She says a few months later Lakhan developed a high fever One night he shook violently she says He was never the same again Sakubai tears up when she talks to us about her grandson We meet her at her home  a grimy stretch of pavement right behind the bus stop Desperately poor this is where she lives She sleeps here on a sari she spreads onto the ground She eats here buying food from a street vendor when she can afford to She is Lakhans only caretaker She tells us his father passed away four years ago His mother deserted them His older sister ran away For a long time it was just Sakubai and her grandson living eating sleeping and surviving together on the pavement She may be in her s but Sakubai still works to earn a meager living selling small toys and trinkets on Chowpatty a popular beachfront in the heart of Mumbai She says she had no choice but to tie him to a pole He is deaf so he would not be able to hear traffic coming If he ran onto the road hed get killed she says See its a long rope Sakubai says as she shows me the frayed cloth she would use to tie Lakhans leg I notice many of them tied to different poles There are many children like Lakhan in Mumbai says Meena Mutha a social worker Muthas been involved with his case since the end of May Lakhan was taken into care after a photographer published his photo in the local newspaper A police constable saw it and asked Mutha to intervene When I saw him first I did feel he needs help He needs a home Mutha recalls Since his grandmother is already  years old he could be without a caretaker in five or  years she says He needed somewhere secure to stay Unable to find a shelter that looks after children with special needs Mutha took him to a governmentrun juvenile center in Mumbai Lakhan is there now but Mutha isnt happy because its not a home for children with special needs And thats the problem Mutha says Theres a serious shortage of residential facilities for children with disabilities in Mumbai  The superintendent of the facility S A Jadhav says Lakhan is being well looked after but he too is trying to find him a more suitable home According to Jadhav there is only one shelter for children with special needs in Mumbai and he cant get Lakhan a spot there because that too is severely overcrowded CNN attempted several times to contact the minister responsible for women and childrens affairs in Mumbai Varsha Gaikwad but received no response Her office is a short walk away from bus stop  where Lakhan was found Poverty and disability are dangerous combinations says Dr Shabnam Rangwala who works with Able Disable People Together ADAPT a nonprofit organization whose mission is to create an inclusive disabilityfriendly India Those who can afford to give their children or family members the care they need do so Those who cant end up like Lakhan on the streets with no recourse to social services invisible to the public
