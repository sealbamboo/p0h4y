This is the nature of anxiety  an unpleasant emotional experience caused by the unpredictability and uncontrollability of the future and the ways that it could hurt you   We all experience anxiety Its the mental part of fear which is a biological response to a threat or danger From an evolutionary perspective fear is what has helped us humans survive for so long It impels us to run away or hide if we see say a bear approaching  And if you are in a park known to have many bears its totally normal and logical to feel anxious even if you dont see one because this makes you cautious and keeps you from leaving food out at your campsite  But what if you are at work and you start thinking about a camping trip you might take with your family and grow very worried that you could encounter a bear that might maul you or your kids resulting in utter tragedy This is when anxiety no longer serves a useful function and becomes a real problem  when you cant stop obsessing about the possibility of something terrible happening no matter how small or remote it is Trying to have it all just adds to the anxiety many women feel I hear frequently from my New York Cityarea patients that the burden of balancing a healthy relationship and turning out great kids while remaining financially afloat and looking young and staying fit of course leaves them fried and fretting  A patient Ill call SW came in reporting that she was exhausted from waking up in the middle of the night concerned that she wouldnt get the next big project at work her son wouldnt make the basketball team her husband wouldnt get that raise and they wouldnt be able to afford a down payment on the house she wanted Then when she was awake she felt little jolts of stress all over again SW did not have an anxiety disorder per se but rather a normal albeit hefty dose of worry It is possible though to retrain an anxious brain I helped SW learn how to lower both the frequency and the amplitude of her worry so she could sleep better and be much more productive during the day as a result  and you can learn how too   SWs story isnt unique nor is the fact that her husband doesnt tend to fret about this stuff Believe it or not its partly because of the way womens brains are wired  A womans limbic cortex  the area responsible for emotional processing  is larger on average than a mans leaving more potential space for worry to live Guys brains also tend to produce more of the soothing neurotransmitter serotonin  Then theres the psychological impact of societys expectations for women While over the years husbands have certainly stepped up the domestic duties they perform women often still feel that theyre responsible for the household And while men may consider it a job well done if theyve made an effort we often stress out if we dont do every little thing flawlessly  from getting a balanced meal on the table to making sure our kids hair is combed  even though perfection isnt always under our control  One group of worriers I see growing in fact is the smart and successful woman Shes juggling a lot and she understands not only how many balls she has in the air but how many can drop She may also worry about worrying so much which makes her feel worse   This kind of stressing is normal but its not inevitable There are things you can do to take the wind out of worrys sails  First note that anxiety tends to be futureoriented What if something happens and quickly escalates to the most dire of consequences Then Ill be broke divorced homeless dead  But is there really any evidence for these outcomes Challenging your fears before they get very far prevents them from blowing out of proportion and keeps new ones from cropping up Ask yourself Is this something thats about to happen or something that might happen in a faraway imaginary future Do I have any control over the outcome Try to take steps to manage what you can  finally setting up your k so you dont go broke spending more oneonone time with your spouse to remind yourself of your solid relationship When thoughts pop up about things that you cant control whether its being laid off or widowed say to yourself Thats just my mind doing its worry shtick again Then move on You should also take advantage of the mindbody connection When you perceive danger adrenaline surges through your body which causes you to breathe faster and sweat harder This reaction in the body feeds back to your mind making you nervous and often leading your brain to invent dire outcomes that are unlikely to occur  Breaking that cycle can interrupt the worrisome thoughts To do that try slow deep breathing for a few minutes each day or whenever youre freaking out Put your hand over your abdomen and breathe in for a count of five then out for five  Muscle relaxation also calms the body Sitting in a quiet place tighten each muscle group in your body  starting with your feet and working your way up to your head  for a count of five then release Or use visual imagery Picture a beautiful and relaxing place youve been to or seen The truth is life will never be worryfree But if you learn how to wrangle your fears youll feel happier in the here and now instead of spending your energy trying to detect a bear far far down the road
