Is everything OK the Raineys would ask  Yes the doctors and nurses assured them Everything was fine  Then one day Tabitha Rainey says a cardiologist took her aside She said If I were you I would move him  Rainey remembers She told me we should take him somewhere else    A few days later the Raineys arranged to have Waylon sent by helicopter to the University of Michigan By then their son not quite  months old was in heart failure  If Waylon Rainey had been born  years ago he almost surely would have died a few days or weeks after birth He has a condition called hypoplastic left heart syndrome which means the left side of his heart is so malformed it cant pump blood  Today surgeons perform a series of three operations on babies like Waylon Theyre highstakes surgeries  cutting into an organ the size of a newborn babys fist is tricky to say the least The blood vessels can be thinner than a piece of angel hair pasta and one wrong move one nick one collapsed artery or vein can be deadly These children are medically very fragile and even the best surgeons lose patients Surgeons track their deaths and complications and take great pride in the number of babies they save Some are so proud they publish their success rates right on their hospital websites  Kentucky Childrens Hospital is not one of these hospitals  Instead Kentucky Childrens Hospital has gone to great lengths to keep their pediatric heart surgery mortality rates a secret citing patient privacy Reporters and the Kentucky attorney general have asked for the mortality data and the hospital has declined to give it to them In April the hospital went to court to keep the mortality rate private     Parents of babies treated at Kentucky Childrens say the hospitals effort to keep the data a secret coupled with troubling events over an eightweek period last year makes them suspicious something at the hospital has gone terribly wrong     On August  Connor Wilson died after having surgery at Kentucky Childrens Hospital for hypoplastic left heart syndrome He was  months old  Three weeks later Waylon Rainey had his surgery and later went into heart failure  Eleven days after that newborn Jaxon Russell had a botched heart surgery at Kentucky Childrens according to his father Waylon and Jaxon both survived after undergoing additional surgeries elsewhere  Less than three weeks later on October  monthold Rayshawn LewisSmith died after having heart surgeries at Kentucky Childrens Hospital  That same month Dr Mark Plunkett the hospitals chief heart surgeon  and the only surgeon performing openheart surgeries at the hospital  went on paid leave according to hospital spokesman Jay Blanton and the hospital stopped doing heart surgeries  The parents say they didnt receive any explanation for why the surgeries stopped or why Plunkett left A hospital spokeswoman said Plunkett was not available for comment  CNN met with Connor Waylon and Jaxons parents in Lexington Kentucky  I think theyre hiding something says Nikki Crew Connors mother  Shannon Russell Jaxons father said when his son had the second surgery at a different hospital it lasted four hours longer than expected because of infection and scar tissue left behind from the first surgery at Kentucky Childrens He said the second surgeon also found a hole in Jaxons heart that the first surgeon missed and corrected it  Our question is how many other babies did this happen to said Russell who with his wife Miranda started   to help other patients of children with congenital heart defects   Dr Michael Karpf is the first to admit his hospitals heart surgery program was not the best  Karpf is executive vice president for health affairs at the University of Kentuckys health care system which includes Kentucky Childrens Hospital He said he put the pediatric heart surgery program on hold because the mortality rates werent what he wanted them to be  They were OK and OK isnt good enough for me he said Its got to be better Its got to be good  In December a local reporter asked for more details Brenna Angel who worked for the universityowned radio station asked the university for the mortality rate for all pediatric cardiothoracic surgeries performed over the past three years She also asked for the number of surgeries performed by Plunkett the date of his last surgery and payments received for his surgeries  The university answered some of her questions Plunkett operated on  children in   children in  and  in  often performing multiple surgeries on one child In  UK HealthCare received  in payments for his surgeries in  it was  But the university refused to release the date of Plunketts last surgery or the mortality rate citing the federal patient privacy law known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of  The universitys lawyer said even though Angel was only asking for numbers those numbers could eventually be linked to patients names  Because Dr Plunkett performs relatively few surgeries and because all of his surgeries are highly complex surgeries it is relatively easy to deduce the identity of his patients wrote William Thro the universitys general counsel  Angel filed an appeal with Attorney General Jack Conway citing the states Open Records Act which requires that public agencies such as public universities open most of their records to the public   The attorney general asked the university to let him look at the data privately The university said no again citing patient privacy laws The attorney general disagreed with the university and found it in violation of the open records law  In April the university   to state circuit court  While the legal battle continues the University of Kentucky has been doing its own internal review of the events last year  Plunkett returned from his months leave of absence and then later resigned from the University of Kentucky to take a position with the University of Florida  Dr Timothy Flynn senior associate dean for clinical affairs at the University of Florida College of Medicine said he spoke to surgeons who worked with Plunkett in Kentucky  They thought Dr Plunkett performed very very well he said We did the due diligence on his skills and we think hell do excellent in our environment The Kentucky hospital plans on hiring a new surgeon and opening the program back up again at some point Karpf the UK HealthCare executive said parents dont need to worry  when it reopens the program will be first class  I wont be satisfied until our program is as good as anybodys program he said  But Connor Jaxon and Waylons parents arent so sure  They say its troubling that doctors and nurses gave them vague answers when they asked specific questions For example their sons had very complex surgeries and they wanted to know how many times Plunkett had done their specific procedures and what his success rate had been  I want to know statistics I want to know hard facts said Lucas Rainey Waylons father But they just said We see this all the time Itll be fine   Karpf said hes not sure parents would understand statistics and rates  Karpf says he worries that most people would have a hard time understanding data  Data is a complex issue he said  Rainey said he and his wife understand data just fine  they analyzed other hospitals mortality rates when deciding where to send Waylon after the cardiologist suggested he be moved out of Kentucky Childrens  Jaxon and Waylon are both at home now and their parents are very pleased with the outpatient care from cardiologists at the University of Kentucky But they said theyll continue to fight to have all safety data released to the public  Weve not lost our child and I thank God for that but Im standing up for the ones that have lost their kids  the moms that Ive had to stand in the hallway with and try to console because theyve lost their children Tabitha Rainey said And they dont know whats happened and there are still no answers given to them
