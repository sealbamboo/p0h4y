I became a doctor to help people When I was a medical student I held the naive and idealistic belief that if I just did good work the business side of things would somehow take care of itself How wrong I was Now Im an internist taking care of all comers age  and up Some days I find myself facing patients and feeling more like a harried airline clerk than a real doctor I carry a laptop in and out of each exam room fretting about entering all sorts of data to document the work I do It feels as though Im trying to find seats on an oversold airplane  and someones going to leave the office unhappy toward the end of the day as all the computer work leads to overtime Doctors are on a hamster wheel these days Were compelled to run faster just to stay in place Its about to get worse Obamacare means millions more people will want our services with not enough primary care doctors to meet demand Government incentives that are pushing us toward computerbased records mean that doctors like me now spend as much time documenting our visits with patients as we do examining them As the hassles have gotten worse Ive seen many colleagues jump ship Most have sold practices to larger enterprises like hospitals leaving the risks of business management to the buyers Ive thought of bailing myself and entering the socalled direct practice model I wouldnt take insurance then and patients would have to pay me directly via monthly subscription But there might be another way   an internist in Dubuque Iowa is looking for one She has made it her mission to find ways to mitigate the drudgery of modern doctoring so that we can find joy in our work With funding from the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation she and four colleagues including her physician husband travelled the US in search of practices that provide topnotch effective primary care while making the work satisfying for the doctors and other health professionals Sinsky and her team found  examples of innovative practices from coast to coast and reported on them in both an   and an indepth   The ultimate goal is a joyful transformation of medical practice An epigraph in the journal article capture the challenge A highly accomplished physician named   was so burned out in in  that he lamented Working at Starbucks would be better Now his practice at Massachusetts General Hospital employs health coaches to work with patients on making the lifestyle changes that doctors recommend but cant adequately teach or monitor Virtual visits  by phone email or video link  have replaced some inperson visits Perhaps most incredibly the practice offers staff downtime each week to come up with innovations Sign me up Certainly the wellbeing of fellow doctors and the efficiency of our practices is of great import to us doctors But what about patients Do the ideas in the joyful practice templates translate When you receive care from someone who enjoys their work its much better care Sinsky tells me At a fundamental level what patients want and what doctors want are very similar Sinsky offers examples of tedious tasks that take doctors away from providing undivided attention No  among them is data entry Does your doctor type while you talk A category Sinsky calls inbox management  all the phone calls emails forms to sign and prescription refills  can take up to twothirds of a physicians day All of this inbox work can and should be handled by nonphysician personnel freeing us up she says So many mandatory tasks are crowding out the work of real doctoring Were not living up to our best intentions for patients Primary care can be the best of specialties Heres hoping the ideas on her list are the fastspreading type
