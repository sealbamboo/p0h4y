Any soccer player who squares up against  knows hell face a fearsome forward Hes the Uruguay forward with a taste for human flesh In the final minutes of the World Cup game against Italy   into defender Giorgio Chiellinis shoulder On Thursday   from all soccer for four months meaning hes done for the rest of the World Cup tournament  Why would one of the sports most talented and celebrated players resort to behavior more typical of toddlers While the ref did not notice it and it does not show up on video Suarez has been suspended twice for gnawing on an opponent Almost immediately   over the now infamous chomp Snickers declared itself more satisfying than Italian Its not a conscious process and he is trying to release emotion says Aimee Kimball a mental training consultant who works with athletes and coaches There were  minutes left in the game and being one of the best players he was under the pressure to score It seems like when he gets really emotional that is his way of releasing Soccer may not technically be a contact sport like American football but players experience a lot of adrenaline and can react aggressively In  Frances Zinedine Zidane headbutted Italys Marco Materazzi and in  Italys Mauro Tassotti broke a Spanish players nose with his elbow When there is physical jostling thats when aggression comes out Kimball says Professional American football players for example have a builtin release When the stress adrenaline testosterone and emotion become too much they simply hit each other its OK Soccer doesnt provide the physical release in quite the same way and some players struggle to contain it They were pushing each other back and forth Suarez was probably in enough control of his emotions that he knew he couldnt push Chiellini and he had no way to get out Kimball says Suarez knew he couldnt use his hands and his first reaction would be to bite him In fact Kimball believes that instinct is the reason that anyone bites in sports or a fight like when Mike Tyson chomped off Evander Holyfields ear in the  boxing match This proved that even though humans only exert  pounds of pressure in a bite a fraction of the  pounds a crocodile exerts a human bite can easily tear cartilage I think if you look at animals in general dogs bite each other because that is how they fight  it is an instinct that animals have  Any time you are fighting with someone whether punching them or elbowing them on a soccer field the instinct would come out Baseball isnt immune to the bite club either In May Los Angeles Dodgers   off part of teammate Alex Guerreros ear during a game fight Beyond the sheer bad sportsmanship of biting an opponent theres a strong ick factor About  to  percent of human bites cause infection due to the  microorganisms per milliliter from about  different species Bites can spread diseases such as herpes syphilis and in rare cases HIV Bites are also a perfect way to spread tetanus says Nasia Safdar infectious disease specialist at the University Hospital of Wisconsin Madison Doctors recommend a Tetanus shot or booster if not up to date Some bites require stitches and antibiotics while others just require a thorough cleaning A   in  found that human bites were the third most common type of mammal bite treated in emergency rooms Most of the victims were male a whopping  percent of cases involved drinking and  percent caused infection But what turns a sober soccer player into a vampire Suarez himself hasnt shed much insight Obviously its not the most attractive image that I can have for myself he   after an earlier incident But thats not what I want to be remembered for I want to do things right I really really do
