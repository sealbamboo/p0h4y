A childs serious illness can cast a very long shadow across a family often for years after the crisis has passed A mother sat in our clinic recently crying because her older child was having trouble in school She blamed herself A couple of years ago her younger child had been very sick and she felt she had been so consumed with worry  at the time and ever since  that she made mistakes parenting the older child Behavioral and academic problems were the result she insisted and she would not be dissuaded I wondered whether she was distraught at least partly because the hospitalization of her youngest still frightened her  even though the child now fully healthy was running around the room Or maybe  I only thought about this later  she was crying because any medical setting with doctors and nurses and medical sights and smells brought back intense emotions Parents can be haunted by a childs illness or injury At the time they are faced with the terrifying truth that a child is in danger or in pain When the normal stress responses of the parents play out in extreme cases  and when they continue well beyond the childs illness  additional harm can come to the family The emotional trauma of the experience the parental equivalent of coming through the wars can echo for years Researchers who study parental stress tend to reach for the oxygenmask metaphor if you dont breathe yourself you arent going to be able to take care of your child Parents need to feel well enough that they can then be there for their child their other children said   a psychologist who is the director of the   at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia The hardest thing is selfcare Dr KassamAdams is the lead author of a new review of posttraumatic stress in both children and parents after the children were injured which concludes that about   They may have intrusive and distressing memories and dreams or continue to avoid people or places that evoke the circumstances of the injury or struggle with mood problems including depression If untreated this can damage the childs emotional and physical recovery Research into the effects of parental stress developed as   medical victories that gave children their lives back Clinicians and social workers  and parents themselves  began asking questions about how to help families   It helped in part to tell parents that theyd been enlisted in a war said   a pediatric psychologist and codirector of the Center for Healthcare Delivery Science at Nemours Pediatric Health System in Wilmington Del Parents connected to this metaphor Youve been part of the war on   the battle fighting it she said Some of the strategies and insights gained from this body of research are already visible in most childrens hospitals a place for parents to sleep even in the intensive care unit including parents in socalled familycentered rounds a staff attuned to interpret a parents extreme behavior as a cry for help rather than a source of irritation and extra work But what happens after children are out of the medical danger zone Many parents continue to experience the physical symptoms of stress  the racing pulse the dry mouth They continue to flash back to the moment of the cancer diagnosis the moment of the very premature birth the moment of the accident Its my belief a parent whos traumatized is always expecting the other shoe to drop will always be scanning the horizon said   a professor of psychiatry at Stanford In an article published this month in the journal Pediatrics Dr Shaw and his colleagues showed that a simple preventive intervention could significantly   in intensive care These parents  watching their improbably tiny babies struggle in one of the most hightech and unsettling settings in medicine  are known to be   The hope for our study was that if we could reduce parental trauma and anxiety it might help parents as their kids got older Dr Shaw said He and his colleagues used many techniques from cognitive behavioral therapy Parents learned about the ways that stress commonly manifests and about techniques to cope like muscle relaxation They also learned ways to understand and describe what was happening to them Cognitive restructuring techniques help people reinterpret and pay attention to the positive and not catastrophize developing a trauma narrative of their experience Dr Shaw said One message for doctors is to go on asking about the past illness and possible related symptoms and to make sure that families who are struggling get referred to   As parents we want our kids to be safe Dr KassamAdams said Once youve been through this you know they will never be  percent safe and its hard to stop thinking about it
