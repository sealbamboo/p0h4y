Hello, everyone, and how are you today? A warm and shiny sun is enveloping the Pharmalot campus, which is unusually quiet. The short people are elsewhere and the official mascots have settled in for another hours-long snooze. We would like to join them but, alas, there is much to be done. So please join us as we reach for yet another cup of needed stimulation and dig in to the ever-growing to-do list. With that in mind, here are some tidbits to get you going. Hope your day goes well and drop us a line when you hear something interesting…. A deadly epidemic that could have global implications is quietly sweeping India, and among its many victims are tens of thousands of newborns dying who were born with bacterial infections that are resistant to antibiotics; India’s National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority has tightened legislation that demands drug makers seek approval for every new medicine, including combinations of existing ones; and U.S. healthcare spending last year increased 3.6 percent over 2012, the smallest rate of growth since 1960.
