A French appeal court has upheld a landmark ruling to grant compensation to some  women who were fitted with defective breast implants Judges said German company TUV Rheinland which certified the implants must pay  euros  in interim damages to each claimant Last year the firm was found jointly liable with Frances PIP Poly Implant Prothese over the global health scare The scandal broke in  after many of the implants ruptured JeanClaude Mas the founder of PIP was handed a fouryear jail sentence and fined  euros in December The court ruled that his company had used substandard silicone gel  rather than medicalgrade silicone  causing many of the implants to split Apart from Mas four other former PIP executives were convicted and given lesser sentences in one of the biggest trials in French legal history Throughout his hearing Mas had denied the silicone used was harmful while all but one of the other defendants said they had not been aware of the risks Tuesdays ruling will be significant for thousands of women worldwide who cannot afford to have their PIP implants removed the BBCs Christian Fraser reports TUV had appealed against having to pay interim damages to victims until its appeal against the ruling that it shared responsibility with PIP was heard later this year Last year six implant distributors and  women brought a class action against TUV Rheinland arguing that anything but a cursory inspection would have found problems TUV Rheinland rejected the ruling on the grounds that it was itself a victim of fraud If TUV Rheinland loses its appeal later in the year as many as  women worldwide could join the case Lawyers are seeking a total compensation of  euros per victim opening the company to a potential bill of some bn euros The health scare came to public attention when the French government recommended that women have PIP implants removed due to an abnormally high rupture rate There was confusion as British health authorities said there was no need for routine removal However they later agreed to remove the implants to put womens minds at rest Frances Health Products Agency ANSM has to date registered more than  implant ruptures and  cases of undesirable effects mainly inflammations among the  women using PIP products in France In a report released last June the ANSM said such incidents tended to be underreported and so the number of women actually explanted may be greater than the number of cases reported to the agency When an implant ruptures the silicone gel filling can leak into the body Some women will not notice anything at all and there is no evidence of an increased cancer risk
