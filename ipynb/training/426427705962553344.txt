The federal government   that it would begin releasing data on physician payments in the Medicare program Somehow the move seems to have ticked off both supporters and opponents of broader transparency in medicine Doctor groups for their part   that the information to be released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will lack context the public needs to understand it The unfettered release of raw data will result in inaccurate and misleading information Dr Ardis Dee Hoven president of the American Medical Association said in   Because of this the AMA strongly urges the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that physician payment information is released only for efforts aimed at improving the quality of healthcare services and with appropriate safeguards On the other hand health care data hacker   has raised concerns about CMS plan to evaluate requests for the data on a casebycase basis That   he wrote giving federal officials too much discretion about what to release So how is this all going to shake out Three recent examples offer some clues The first involves   and the   The news organizations sued the government in  to obtain records on physician claims in Medicare They   as part of a legal settlement but had to agree not to publish physicians names in most cases They never got a complete set of Medicare payment data Instead they received a  percent sample of the socalled Carrier Standard Analytic File which includes records of Medicare Part B outpatient billings and payments The second example is the project that my colleagues at ProPublica and I have been working on to examine how doctors and other health professionals prescribe medications in Medicares drug program Instead of seeking individual medication claims we sought aggregate records for each prescriber grouped by drug We gave up some information we wanted such as characteristics of the patients but we also werent subject to any limits in terms of our ability to name doctors The result is our   news application that lets consumers look up their doctors and see how they compare to others in the same specialty and state Our   identified examples of risky prescribing high rates of brandname prescribing and patterns that suggested fraud We didnt have individual details on every drug claim filed  more than  billion a year Still the files we had were vast more than  million rows of data on the drugs prescribed by  million providers in  alone In cases in which a provider wrote fewer than  claims for a particular drug the data were redacted Finally health care hacker Trotter obtained data from Medicare on referrals to and from providers within Medicare He received statistics on the number of patients who saw one doctor say Doctor A within  days of seeing another doctor Doctor B Hes created DocGraph to show these referrals visually According to   Trotter received nearly  million pairs of referring parties involving about  million providers in  Like the data ProPublica received Trotter did not receive information on referrals in which fewer than  patients were involved Some takeaways  Medicare is far more likely to release aggregate information than data on individual claims This is mostly to protect patient privacy but also because officials have grown increasingly comfortable writing programs to aggregate the data as was the case with ProPublica and Trotter  Expect redactions Its safe to assume that Medicare will redact data in which fewer than  patients are involved  Medicare likely wont create a glamorous application to help consumers view the data When the government released information on   last year it released a big spreadsheet and left it to news organizations and others see   and   to come up with clever ways of displaying it  Medicare likewise is unlikely to put together tip sheets and other context for interpreting the data While the program should  and probably will  release basic information about what is being disclosed officials probably wont tell consumers how much weight they should give it  Those wanting every morsel of Medicare data to be released will likely be disappointed This is a massive immensely complicated program with many interrelated parts More information may be released each year but it wont happen overnight All that said let the data releases begin
