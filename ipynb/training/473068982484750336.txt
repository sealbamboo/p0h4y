News about cancer therapies usually comes out in medical journals with the regular rhythm of an IV drip But every now and then information comes out in a flood Thats the case this weekend The  is holding its   annual meeting in Chicago The convention typically attracts  attendees making it one of the biggest cancer meetings of the year And the amount of new information must be bewildering for even the most intrepid doctors The society says it received  proposed presentations for the meeting Of those  will get a hearing at the meeting as a talk or a poster And another  will be published online Clearly this process is nowhere as selective as getting a paper published in a major journal so caveat lector And the choices of what to pay attention to are so staggering even the organizers seem to be gobsmacked We have a wonderful group of talks this year Dr Gini Fleming chair of the cancer education committee writes on the meetings   Duly noted Some presentations may rise above the noise with help from press releases For example the University of Colorado in Denver draws attention to a study conducted there that concludes theres no reason to keep giving statins to ward off heart disease to patients who are in the late stages of cancer In fact this study showed that people taken off the widely used cholesterollowering drugs had a better quality of life and saved money A few presentations at the meeting get singled out by the  which has opted to publish research as it is presented at the meeting Those papers include updated results for the medication   which the US Food and Drug Administration approved for chronic lymphoid leukemia CLL in February A new study tested ibrutinib headtohead with another drug ofatumumab in patients who had previously been treated for CLL but had relapsed or hadnt responded to the traditional treatment The study found that  percent of the patients given ibrutinib lived for at least one year compared with  percent of the people given the alternative treatment A second report from the meeting also published in the   finds that women with a specific type of breast cancer were less likely to have a recurrence when treated with the drug   instead of tamoxifen In this case  percent of women given the exemestane lived at least five years compared with  percent of the women with tamoxifen We are not talking big breakthrough here The meeting is a reminder that cancer therapy rarely improves in leaps and bounds but rather in small increments Thats a challenge for journalists since small steps are generally not newsworthy Yet we do want to recognize advances in cancer treatment because they can add up over time The real test is not whether a study makes headlines but whether the  or so practitioners gathering in Chicago are able to find new ideas that help improve the lives of people with cancer
