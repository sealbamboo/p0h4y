When states and the federal government rolled out online marketplaces to help people buy health insurance on Tuesday youd think that oldfashioned insurance brokers would have been worried All told about  million is being spent on a new army of people to help consumers find their way These navigators guides or assisters as theyre called would seem to threaten the business of traditional brokers Many brokers work for small independent businesses So are brokers at risk of becoming the next travel agents whose ranks were thinned by online shopping Many brokers thought so when the Affordable Care Act was passed back in  says   an ambitious young insurance broker in Ft Collins Colo Brokers were concerned they were going to be out of business that the law was designed to put them out of business he says Part of the law led insurance companies to dramatically cut the commissions they paid brokers And Hebert says the new governmentrun exchanges were designed to make it easy to buy health insurance Brokers were concerned that the exchanges would set up a federal entity and that they would have people come to them and enroll in the exchanges and that brokers would not be able to help in that and would not be compensated he says So wed lose the majority or all of our clients to the exchange putting us out of business At the same time an estimated  million Americans who couldnt afford health insurance before would be able to get government subsidies to help them buy it Brokers worried that that subsidized coverage would only be available through the new online shopping portals in every state The   for example has a website designed to take people from uninsured to fully covered right at the keyboard Christopher Ringwood who works for the exchange in Colorado shows off the new site So Im entering the ZIP code and county information my month and year of birth Im now going to browse plans he says If I want I can add additional family members to get a quote The website is backed by a tollfree phone number In Colorado alone nearly  people are available to take calls Then there are the navigators Many work for established nonprofits which got grants to help people get health coverage One of those facilitators is Heather Parker an inperson navigator with   In every state and the District of Columbia people like Parker are taking governmentsponsored training to help the uninsured find coverage Im an attorney Parker says So I felt like I could help people do this and it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside and I get to go home and feel like I did some good in the world that day With all the new people like Parker being brought on its not surprising that insurance brokers thought they were being pushed aside Thats despite the fact that the White House wants brokers to be part of its larger effort to get health coverage for as many Americans as possible by the end of March It has set a goal of  million which it calls ambitious Brokers lobbied Congress hard to make sure they wouldnt be replaced by navigators Those efforts helped pass laws in  states restricting what navigators can do The brokers say they dont want to be undercut by people who dont face the same licensing and liability requirements they do But Colorado broker Hebert says he isnt worried about the new competition For our business we anticipate this is the single best opportunity for us to grow he says Hebert is planning to work with navigators and expects theyll send him cases that are beyond their expertise Brokers are designed to really handle the more complex issues Navigators are more of an education and outreach entity Herbert says But   with the National Association of Health Underwriters says most people dont appreciate that buying health insurance is a lot more complicated and consequential than buying an airline ticket online When you go to an agent or broker to buy your coverage then youre going to them for the whole year its not just for enrollment purposes she says When you  have a claim if you lose your card if you have a problem if something isnt covered that you thought was covered  all those things you can go back to the broker and then its their job to solve that problem for you
