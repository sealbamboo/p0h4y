Another day brings another delay for the federal health law known as the Affordable Care Act On Friday the Obama administration announced that starting next year it is pushing back the start of the signup period for those buying individual and small business insurance until midNovember rather than midOctober That will give insurance companies some extra time to set their premiums given this years difficulties And as some analysts point out the delay may also ease some political concerns for Democrats The open enrollment period in  will begin on Nov  and last until January White House spokesman Jay Carney said at a press briefing This gives insurance companies more time to assess the pool of people who are getting insurance through the marketplaces and then make decisions about what rates will look like in the coming year Carney told reporters The delay also gives the administration a bit of breathing space in case as expected it needs to extend the current enrollment period past the March  deadline if ongoing problems with the website arent fixed Right now the schedule has insurance companies tasked with filing next years proposed rates in April The change would give them until May But some question whether the additional month actually gives insurers much more information Theyre going to have marginally a little more data says   a health industry consultant But its not really going to matter in terms of their being able to calculate rates So what is driving the change Laszewski says thats easy politics Moving the start date of open enrollment to Nov  means that if premiums for the next year are going to rise as many fear it wont be known until safely after Election Day Still there are downsides to changing the dates at least for consumers   who heads health policy at the tax preparation firm Jackson Hewitt says it could hit people who lack health insurance particularly hard Putting the Christmas holiday smack dab in the middle of the open enrollment period means that decisions about health insurance will compete headtohead with holiday giftbuying Haile points out And thats a real challenge he says Because if youre trying to get someone to sign up for insurance you dont want to be competing with their desire to put something under the tree As long as the administration has decided it has the authority to move the dates for open enrollment around Haile says it ought to consider moving the decision point to the season when the uninsured have the most disposable income That would be spring when tax refunds arrive The Obama administration on Friday also pushed back a date associated with  signups Until now in order to have coverage start on Jan   you had to complete the enrollment process by Dec  That date is now being moved to Dec  to help accommodate the crowds expected to flood the federal and state websites in the coming weeks The shift in dates may be a reprieve for consumers but it prompted some concern among members of the insurance industry It makes it more challenging to process enrollments in time for coverage to begin on Jan  says Robert Zirkelbach a spokesman for   an industry trade group Ultimately it will depend on how many people enroll in those last few days Zirkelbach and officials from the Department of Health and Human Services also note that anyone signing up this year must pay their first months premium before the end of December to have coverage take effect on Jan
