The lowest ever number of winter deaths was recorded last year official figures for England and Wales show An estimated  excess winter deaths occurred in  the lowest number since records began in  Last winter was notably warmer than in previous years and had a relatively mild flu season which contributed to the lower number of deaths  The   data compares deaths in winter months with averages in other seasons It showed  more people died last winter and elderly people were disproportionately affected Of the  excess deaths  were in the overs Temperatures were C above average for December and January last year The ONS report said The peak in mortality for  was much less pronounced than in previous years with  fewer mean average daily deaths during December and January compared to the five year average While excess winter deaths are linked to low temperatures hypothermia is not the main cause Experience shows that the majority of such deaths are due to heart disease stroke and respiratory illness However the flu season was mild and the type of flu virus circulating last winter had a bigger impact on young adults than elderly people The combination of mild winter temperatures and circulation of a subtype of influenza virus which predominantly impacts on young adults rather than the elderly may partly explain the low levels of excess winter mortality in  the report said  suggest this winter is likely to be relatively mild as well In  an estimated  excess winter deaths were recorded but the figures were closer to  for most of that decade There has been a consistent decline since then with deaths averaging around  in the s and  in the s Despite improvements the UK tends to have higher winter mortality figures than colder countries such as Germany and Finland It is thought that people who live in countries with relatively mild winters have less insulated homes and are less likely to wear warm gear in cold weather Commenting on the report Age UKs Caroline Abrahams said It is truly shocking that thousands of older people are dying unnecessarily every winter because they cannot afford to keep warm  This is a national disgrace and a damning indictment of our failure to tackle the root cause of the problem cold energyinefficient homes Fewer older people died last year compared to recent years but the winter was exceptionally mild we must not be complacent about the cold homes which cause so many deaths among older people because who knows how bad this and future winters will be  She called on the government to bring all our housing up to a high energy efficiency standard
