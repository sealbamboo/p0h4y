So why has the  movie stuck around for so long for the under set Experts say it is not just because you can find images of the movies sisters on everything Elsa and Anna are on dresses on scooters and even on jelly beans The news that a longawaited sequel is finally coming in November  was met with cheers and a few groans across the Internet To understand the psychology behind Frozen Mania in  CNN reached out to psychologists who are sisters themselves Yalda Uhls is regional director for Common Sense Media Maryam KiaKeating is an associate professor of clinical psychology at University of California Santa Barbara Here is our edited conversation  Princess movies have been around since the beginning of time but this has really resonated What has made this one so unique  One of the things that really struck me and I think struck little children is that there is a really strong intergenerational familythemed message here Despite the sisters Anna and Elsa being separated for so long the story is ultimately about the bond between the two of them When youre little that is your zone thats your group they define your world Highlighting that and making it feel important  your sister your brother your mom and dad  is something little kids can really identify with  Kids can really understand the idea of their sister wanting to play with them and sometimes not but still having a strong family bond Ultimately its about the love between the sisters Thats a message that many little children understand There are also good lessons about overcoming struggles and facing life challenges But whats interesting about preschoolers in particular is theres this loyalty and unrelenting interest to watch this movie over and over again Part of it is because it was so well done but there are some themes that younger kids can really identify with My yearold daughter told me that she also liked that it didnt have a witch I wouldnt have thought that until she said it but it made me more thoughtful about all the other movies  great movies  that have scary witches and themes in them This was something that little kids under  arent going to have nightmares about Why is not having a witch important to a preschooler  When youre an adult youve heard a lot of these stories like Snow White or Cinderella and you forget the power they can have Its helpful to have a childs point of view on this Kids are living in this world where the line between whats real and whats not really is blurry and because they have such vivid imaginations witches and monsters can feel very real As adults we may see these villains or monsters as a way to tell a story or a lesson but when children are in the moment of being scared they are caught up in the fear and not in finding the larger lesson  I used to work in the film industry and as adults were told that we need conflict to drive drama Take Grimms Fairy Tales there are always dire stakes Or movies like Bambi and The Lion King where the mother or father die These are serious issues and themes and sometimes little kids arent ready to process and understand these ideas  What about the characters seem so easy for kids to empathize with  Preschooler imaginations are really strong and so they respond really well to stories with magical realism In Frozen Princess Elsa has these powers to control ice and snow  and that really captures kids imaginations When youre small you dont feel powerful Everyone is always dictating what you can and cannot do Having a character they can empathize with that has these powers can make them feel more empowered as well  That magical piece is exciting and is one of the things that really sets this movie apart from others Another aspect that kids see themselves in Elsa and Anna is the impulsiveness Parents are constantly trying to teach their little ones how to selfregulate their emotions how to behave how to sit down Elsa is constantly trying to tame or control her emotions  and while this is something that is salient to everyone throughout their lifetimes this is something preschoolers deal with all the time The song Let It Go Its everywhere and kids cant stop singing it What is it about this anthem  My yearold came home and learned the song before we had even seen the movie One of the lines she and all her friends connected to was Be the good girl that you always have to be And when they sing it they wag their fingers like they do in the movie I think it looks a lot like something they see and hear from parents  be a good girl or boy dont do this or that  so part of it is copying what they frequently hear But when I asked my daughter what she thought the song was about she said it was about Elsa being happy and free and nobody bothering her Thats a message that everyone wants to be happy and free
