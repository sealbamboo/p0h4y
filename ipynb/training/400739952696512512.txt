For Obamacare to succeed its crucial for young people to sign up Healthy young Americans need to pay into the insurance system to help cover the costs for older sicker people So the White House is reaching out Its website sent emails to subscribers with a big orange graphic that says half of young people can get coverage for  a month or less And theres a link to an online video featuring   an assistant to the president who touts that statistic again Nearly  percent of young single adults will be eligible for a plan at  a month or less he says Thats an amazing rate But is that accurate The short answer is no  at least not according to the administrations   The report done by the Department of Health and Human Services actually says its only  percent of single uninsured young adults who can get health coverage that cheap The rest will have to pay more Now to be fair the administration mentions on its blog emails and press releases that this orless number refers to people who are eligible for the health insurance marketplace But it doesnt explain that that qualifier eliminates more than half of uninsured young Americans For that you have to read the actual report If you do youll see that most young Americans actually dont make enough money to qualify for the public exchanges People like that were supposed to be covered by Medicaid The Affordable Care Act compelled states to expand their Medicaid coverage and be reimbursed by the federal government for the extra cost But the Supreme Court struck down that part of the law and states got the right to opt out By the latest count  states   of them with Republican governors  are so far not expanding Medicaid So many young people in those states fall through the cracks OK so back to that  health care claim which should probably have a big asterisk next to it Its really just trying to get young people to check out their options says Jonathan Gruber an MIT professor who was a consultant to President Obama on the development of the Affordable Care Act Gruber says he doesnt know if all the White House statements are accurate The president himself is encouraging young people to check out just how affordable health coverage can be He spoke to supporters at a hotel in Washington this month Most of the young people in this country who dont have health insurance currently are going to be able to get it for less than their cellphone bill less than their cable bill he said But the actual numbers in the administrations own study show that without some qualifiers and asterisks its still a bit of a stretch According to the HHS study  percent of young people under  can get coverage for  a month or less Some of these sound bites may seem a bit oversimplified or overstated The goal of a statement like that is to really just say to young people Hey theres good lowcost options out there Gruber says And for many of you it could be  a month For some it could be a bit more but it will be surprisingly cheap once you look at it And the important point is for people to get on the website and shop So in other words its like any other marketing campaign All the pitches arent exactly entirely true but they do get your attention And at least some people have been able to get on the Obamacare websites and shop around like the administration wants them to Brighid Greene a yearold dancer who lives in the New York City borough of Queens is one Im excited that it worked she says I think thats huge that I was able to go on and like figure it out and make sense of it Greene makes  a year She went online to find out what kind of coverage she could get and from the best she could figure with the tax credits shed qualify for it would be  a month Greene says thats less than half of what she can get without Obamacare for a similar plan So shes going to sign up The Obama administration stands behind its promotion campaign and points to a finding in that federal study It says that if all the states in the study expanded their Medicaid coverage the way they were supposed to when the law passed almost  percent of single Americans under  years old could get coverage for less than  a month
