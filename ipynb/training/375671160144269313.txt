An intense nationwide push to speed hospital treatment for heart attack patients has been a success cutting by  the average time people waited before getting their clogged arteries opened between  and  But in a twist cardiologists called disappointing the improvement did not translate into lower death rates according to a  Â published in Thursdays edition of the New England Journal of Medicine We had hoped this would make a huge difference and it hasnt said study senior author Dr Hitinder Gurm an interventional cardiologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor We need to explore other strategies Major heart attacks occur when arteries carrying blood to the heart become blocked starving the muscle of oxygen and eventually killing heart tissue Physicians treat heart attack patients by opening up the blood vessels often by inserting a balloon into the vessel and inflating it to remove the blockage Speed is of the essence for these angioplasty procedures As the doctors who perform them like to say Time is muscle The concept has always been the faster we open the artery the more heart muscle we can protect and the more lives we can save said study leader Dr Daniel Menees also an interventional cardiologist at the University of Michigan About a decade ago the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Assn began instituting guidelines to help hospitals reduce their socalled doortoballoon times to  minutes or less More than  hospitals eventually participated in a campaign backed by the American College of Cardiology said Dr John Rumsfeld who leads the organizations efforts to track hospital performance on heart attack care The effort became one of medicines largest and most successful quality improvement projects Medicare began reporting which hospitals were performing well which also encouraged medical centers to improve their doortoballoon times he added But while hospitals were clocking better times the benefits for patients werent always clearcut Some studies seemed to show that the patients with shorter wait times were more likely to survive their heart attacks than those with longer waits However other research didnt find that improved doortoballoon times translated into lower overall death rates In  Gurm worked on a study of  patients in Michigan that found that big improvements in doortoballoon time didnt translate into   To expand on that work the team looked at  patients admitted to  hospitals throughout the US from July  to June  a period that coincided with the qualityimprovement effort The average time it took for a patient to get treatment in a catheterization lab decreased every year dropping from  minutes in  to  minutes in  But the proportion of patients who died before leaving the hospital barely changed at all starting out at  and winding up at  The researchers also looked at Medicare data for a subset of  patients to see how many were alive  days after their procedures Again they found no significant change in death rates even as doortoballoon times decreased from  minutes to  minutes Gurm called that additional evidence sobering He and Menees said they would like to see more attention placed on the period before a patient arrives at the hospital a critical time when damage to heart muscle can begin to set in Doortoballoon time is really only one part of the puzzle Menees said Patients might do better if they were taught to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack  pain shortness of breath or tightness in the chest that hadnt been there before  and knew to call  without delay said Rumsfeld who provided performance data to the study team It doesnt start at the hospital It starts at home he said If they dont initiate the process early enough the hospital cant help Even better would be to focus more on preventing heart attacks in the first place said Dr Eric Topol a cardiologist and director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute in La Jolla Weve kind of maxed out what we can do in the early hours of a heart attack said Topol who wasnt involved in the study Weve hit the wall The American College of Cardiology issued a statement Wednesday stressing that it stood by its guidelines and pointing out that shortterm mortality is not the only goal of doortoballoon We are also interested in recovery and quality of life after heart attack Studies have yet to examine whether those outcomes have improved as a result of better doortoballoon times though Menees said he hoped that would change
