You go in for a checkup The doctor feels your throat Hmm she says theres a lump in your thyroid gland We better check that out And that might be the start of a painful costly and unnecessary treatment for thyroid cancer a study says The number of people diagnosed with thyroid cancer has tripled since  but many of those cases are probably due to small slowgrowing tumors that would never cause problems the researchers say Were in the midst of an epidemic here but its largely an epidemic of our own creating says   a professor of medicine at Dartmouths Geisel School of Medicine and an author of the study People need to know that theres a tremendous amount of overdiagnosing going on in thyroid cancer Welch and his colleagues started looking at thyroid cancer back in  They   that the number of cases had doubled from  to  but the number of people dying from the disease hadnt changed at all If the diagnoses were catching new dangerous cancers that death rate should have dropped In this latest analysis the number of people diagnosed has accelerated tripling from  to  But death rates havent changed remaining at  per  The   was published Thursday in  Almost all of the increase was due to   a common but slowgrowing form and in tumors that were  centimeters or smaller Women appear to be especially vulnerable to overdiagnosis the study found The absolute increase in thyroid cancer diagnoses in women was four times higher than in men even though men are more likely to be found having thyroid cancer in autopsies Treatment for   usually involves taking out some or all of the thyroid gland But the voice box and nerves can be damaged during surgery affecting the voice So can the parathyroid gland which controls calcium levels in the body Once the thyroid gland is removed people have to take thyroid replacement medication for the rest of their lives The manual throat exam included in physicals isnt a very good way to check a small bumpy gland Welch says A lot of us and I include myself in this arent that confident about our physical exam skills Welch told Shots Its easy to say that the next step is to get a more definitive test Well I dont know maybe thats something Then they send you for an ultrasound If the ultrasound finds a nodule on the thyroid doctors often recommend a biopsy with a very thin needle But the results can be inconclusive Welch says He studies cancer diagnosis and focuses on how early testing and aggressive treatments affect health Perhaps the most useful thing for patients to know is if a nodule is growing Welch says This is a basic principle that the lung cancer screeners have learned he says Growth is a pretty important part of lung cancer screening for small lesions that look like cancer Were not going to stick needles in them until they show some growth Since thyroid cancer screening appears to be leading to a lot more diagnoses and surgery with no improvement in lives saved Welch wonders if doctors should be palpating peoples necks at all Thats not to say that people who notice a big lump on their necks shouldnt go in to see their doctors Welch says That makes a lot of sense But if people are found to have nodules that are concerning Id hope in the future well see more of a   active surveillance to see if that thing is growing Welch says medical care can do a lot for people who are sick and suffering But we have to ask to what extent do we want the health care system looking for things in well people he says We do know that the harder we look at people the more abnormalities we find By the time were middleaged the chances are better than not I can find something wrong with you
