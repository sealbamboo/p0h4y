A pioneering new breast cancer treatment will not be routinely available in England and Wales the NHS drugs advisory body NICE is proposing The drug  Kadcyla  adds six months of life on average to women dying with an aggressive form of breast cancer NICE criticised makers Roche for not setting an affordable price in its updated draft guidance The drug costs  per patient but Roche said it had offered a lower  undisclosed  price in recent talks The two organisations have been in negotiations since the first draft guidance from NICE the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence rejecting the drug was published in April There is a real sense of sadness  and anger for that matter  that the new breast cancer drug Kadcyla looks unlikely to be made routinely available on the NHS something that is obvious from the bitter language being used by both sides The decision by Englands official NHS advisory body the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE to reject Kadcyla prompted manufacturers Roche to claim the system was broken NICE  not known for its strong use of language  responded by saying it was really disappointed in the approach taken by the drugs firm While this latest guidance is only the final draft version there tends not to be any major changes when the official recommendations are published  normally a few months after this stage The original cost of Kadcyla worked out at  per patient  that is based on the standard  months of treatment Roche said it had offered to lower the price substantially but NICE said the new price  which is not being disclosed  made little difference Kadcyla is used to treat people with HERpositive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and cannot be surgically removed About a fifth of breast cancer cases are HERpositive and it is thought this drug could benefit  women a year It works by seeking out and destroying cancerous cells attacking them from within  Its novel action means it is unlikely to cause the sideeffects such as hair loss seen with many other types of chemotherapy  Kimberley Mawby  who managed to get the drug through a trial at Londons Royal Marsden Hospital described it as amazing She said I can have a great life I dont feel ill the sideeffects are so minimal I lead a really normal life  And I know how much it costs but at the end of the day you cant put a price on your life and thats what Roche are asking people to do  For all the people out there that need this drug I really believe they should be able to get it NICE chief executive Sir Andrew Dillon said We are really disappointed that Roche were not able to demonstrate more flexibility  The company is well aware that we could not have recommended Kadcyla at the price it proposed Jennifer Cozzone head of health economics and pricing at Roche said Were very disappointed with this decision and frankly not just for patients who would have had the opportunity to receive Kadcyla with a positive decision Considering Kadcyla is the eighth medicine in a row that NICE has declined to make available to women with advanced breast cancer in the UK we dont believe this is a question of the price of Kadcyla We believe that this is an issue with how NICE considers medicines in advanced breast cancer Dr Jayson Dallas of Roche added NICEs rejection of Kadcyla demonstrates quite simply that their current system is broken not fit for purpose and in need of a complete overhaul when it comes to advanced cancer Mia Rosenblatt head of policy and campaigns at Breast Cancer Campaign said the news was a huge blow It is vital that this is not the end of the line for Kadcyla in respect of NICE approval and we ask NICE and Roche to urgently revisit their negotiations to find a solution  Its not too late to review the cost of the drug she added It means the only way women will be able to get access to the treatment is through the Cancer Drugs Fund for which their doctors would have to make special requests  Since April more than  women have been given Kadcyla in this way but the Cancer Drugs Fund is due to end in  While the guidance applies to England Wales have said they will follow suit Officials in Northern Ireland and Scotland are considering the NICE recommendations None of them currently funds the drug
