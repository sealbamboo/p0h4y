The next time you go out for cheeseburgers and fries or pepperoni pizza you might want to consider washing it down with a glass of grapefruit juice A new study from UC Berkeley researchers found that mice who drank their fill of sweetened grapefruit juice gained less weight on a highfat diet than their counterparts who drank sweetened water The juicedrinking mice also had better measures of metabolic health including blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity Grapefruit juice did not affect weight gain or loss for mice who were eating a lowfat diet the researchers found But it did make their bodies more sensitive to insulin The results of the   were published Wednesday by the journal PLOS ONE The findings come with several caveats For starters the study was paid for by the California Grapefruit Growers Cooperative But the Berkeley researchers from the universitys   insisted that they went into the study with plenty of skepticism about the dietary power of grapefruits I was surprised by the findings Andreas Stahl the studys senior author said in a statement from the university We even rechecked the calibration of our glucose sensors and we got the same results over and over again Also the study was small with each combination of diet liquid and other nutrients tested in groups of just six mice And of course what happens in mice wont necessarily happen in people Still the results may help explain why grapefruits are frequently featured in fad diets Mice dont care for the bitter taste of grapefruit juice which comes from a flavonoid called naringin In previous studies of mice that slimmed down when given grapefruit juice instead of water their weight loss could have been due to the fact that the bitterness caused them to lose their appetites The Berkeley researchers hoped to solve this problem by doing two things First they sweetend the pulpfree grapefruit juice made from California Ruby Red grapefruits with saccharin Second they gave mice in the control group sugar water made with glucose and saccharin that had the same amount of calories as the sweetened juice In the experiments mice offered grapefruit juice and water drank similar amounts They also ate similar amounts of food After eating highfat chow for  days the mice who drank grapefruit juice weighed  less than the mice who drank the sweetened water The difference in body weight started to become apparent within  days and the gap was large enough to be statistically significant by day  according to the study At the end of the  days the mice who drank juice were in better metabolic health than the ones who drank the same amount of calories in the form of sugar water They had lower fasting blood sugar levels better insulin sensitivity and lower levels of triglycerides in their livers In a followup experiment the researchers allowed the mice to become obese before they introduced the grapefruit juice After  days the mice who drank grapefruit juice weighed  less than the mice who drank water and they also showed signs of better metabolic function Then the researchers compared the effects of grapefruit juice with the grapefruit flavonoid naringin and the diabetes drug metformin All three treatments reduced the mices blood sugar compared with drinking sugar water But only the juice drinkers saw any benefit on the scale  after  days they weighed  less than mice in the other groups Its not exactly clear why grapefruit juice would promote weight loss especially since the active ingredient  naringin  didnt have the same effect However the researchers noted that mice that drank juice had reduced expression of a protein involved in regulating metabolism so perhaps something in grapefruit changes the way the body makes or stores fat The researchers also warned that grapefruit and grapefruit juice may interfere with the bodys ability to metabolize certain drugs This   includes some kinds of drugs taken to control cholesterol blood pressure heart arrhythmia allergies and anxiety according to the Food and Drug Administration The problem is serious enough that scientists are trying to create a hybrid grapefruit that would be safe to take with medications this   says
