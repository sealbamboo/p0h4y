Nobody gets enough sleep these days and everyone needs to work harder Sometimes coffee just doesnt seem like its enough Thus the temptation to apply pharmacology to thinking smarter faster and longer One option is modafinil a prescription drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat narcolepsy I feel like a welloiled machine  days a week on  hrs a night one poster who uses modafinil   on Reddit But theres no conclusive evidence that   actually makes people think better The problem is says   a psychologist at the University of Nottinghams campus in Malaysia that we dont really know how this drug is acting on the brain In a small   published in the current issue of  Mohammed found that rather than boosting cognition the modafinil actually seemed to slow volunteers down While some small studies in   and   have suggested that modafinil may improve memory attention span or other aspects of cognition other research has found no such link One intriguing  study suggested that it   people whose IQ is already high or even average The Food and Drug Administration first approved modafinil brand name Provigil for excessive sleepiness due to narcolepsy back in  Since then doctors   have prescribed the drug offlabel for everything from multiple sclerosis to depression For his study Mohamed gathered  young healthy volunteers and had half of them take modafinil while the others took a placebo pill He then had all the participants complete reading and sentence completion tests The two groups completed the tests equally well  but people in the group that got modafinil took slightly longer to respond to the questions Basically this suggests that the drug might slow you down without making you smarter Mohamed says The results though preliminary make sense considering that modafinil is designed to promote wakefulness says   an associate professor of psychiatry at UCLA It makes sense that people would feel more alert while taking it she says But that doesnt necessarily mean that theyre performing better Its unclear how many people use modafinil and other psychostimulant drugs like Adderall and Ritalin as a brain booster though some public health officials and drug researchers say they   Psychiatric patients are asking about the drug more often these days Mooney says And we are getting an increase in requests for prescriptions to enhance performance She says she wouldnt recommend modafinil for that purpose especially for young people considering that researchers still arent sure how it might affect brains that are still developing Side effects may also be a concern In  an FDA advisory committee recommended the agency   modafinil as a treatment for children with ADHD because it seemed to have caused a potentially fatal reaction called StevensJohnson syndrome in some patients Its important to clarify that Provigil is indicated to improve wakefulness in adult patients says Doris Saltkill a spokesperson for Teva Pharmaceuticals which manufactures modafinil under the brand name Provigil The company doesnt recommend the drug for any other purpose she says Given that theres no conclusive evidence that modafinil does anything to boost brain power Mooney says Why not just have a cup of coffee
