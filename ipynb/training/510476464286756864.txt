Theres no question Ebola is one of the most terrifying diseases out there It causes   typically kills more than  percent of those infected and essentially has no cure But if you compare how contagious the Ebola virus is to say SARS or the measles Ebola just doesnt stack up In fact the virus is harder to catch than the common cold Thats because there has been no evidence that Ebola spreads between people through the air Health experts repeatedly emphasize that humantohuman transmission requires direct contact with infected bodily fluids including blood vomit and feces And to infect those fluids have to reach a break in the skin or the mucous membranes found around your eyes mouth and nose But that hasnt stopped twothirds of Americans from thinking that the virus spreads easily a poll from Harvard School of Public Health   in August Almost  percent of the  people surveyed said they worry about an Ebola epidemic in the US More than a quarter were concerned about catching the virus themselves Many questions still linger Is Ebola really not airborne Can it spread through contaminated water What about through a drop of blood left behind on a table So we took those questions to two virologists   at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and JeanPaul Gonzalez at   a company that tracks global infectious diseases With airborne illnesses like influenza or tuberculosis you can easily get sick by inhaling tiny pathogenic particles floating around in the air But with Ebola large droplets  which neither travel very far nor hang in the air for long  are the real risk factors That means an Ebolainfected person would likely have to cough or sneeze up blood or other bodily fluids directly in your face for you to catch the virus Schmaljohn says If that drop of blood doesnt land on your face it will just fall to the ground It wont be swimming in the air waiting to be breathed in by an unsuspecting passerby During the  Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention    family members of  people infected with the virus Seventyeight people had no direct contact with an infected person but they could have been exposed to Ebola through the air None got infected The  family members who did get sick all had some sort of physical contact with an ill person Weve known for years that Ebola can be transmitted through direct contact with infected bodily fluids Gonzalez says This is very clear only direct contact So why does the question of airborne transmission keep coming up Well airborne is a broad term that simply means transported by air If a drop of infected blood is sprayed directly from a needle to a person then yes that contagious droplet was technically carried through the air But there is no convincing epidemiological evidence that airborne transmission occurs from an infected person to a nearby noninfected person Schmaljohn says The confusion surrounding this topic he adds is welldeserved in part because health officials often try to simplify their messages So they dont spend much time fleshing out exceptions and extraordinary possibilities he says As they simplify it they start to sound like an absolute Schmaljohn says And people are smart enough to disbelieve absolutes He says to think about the methods of Ebola transmission as highrisk or lowrisk Theres a high risk for example of catching Ebola if you shake hands with an infected patient and a very low one if that same person coughs or sneezes around you Note A   in  showed infected pigs passed on the Ebola to monkeys without touching them Besides the fact that people arent pigs or monkeys the lead author has   its possible the monkeys caught the virus when droplets from the pigs splashed into their cage during cleaning The authors also noted that pigs can generate large infectious droplets better than any other animal And airborne transmission of Ebola between monkeys has never been observed The virus is most abundant in blood and diarrhea In fact a milliliter of blood typically carries about a million infectious particles And in a controlled lab just a small drop of blood from an infected monkey can be strong enough to kill a million of its companions Schmaljohn says A   in  found that Ebola is shed through other bodily fluids during the illness such as saliva breast milk and semen In most cases these fluids were not visibly contaminated by blood but they still contained the virus That study didnt look at sweat but another one   that Ebola could be passed on through sweat Researchers suspect the amount of Ebola in these other fluids like saliva and sweat to be much lower A drop of blood can remain contagious outside the body And virus particles can survive for days or weeks depending on the environment Ultraviolet light heat and exposure to oxygen gradually deactivate the virus while cooler temperatures and humidity help keep it active Blood once its outside the body contains all the virus its ever going to contain Schmaljohn adds Its all downhill from there for Ebola So yes theres a risk you can catch Ebola from a drop of blood on a table But that risk diminishes over time as the blood dries up Still he stresses surface decontamination is necessary in practice The virus will not remain for a long time in the water Gonzalez says Its not a very rich medium to protect the virus Its important he adds to remember that viruses arent as resistant outside the body as bacteria are Rather they depend heavily on the cells of their host  animal or human  for survival In water the Ebola virus would be deactivated in a matter of minutes Schmaljohn says Thats because each Ebola virus is encased in an envelope taken from the outer surface or membrane of a host cell Infected cells dont live long inside a liquid that doesnt have the same salt concentration as in our bodily fluids Drinking water has a lower salt concentration than that found inside human cells As water rushes inside the cell to balance the salt concentration pressure builds ups Eventually the cell bursts killing the virus in the process A long time  although its still unknown exactly how long Remember virus particles can last for days and even weeks in a drop of blood So inside the entire body of the deceased patient the virus can probably remain active for several months Gonzalez says Thats why its very important to perform the burial as soon as possible he adds And to be extremely careful while doing it
