I recently spoke with Mr Sturman about his time in Africa how its changed his view of the practice and the universal language of yoga Here is our conversation    As an artist I am more interested in humanity than anything else Yoga is a beautiful poetic expression of the body I wanted to go to Africa to celebrate human beings aspiring to reach their full potential Often we see images coming from Africa that point toward the suffering but I wanted to create a body of work that pointed toward something inspiring and positive  I found the Africa Yoga Project online and I was inspired to create visual poetry with what they are doing in Africa Their generosity deeply interests me For example they have a sign language interpreter at many of their classes because there are a few deaf people in their yoga community That was one of many things that touched me about their work In Kenya people walk out of yoga class feeling great just like they do in New York The one difference I loved however was that the children who took the classes always broke out into a spontaneous song or dance right in the middle of class Then they would go back to the yoga postures  Through the practice of yoga the children are given the opportunity to express themselves be creative and open up physically and mentally It was most apparent to me that by the time their hourlong class is over they feel loved   Visiting the Kenyan prison brought me unexpected joy The inmates some of whom are HIVpositive told me that yoga has become a rare source of happiness in their daily lives After a yoga class I looked at the people in the class and I saw the hope in their eyes that they could become a part of something positive The students leave the class empowered to be leaders in their communities It was awesome to witness their enthusiasm and to have the opportunity as an artist to show them that part of themselves
