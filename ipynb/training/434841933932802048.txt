UKUS scientists have given one glimpse of the future of personalised medicine Using supercomputers they simulated the shape of a key protein involved in HIV infection in an individual patient and then ranked the drug molecules most likely to block the activity The research was reported at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science AAAS In the future it is expected that patientspecific drug selection will become routine Researchers now recognise that pharmaceutical products do not have the same effects in all people Subtle genetic differences between individuals will lead to a range of outcomes Prof Peter Coveney and colleagues from University College London and Rutgers University have demonstrated how you might tackle this problem using the latest genetic sequencing techniques and big computation They took as their target the HIV protease molecule which is critical in helping to build the viral particle or virion in a cell that will eventually break out to infect the next cell The protease has a slightly different shape in each individual in particular in the proteins active zone where it slices the components that will form the next virion This is a consequence of the very specific genetic sequence of the virus in that person but unless that shape is known there is uncertainty as to which particular drug will bind to the protease and stop it in its tracks The UCL team showed how one could take the specific viral sequence infer the shape and then work out the most appropriate drug We show that its possible to take a genomic sequence from a patient use that to build the accurate patientspecific threedimensional structure of the patients protein and then match that protein to the best drug available from a set  In other words to rank those drugs  to be able to say to a doctor this drug is the one thats going to bind most efficiently to that site The other ones less so There are currently nine US Federal Drug Administrationapproved HIVprotease inhibitors on the market The UCLRutgers project ranked seven of them in its proof of principle experiment Although the idea sounds simple working out how each drug molecule would fit into the patients shapespecific protease protein required enormous computing capability Were having to run upwards of  simulations of these models each one of which needs a hundred cores on a computer  So thats a machine with  cores and then you run the calculations for about  to  hours explained the director of the Centre for Computational Science at UCL You get a huge amount of output data and then do postprocessing and analysis to get the ranking A doctor need not know about any of this complexity all theyd be interested in would be the list of besttoworst drugs for that patient Although the required computing power might make this approach look somewhat impractical today Prof Coveneys point is that the relentless improvement in processor capability means these types of simulations will become much more reasonable in the future Todays supercomputer is on your desktop in  years right What it is more in principle it is possible to turn the calculations around in two to three days which is very relevant to the timescales required by doctors to make treatment decisions for their patients As well as reporting this work at the AAAS meeting Prof Coveneys UCLRutgers team has also   JonathanAmosINTERNETbbccouk and follow me on Twitter  JonathanAmosINTERNETbbccouk and follow me on Twitter
