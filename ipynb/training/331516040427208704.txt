Only  months old Vivian Andorf underwent her sixth   Her cardiologist inserted a flexible tube through a tiny artery in her leg and wended it to her heart in an attempt to treat her narrowed veins and arteries the result of a congenital condition In prior procedures the first of which she had at a mere  weeks old an adultsize catheter had to be used Catheters sized for a child let alone an infant were not available The larger catheter took longer to insert and was more likely to injure her already abnormal blood vessels said her cardiologist Dr Alex Golden of the Cleveland Clinic Childrens Hospital Its trying to put something too large into something smaller he said But during the sixth procedure Vivian became just the second young patient in the country to benefit from a catheter approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in children It is a rare success in the field of pediatric medical devices The development of surgical tools and medical devices designed for children lags a decade behind device development for adults The lag say experts can be blamed largely on economics The pediatric market is far smaller than the market for adults making it difficult for companies to recoup research and development expenses for smaller devices Innovation in medicine is driven by need but also by the market said Dr Michael R Harrison the director emeritus of the Fetal Treatment Center and the director of the Pediatric Device Consortium both at the University of California San Francisco Big markets have lots of folks developing devices but small markets like the pediatrics market dont Take for example the field of knee and hip replacements in adults Theres been an incredible amount of investment and talent and innovation devoted to those things said Dr Harrison but essentially none to pediatric orthopedic devices So for decades pediatric surgeons and other specialists have had to make do using adultsize devices off label in children They might chisel out their own smaller surgical tools in workshops or juryrig devices to squeeze into their tiny patients Always they contend with the extra challenges that come with using a device thats not quite right Often we end up having to dramatically modify an operation simply to be able to implant a device in a child said Dr Pedro del Nido chairman of the department of cardiac surgery at Boston Childrens Hospital Among the adult devices used with children are stents   pacemakers artificial mitral valves   delivery devices kidney   systems and metal implants that help straighten a spine or replace a piece of bone Young patients often have to undergo multiple operations to resize or replace devices that no longer fit or have worn out because they were not designed for the physiological changes of childhood While the failure rate of defibrillators in adults is extremely low for example its  to  percent in children said Dr del Nido Children have growth spurts Their immune systems and hormones are changing said Barbara D Boyan the dean of the engineering school at Virginia Commonwealth University You need to be able to adapt to different ages different stages of development At the same time some pediatric conditions do not occur in adults or are best treated in childhood These conditions are often completely ignored by medical device companies In  Congress passed the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act authorizing the FDA to offer grants to stimulate the development of pediatric devices The agency has given  million in grants to several universitybased consortia These groups offer seed money to developers and provide technical advice assistance finding investors and advice about navigating the regulatory process The consortia have assisted in more than  projects which are in various stages of development Still some believe that the grant money could be better spent Tim Moran the founder of Pediaworks the nonprofit company that created the pediatric catheter said that theres little market data on what pediatric devices are most needed something he hopes to change Mr Moran grew interested in pediatric devices after seeing his daughter who was born prematurely wince or scream in pain when devices designed for adults were used in her care Mr Moran surveyed pediatric cardiologists to identify their greatest needs and found that the catheter was high on the list He eventually discovered a company in Japan that was making smaller catheters and created a joint venture to develop the catheter for children and to seek approval for it in the United States Id love to see the pediatric community as a whole identify the biggest device needs in their space said Mr Moran who plans to survey doctors in about  specialties about their medical device needs But market data may not have helped someone like Tommy Blackshaw who was born with a condition that is rare in children mitral valve stenosis At  months his dysfunctional heart valve needed replacement Because the adultsize artificial mitral valve was too large to fit in the proper position it had to be implanted above it About six years later the valve had to be replaced Dr del Nido Tommys cardiologist believes that the less than ideal placement caused his heart to weaken Tommys heart began to fail when he was  and he was told he needed a   He got one on Valentines Day and hes doing well It would have been less dangerous if they had a smaller valve said his mother Sandra Blackshaw of North Andover Mass But there were no options for him
