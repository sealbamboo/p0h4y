The idea that eating cocoarich dark chocolate may offer greater health benefits than milk chocolate is not new Cocoa is loaded with compounds called polyphenols that have been shown to help our bodies fend off inflammation and maybe even improve our moods And now a small   published in the   offers evidence of another possible benefit improving vascular health by increasing blood flow Researchers studied patients with peripheral artery disease or PAD which affects about  percent of adults older than  in the US and other Western countries People who have PAD can have trouble walking and exercising since blood flow to their limbs becomes impaired Cramping can be a problem too As part of the study researchers gave half of the  participants  grams about  ounces of dark chocolate that had at least  percent cocoa The other half of the group received  grams of milk chocolate that had less than  percent cocoa The aim was to test whether the dark chocolate could improve those patients ability to walk on their own on a treadmill After eating the dark chocolate the participants walked an average  percent farther study author   of Sapienza University of Rome tells The Salt in an email And yes he says they were surprised by the findings He and his colleagues observed improved blood flow among the participants who ate the dark chocolate Conversely we did not observe effects on blood flow and on walking autonomy in PAD patients after milk chocolate consumption So what explains the link between dark chocolate and improved walking The researchers say the polyphenols in dark chocolate can help reduce oxidative stress and help the body form more nitric oxide a compound that causes blood vessels to dilate Interestingly as I   a few years back theres another kind of intervention that leads to a similar effect meditation Thats right slowing down and centering yourself or being in the moment as   teaches has been shown to have the same nitric oxideproducing effect in the body And this may be beneficial for lots of people not just those with PAD When blood vessels open up blood pressure tends to go down As hypertension expert   explained it when I reported on the meditation study you can think of it as a plumbing issue Youre pushing the same amount of blood through a bigger pipe he said Thats what nitric oxide  does in response to relaxation And it seems dark chocolate helps that process along Now back to the PAD study which was funded by a grant from the Sapienza University of Rome Do the results suggest that chocolate could be used as treatment Not so fast As physician   of Brigham and Womens Hospital who reviewed the study points out The overall effect of the dark chocolate was relatively modest In an email he pointed out to us that the  percent increase in walking distance doesnt add up to much  only about  extra feet To put this in context says Creager with other forms of treatment such as supervised exercise training maximal walking distance increases by approximately  percent Creager says the new study highlights the potential role of antioxidant treatment but he says followup studies including a larger number of participants would be needed to see if the findings hold up
