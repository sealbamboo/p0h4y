By the time I met him he had had a rough go of it After learning the previous year that he had lymphoma he was fortunate enough to receive a bone marrow transplant  only to have his body promptly reject it On three separate occasions in the past six months he had deadly antibioticresistant bacteria coursing through his blood He was just recovering from a bout of pneumonia when the meningitis struck  
Last night his nurse saw him crying quietly in the corner of his hospital room She asked our team to meet with him to evaluate whether antidepressant medications might be helpful to bolster his mood When I entered his room he greeted me with a smile  weak and pained in his emaciated body but warm and genuine I introduced myself as the medical student on the psychiatry consultation service and asked him how he was holding up Id be lying if I told you it hasnt been tough he said I get down sometimes but I have so so many things going for me We spoke at length about his family His twin sons had just graduated from college and had initially planned to work for a nonprofit organization in Nepal but opted to stay close to home given his medical condition His daughter all grown up now was being recruited to play softball at a local college His wife had been tending to their small restaurant business during his long hospital stay  I consider myself to be an incredibly blessed person he said I know Ill get through this  His body was sick yes but his spirit was unyielding At the end of our conversation he expressed his deep gratitude for his caregivers over the past several months You guys have made this bearable Thank you doctor I started to correct him  technically I wasnt yet a doctor  but thought ah forget it Our interaction had left me energized The next evening I donned my white coat and strode into the bustling emergency room with renewed confidence ready to heal  I started my shift with a woman in her mids who sat crosslegged on a stretcher in the hallway bouncing up and down with a wideeyed unhinged look on her face as she vacillated between singing and crying As I approached to introduce myself a viscous ball of saliva and mucus left her mouth and landed squarely on my left cheek  Be careful Shes a spitter a nurse advised as he rushed past PCP and alcohol Give her a few minutes to calm down  I moved on to an elderly man who was lying on a nearby stretcher and moaning and I softly asked what had brought him to the hospital No response I shook him gently and asked again louder this time He opened his eyes just enough to see my face and muttered something entirely incomprehensible  Suddenly behind me the spitter let me know she wanted to leave She took off her socks and started flapping them about Im ready to go I began to feel frustrated and disengaged a far cry from the feelings Id had the day before Across the room a thin disheveled man hunched awkwardly over the edge of his stretcher He had strange cuts and bruises scattered across his face and arms and had been waiting to be seen for almost an hour According to the chart he was  years old but he looked at least  He had come to the ER in withdrawal from alcohol as he had once every few months  I asked my supervising physician if he had time to accompany me to see the man Rushing away to see a new patient he looked over his shoulder and said Im not going to check on a drunk while hes throwing up I was shocked by how bluntly and callously he spoke But I wondered whether this was the kind of calculation that busy doctors make all the time Are we constantly shortchanging patient encounters we find difficult troublesome or otherwise unrewarding As I approached the patient he was calm but tearful I dont want to live like this anymore he whispered He told me how frustrating it had been for him to struggle with alcohol how he had tried time and again to quit He had worked in construction but lost his job last year His girlfriend left him a few months later  It seems like youre going through a tough time right now I offered  Ive been going through a tough time for  years he responded  ever since his daughter died in a car accident  Like many of my classmates I entered medical school with an idealized notion of medicine But I will leave with the knowledge that the reality is far more complex There are patients who dont listen who cant listen who try who dont try who smile thank and love who steal curse and hate Each of these patients deserves the full extent of our respect and abilities But too often those most in need of our compassion are least likely to receive it  The balancing of complex emotions time constraints and limited resources will only become more difficult with the influx of millions of previously uninsured people into our medical system As we continue to carry out the Affordable Care Act and enter an era of tremendous change we must confront our natural tendencies to favor patients we find pleasant  especially when it comes at the expense of those we find less so We must recognize that sometimes the patients who behave the worst are those who are hurting the most
