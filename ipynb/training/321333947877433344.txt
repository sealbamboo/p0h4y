Music and language are closely related  some might even say forms of one another  It is known for example that   ones ability to learn a second language But now scientists have shown that the relationship can work in reverse  People who speak languages that use tones to convey meaning appear to have a better ear for learning music according to research   The findings further highlight the overlap of music and language in the brain and they suggest that tonal languages may prime the brain for the development of musical skills In the study scientists at Baycrest Health Sciences Rotman Research Institute recruited a group of musicians as well as two groups of nonmusicians composed of English and Cantonese speakers Understanding Cantonese requires mastering six different tones which can change the meanings of words  When the scientists gave the subjects a set of complex musical and cognitive tests like discriminating pitch and melodies they found that the Cantonese speakers performed about as well as the musicians Over all they scored about  percent higher than the Englishspeaking nonmusicians on the various tests  One author of the study Gavin M Bidelman an assistant professor at the University of Memphis said the findings most likely apply to other tonal languages as well  but not all of them   has not shown much musical benefit to knowing Mandarin for example and that may be because the tones are more curved In Cantonese as with languages like Thai and Zulu the pitches have a flat stairstepped pattern which more closely resemble music   You can think of some tonal languages in essence as a language version of music he said  Knowing a tonal language may prime the brain for musical training
