Fifty years ago President Kennedy started the Peace Corps with the promise that it would train doctors in faraway lands But you may be surprised to know the Peace Corps has never actually recruited doctors and nurses as mentors and medical educators  wants to fulfill that promise The yearold physician  a daughter of Sen John Kerry  has created a partnership with the   to send doctors and nurses abroad In return a nonprofit pays off part of school loans Its a Peace Corps for doctors and nurses Kerry tells Shots The goal of the   as it is tentatively called is to reduce the severe shortage of medical workers in developing countries But she thinks the partnership will also strengthen health care here stateside by infusing US doctors with a worldview centered on making the most of available resources Thats not exactly the prevailing philosophy of medicine as its practiced stateside Theres evidence people come back with better clinical skills better appreciation of needs more likely to work in underserved specialties she says Kerry who directs a   at Harvard Medical School and works at Massachusetts General Hospitals   knows something about the trials and satisfactions of practicing medicine in severely underresourced places Ive lived with a coldbucket shower for many a week and youre fine with it if youre committed to the work she says And small investments can make a big difference In Uganda for instance a major cause of death is brain hemorrhage following auto and motorcycle accidents The Center for Global Health helped to get the medical supply company Stryker to donate an electric craniotomy drill With an electric drill you can evacuate blood in two minutes Kerry explains Weve used this drill a number of times and its saving lives I got a letter saying You dont know what a difference this has made  Partnering with the Peace Corps is a strategic move  not only for name recognition  but to tap into its halfcentury of experience The Peace Corps doesnt have the technical capacity to do clinical medicine and nursing Kerry says But they do well at deploying people in a sensitive integrated way To fill the medical gap Kerry wrote commentaries in   and the   After persuading the Peace Corps to get on board she worked with them to got money from the federal government through   a  billion program to fight HIVAIDS to help pay for the health corps The Global Health Service Partnership launched in March and it started taking applications in August It plans to have  health workers in Tanzania Malawi and Uganda by next July What distinguishes this program from other travel fellowships is that it will pay off school loans about  for each year of service Kerry says this should open up the program to more doctors What is really important is that you cover your interest at minimum  a year is more than enough Kerry says The Global Health Service Partnership volunteers wont just provide onthespot medical care Kerry says theyll be teachers and mentors to local doctors augmenting faculties of medicine and nursing Weve been very clear that these people are there to provide faculty support and integrate with faculty in these institutions Kerry says This way they can grow local health systems in a sustainable way She thinks that might eventually help reverse the medical brain drain that plagues many developing countries If we can build up opportunities and create a better academic environment that can build up retention of local doctors she says Health professionals often migrate not just because they can make more elsewhere but because they cant practice the kind of medicine they want to at home she says By raising the standard they might stay People want to stay in their country they want to stay with their family Kerry says The opportunities just have to be built
