Women are delaying marriage and childbirth but infertility rates in the United States havent really changed in  years federal researchers reported Wednesday And even more surprising  it doesnt appear to be because more people are being treated for infertility the National Center for Health Statistics finds The percentage of adults of childbearing age getting fertility treatments   since  Infertility rates have come down a little bit says Dr Anjani Chandra researcher at the NCHS part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention That surprises people because they think it is going up In fact it really hasnt been the case  Chandra and colleagues looked at data from the National Survey on Family Growth in which more than  people were interviewed face to face between  and  The survey was also done in  and  The surveys showed that  percent of married women aged  to  were infertile in   defined as having been married and having unprotected sex for  months without becoming pregnant This fell to  percent of the same age group married or unmarried in   When they added in women who could finally get pregnant but who miscarried before giving birth the number rose to  percent Contrary to popular perceptions based on infertility service use and media coverage about biological clocks we still dont see that Chandra told NBC News  It hasnt changed for men either Some form of infertility  was reported by  percent of men aged  and  percent of men aged  in  similar to levels seen in  Chandras team writes in the report One obvious answer would seem to be increased use of fertility treatments Since  in vitro fertilization or IVF has been perfected and more than  treatments were done in   just about double the number done a decade before Federal law requires doctors and clinics to report fertility treatments and success rates to the CDC But this data doesnt show whether  separate people were treated and the new statistics suggest that in fact more people arent being treated Instead individuals may be undergoing more treatments in the same year says Chandra Thats because the percentage of women who have ever gotten fertility services was the same in  as compared to    percent in both times Dr Richard Reindollar of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine said the findings were encouraging Even though the ages at which women in the United States have their children have been increasing since  the percentage of the population suffering from infertility or impaired fecundity has not increased Reindollar said in a statement Studies clearly show that fertility goes down with age And studies also clearly show that women are delaying marriage and childbearing According to the CDC the average age at which a woman has her first baby has risen from  in  to  in  and  now And the annual birth rate is the lowest its been since  at  births per  women aged  to  So there are two possibilities that would explain the data either the same couples are simply getting treated more often than in past years or women older than  are getting more infertility treatments Chandra said  or both Because the survey stops at age  we are missing some of it she said Another report coming out later this year will answer some of those questions she said Dr Mylene Yao a former Stanford University fertility expert who founded Univfy a private company that predicts fertility treatment success says the numbers arent necessarily surprising She believes people might not be paying attention to their fertility There still needs to be a lot of work done to raise awareness of reproductive health Yao said But Melinda Becker a yearold Washington DC resident who gave up trying to have children five years ago disagrees Perhaps she said people believe theres a fertility crisis because so many clinics advertise and because people talk so freely about an issue that was kept very private in years past  I think everyones talking about it all the time said Becker who asked that her true full name not be used for privacy reasons Its not something to be ashamed of any more
