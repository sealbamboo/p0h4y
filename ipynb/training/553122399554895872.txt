itting in the chair beside her hospital bed in a nightie Elizabeth Lee would much rather be elsewhere  at home Ive been here since midSeptember and was told I was fit to leave in late October but Im still here says Lee who is   and a half she adds The problem is that they cant get care in place to let me go home I feel like Im stuck here stuck and isolated Im missing being at home And Im missing my husband Fred Weve been married for  years If hes on his own there it means Im on my own here The doctor says that as soon as they get care in place I will be going home But theyve been telling me that for ages adds Lee for whom ward G in Addenbrookes hospital Cambridge has become her involuntary longterm temporary home I cant get frustrated as all the staff here have been very kind But I feel upset about being here My eyesights not good  Ive got cataracts  so I cant see very well or read for more than a few minutes Fred visits me every day apart from Sunday when the park and ride isnt on But otherwise I just sit in this chair or stay in bed Its boring she adds Lee is the human face of a serious and deepening problem commonly referred to as bedblocking a major cause of the growing struggle hospitals are facing to cope with an unprecedented number of patients arriving who need treatment mainly through their AE departments The nonagenarian is typical She arrived in Addenbrookes on  September after passing out at home After several weeks of tests and treatment for a broken rib she was declared fit to go on  October but  days on she is still trapped in hospital Officially she is a delayed transfer of care  a DTOC in NHSspeak  waiting in theory for the hospital to arrange a package of care support with Cambridgeshire county council to enable her to get back home She needs to have carers coming in four times a day to help her with some basic tasks as she cannot walk the legacy of breaking her back after falling over on snow in the very cold winter of  But the reality of her situation is much more complex and is both gloomy and very sad Jenny Abel the hospitals lead clinical specialist practitioner for discharge planning explains that it has proved impossible to arrange help for her simply because of where she lives  in a village  miles from Cambridge We just cant get the care for her admits Abel The problem is that although it would be a minute call to see Mrs Lee it would take  minutes to get there from Cambridge and  minutes to get back and that would happen four times a day But because of that and because theres no one else in her village receiving a care package all of the four care providers who provide those packages  private companies  are saying that they dont have the capacity to do it They dont have enough carers or they dont have enough care to provide to others in that area to make it viable Hence someone who is keen and fit to leave the   bed she is occupying unnecessarily is unlikely to be able to do so any time soon because no one can make a profit from her doing so It is a situation the charity Age UK describes as madness in which there are only losers and no winners Crucially it is causing entire hospitals to get clogged up leaving them unable to admit new patients as quickly as they deem necessary As Chris Hopson chief executive of NHS Providers explains Delayed discharges are a very significant problem and a major contributor to current performance difficulties in AE services If a hospital discharge back door is blocked wards fill up very quickly and the AE front door becomes jammed Yet despite the health services ability to cope with the growing pressures on it now being seriously questioned by doctors NHS experts and health union leaders bedblocking has reached its highestever level with record numbers of patients involved and bed days lost Addenbrookes which is among the hospitals worst affected is a microcosm of wider problems Currently  of its  beds are occupied by mainly frail elderly patients classed as DTOCs That is the largest number it has ever had and is a sharp rise on the  seen in September  when it began keeping records Lee is the DTOC who has been there the longest after her fittogo date although another woman has been trapped for  days past hers and another  patients for at least three weeks The hospital pays a heavy price for all this  patient flow vital to its smooth running becomes constricted  though it is an innocent victim of failings elsewhere We want to get these patients home Its in everybodys interest for that to happen says Tom Bennett the hospitals director of operations But before they can go they have to be medically safe to go and the care that will be provided to them when they are at home or at a relatives or in a care home or nursing home or stepdown facility has to be in place And that is when things start getting complicated This whole business is hugely frustrating and it gets upsetting as well Discharging patients who are usually old and needing ongoing care is complex and sometimes very messy says Sandra Myers the hospitals director for integrated care Disputes drag on between the local NHS and the patients council over whether a patients needs once they are discharged are primarily medical or mainly for social support and thus who pays Just when a patient needs the health and social care systems to work together to help them they find that they are fragmented and sometimes at odds with each other As Lees case shows there is too little social care support available  help with washing dressing or getting out of bed  because Cambridge is too expensive for its poorly paid workforce A lack of places in care homes in the city is another problem especially for patients who while fit to go need ongoing medical care If a dementia patient needs nursing care we have on average one bed available in any week in a nursing home for such a patient Thats part of the reason people get stuck here If youre an independent provider a care home these types of patients arent going to be the most lucrative patients because they are the most needy patients So care homes can in effect pick and choose which patients they let in Thats not a criticism its just a fact of life adds Myers The council is having increasing difficulty finding care homes places available at the benchmark maximum prices it is prepared to pay because a mismatch between supply and demand and number of people who fund their own care has produced a shortage adds Abel Such patients require care homes to have more nurses are on duty and both they and Addenbrookes are having trouble recruiting enough for their own purposes That is one reason why Myers has little luck trying to persuade care homes to upgrade beds for less needy patients to ones for medical cases The risk of tough inspection is another Bedblocking does not just increase the risk of Addenbrookes getting jammed up but having to declare a major incident as it has done three times in the past three weeks  including on Tuesday night  due to overcrowding and open as many as six overflow or contingency areas to give it more beds DTOCs also cost it money from planned operations such as hip replacements having to be cancelled In all  such procedures have already been postponed since  January because of lack of capacity partly due to DTOCs One week before Christmas delayed transfers resulted in the loss of  bed days These  beds are a real loss both for the patients themselves who are waiting to go elsewhere and for us and also for the patients waiting at home to have their hernia repaired or hip replaced whose operations we have had to cancel says Bennett Its a very frustrating problem and one which with our ageing population is becoming more problematic over time
