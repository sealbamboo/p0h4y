Governments and tobacco companies are engaged in a struggle over territory  a few square inches on the front and back of cigarette packets But as health warnings grow ever bigger and gorier the companies have been finding other ways to give their products a distinctive look and feel On Saturday  December  Australia introduced the worlds toughest restrictions on cigarette packets On that day they became drab brown containers without distinguishing features other than the brand and product name This was written in a prescribed colour  Pantone Cool Gray  and font  C Lucinda Sans regular size  and   Graphic health warnings depicting the consequences of smoking covered  of the front of the packs and  of the reverse But before the month was out smokers began noticing a small change to some of their cigarettes Under the new rules these were meant to be unbranded but a mysterious threeletter call sign had begun to appear near the filter For Benson and Hedges it was LDN For Holliday it was ESC Winfield bore the legend AUS while Pall Mall got NYC  Its the cigarette companies trying to push the boundaries said Health Minister Tanya Plibersek The owner of the brands British American Tobacco Australia was not fined but was told to remove the mysterious insignia forthwith The episode shows how desperate the tobacco companies are to give their cigarettes a distinctive character  something however small that consumers can respond to  and how determined the Australian government is to stop them Australia is still dealing with the fallout from the plain packaging law The companies said it violated their intellectual property rights sued and lost But Philip Morris is still seeking to overturn the law on the grounds that it breaches a bilateral investment agreement with Hong Kong the company moved part of its business there from Australia soon after plans to introduce the law were announced Separately five countries  most of which either grow tobacco or manufacture cigarettes  have taken a case to the World Trade Organization arguing that the law distorts the market While the litigation is deterring some countries such as New Zealand from following Australias example others are giving plain packaging active consideration The UK may introduce legislation next year  and if the Westminster parliament decides against it Scotland has signalled it may press ahead independently France and Ireland have also expressed a determination to adopt plain packets Dr Crawford Moodie of the University of Stirling foresees a possible domino effect in Europe once the first country makes its move  It will be interesting to see if the uptake of plain packaging follows a similar pattern to pictorial health warnings he says They were first introduced on packs in Canada in  and five years later were only required in five countries but by  that will be at least  countries  The size of the images varies and so do the images themselves The EU has a library of  pictures which all focus on health risks but other countries sometimes warn smokers about the impact of the habit on their wallets or use socalled gain messages  positive encouragement to smokers explaining that they can rid themselves of addiction A new set of photos developed for African countries includes humorous images relating to impotence but there are also graphic pictures such as a man with a vast tumour swelling from his mouth and a miscarried baby lying on a towel  Youre trying to scare smokers and get them to rethink their addiction says Rebecca Perl from the World Lung Foundation which was commissioned by the World Health Organization to create the image library David Hammond of the University of Waterloo in Canada argues that some of the most powerful warnings are not only scary but also tell a story about real people Its a very effective way of changing the discussion around these topics from The governments attacking me the governments preaching to me to Theres a real person and heres what happened to them he says A particularly famous face in Canada is Barb Tarbox a former model who died at the age of  In the months leading up to her death from lung and brain cancer in  she gave antismoking talks to schoolchildren and allowed distressing images of herself taken in hospital to appear in campaigns Her image is still used on cigarette packets today Among developed countries the US is an outlier Despite being the first country to introduce a health warning on cigarette packets back in  it now belongs to a tiny group of countries that have not ratified the WHOs Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and do not force manufacturers to put prominent warnings on the front or reverse of packets South Sudan Haiti and Malawi are in the same position A federal act requiring picture warnings became law in  but tobacco companies sued and a judge threw out the nine images that had been chosen for the packets ruling that they violated the manufacturers constitutional right to free speech For now the US health warning merely consists of text on the side of the packet  the same text that has been there since   The gruesome images adorning cigarette packets in an evergrowing number of other countries reflect two important realisations  cigarettes kill roughly half of the people who use them regularly and the packets play a different role from most other packaging Most packaging is discarded before the product is used for the first time But smokers  like gumchewers and mintsuckers  continue to use their packets until theyve stubbed out their last butt  This isnt just about convenience In the s researchers found that an individuals experience of smoking can be shaped by the name of the cigarette or the colour of the packet A  experiment further found that when male and female smokers were given identical cigarettes with half the packs branded Frontiersman and the other half April men preferred the taste of the former and women the latter  As former cigarette packet designer John Digianni once put it a cigarette packet is part of a smokers clothing When the smoker saunters into a bar and plunks it down he said he makes a statement about himself  This was in  decades before public smoking bans made the plunking down of cigarette packets on bar tables a rare sight in many countries But daily smokers still retrieve their packets from their pockets and handbags some  times a year  and in countries where bans have been accompanied by the removal of advertising from TV and billboards the packet is often the last remaining vehicle for the brand  And yet as the health warnings grow the cowboys and camels shrink and could eventually disappear altogether Smoking is dangerous and addictive Philip Morris told the BBC in a statement We support clear and consistent health warnings on our packaging and recognise the important role they play in tobacco control policy In fact we are such strong supporters of health warnings that we place them on our products voluntarily in countries where they are not required However we oppose excessively large health warnings that infringe on our intellectual property rights and have been proven not to reduce smoking rates The tobacco companies have responded to the spread of inyourface health warnings with litigation and lobbying  Philip Morris spent  million euros m on lobbying the EU in  more than any other company  But also as scope for branding by means of graphic design has diminished they have focused more on the structure of the packet  In  a pack was introduced which rather than opening from the top  the traditional fliptop opening opened from the side says Crawford Moodie Now you might not think thats a big deal but that example of structural packaging innovation increased UK sales for that particular brand variant by m  Sideopening packs also have an interesting sideeffect  when the packs are open the health warning occupies a smaller percentage area Another example of a structural change is the socalled book pack design which opens in two along a spine When a pack is left open on a table no health warnings are visible and the inside of the pack can be branded just like the outsides used to be It extends the communication space for tobacco companies but of course in many respects undermines the onpack warnings says Moodie A variant of the book pack design was released in Australia before the country introduced plain packaging It could be torn in two allowing hardup smokers to share a packet of cigarettes and split the cost However half the pack did not then bear the mandatory warning so the design was banned The countrys plainpackaging law now outlaws all packets except the standard fliptop design Elsewhere the industry has often continued to target women with slimline packets that look like perfume boxes These as Crawford Moodie points out sometimes make the health warning difficult to read Tobacco companies have also chosen colours carefully for areas of the packet not covered by the health warning In more than  countries cigarette companies are now prevented from using terms like mild light and lowtar since these perpetuate a common misunderstanding among smokers that such cigarettes are less harmful But in most countries there is nothing to stop cigarette companies retaining the colour schemes associated with these cigarettes in the past or introducing new ones Tobacco companies have engineered packaging over decades so that we associate terms like light and low tar with packs that come in lighter colours and many consumers mistakenly assume they are safer says Moodie Pack designers often say that colour is the single most important element of pack design Curtailing tobacco companies freedom to use colours is one of the main reasons some governments are keen to follow the Australian plain packaging model Studies have shown that plain packs also make health warnings more eyecatching to users and the whole pack less glamorous and appealing  Moodie is the last person to underestimate the tobacco companies Their flair for innovation and the sheer size of their budgets makes it very hard for public health to compete he says He adds While tobacco companies exploit the entire cigarette pack including the cigarette as a sophisticated communications tool policy makers are less creative The same techniques  the tobacco companies use to attract consumers should be used by governments to dissuade them from smoking he argues Since the companies stamp their brand name on each cigarette he asks why not put a health warning there too He has even mocked up an example of a cigarette carrying the words Smoking kills Watch that space
