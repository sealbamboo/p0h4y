Standing outside her sixthfloor apartment in the Bronx Lissette Encarnacion says she sometimes forgets the place belongs to her Im thinking Im at somebody elses house she says Im ringing my own doorbell Encarnacion used to have a career in banking and lived in a real home with her son and husband Then one night everything changed she says when her husband came home drunk and angry and threw her off a balcony He came home pulled me from the hair and just started beating the hell out of me she says She was seven months pregnant with her second child a boy  Encarnacion suffered traumatic brain injury and was never the same She and her sons moved in with her sister but Encarnacion often wandered off Eventually she became homeless she   NPR affiliate WNYC and remained that way for a decade She suffered from epileptic seizures and was frequently picked up by paramedics and taken to emergency rooms Then two years ago she moved into   an apartment complex that provides supportive housing to its residents  more than half of whom are formerly homeless Now Encarnacion lives in a studio apartment which she has decorated with stuffed animals and Christmas lights And though the place is small she likes to think of it as her penthouse apartment  the director of   the organization that manages the building says The Brook offers a full range of services to keep its residents healthy social workers security a doctor and even an event planner And while these services dont come without a cost  an apartment at The Brook runs at about  a year  Rosen says they are cheaper than the estimated  per year that the city spends on the emergency room visits and stays at shelters and jails where many people with severe mental illness end up You know we as a society are paying for somebody to be on the streets says Rosen Few people would dispute that Lissette Encarnacion is better off in her studio apartment than she was when she was living under the bridge And its far cheaper if she has a doctor downstairs than if she has to show up regularly in the ER The question is who pays for this kind of housing New York now has about  supportive housing units and the state intends to invest  million Medicaid dollars over the next two years But the federal government wont match it At the crux of this debate is the question of whether housing qualifies as health care This past December the outgoing New York State commissioner of health argued in   in   that housing is health care Providing housing to the chronically homeless   health care money he argues so Medicaid should help pay capital costs New York State Medicaid Director   went further arguing that federal Medicaid money already pays for housing through long stays in nursing homes and hospitals But Bruce Vladeck who   in the Clinton administration says federal Medicaid dollars cant and shouldnt be used to pay for housing  its not costeffective Medicaid is supposed to be health insurance and not every problem somebody has is a health care problem says Vladeck Instead Vladeck argues that housing programs should be paid by housing agencies As a society both in the private sector and the public sector we are really cheap and niggling and resentful about paying for social services and we are much more generous when it comes to paying for health services he says At the moment there is not enough housing money to go around for all the people who need it  people like Encarnacion who are done living on the streets but   For her The Brook offers a place in between I stuck it out and its good she says And Gods been real good to me And the people that work here have been very good to me  and patient because I am not easy I am not easy
