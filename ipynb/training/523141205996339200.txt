It is possible to savor every moving anecdote graceful paragraph and astute observation in Being Mortal the latest book by surgeonwriter Dr Atul Gawande and still find yourself wanting to pose a few impatient questions to the author This comes as news to you Were you not paying attention Subtitled Medicine and What Matters in the End the book skillfully maps out the quandaries facing both health care professionals and patients and their families when they come up against the limits of contemporary medicine at the end of life As a newly minted physician I knew theoretically that my patients could die of course but every actual instance seemed like a violation as if the rules I thought we were playing by were broken he acknowledges I dont know what game I thought this was but in it we always won By now though Dr Gawande has come to understand this territory well He has seen his grandmotherinlaw falter and die he has helped his once unstoppable father enter hospice care He has worked with many patients young and old whose diseases and disabilities cant be fixed though that generally doesnt stop them or their doctors from trying In his hospital and in his life he sees the evasion of discouraging realities the pressure to do something when just standing there might be more helpful the conveyor belt that carries ailing patients and their hopeful loved ones from emergency room to hospital bed to nursing home when staying home is what almost everyone claims to want He passes all this along laced with relevant research findings He visits nursing homes and geriatricians offices and tags along with a hospice nurse He also explains the medical financial and other systemic factors that shape our sometimes limited choices It is a modern tragedy Dr Gawande writes When there is no way of knowing exactly how long our skeins will run  and when we imagine ourselves to have much more time than we do  our every impulse is to fight to die with chemo in our veins or a tube in our throats or fresh sutures in our flesh The fact that we may be shortening or worsening the time we have left hardly seems to register We imagine that we can wait until the doctors tell us that there is nothing more they can do But rarely is there nothing more that doctors can do And rarely do doctors write so eloquently But if you have been reading other books and articles about aging and dying if you have grappled with these issues on behalf of dying relatives yourself you may not find much in Being Mortal that you havent already learned In fact Dr Gawande surprised me  though this may be a narrative strategy a way to engage readers in his discoveries  with his apparent willingness to not look squarely at these issues for much of his career In a chapter called Things Fall Apart partly devoted to geriatrics and its benefits he notes that hes passed his own hospitals geriatrics clinic daily for years and I cant remember giving it a moments thought He hadnt thought much about hospice either and knew few patients who chose it until they were days from death It is an odd oversight now that more than  percent of American deaths involve hospice But if as he writes the picture I had of hospice was of a morphine drip why would his patients grasp its multiple benefits and enroll earlier Dont misunderstand Being Mortal is a wise and potent conversion tale and I hope it draws a huge readership It makes its debut on the Oct  New York Times Bestseller List at number three in hardcover nonfiction and the publisher has already gone back to press three times  so it is on its way That other physicians authors researchers and advocates           have surveyed the same landscape doesnt diminish Dr Gawandes book These are arguments that cant be made too often and they are not often made this well But the real power of Being Mortal might come from the mere fact of Dr Atul Gawande  a writer at The New Yorker certified   prizewinning and already bestselling author with    having written it He has a bigger megaphone than most of his predecessors Last week Dr Gawande was all over PBS and public radio and   Stay tuned for a Frontline documentary based on the book in January too People who didnt pay attention before may listen up now
