Nancy Wagner a social worker at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch NJ encounters this frustration at least once a week A patient arrives in the emergency room and tells the inquiring staff that yes she has indeed prepared and signed an advance directive But well she doesnt have it with her On one recent Monday it happened twice First an yearold woman feeling numbness in her arm came in fearing a stroke and underwent a raft of tests Her son who accompanied her was her health care proxy designated to make decisions for her if she couldnt make her own  but where was the document saying so Its locked up in the safe deposit box along with my will she told Ms Wagner Luckily she was alert and oriented and could talk to me said Ms Wagner who quickly arranged for the woman to fill out a new form naming her son But what if shed been unconscious or incoherent On the same day a yearold man came in with pneumonia He too had an advance directive  stored safely at his attorneys office in New York City Im trying to get in touch with his lawyer said Ms Wagner who is required to make three attempts to obtain an advance directive if one exists She was hoping the firm could fax a copy A real crisis developed last month she told me involving a yearold nursing home resident with dementia who came to the hospital in serious decline Whether he should have been in the ER at all is   A friend had his financial power of attorney and thought she was also his health care proxy but her copy of that document was unsigned At least it gave his lawyers name so Ms Wagner could call the law office The friend was not the mans health care proxy it turned out he had appointed his brother and sisterinlaw in Georgia to make decisions for him His brother had since died but the law office could supply the sisterinlaws phone number so Ms Wagner could call and ask her what to do By then the ICU staff was asking whether to put the patient on a ventilator But the firm couldnt fax a copy of the directive because the mans lawyer carried it around with him in a briefcase in his car you wonder if the American Bar Association would approve and he was out of the office taking a deposition It was a nightmare Ms Wagner said Hours passed before the lawyer could return her call and even then he was on the road and not near a fax machine Most of the time patients who have advance directives  somewhere  and dont bring them to the hospital have simply left them at home But lawyers offices and safe deposit boxes are also popular locations All of which are useless if a person cant direct his own care or if family members are at odds or they are rummaging through drawers and files looking for the paperwork while the ER staff stands by Another social worker told me shed seen instances in which the documents showed that the person who assumed he was a patients appointed decisionmaker and was acting in that capacity wasnt the designated health care proxy at all It makes Ms Wagner a little crazy frankly Most Americans dont have advance directives at all But these patients did what everyone   is constantly urging them to do Theyve struggled with this difficult conversation theyve come to a decision and then they just dont bring the document with them Ms Wagner lamented The moral of this story is clear I trust As a hospital social worker Ms Wagner wishes people with advance directives would at minimum supply copies to their primary care physicians and to the individuals named as their health care decisionmakers as well as keep copies close at hand themselves But it makes sense to broaden the distribution and give them to other doctors as well  your cardiologist your neurologist  and to additional family members or friends The more copies there are in circulation the better the odds that one will materialize at the hospital when you need it
