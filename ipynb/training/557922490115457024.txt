Researchers from Toronto came to this conclusion after analyzing 47 studies of sedentary behavior.  , They adjusted their data to incorporate the amount someone exercises and found that the sitting we typically do in a day still outweighs the benefit we get from exercise.  Of course, the more you exercise, the lower the impact of sedentary behavior., The studies showed sedentary behavior can lead to death from cardiovascular issues and cancer as well as cause chronic conditions such as Type 2 diabetes., Physical inactivity has been identified as the fourth-leading risk factor for death for people all around the world, , Prolonged sitting, meaning sitting for eight to 12 hours or more a day, increased your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 90%., So what can you do to reduce the time you spend engaged in an activity that is not good for you?, The study authors did make some simple suggestions to help you sit less.  One is to just be aware of how much you are sitting.  That way you can make a goal of reducing that number a little bit each week.  , If you are at work, you could try a standing desk or make it a goal to stand up or walk around for a minute or three once every half an hour., If you watch TV at night, don't zoom ahead during the commercials with your DVR.  Instead walk around or at least stand up during the show break.
