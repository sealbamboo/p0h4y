To some people the transition to daylight saving time means a few days of sleep deprivation or the chance to leave work before the sky is completely dark To others its a perfect opportunity to conduct scientific research Not just sleeprelated research If you ever wondered whether changing the clocks twice a year would lead to more cyberloafing at work youll be glad to know that business school professors wondered that too Got a hunch that daylight saving time affects air quality So did a geophysicist in Chile Daylight saving time shifts can be looked upon as largescale natural experiments researchers wrote in a   that examined whether lost sleep translated into a greater risk of heart attacks It did Among Swedish adults the the incidence of heart attacks was  higher than usual in the first week of daylight saving time Here are some other discoveries made possible by springing forward and falling back  The more daylight available in the evening hours the more time kids spend getting some kind of exercise according to a   in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity Researchers figured this out by putting fitness trackers on more than  kids and teens from nine countries A   in the Journal of Physical Activity and Health found that British children got more exercise when there was more daylight between  and  pm This strengthens the public health arguments for daylight saving measures the researchers concluded  More natural light during the evening commute improves visibility for drivers which translates into fewer crashes according to a   in the Journal of Safety Research On the flip side many research groups have speculated that the sleep disturbances brought on by daylight saving time could lead to more workplace accidents But studies in   and   found no change in the number of accidents after the clocks changed  A   in the Annals of Human Biology examined whether people with particular variants of genes called CLOCK and PER adjusted more easily to losing an hour of sleep They didnt  People produced more of the hormone cortisol  which is released by the body in response to stress among other triggers  when sunrise got pushed back According to a   in the journal Chronobiology International each onehour delay was associated with a  median increase in cortisol in the bloodstream  Italian researchers persuaded  college students to wear actigraphs in the weeks before and after the start and end of daylight saving time The time change in the spring caused greater disruptions in the sleepwake cycle with students spending more time in bed and waking up more often during the night among other things These   appeared in  in Chronobiology International  A study that examined the concentration of air pollutants hour by hour over  years found that the air was cleaner in the days after daylight saving time ended in the fall These measurements taken in Santiago Chile were   in the Journal of the Air  Waste Management Assn  When workers are tired due to lost or lowquality sleep they are less likely to resist the temptation to goof off online according to a   in the Journal of Applied Psychology The shift to Daylight Saving Time DST results in a dramatic increase in cyberloafing behavior at the national level the study authors concluded
