Human excrement spread by poor sanitation was to blame for over  cholera deaths in Haiti but now thanks to a simple measure to transform it into nutrientrich compost cleanliness has improved  and some enterprising Haitians are able to grow their own fresh food Like an oasis in the middle of the desert Frantz Francois garden is probably the greenest area in Cite Soleil the biggest slum in Haiti the poorest country in the Americas  In an area where it is hard to find even a tree Francois grows carrots peppers and callaloo  a leafy vegetable traditionally used for soups  in his garden But it was not easy for him to tempt his neighbours to eat them as he uses human waste as a fertiliser  something of a taboo in these parts At the beginning some people said they didnt want to eat food from this garden because it was grown in the soil from the toilets says Francois Things started to change when he got his first harvest Neighbours saw the vegetables and they spread the word Little by little the residents are getting over the taboo Now when they see how the plants grow they realise theres no contamination and everyone in Cite Soleil would like to have a garden like this for themselves he says Frantz Francois runs an urban garden that uses compost from ecofriendly toilets a system promoted by SOIL an NGO that aims to improve sanitation in Haiti When SOIL was founded back in  only  of the rural population had access to proper toilets Even in the capital PortauPrince it was only slightly higher at  according to SOILs cofounder Baudeler Magloire Many toilets which do exist often flush untreated waste straight into rivers or groundwater Open defecation in the streets led to the spread of disease After the devastating  earthquake that killed more than  people and left  million living in temporary camps poor sanitation caused a health crisis  Cholera a disease transmitted by drinking water or eating food contaminated by the faeces of an infected person broke out later that year killing more than  people Several studies have found that cholera was probably brought to Haiti by UN peacekeepers from Nepal When cholera struck SOIL had already taken composting toilets to different parts of the country but the fatal disease proved a setback At first glance an eco toilet doesnt look too different from a portable toilet The difference is inside Faeces and urine are collected in separate drums and after each use a layer of sawdustlike material made from sugar cane waste and peanut shells is added on top This reduces the risk of infection and masks unpleasant odours However during the cholera outbreak Haitians were told that poor sanitation was to blame so many people thought collecting human waste added to the problem  As a result the NGO was asked to leave their neighbourhoods and take their toilets with them In Haiti when you talk to people about sanitation theyre afraid of it says Jimmy Louis Sanitation Coordinator of SOIL But the organisation decided to face the criticism by raising awareness about sanitation and inviting community leaders to their facilities to see for themselves how the toilets worked  Now more than  people have access to these toilets in Haiti a country of about  million people According to Erica Lloyd SOILs Program Manager in PortauPrince most of the users of the eco toilets didnt have access to toilets before  People dont want that Given the choice to have safe sanitation people want that for themselves and for their communities and we actually have a waiting list to have a toilet One of them is Midi Idemon He lives in the Gerald Bataille district in PortauPrince and says the eco toilets dignified his familys lives Before we had these toilets there was a communal latrine It wasnt good because some people didnt clean it it smelt bad and there was a high risk of getting diseases With this project we have a better life because at night you can wake up open your door use the bathroom and clean your own toilet For Paul Christian Namphy Coordinator for Haitis Water and Sanitation Authority DINEPA ecological sanitation is an important initiative for preventing cholera offering a lot of promise for the future of Haiti Cholera is the disease of the poor of the disenfranchised its the disease of those that for centuries have not had the minimum of what people need to have a dignified existence We need to make sure that people have access to treated water to basic sanitation services and to hygiene practices that make it possible to cut the chain of transmission In order to stop the transmission of cholera and other diseases SOIL collects human waste from the communities four times a month and takes it to a composting site where dangerous bacteria are killed The compost is left between  and  months in different piles outdoors at a high temperature more than  degrees Celsius to kill the most resistant bacteria  Its a relative inexpensive process as SOILs Erica Lloyd puts it because Mother Nature does the hard work there High temperatures are reached through sun exposure and SOIL only pays for the cleaning supplies After that time it becomes a safe compost that can be used as a fertiliser Its like a circle eat go to the toilet and then give back to nature The main idea is to recycle the resources says Jimmy Louis This organic fertiliser which is sold to local farmers is already being used in the garden at SOILs headquarters to produce different vegetables such as corn spinach potatoes peppers and rice Theyre now testing how the compost works with aubergines and beans  And in a country where according to the World Food Programme WFP nearly a third of the population suffer from food insecurity and  people need external food assistance to survive this can help tackle a big problem This is what Francois is trying to do from his community garden in Cite Soleil where he teaches children and young people to grow plants in old tires and compost soil Almost everybody who lives in Cite Soleil is from the countryside so instead of going to the streets to sell water or other things they know they can learn to care for their own gardens
