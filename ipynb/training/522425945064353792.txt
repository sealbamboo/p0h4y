How many people have died from Ebola in West Africa It sounds an easy question but the answer is certainly not  The most recent official figure from the World Health Organization puts the number of deaths at  But  could be a better estimate Getting to this figure highlights a number of issues with the Ebola data First of all there is a fair bit of uncertainty about how many people have Ebola  The ones we know about stand at   this is made up of confirmed suspected and probable cases However Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea have some of the worstfunded healthcare systems in the world  We know people are contracting the disease and dying from it without being noticed  Based on small trials agencies including the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control are taking an educated guess that the figure is around twice that The widely reported estimate of  cases per week by December uses this doubling to account for underreporting  We get that because  is the midpoint of our modelling scenarios and if we allow for underreporting by a factor of two then thats  said Dr Christopher Dye the director of strategy in the office of the director general at the WHO Use the same principle and the number of cases now could be around   Looking at the official figures again   cases and  deaths  you might think that roughly half of patients die This is wrong Dr Dye told me The data is quite frankly a bit of a mess Take the   It has more confirmed deaths in Liberia from Ebola  than actual cases   This confusing set of figures comes about by collecting data on cases and deaths separately Also comparing current cases and current deaths does not take account of people living with the disease for some time before either dying or recovering  What you need is quality data and the best comes from a report in the   A team including scientists at Imperial College London looked at a subset of patients with full medical records from diagnosis through to either recovery or death  Dr Dye told the BBC On the basis of this analysis our best estimate is a  case fatality and its sensible to use a range as there are variations from one place to another Use the  figure on the  estimated cases and it seems around  are either dead or dying  Clearly that is not a definitive figure but getting there shows how messy some of the data are And this is the same basic data being used to reach forecasts of  million cases by January or  new cases a week by December
