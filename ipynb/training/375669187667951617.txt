On one level its easy to understand the allure of a fad diet Eat this not that and youll lose weight guaranteed Who doesnt want an easy way to shed unwanted pounds It was that sort of thinking that first prompted photographer   to investigate many current fad diets I had tried Weight Watchers  and it works the Los Angelesbased freelancer tells The Salt And then you kind of slip off of that and then you think What else can you do that is easier than counting points  So I started researching other diets and thought These do not sound healthy  Healthful they may not be But visually stirring Absolutely Looking at what such diets require you to subsist on  lemon juice maple syrup and cayenne for the   for example helps crystallize just how absurd for most people they are I think its funny to see exactly what these diets entail visually instead of reading about them Gonot says The series called Fad Diets is really a reflection of a culture thats become overly obsessed with dieting in general Theres all this stuff in the media about fad diets she says and I think we need to eat better and watch what you eat but you dont necessarily need these diets to take care of that Thats a point the medical community is making as well In a   published recently in the   researchers   of the University of Massachusetts Medical School and   of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago issued a call for an end to fad dieting Pagoto and Appelhans argue that our obsession with macronutrients  carbs and fat among them  misses the point that the best diet is the one you actually stick with And no diet they argue can truly be effective without an overhaul in lifestyle as well Pagoto notes that multiple studies have compared diets that vary by how many carbs protein grams and fat grams they require you to eat A lot of times its a draw No diet is better than the other she says in a   When a diet does outdo another diet in terms of weight loss its by a very small amount Not all obesity researchers would agree As   one   published in the   in  found that a lowcarb diet was a clear winner over a lowfat diet and lowglycemic diet Still Pagoto has hit on something that has stymied many dieters forever the challenge of sticking with a weightloss plan thats both healthful and effective We really need to shift our conversation away from what exactly people should be eating to how do you change their behavior how do you get people to make longterm changes Pagoto says When it comes to that effort images like those in Gonots series can help says Kate Pilewski a   at Duke University She and her colleagues plan to use the photographs as part of their student outreach during   in the spring We give students advice about why fad diets dont provide the nutrients they need Pilewski tells The Salt But seeing these diets in photos is really striking and makes them look much less appealing than hearing that
