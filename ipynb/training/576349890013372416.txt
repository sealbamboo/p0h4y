The NHS in England has missed its AE waiting time target for every week of winter figures show Hospitals are meant to see  of patients in four hours but during the  weeks since the start of November that has been missed every week NHS England has also admitted the  average will be below the target  the first time this has happened for a whole year  Hospitals in Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland have also struggled Each nation has missed its target which relates to the time from arrival to being discharged admitted or transferred during November December and January  Northern Ireland has also published a figure for February which showed  of patients were seen in fours the lowest its been this winter The data comes as the BBCs NHS Winter project which has tracked the performance of local hospitals finishes The project has focused on the biggest units  known as type ones  from the start of November to last Sunday The national figure also includes smaller centres such as walkin clinics Sixtythree of the  major trusts missed the target every single week Just one  Luton and Dunstable  managed to achieve the  mark every week But Dr Sarah PintoDuschinsky director of operations at NHS England said the health service still deserved praise for the way it had managed the pressures This winter NHS staff in England pulled out all the stops and compared with last year provided care for an incredible  more people coming to AE and  more being admitted to hospital as an emergency  These record numbers  up by between  and  some weeks  mean that although the NHS wont have met the AE average  target for the full year staff continued even during this busiest winter ever to treat more than nine in ten people within four hours  And most patients were in fact treated in under an hour This is not only the best performance in the UK but probably of any major country internationally The publication of the winter data came as   the pressures in the NHS were so great that even the best hospitals in England were struggling The think tank looked at performance in this Parliament against six targets covering AE operations cancer and diagnostic tests It found most patients were still being seen within the target times at the  hospital trusts But it said performance at even the top sites was declining Report author Holly Dorning said Weve known that hospitals have been struggling to meet the fourhour AE target for a while  But the fact that we are starting to see problems in other areas like access to planned treatment is a real concern  As this study makes clear warning lights are now starting to flash across the wider hospital system
