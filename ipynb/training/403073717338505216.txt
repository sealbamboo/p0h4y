Dogs with the bleeding disorder haemophilia A have been successfully treated by gene therapy according to US scientists  Two of three dogs given the experimental treatment remain free of severe symptoms more than two years on they write in   Haemophilia A is a bleeding disorder which affects one in  men Gene therapy may be suitable for human treatment for bleeding disorders in  years says the Haemophilia Society People with haemophilia A have an error in their genetic code which means they cannot produce a protein called Factor VIII which helps in bloodclotting  Researchers in the US and France studied three dogs with a disorder similar to human haemophilia A  They used a virus to carry the normal gene for factor VIII into platelets the blood cells involved repairing damaged blood vessels More than two years after the gene therapy two of the three dogs remained free of serious internal bleeding Lead researcher Dr David Wilcox of the Medical College of Wisconsin Milwaukee said the study could ultimately improve the quality of life of patients affected by haemophilia A Haemophilia patients usually suffer internal bleeding several times a year and have to have regular injections of synthetic clotting factor The results indicate that performing gene replacement therapy on a patients bone marrow cells can lead to production storage and release of factor VIII from platelets directly at the site of an injured blood vessel to prevent uncontrolled bleeding for several years after treatment he told BBC News   This could greatly improve the quality of life for the nearly one in  individuals affected by this disorder ultimately helping the patients to save a great deal of money in medical costs The Haemophilia Society in the UK said it supported research into gene therapy In  six patients with haemophilia B received gene therapy that allowed four of them to go without medication raising hope for the future A spokesperson said We see gene therapy as a potential longterm solution for people with bleeding disorders given the practicalities and the research already done we would see this on a year horizon as most likely being relevant to haemophilia B and then haemophilia A Nevertheless we are mindful that no therapy can be used until it has passed every hurdle including clinical testing and we are very mindful of the dangers of raising false hopes amongst those affected by the various bleeding disorder conditions Other researchers have carried out gene therapy on dogs with haemophilia A using a different technique which focuses on restoring clotting factor production in the liver  The US researchers say this would not be applicable for all patients such as those with liver damage They are applying for permission to carry out a clinical trial in the US within the next two years
