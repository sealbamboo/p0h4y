Responding to a major case of research misconduct federal prosecutors have taken the rare step of filing charges against a scientist after he admitted falsifying data that led to millions in grants and hopes of a breakthrough in AIDS vaccine research Investigators say former Iowa State University laboratory manager DongPyou Han has confessed to spiking samples of rabbit blood with human antibodies to make an experimental HIV vaccine appear to have great promise After years of work and millions in National Institutes of Health grants another laboratory uncovered irregularities that suggested the results  once hailed as groundbreaking  were bogus Han was indicted last week on four counts of making false statements each of which carries up to five years in prison He was set to be arraigned Tuesday in Des Moines but he didnt show up due to an apparent paperwork mixup A prosecutor said Han will be given another chance to appear next week Han  didnt return a message left at his home in Cleveland where hes been living since resigning from the university last fall A native of South Korea he surrendered his passport following his arrest and initial court appearance in Ohio last week Experts said the fraud was extraordinary and that charges are rarely brought in such cases The National Institutes of Health said its reviewing what impact the case has had on the research it funds Its an important case because it is extremely rare for scientists found to have committed fraud to be held accountable by the actual criminal justice system said Ivan Oransky cofounder of Retraction Watch which tracks research misconduct Oransky a journalist who also has a medical degree said there have been only a handful of similar prosecutions in the last  years He said Hans case was particularly brazen and noted that charges are rarely brought because the US Office of Research Integrity which investigates misconduct doesnt have prosecution authority and most cases involve smaller amounts of money Its a pretty extraordinary case involving clear intentional falsification added Mike Carome a consumer advocate and director of Public Citizens Health Research Group The wool was pulled over many peoples eyes Carome noted that Hans misconduct wasted tax dollars and caused researchers to chase a false lead He said such cases also undermine the publics trust in researchers Finding an HIV vaccine remains a top international scientific priority
