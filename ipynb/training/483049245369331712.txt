The day a premature baby is born is the most dangerous of its life Thats when the risk of death and disability is greatest But doctors around the world are working to help more babies survive that day Of the m premature babies born every year around the world one million will die  Babies born too soon are vulnerable to infection and breathing can be difficult because of their underdeveloped lungs   Its not always fully understood why babies are born early  but things which increase the likelihood include the age of the mother some infections and if the woman has already had a premature baby     Preterm labour  defined as three weeks or more before the usual  weeks gestation  is also higher in women from poor backgrounds in multiple births twins or more or a condition called preeclampsia which causes high blood pressure and the only treatment is to deliver the baby   Malaria can also cause a baby to be born early  The first report on the global toll of prematurity was published just two years ago   estimated that lowcost interventions could prevent up to three quarters of premature baby deaths each year   Modern medicine has helped but the current limit of survival appears to be around  weeks  just over halfway through the length of a normal pregnancy   There is a stark divide between rich and poor countries Two thirds of all premature births happen in    Half of premature babies born at  weeks in developed countries survive whereas half of babies born in developing countries at  weeks will die  This has been dubbed the survival gap  Joy Lawn professor of maternal reproductive and child health and director of   at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine is a Ugandanborn paediatrician who has worked in countries like Ghana She says the stubbornly high number of deaths of premature babies is limiting success in trying to achieve the fourth    to reduce the number of deaths of children under five by two thirds  Weve seen a fantastic progress for reducing deaths for children under five but with much less attention to newborns particularly preterm babies says Prof Lawn  So now  of child deaths globally are in the first month  India tops the list of countries where most premature babies are born  and  of deaths in underfives are newborns But at Goas Medical College in India medics are working to reverse the trend by introducing basic measures aimed at preventing infections  Dr Mimi Silveira insists all visitors to the neonatal intensive care unit wash their hands thoroughly and wear aprons and indoor shoes The staff even sterilise the babies clothes   The measures appear to be helping  Dr Silveira says Five years back our mortality rate was around  but last year it came down to  which I think is quite good  Also babies born at  weeks and below had a mortality rate of almost  Last year we had come down to  One other lowcost method of improving the chances of premature babies is by giving their mothers    costing just  cents  to help mature the babys lungs before it birth which can halve the risk of the baby having breathing problems   Families often feel bewildered by the shock of a premature birth and bonding can be more difficult than with a fullterm baby  Kangaroo care  where a baby is worn next to the mothers breast with direct skintoskin contact  helps to maintain a vulnerable babys temperature promotes breastfeeding and reduces the risk of infection   Importantly it   in stable preterm babies  The technique was pioneered by the Colombian doctor Edgar Rey Sanabria in the late s  in response to overcrowding  there were too few incubators so more than one baby had to be placed in each increasing the risk of infections spreading   Kangaroo care is now proved to save lives  helping to enable babies to gain the strength to go home more quickly  It also helps with bonding during those first few weeks when a hospital environment can feel strange and stressful to new parents  When Jo James gave birth to her daughter Molly at  weeks she weighed just under a kilo Jo had been pregnant with twins after four miscarriages But during a D ultrasound scan at  weeks she was told that Mollys sister Lily had died  She continued to carry both babies for a further four weeks But then there was no movement at all so I thought right I am going up to the hospital to get looked at  I was in slow labour  Both girls were delivered by Caesarean section  Lily was coming out first If Id gone into labour properly Lily would have come out and Molly followed  but she was too traumatised  When she was born she wasnt breathing But the doctors were brilliant I saw her little head but it was five minutes before she breathed Molly was so small there were no clothes to fit her Jo was unable to hold her daughter for nine days  but then tried kangaroo care It was the loveliest feeling says Jo   Molly now three only experiences minor effects after her birth says Jo When she gets a cough she does get a bad chest infection Shes still on iron medicine to give her a bit of a boost which shell take until shes five at least Babies who are born very early  before  weeks  can often be left with lung problems cerebral palsy and learning difficulties  Even babies born just a few weeks early have higher rates of hospitalisation and illness than fullterm infants  In addition to the human costs preterm birth also costs  billion annually   In the UK researchers have been following the progress of premature babies since  in the    Many of the common difficulties like cerebral palsy  characterised by abnormal muscle tone like spasms  have begun to reduce according to Neil Marlow professor of neonatal medicine at University College Hospital London and one of the principal investigators of EPICure  Weve seen that cerebral palsy has reduced quite dramatically over the last  to  years such that now were beginning to see improvements for those babies who are most at risk  which are those who are born very very prematurely  he says As well as intellectual impairment another disability which can affect very premature babies is blindness  Immature blood vessels at the back of the babys eye can grow in a disorganised manner resulting in scarring and detachment of the lightsensitive retina  Oxygen therapy  given to babies born early who have problems breathing  increases the risk of this happening So careful monitoring of babies is crucial Prof Marlow says In terms of vision loss and retinopathy weve now been able to do trials which tell us exactly how much oxygen to give and how to monitor that oxygen  And we think this is going to lead to a reduction further together with some new therapies that are coming along Now that doctors understand more about what helps to give a premature baby the best chance of survival the next challenge  to reduce the amount of disability in the children who do survive being born early  is one which parents like Jo James will follow with interest   She now campaigns for the premature baby charity   along with the rest of her family Jo says Since I had Molly all of my aunts and friends knit for me  And I take hampers to the Birmingham Womens Hospital where she was born every Christmas along with a hat and cardigan for every baby because I know how helpless it feels when all you want is for your baby to be all right
