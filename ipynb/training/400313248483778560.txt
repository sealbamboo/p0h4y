 Scientists say that if all smokers in the world switched from cigarettes to electronic cigarettes it could save millions of lives In the UK there are currently about   attributable to smoking worldwide it is estimated to be more than five million  Now researchers are hopeful that an increasing use of ecigarettes could prevent some of these deaths  But some groups warn that ecigarettes could normalise smoking An estimated  users smoke ecigarettes in the UK according to Action on Smoking and Health Some users combine vaping as it is often called with traditional cigarettes while others substitute it for smoking completely Ecigarettes   to be just as effective as nicotine patches in helping smokers quit Rather than inhaling the toxic substances found in tobacco ecigarette users inhale vaporised liquid nicotine  Robert West professor of health psychology at University College London told delegates at the    at Londons Royal Society that literally millions of lives could be saved The big question and why were here is whether that goal can be realised and how best to do it and what kind of cultural regulatory environment can be put in place to make sure thats achieved  I think it can be achieved but thats a hope a promise not a reality he said  This view was echoed by Dr Jacques Le Houezec a private consultant who has been researching the effects of nicotine and tobacco He said that because the harmful effects of its main comparator tobacco ecigarette use should not be overregulated  Weve been in the field for very long this for us is a revolution  Every adolescent tries something new many try smoking I would prefer they try ecigarettes to regular cigarettes Dr Le Houezec added  Many are now calling for the industry to be regulated  Konstantinos Farsalinos from the University Hospital Gathuisberg Belgium said it was important for some light regulation to be put in place as soon as possible  Companies are all hiding behind the lack of regulation and are not performing any tests on their products this is a big problem Prof Farsalinos studies the health impacts of ecigarette vapour Despite the lack of regulation he remained positive about the health risks associated with inhaling it An EU proposal to regulate ecigarettes as a medicine was recently rejected   as a medicine from  Ecigarettes are still relatively new so there is little in the way of longterm studies looking at their overall health impacts In order to have valid clinical data a large group of ecigarette users would need to be followed for many years   Seeing as many users aim to stop smoking following a large group of esmokers for a long period could be difficult  But in rats at least a study showed that after they inhaled nicotine for two years there were no harmful effects This was   before ecigarettes were on the market a study Dr Le Houezec said was reassuring Concern about the increase in ecigarette use remains   that consumers should not use ecigarettes until they are deemed safe They said the potential risks remain undetermined and that the contents of the vapour emissions had not been thoroughly studied  The British Medical Association   in the same way that public smoking was banned  They stated that a strong regulatory framework was needed to restrict their marketing sale and promotion so that it is only targeted at smokers as a way of cutting down and quitting and does not appeal to nonsmokers in particular children and young people  Ram Moorthy from the British Medical Association said that their use normalises smoking behaviour We dont want that behaviour to be considered normal again and that ecigarettes are used as an alternative for the areas that people cannot smoke he told BBC News  But Lynne Dawkins from the University of East London said that while lighttouch regulation was important it must be treated with caution She said that ecigarettes presented a viable safer alternative to offer to smokers  We dont want to spoil this great opportunity we have for overseeing this unprecedented growth and evolving technology that has not been seen before We have to be careful not to stump that
