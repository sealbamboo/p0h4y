People who use statin drugs to lower their cholesterol sometimes complain of muscle pain and soreness But a new study suggests that in some cases these side effects may be a result of combining statins with other medications The research found that people taking statins had double the risk of muscle pain when they were prescribed various other drugs and often these side effects were what prompted people to stop taking statins People in the study who quit using statins because they could not tolerate them were on average taking as many as three other drugs that could increase the risk of side effects Statins are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world and used by roughly  million Americans to reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke But the new research suggests that doctors and pharmacists may need to do a better job of managing the medications that are prescribed in combination with them What this tells us is that if we as practitioners and as patients are proactive about knowing the potential drugs that could cause interactions we could reduce the risk of these muscle pains and side effects said   a professor at the Oregon State University College of Pharmacy and the president of the National Lipid Association a nonprofit group representing specialists in lipid disorders that funded the study These medications are lifesaving But patients dont benefit from them if theyre not taking them because of a side effect Statins lower LDL cholesterol and can reduce inflammation in arteries But some studies suggest that as many as   taking them   weakness and   in their muscles a condition referred to as myopathy Scientists suspect this occurs because statins block the production of a molecule the body uses to generate energy called CoQ clinical trials are currently exploring whether taking CoQ supplements can prevent this from happening About a quarter of Americans older than  are prescribed statins and it is well known that a large number of antibiotics antidepressants and other medications can interfere with the way they are metabolized Some drugs inhibit an enzyme that helps metabolize statins called CYP Others block proteins that help transport statins across the gastrointestinal tract and into and out of the liver But the net result of drugs that have this impact is the same They increase the concentration of statins in the bloodstream amplifying their effects In the new study which was   Dr Ito and his colleagues examined data on more than  current and former statin users Roughly a third reported having experienced muscle pain that began or worsened when they took statins and about  percent of people who stopped taking them said that these side effects were the reason The researchers found that people who quit using the drugs were taking on average three other medications that could interfere with the normal metabolism of statins Over all after controlling for other myopathy risk factors the study found that people taking these other medications were  percent more likely to stop taking statins Because statins are widely used by older adults many of the people taking them are on other medications for diabetes hypertension gout or other chronic conditions said Dr James A Underberg the director of the Bellevue Hospital Lipid Clinic in New York a lipidologist who was not involved in the research Dr Underberg said many of the patients referred to him are people who tried various statins and could not tolerate them Doctors often decide which statins to prescribe based on cost and insurance coverage But the new research suggests that prescribing based on the potential for drug interactions may affect whether patients actually take them or not If you think about the drug interactions then you can better predict who is going to get into trouble and who is not and maybe you should be using that information to select your drugs said Dr Underberg a clinical assistant professor at the New York University School of Medicine Instead of just saying Im going to choose this drug because its the cheapest or the one I have in my office you should think about which one makes sense based on the drug interactions that are at play Dr Ito said it was nearly impossible for doctors to know all the potential drug interactions of each one of the more than a half dozen statins on the market One potential way to help doctors flag such problems is with better electronic prescribing systems But less than half of all hospitals have electronic medical records in place he said and most of those that do are using rather basic systems There needs to be better systems to identify these potential interactions he said and that will help reduce these potential issues Dr Underberg said that in the meantime clinicians should think carefully when prescribing statins to patients who are on other drugs because if they do not their patients may not be using statins very long Just because there are seven statins does not mean people are going to let you try seven times he said Here is a list of drugs that were found to interact with statins in the current study The list is not exhaustive Other medications may also interact with statins
