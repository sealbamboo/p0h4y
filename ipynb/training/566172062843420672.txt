 Kitchen Mouse.  An unpretentious, newly-opened vegetarian gluten-free breakfast and lunch option in Highland Park's historic Figueroa Street shopping strip, with good coffee..  Highland Park's newer wave of younger residents with nice hair-dos and glasses. Also, a few ladies in yoga pants and ponytails, probably refueling after an intense session from the Pop Physique across the street..  Quick and curt counter service..  The menu is small. Though there is a different special available every week.
