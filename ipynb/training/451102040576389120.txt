She had struggled with obesity most of her life In the ninth grade she was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and doctors put her on prednisone The steroid made it difficult for her to maintain a normal weight  But in  Lugger had surgery to fix the colitis From there on out I couldnt blame anything but my poor habits  Shortly after her birthday in February  Lugger decided that reaching  pounds would be unacceptable The Oxford Michigan resident realized that her weight was holding her back from doing the things she wanted to do She had been the heaviest person in her college classes where she studied to become a physical therapist And although family and friends never said anything outright she noticed they didnt exactly try to set her up on dates   She avoided social situations and outdoor activities that might call attention to her size and she worried about traveling because fitting in an airplane seat was difficult  For weeks before I flew that would be on my mind she said After signing up for DietBet Lugger made a plan She threw out all the junk food in her house She decided she would wake up  minutes early every morning to work out on her elliptical machine Then at lunch she would use the physical therapy equipment at her office to strength train That way if she wanted to go out with friends in the evening she wouldnt miss a workout  I have never seen her so driven and persistent on a goal her friend Travis Summerville said I dont know where that came from but she chose a simple exercise regimen and diet style that worked well for her and she just kept at it consistently Lugger traded her morning bowl of cereal for a protein shake She stopped frequenting fastfood places and instead used Pinterest to find lighter fare to cook at home She now keeps to a calorieaday diet  Im kind of an allornothing person she said I cant just lean into things or it doesnt happen Losing weight did happen Lugger loved the support she found from her group on DietBet and signed up for two more games after the first one ended Over time she upped her bets to  and then  as she gained confidence  and lost  pounds Luggers friend Christie Williams has also lost  pounds using the site Looking back Williams is amazed at how heavy she and Lugger once were But what shes always loved about her friend is still there Williams says    I dont believe Sara has changed as a person She still laughs loud dances crazy and screams at the wrong parts in horror movies What has changed is the activities we do Its not always takeout pizza and two movies Well go walk a couple of miles or play Just Dance before we go out to eat The friends are training for an upcoming K and helping each other maintain their slimmer figures  We are holding each other accountable Williams said My biggest fear was Lugger having a heart attack at age   That fear is gone and I dont want it back  Its never going to be easy but it will be easier than losing her at a young age Overall Lugger has won more than  on DietBet Shes also won a new outlook on life   Lugger used to tell her friends  and herself  that she didnt like basketball because she knew she wouldnt fit into the arena seats Now shes a Detroit Pistons fan  Turns out I really like basketball she said with a laugh  Lugger is also traveling more And shopping She loves dressing in clothes she feels express her style instead of trying to hide in the background Im finding me more and thats a really neat thing
