The head of pharmaceutical drug purchasing for Oregon’s Medicaid program has a message to hepatitis C drug makers: Let’s make a deal. Oregon is seeking to severely restrict use of Sovaldi – the $84,000 hepatitis C pill sold by Gilead Sciences – among Medicaid beneficiaries and expects competing treatments to come on the U.S. market in the next year.. And when one or more of those new treatments does become available, Oregon will start bargaining for a deep discount – perhaps as much as 50% – in exchange for reimbursing the winning drug maker’s therapy for Oregon beneficiaries, Thomas Burns, pharmacy director for the Oregon Health Authority, tells us.
