 Doctors from the Mount Sinai Childrens Environmental Health Center in New York are calling for renewed efforts to examine the role of toxic chemicals in causing autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders like   While the causes of   remain unknown most researchers suspect a combination of genetic and environmental factors are responsible Health professionals estimate that  percent of neurobehavioral disorders are caused directly by exposure to   and that another  percent can be blamed on interactions between environmental and genetic factors said an editorial published yesterday in the journal  A great concern is that a large number of the chemicals in widest use have not undergone even minimal assessment of potential toxicity and only about  percent have been screened for potential toxicity during early development writes Mount Sinai Childrens Environmental Health Center director Philip Landrigan Knowledge of environmental causes of neurodevelopmental disorders is critically important because they are potentially preventable they added in a press release coinciding with the published editorial In December  the Childrens Environmental Health Center hosted a symposium called Exploring the Environmental Causes of Autism and Learning Disabilities Cosponsored by the autism advocacy group Autism Speaks and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences the workshops goal was to discover preventable environmental causes of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders The gathering also developed a list of  chemicalenvironmental suspects Found in paint dust drinking water some canned imported food older toys some imported toys leadglazed or leadpainted pottery and some inks Methylmercury is not the same as ethylmercury the form found in Thimerosal the controversial preservative formerly used in vaccines and which some believe is   Methylmercury is released into air and water mostly from industrial emissions It is the form of mercury that is found in high concentrations in some fish The US government banned production of PCBs in  but they continue to be released into the environment from hazardous waste sites and from illegal or improper dumping PCBs are also found in some types of caulk used in building materials including in some schools These make up the majority of pesticides used on fruits and vegetables ingested by pregnant women and kids in the United States Less common organochlorines are still used The most infamous organochlorine is DDT which was fully banned in the United States in  Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can potentially interfere with prenatal development There are literally hundreds of endocrine disruptors the most wellknown of which is bisphenolA or BPA Toxins of concern in motor vehicle exhaust include carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide These chemicals are found in an array of sources  from cigarette smoke and burning coal to industrial waste incineration and hazardous waste sites These fireproofing chemicals are added to pillows vehicle seats fabrics and some electronics  including computers PFCs are found in sources as varied as waterresistant clothing some nonstick cookware and microwave popcorn bags
