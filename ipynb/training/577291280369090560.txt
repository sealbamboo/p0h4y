Pioneering surgeons have developed a technique to preserve the bowels when removing precancerous growths The rectum is prone to the growth of very large polyps Removing them can cause so much damage it leaves the patient needing a stoma bag The new method has been performed on  people and the largest polyp removed was cm The team at London North West Healthcare NHS Trust said their method was life changing for patients A polyp is not necessarily a tumour But the bigger they grow the more likely they are to become cancerous  They are often removed to prevent them reaching a deadly stage  but larger polyps can be difficult to get rid of  Some are so large they take over the entire circumference of the rectum Prof Brian Saunders a gastroenterologist and surgeon Janindra Warusavitarne developed a new technique at St Marks hospital in London A tube is passed through the anus into the rectum  the final resting point of faeces before they are passed out of the body The tool which allows combined laparoscopy and endoscopy surgical techniques allows one doctor to pull the polyp away from the rectal wall while another doctor cuts it free  Prof Saunders told the BBC What that does is minimise the amount of trauma to the rectal area The patient with the cm polyp couldnt get out of bed he was pouring mucus out of the anus losing sodium and potassium which affected his blood pressure and he could not stand up Now hes absolutely fine back doing his job and leading a full life For the patients who benefit it is pretty life changing George McAusland  from southeast London thought he had Irritable Bowel Syndrome IBS for more than a decade Eventually I had permanent diarrhoea and I would go up to six times per day and in the night as well he said Mr McAusland eventually went to the doctor and a cm rectal polyp was discovered It took a fivehour operation to remove the giant polyp but his rectal function was preserved  Mr McAusland says he had a lucky escape from a colostomy bag I cannot imagine how that must be people put up with a lot of things but that would have been a gamechanger If you do have a bag youre on drugs and medication   Im so glad I dont have to   its all good Im delighted people are out there its not the glamorous end and theyre so dedicated and trying to make it better and better and this seems to be doing the trick It is not clear how many people would benefit  The technique would only be suitable for patients with very large polyps or the very early stages of cancer  not advanced cancer  The team at St Marks estimate that between  and  people might be suitable each year  And with bowel cancer screening coming it is likely to be increasing added Prof Saunders It remains unclear why the rectum suffers from larger polyps than the rest of the colon One idea is that the faeces rest there for longer so there is more contact with potential carcinogens  Shafi Ahmed from the Royal College of Surgeons and a consultant general and colorectal surgeon said The removal of rectal polyps has traditionally been performed through endoscopy however the risk of complications with this technique is higher particularly for large polyps   It is great to see St Marks medical and surgical teams working together to discover and develop a new technique that brings benefit to patients  We look forward to seeing further results in the future as this technique is still in its early phase but its a promising sign of whats to come
