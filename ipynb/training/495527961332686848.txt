Last week we learned that two Americans working in Liberia for a medical charity   were among those who had contracted Ebola When their symptoms took a turn for the worse the organization announced that the two were going to get experimental treatments One was going to get a blood transfusion from a yearold boy who recovered from the disease the organization said the other was to get an experimental serum Whats that We know theres no drug to treat Ebola   But sometimes the human body can mount a successful defense against this deadly virus And  years ago doctors adapted this natural defense to make an impromptu treatment during a previous Ebola outbreak The year was  Ebola had erupted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Eighty percent of patients were dying But a small group of doctors took blood samples from people who appeared to be on the road to recovery  and used that as an experimental treatment for other sick patients Heres the idea A person who had managed to fight off the infection may have developed antibodies that circulate in the blood and that could neutralize the Ebola virus This isnt as crazy as it might seem In fact these sera were a common treatment for infectious diseases in the th century before antibiotics came along Sera are proven treatments for many infectious diseases including diphtheria and botulism In fact the immune globulins used to treat tetanus today are a refined version of this process For example if you step on a nail and are exposed to tetanus and youve never been vaccinated you can get something called tetanus immune globulin which works immediately says   a pediatrics professor at the UCLA School of Medicine These antibodies only stay in your body for about four weeks he says but thats often enough time to treat a sudden infection like Ebola And the source doesnt have to be other people  horses are also used to produce these antibodies for human drugs Because antibiotics are safer sera fell out of favor starting in the s for most diseases And vaccines are a closely related concept  except that vaccines generally stimulate the bodys immune system to produce its own antibodies rather than transferring antibodies from somewhere else Vaccines are much more effective because the antibodies are there at the time of infection Its harder to knock down a disease thats already raging Still if theres no drug theres not much choice Attempts to   date back to  just a year after the virus was first recognized as a threat to public health But the technique relies on finding Ebola survivors who can donate their blood and the antibodies it contains So its challenging even in the best of circumstances Stiehm and a pediatrician colleague from UCLA Dr Margaret Keller   in a published overview of the science that goats were used to produce antibodies against Ebola in the early s and this serum was then used in Russia for emergency prophylaxis for four patients exposed by laboratory accidents Nobody got seriously ill but its not entirely clear what role the serum played in protecting them The most hopeful experience to date involves blood donors who were recovering from Ebola back in Congo in  Their blood was transfused into eight patients who were ill with Ebola Normally  percent of people with Ebola die but in this case seven of the eight survived   The medical charity Samaritans Purse hasnt spelled out the source or the nature of the serum available to its workers These days blood transfusions arent the only possible source of sera Researchers in Canada and Japan are currently developing customtailored antibodies to combat Ebola These are monoclonal antibodies meaning they are specifically designed to attack one thing  in this case the Ebola virus Theyve been successfully tested in monkeys but its not clear under what circumstances this material would be tested in humans
