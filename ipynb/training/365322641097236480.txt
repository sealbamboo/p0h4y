At a time when many Americans have managed to kick the habit a surprising new government report finds that asthmatic kids are just as likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke as they were a decade ago especially if they come from poor families There is some good news though During the same time period secondhand smoke exposure dropped significantly among kids who dont have asthma according to the report by the National Center for Health Statistics  What surprised us was that among kids with asthma secondhand exposure to smoke did not decrease at all said the reports lead author Dr Kenneth B Quinto an epidemic intelligence service officer with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention I think we could be doing a better job educating parents with children with asthma about the health effects of secondhand exposure The new findings are counterintuitive said Dr Sande Okelo an asthma expert unaffiliated with the new study and an assistant professor of pediatric pulmonology the David Geffen School of Medicine and the Mattel Childrens Hospital both at the University of California Los Angeles I think this would be very unexpected for your average physician who would assume that the rates of smoking are going down for everyone  The data for the new report came from the ongoing National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES which periodically interviews and examines a large nationally representative sample of Americans  Quinto and his colleagues looked at health information collected on  children aged  to  Along with surveys the NHANES researchers collected blood samples which were tested for the presence of serum cotinine which is a marker for secondhand smoke exposure  The researchers found that from  to  the percentage of children without asthma who had been exposed to secondhand smoke decreased from  to  percent  while there was a barely perceptible drop  percent to  percent among kids with asthma  When the researchers looked only at recent data  from  to   they found the biggest disparities in secondhand smoke exposure were related to income  Among families with incomes below  percent of federal poverty guidelines nearly  percent of asthmatic kids showed signs of exposure to secondhand smoke as compared to nearly  percent of those without asthma Among families with incomes between  and  percent of the poverty line the numbers were even more striking  percent of kids with asthma showed signs of being exposed to secondhand smoke as compared to nearly  percent of those without asthma Among families with incomes above  percent of the poverty line there was virtually no difference between kids with asthma and those without  percent versus  percent  The explanation for those findings may be that income can be a proxy for educational level Quinto said adding that the more educated parents may better understand how smoking affects asthma Quinto said this study didnt look at the role secondhand smoke may have played in causing asthma The report also found that nonHispanic black children had a higher rate of exposure to secondhand smoke whether they suffered from asthma or not at  percent Mexican American kids had the lowest rates of secondhand smoke exposure But again the rate was higher among those with asthma  percent versus  percent  The new findings fall in line with other research on poor kids and asthma said Patrick Breysse a professor in the department of environmental science and codirector of the Center for Childhood Asthma in an Urban Environment at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public health  Im not entirely surprised by the results Breysse said We know that over the last  years smoking has been banned in public places The last bastion of smoking is the home environment Beyond that studies have found that asthma rates are higher in low income areas of the inner city and smoking rates are higher in the same areas so their intersection is not surprising Breysse said  The new report makes it clear that there needs to be a more targeted effort to reach some of these groups that are at risk for ongoing exposure to secondhand smoke Okelo said  Breysse agreed I think there has to be a concerted campaign to get the message out to all ethnic groups and all socioeconomic strata
