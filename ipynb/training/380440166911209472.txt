Walgreens today became the latest major US company to announce that it's shifting it's employees healthcare benefits over to a new so-called private exchange system. Some 160,000 Walgreens workers will now be shopping for their healthcare on an online marketplace with scores of different insurance companies offering competing coverage plans. The hope is that such systems will hold down rising costs. But consumer advocates worry the trend could mean that workers will end up shouldering more of the cost of their own healthcare.
