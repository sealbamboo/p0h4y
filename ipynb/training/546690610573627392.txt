Images of an expertly sculpted nose on a Chinese mans forehead may be shocking to many but plastic surgeons say the use of forehead tissue for nasal reconstructive surgery dates back thousands of years The practice of using flaps of tissue from both the forehead and cheek to reconstruct a severed nose was begun in ancient India where facial disfigurement served as a form of punishment according to Dr Robert X Murphy president elect of the   They were very far advanced in using the forehead skin to refashion a semblance of a nose Murphy said The Sushruta Samhita a Sanskrit text described the surgical tools herbs and techniques necessary for nasal reconstructive surgery and offered this bit of advice to practitioners Operation without trembling fear or doubt are always praiseworthy of the surgeon operating The   of the Chinese forehead nose has drawn gasps from many in the general public particularly Westerners In the United States plastic surgeons perform such reconstructive surgery in a single session Cartilage taken from a patients rib and ear is used to build a foundation for the replacement nose Next a flap of skin cut from the forehead is folded down and over the cartilage to create a new nose In the China procedure however the plastic surgeon used a different method The surgeon used tissue expanders placed beneath forehead skin to stretch the flesh and create a pocket of skin Next the surgeon placed rib cartilage beneath the stretched flesh to shape a new nose that would later be harvested and placed in the position of the patients old nose which was damaged in an auto accident The process probably took a period of weeks and the actual replacement surgery has yet to occur Murphy said that while the replacement nose was expertly sculpted he doubted that there would be a market for the technique in the United States In the West we go at this in a different way because not many people here would consider having a proboscis on the forehead Murphy said In the Western procedure a patient is left with a flap of skin connecting the bridge of their nose and their eyebrow for roughly three weeks after which bridging flesh is removed I think thats probably easier to deal with than having something sit on your forehead for weeks Murphy said While skin from other areas of the body such as the arms and legs can be used in reconstructive surgery forehead tissue is preferred in nose reconstruction for a couple of reasons Murphy said First forehead skin is the closet match to the flesh found on a patients real nose Skin taken from another party of the body may be thicker have a different color and have hair Second by using forehead skin and keeping a portion of it intact for a short time  that piece that connects the bridge of the nose and an eyebrow  initial blood supply is maintained and chances for complications are reduced Murphy said he didnt see any big advantages in the China procedure compared to conventional reconstruction methods here However he said it did raise tantalizing possibilities for the future when technology and the use of genetic materials such as stem cells has advanced What would be exciting is to take precursor cells and grow them into a form that we want to use in reconstruction Murphy said
