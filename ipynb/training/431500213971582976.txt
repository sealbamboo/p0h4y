The human hand is a wonder of strength sensitivity and discrimination  not only because of those four fingers and the opposable thumb but also because of the human brain that controls it No wonder then that for those who design hand prostheses recreating the natural dexterity of the brainpowered hand is a daunting challenge But a new study demonstrates that with the aid of some artificial sensors and electrodes sunk into a users arm a prosthetic hand can be made to detect the need for a firm grasp or a light touch to make fine distinctions between an objects texture weight and size and to respond accordingly with no detectable delay The latest   published Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine marks another key step in the effort to enhance the function of prosthetic limbs by devising brainmachine interfaces In bioengineering labs across the world engineers and brain scientists are working to recreate the connection that once existed between the brain and the lost limb and transfer it to the new prosthetic limb By a variety of different methods the researchers are trying to make prosthetic limbs that step bend reach or grasp in response to a users thoughts Here however a team of engineers from France Italy the United Kingdom and Denmark worked together to make the communication between brain and prosthesis twoway The prosthetic hand could be directed to open and close at the conscious command of the user But it could also send back to the users brain information about the touched objectdetails for instance about its size weight texture and density The aim of such realtime bidirectional control as the authors of the current study put it would allow prosthetic hand movements that are more natural more dexterous and more responsive to a users needs Allowing sensory input to temper motor commands would someday allow a prosthetic user to employ a different grasp to pluck an egg from a nest than she would to wield a hammer In a yearold man who had his injured left arm amputated below the elbow  years before the researchers tested their ability to restore the user control loop Motor commands for a variety of different grasps as well as for an open hand made their way down the arm and were detected by sensors on the skin of the subjects stump then digitized and conveyed to the prosthetic hand This capability is already making its way into broader use in prosthetics But returning sensory input from an artificial hand is a newer trick To do so the researchers implanted a suite of electrodes into two nerves embedded in the muscles of the subjects upper arm Electrodes sunk into the ulnar nerve carried sensory information from the subjects prosthetic pinky finger to the brainmimicking the routing that had once existed between his real little finger and his brain Electrodes emplaced in the medial nerve became the conduit for tactile information from his prosthetic thumb and pointer also called the index fingeragain reproducing a pattern of signaling that had once existed between his original hand and his sensory cortex Those electrodes carried electrical charges in three different strengths corresponding to sensors embedded in the prosthetic hand itself The lightest contact with an object would set off the weakest charge detectable to the subject A grasp that exerted increasing force on the sides of an object would set off a charge of increasing power stopping just short of inducing a sensation of pain Four months and  trials later the subject who wore a blindfold and soundcanceling earphones during his testruns was not only able to close his hand around a variety of objects with a high degree of dexterity he was also able to distinguish between a pack of cotton a stack of plastic glasses and a piece of wood and without any discernible delay respond to those very different textures with different grips The subject began refining his use of the prosthetic hand almost immediately and the researchers observed clear signs of growing sensitivity within a week of his trying the user control loop for the first time Having just two suites of electrodes to provide sensory feedback may provide a rudimentary level of information to a prosthesis user the researchers said But while that feedback might be made richer by using more electrodes they wrote the human brain may well with experience supply a lot of additional information about objects to be touched grasped and manipulated In time the yearold amputee who served as the groups subject became able to distinguish quicklyby prosthetic touch alone between such tricky paired objects as a mandarin orange and a baseball His restored sensation appeared to induce an artificialalbeit close to natural neural coding that allowed him to learn quickly on his own and to use his growing intuition to fill in unknown properties of the objects his prosthesis touched
