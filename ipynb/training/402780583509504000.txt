A midwife who left a baby face down in a stationery cupboard was guilty of failing to provide appropriate clinical care, a tribunal has ruled.. Yvonne Musonda-Malata, 35, left the four-day-old in the cupboard during a night shift at Queen's Hospital in Romford, east London, on 18 April 2011.. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) panel will rule on what sanctions she will face on Wednesday.. Christine Onade, who was accused of the same charge, was cleared by the NMC.. The incident came to light after nursery nurse Alex Curtis found the baby in its cot in the cupboard.. Ms Curtis told the tribunal she had gone "to the post-natal ward to get an envelope from the cupboard and found a baby lying on its tummy on its own".. She said she had checked "if it was breathing" as staff should "always lie a baby on its back [because of] a risk of cot death".. The hearing had heard the child's mother had a condition which made it important for her to get a good night's sleep and, as a result, the baby had been moved from beside her bed.. The panel was told the child became unsettled and Ms Musonda-Malata placed it in a cot in the doorway of the cupboard, keeping the door open, but was then called away for 20 minutes.. Ms Musonda-Malata had denied the charge at the tribunal.
