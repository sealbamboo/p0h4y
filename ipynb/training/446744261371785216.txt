The human eye can distinguish more than  million distinct colors But scientists studying smell now say they have their vision colleagues beat The human nose they say can distinguish more than a trillion different smells Yes trillion with a T That new figure displaces a much more modest estimate Until now smell researchers have been saying the human nose can distinguish about  smells But   at The Rockefeller University says that number comes from a discredited idea from the early th century which asserted that there are four primary smells the way there are primary colors Thats just plain wrong And I found that so interesting and ridiculous that I thought it would be time to do an experiment and test how many odors there really are Keller says So he and his colleagues at   and   put together an experiment They started with  chemicals with distinct smells and started mixing them together as many as  chemicals per bottle Subjects come in and theyre given three little bottles with odors in them Keller explains Two of the bottles are identical The third is slightly different And the task is simply to tell which one is different Through this process the scientists found that the human nose could do a remarkable job of distinguishing very small differences between smells Once they figured out the percentage of these mixtures a person could distinguish they called in a mathematician who figured out how many possible unique odors you can make from elaborate mixtures of these  chemicals And thats how the number of  trillion came about Keller says Its true that a human being would never encounter a trillion different smells in a lifetime And most of the smells we tested in our test were probably never smelled by a human being before Keller says But the human nose has presumably evolved to be able to detect tiny differences among smells  say to tell the difference between fresh food and something thats just beginning to spoil That could be a matter of life and death So why do this experiment This is just fun Keller says Its just bothersome to see a number in the literature thats so clearly wrong The   was published Thursday in the journal   The question now is whether the new number will be believable to other scientists in the field I think its actually a huge underestimate says   who works at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia Thats more or less the world capital of research on smell and taste The new study at least puts a lower limit on it and says its much much higher than people were thinking he says Mainland who wasnt involved in this project says what intrigues him about the findings is not so much the huge number but that the scientists sometimes found mixtures of very different chemicals that ended up smelling the same This hints that there could be a basic logic of smell he says If scientists could decipher that they could in theory reduce smells to a basic set of instructions  a universal code for smells Mainland imagines that someone someday will come to him and say Look I have this beautiful strawberry smell and I want you make this strawberry smell But you cant use any of the molecules I have on this list I want you to use this other set of molecules to make a strawberry He says If you have a universal code then you can use a set of ingredients that were never in the strawberry to make the same strawberry smell And if you could do that you could send smells on the Internet That is you could transmit instructions to a machine that has a small number of chemicals that can be combined to make a huge variety of smells We could have SmellORama But first you have to figure out the code Mainland says thats a daunting challenge but the new research just might help frame that search
