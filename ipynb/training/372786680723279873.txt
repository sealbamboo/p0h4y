The first complete living model of the developing human brain has been created in a lab dish  Researchers grew human  in an environment that encouraged them to form peasize gobs of brain tissue which developed into distinct brain tissues including a cerebral cortex and retina  The minibrains were used to model   a human genetic disorder in which brain size is dramatically reduced Though not capable of consciousness or other higher cognitive functions the minibrains allow scientists to study aspects of the developing human brain that are difficult to model in animals  The mouse brain is not always a good model system for   study researcher Jergen Knoblich of the Austrian Academy of Sciences Institute of Molecular Biotechnology in Vienna said at a news conference Our system allows us to study humanspecific features of brain development  Other groups have grown small pieces of neural tissue in the lab before but none has been able to successfully grow tissue that contained both a cortex  the specialized outer layer of the brain  and other brain regions Knoblich said  To create the minibrains Knoblich and his team took human embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells  both types of cells with a capacity to develop into any kind of tissue  and grew the cells in conditions that allowed them to form a tissue called neuroectoderm which develops into the   The researchers embedded fragments of the tissue in droplets of gel to create a scaffold to guide further growth They then transferred the droplets to a spinning bioreactor that increased nutrient absorption After  to  days the tissue formed minibrains called cerebral organoids each enclosing a fluidfilled region much like the cerebral ventricles that contain cerebrospinal fluid in the human brain After  to  days some of the organoids formed defined brain areas including a cerebral cortex the brains complex outer layer retinal tissue the lightsensitive part of the eye meninges the membranes that envelope the brain and choroid plexus which produces the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain The minibrains grew  to  millimeters  in in diameter and have survived in lab dishes for  months so far Their size is limited because they lack a circulatory system to provide nutrients and oxygen to their core regions As a result the brains could not develop the many layers seen in a real human brain the researchers said In addition to modeling how a healthy   the organoids can be used to model brain disorders Knoblich and his colleagues used their minibrains to study microcephaly a disorder not easily studied in mice because their brains are already smaller than human ones They took skin cells from a microcephaly patient and reprogrammed them into stem cells which they then grew into brain organoids The mini microcephaly brains grown from the patients cells were smaller than ones grown from normal tissue but had more neuron growth The results suggest the brains of microcephaly patients develop neurons too early before their brains have grown large enough Other experiments showed the orientation in which the stem cells divide could also play a role in the disorder  Biologist Gong Chen of Pennsylvania State University who was not involved with the research called it a remarkable achievement adding it opens the door for many studies on the human brain using human neurons  This method of growing minibrains in a lab could be used to or test medications or to study other brain disorders Ultimately we would like to move to more common disorders like schizophrenia and autism Knoblich said though he added that its premature to speculate when scientists will develop minibrains complex enough to do so  The research was detailed online Wednesday in the journal Nature
