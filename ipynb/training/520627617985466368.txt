The   released this week tells a nowfamiliar story In  life expectancy for older Americans continued to climb People who reached age  could look ahead to an average additional  years on the planet an alltime high Men could anticipate another  years on average and women another  The numbers inched up only slightly from   seniors gained an extra five weeks or so on average But the longerterm trend has been dramatic said Robert Anderson chief of mortality statistics Theres been a fairly substantial increase just in the past decade Take a look In  an average yearold had a life expectancy of  years A big jump came between  and  to  Remaining life span stretched to  years in  and  in  But in the  years after we gained another year and a half 
 Disparities related to race or ethnicity have narrowed Dr Anderson also pointed out Statistics from  show that among yearolds life expectancy was  years on average for Hispanics  years for whites and  years for blacks The latest report points to some familiar reasons for this increased longevity including significant declines in ageadjusted death rates across the whole population from cancer heart disease stroke lower respiratory disease diabetes flu and pneumonia  even from Alzheimers disease for which theres scant effective treatment Of the leading causes of death only suicide has risen But although   from their low point in  they are still much lower at  deaths per  population in  than at their recorded peak  in  The recent increase in suicide doesnt appear to be driving the increase in the overall suicide rate Dr Anderson said How long can increases in life expectancy continue Impossible to predict Dr Anderson said Some people believe theres an upper level and it will level off He recalled predictions that life expectancy at birth would never top  Its just hit  years I think most of those people have backed off he said I dont see any reason it couldnt continue to go up he said Less smoking among those who are now middleaged could increase future longevity among older adults for instance while increases in obesity have leveled off Alzheimers disease has gained ground as a leading cause of death relative to other causes despite the decline in  In  it didnt rank in the top  it entered the top  in  partly because of a World Health Organization coding change By  though Alzheimers was the eighth leading cause of mortality now its sixth But as Dr Anderson pointed out that may reflect what public health experts call competing risks  more people surviving long enough to develop Alzheimers as other diseases cause fewer deaths For some older adults and their families these extra years represent nothing but a bonus The elderly keep chugging along either because theyve remained healthy or because theyre coping well with disabilities and managing chronic diseases The latest figures just mean more good news In other cases as some readers here know too well ailing older people dont necessarily welcome additional years and the medical interventions that make them possible Those folks and their caregivers may not be cheering I give talks where inevitably someone in the audience confesses not only frustration and sorrow about an older relatives long decline but befuddlement at how to help where to turn I dont know what to do she often says How could you know I want to respond mindful of trends like these How could any of us know As a society weve never been this old As caregivers were in new territory Sometimes its great sometimes its awful and everyones just muddling through the best they can
