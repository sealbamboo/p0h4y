There is a sensor on each of Mary Lous two key chains that detects when she goes outside her condos grounds A motion sensor in the kitchen helps monitor her eating habits and another in the bedroom notes when she wakes up in the morning and catches any sleeping issues There is even a flood sensor in the laundry room All the sensors are made by   and relay the information back to a small wireless hub Her two daughters who act as her caretakers can monitor it all on a smartphone app and set up special notifications  Its kept her to the point where we havent even had to have inhome care yet Our goal is to keep her in her home for as long as possible said her daughter Cathy Johnson Caregivers like Johnson are increasingly turning to smarthome technology and wearable devices to monitor family members with Alzheimers and dementia helping them live independently longer One of the first things Alzheimers patients lose is the ability to learn new things It makes getting their bearings and adjusting to a new residence especially difficult But living alone can pose its own dangers such as leaving a stove on wandering off or forgetting to take medication  Often decisions about care are made when safety becomes an issue said said Beth Kallmyer vice president of constituent services for the  Tools like these sensors can allow people to feel more comfortable and ease the transition  SmartThings is a DIY   system that connects sensors and smart devices with a wireless hub In addition to sensors like those in Mary Lous home the system can loop in smart thermostats smart plugs door locks and surveillance cameras  SmartThings is highly customizable and works easily with thirdparty sensors which makes it appealing to people like Cathy Johnson It also doesnt require a monthly fee unlike many other systems Samsung   the company for  million  The elder care tech industry is still young but Laurie Orlov an industry analyst predicts it could be a  billion business by  This means that both startups and bigname brands are getting in on the action         and   all have their own connected home systems and sell starter kits that you can expand by purchasing sensors  la carte   Systems   and   offer seniorspecific accessories such as bed toilet and pillbox sensors   offers connected blood pressure weight and glucose monitoring devices  Wearable devices can also track health and behaviors and builtin accelerometers can pick up on physical changes or tell when a wearer has fallen   is a wristband for seniors that picks up on lapses in routine or changes in gait that might indicate mental or physical deterioration The device is due out this winter Pet doors water heaters you name it weve either got it connected right now or were in the process of connecting it said Kevin Meagher the vice president and general manager of Lowes smarthome system IRIS With any device that collects data privacy can become an issue   We want to respect peoples autonomy respect their desire for how they want their care to go One of the reasons we think people should get diagnosed early is so they can be a part of the conversation said Kallmyer Phil DEramo chose to tell his parents about the Lively system he set up in their senior housing He uses sensors to make sure they take their pills and tracks how many times his father goes to the bathroom at night information that gets passed on to his doctor His father who has Alzheimers said it makes him feel more comfortable to know his son is monitoring him  It helps that Lively includes a social element that appeals to seniors Caregivers can upload photos texts and notes to the Lively app from their phones and once a month Lively will print out and mail the messages and photos to the seniors in a bright orange envelope I compare it to the analog version of Facebook for seniors said DEramo It helps them be connected to the digital social world Connected home and wearable technology isnt enough to replace professional care or personal attention from family members However it can extend the amount of time a person is able to live independently and the technology is constantly improving  Were just touching the surface of the technology said DEramo I think in the future the Lively base unit could interact with the person almost like an electronic caregiver
