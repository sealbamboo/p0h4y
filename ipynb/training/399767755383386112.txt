Anyone who has roasted a turkey knows that if you take it from the oven too soon it will not have cooked through and if you leave it in too long it will be dry and tough For a baby in the womb the same principle applies timing is key A gestation that is shorter or longer than full term can sometimes be less than ideal for the infant and occasionally for the mother A pregnancy a week short or a week longer than full term can notably affect a childs health studies have shown The traditionally used phrase term pregnancy refers to one that lasts from  to  weeks But the words have proved confusing and to some extent subject to individual interpretation That anywhere in a fiveweek period can be deemed term has brought widespread misunderstanding among pregnant women and their doctors as to the best time for babies to be born when there is no compelling reason to deliver the baby sooner or keep it in the womb longer Alarmed by recent trends to induce labor or schedule cesarean deliveries earlier than  weeks gestation for a single fetus the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for MaternalFetal Medicine last month   to clarify matters for women and doctors Language and labels are important said Dr Jeffrey L Ecker a maternalfetal medicine specialist in Boston and chairman of the colleges committee on obstetric practice Outcomes do vary and we want to be sure all involved  doctors midwives and patients  are speaking about the same thing The new definitions are based on the duration of pregnancy calculated from the first day of a womans last menstrual period a known date of conception or an ultrasound measurement of the fetus during the first  weeks of pregnancy   Early term Between  weeks  days and  weeks  days   Full term Between  weeks  days and  weeks  days   Late term Between  weeks  days and  weeks  days   Postterm Fortytwo weeks  days and beyond This terminology change makes it clear to both patients and doctors that newborn outcomes are not uniform even after  weeks said Dr Ecker Each week of gestation up to  weeks is important for a fetus to fully develop before delivery and have a healthy startDuring the last weeks of pregnancy from week  to  a babys lungs and brain fully mature and babies born fullterm by the new definition have on average the best health outcomes Dr Ecker among other experts advocates patience observing mother and fetus weekly and allowing nature to take its course when there is no reason to intervene If it is important to schedule a Csection or to induce labor in an otherwise healthy pregnancy after  weeks is appropriate he said Of course there are many situations in which a planned delivery of a baby before  weeks gestation is medically desirable and possibly even lifesaving One common circumstance is a twin pregnancy which is now often delivered at  weeks Studies have suggested that on average twins fare less well when the pregnancy is allowed to continue to full term Other conditions that can warrant delivery earlier than full term include placental abnormalities a prior Csection that cut through the muscular wall of the uterus an inadequate amount of amniotic fluid fetal growth restriction premature rupture of the membranes enclosing the fetus and in the mother preeclampsia and poorly controlled hypertension or diabetes In the case of fetal growth restriction among others a decision to deliver a baby early should be made on a casebycase basis after thoroughly weighing the risks and benefits Dr Ecker said If everything is going well with mom and baby a delivery before  weeks is not justified said Dr Catherine Y Spong a maternalfetal specialist at the National Institutes of Health whose studies have largely informed the new definitions of term pregnancy In a study of  women who had a scheduled repeat Csection Dr Spong and her colleagues assessed   The earlier the delivery occurred they found the greater the babys risk of developing respiratory problems being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit needing cardiopulmonary resuscitation or mechanical ventilation developing a bodywide infection experiencing low blood sugar or requiring prolonged hospitalization Relative to delivery at  weeks various risks of harm to the baby increased by as much as fourfold for delivery at  weeks and doubled for delivery at  weeks Delivery after  weeks also was linked to an increased risk of infant harm Our results indicate that a high proportion of elective cesarean deliveries in the United States are performed before  weeks they wrote These early deliveries are associated with a preventable increase in neonatal morbidity and admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit which carry a high economic cost These findings support recommendations to delay elective delivery until  weeks of gestation An Israeli study   whenever possible It found a threefold higher rate of infant death among those born between  and  weeks when compared with babies born fullterm The authors pointed out that the last six weeks of gestation represent a critical period of growth and development of the fetal brain and lungs and of other systems Effects of a birth earlier than full term can be lifelong A Finnish study published in the October issue of Pediatrics that followed nearly  men and women born between  and  found that compared with those born at term those born between  and  weeks of gestation were   than their fathers In an interview Dr Spong also outlined the mothers risks in delivering a baby early Induced labor may not work and can be very long the mothers risks of infection and postpartum hemorrhage are greater and hospitalization can be prolonged Although a cesarean section is very safe over all she said it nonetheless poses a greater risk of excessive bleeding infection anesthetic complications and damage to internal organs
