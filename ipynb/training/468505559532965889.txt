
 If not quite AliFrazier or WilliamsSharapova the duel was all the audience of about  could ask for They had come to the first   or XMT to see a fastpaced digitally enhanced memory contest and thats what they got The contest an unusual collaboration between industry and academic scientists featured oneminute matches between  worldclass memory athletes from all over the world as they met in a World Cuplike elimination format The grand prize was  the potential scientific payoff was large too 
 One of the tournaments sponsors the company Dart NeuroScience is working to develop drugs for improved cognition The other Washington University in St Louis sent a research team with a battery of   to determine what if anything sets memory athletes apart Previous research was sparse and inconclusive Yet as the two finalists both Germans prepared to face off  Simon Reinhard  a lawyer who holds the world record in card memorization a deck in  seconds and Johannes Mallow  a teacher with the record for memorizing digits  in five minutes  the Washington group had one preliminary finding that wasnt obvious We found that one of the biggest differences between memory athletes and the rest of us said   the psychologist who led the research team is in a cognitive ability thats not a direct measure of memory at all but of attention 
 The technique the competitors use is no mystery People have been performing feats of memory for ages scrolling out pi to hundreds of digits or phenomenally long verses or word pairs Most store the studied material in a socalled memory palace associating the numbers words or cards with specific images they have already memorized then they mentally place the associated pairs in a familiar location like the rooms of a childhood home or the stops on a subway line The Greek poet   is credited with first describing the method in the fifth century BC and it has been vividly described in popular books most recently   by Joshua Foer Each competitor has his or her own variation When I see the eight of diamonds and the queen of spades I picture a toilet and my friend Guy Plowman said Ben Pridmore  an accountant in Derby England and a former champion Then I put those pictures on High Street in Cambridge which is a street I know very well As these images accumulate during memorization they tell an increasingly bizarre but memorable story I often use movie scenes as locations said James Paterson  a high school psychology teacher in Ascot near London who competes in world events In the movie Gladiator which I use theres a scene where Russell Crowe is in a field passing soldiers inspecting weapons Mr Paterson uses superheroes to represent combinations of letters or numbers I might have Batman  one of my images  playing Russell Crowe and something else playing the horse and so on 
 Now and then a challenger boasts online of having discovered an entirely new method and shows up at competitions to demonstrate it Those people are easy to find because they come in last or close to it said another worldclass competitor Boris Konrad  a German postdoctoral student in neuroscience Everyone here uses this same type of technique Anyone can learn to construct a memory palace researchers say and with practice remember far more detail of a particular subject than before The technique is accessible enough that preteens pick it up quickly and Mr Paterson has integrated it into his teaching Ive got one boy for instance he has no interest in academics really but he knows the Premier League every team every player he said Im working with him and hes using that knowledge as scaffolding to help remember what hes learning in class 
 The competitors gathered here for the XMT are not just anyone however This is the allworld team an elite club of lasersmart types who take a nerdy interest in stockpiling facts and pushing themselves hard In his doctoral study of  worldclass performers most from Germany which has by far the highest concentration because there are more competitions Mr Konrad has found as much The average IQ  Average study time  to  hours and counting The top competitors all use some variation of the memorypalace system and test retest and tweak it I started with my own system but now I use his said Annalena Fischer  pointing to her boyfriend Christian Schfer  whom she met at a  memory competition in Germany Except I dont use the distance runners he uses I dont know anything about the distance runners Both are advanced science students and participants in Mr Konrads study One of the Washington University findings is predictable if still preliminary Memory athletes score very highly on tests of working memory the mental sketchpad that serves as a shopping list of information we can hold in mind despite distractions One way to measure working memory is to have subjects solve a list of equations     x     y     z and so on while keeping the middle numbers in mind   and  in the above example Elite memory athletes can usually store seven items the top score on the test the researchers used the average for college students is around two And college students tend to be good at this task said Dr Roediger a coauthor of the new book   What Id like to do is extend the scoring up to say  just to see how far the memory athletes can go Yet this finding raises another question Why dont the competitors memory palaces ever fill up Players usually have many favored locations to store studied facts but they practice and compete repeatedly They use and reuse the same blueprints hundreds of times and the new images seem to overwrite the old ones  virtually without error Once youve remembered the words or cards or whatever it is and reported them theyre just gone Mr Paterson said Many competitors say the same Once any given competition is over the numbers or words or facts are gone But this is one area in which they have less than precise insight In its testing which began last year the Washington University team has given memory athletes surprise tests on old material  lists of words theyd been tested on the day before On Day  they recalled an average of about threequarters of the words they memorized on Day  college students remembered fewer than  percent That is despite what competitors say the material is not gone far from it Yet to install a fresh imageladen story in any given memory palace a memory athlete must clear away the old one in its entirety The same process occurs when we change a password The old one must be suppressed so it doesnt interfere with the new one One term for that skill is attentional control and psychologists have been measuring it for years with standardized tests In the best known the   people see words flash by on a computer screen and name the color in which a word is presented Answering is nearly instantaneous when the color and the word match  red displayed in red  but slower when theres a mismatch like red displayed in blue Memory athletes are a little older on average than college students so youd expect them to do worse because we know this ability declines with age said   a psychologist at Washington University who with   and   rounded out the research team But in fact they do better staying focused on the colors and blocking out the words Outside experts familiar with the work say the findings are likely to hold up given what is known about memory While attentional control is not a direct measure of memory we know that it certainly serves memory said   a psychologist at Michigan State The skill is crucial in memory competitions he added and its one that likely has a genetic component given what we know about expertise In short memory champions are not only exceptional at remembering Theyre also experts at forgetting To put it another way competitors stumble not when they remember too little but when they remember too much The new research on extreme memory suggests that remembering and forgetting are not necessarily related in the way it seems the one the enemy of the other 
 All of that seemed academic when Mr Reinhard and Mr Mallow took their places on stage at sundown well late afternoon on a recent Sunday to close out the tournament The two are good friends who train and travel together But this was all business a bestofnine series with the winner getting a fat check Look there are spelling bees theres poker on TV theres hotdog eating contests  memory contests should be popular everyone is fascinated by memory said the master of ceremonies Nelson Dellis  the United States champion who persuaded executives at Dart NeuroScience to cosponsor the event and who designed the format For spectator appeal Mr Dellis a consultant based in Miami installed large flat screens that displayed the competitors every move as in televised poker The first category was words The two studied  all in their native German taking no more than a minute The seconds flew and the pair began entering the words into their computers which were in turn projected onto the screens so the audience could follow Mr Reinhard dressed all in black was in motion rocking in his chair jerking this way and that as if physically touring his memory palaces he jumped out to an early lead with  words correct and time ticking down Mr Mallow still stuck at  looked nearly meditative poking at his computer in a way that seemed almost leisurely Hed been here before only an hour or so earlier he came back from a  deficit in the semifinals against the current world champion a Swedish wunderkind named Jonas von Essen Mr Mallow can start slow and finish like Usain Bolt Yet it wouldnt happen this time After losing the words test Mr Mallow won the numbers category but in the cards match Mr Reinhard was fast and meticulous arranging his cards in order on his computer in practically no time He then won names and soon the match and the tournament The crowd exhaled and Mr Reinhard jumped to his feet and pumped his fists letting his head roll back in relief Im happy he called out to the audience happy and  and exhausted In all it had been a weekend that none of the attendees  whatever their Stroop abilities  is likely to forget
