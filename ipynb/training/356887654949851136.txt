Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop a new class of drugs that   The New York Times reported last week For many people with high cholesterol the breakthrough cant come soon enough  the miracle drugs responsible for keeping cholesterol in check in wide swaths of the population may be reaching the limits of their effectiveness Average cholesterol levels in Americans have stopped falling since  according to a large analysis of patient records   Researchers at Quest Diagnostics a national laboratory chain reviewed blood levels of LDL the socalled bad cholesterol in  million adults tested by the company between  and  Average LDL levels declined from  milligrams per deciliter of blood in  to  in  about a  percent drop But in the next three years average LDL levels flattened out An LDL of  mgdL is considered healthy but experts say people at very high risk of heart disease should bring their levels down even further to about  mgdL or lower The percentage of patients with an LDL under  mgdL rose from  percent in  to  percent in  then leveled off Those with a high LDL of  mgdL or more dropped from  percent in  to  percent in  The study was not a random sampling it comprised individuals whose physicians had requested cholesterol tests Still the findings have worried experts The study suggests that the progress has slowed in systematically lowering cholesterol levels said   the chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic who was not involved in the study The authors suggested that these results may affect cardiovascular mortality rates as well There has been approximately a  percent decrease in cardiovascular disease mortality from  through  said Dr Harvey W Kaufman senior medical director at Quest Diagnostics and an author of the study A large portion of this was driven by the reduction in cholesterol and this progress is now threatened A combination of factors have brought down LDL levels including improved diet and exercise But statins have been a significant driver over the past  years The study did not look at causes for the plateau but Dr Kaufman and his colleagues speculated that the recession may have played a role by influencing patients ability to see their physicians and fill their prescriptions for statins Tough times also may have affected lifestyle factors that can contribute to higher LDL including stress levels a highfat diet and lack of exercise The number of prescriptions for statins rose dramatically almost every year since  but the growth slowed in  according to IMS Health a health care information company There also was a decline in physician office visits which means that fewer people are getting their cholesterol tested and treated But other experts suggested that LDL levels have flattened out simply because they may be as low as they can go with the available treatments We could conceivably be experiencing a bottoming out of the statin effect said   director of   research at Childrens Hospital Oakland Research Institute in Oakland Calif According to   director of preventive cardiology training at Columbia University Medical Center There may be a rapid rate of change at first and then you get to a threshold point for which you cant do much more To bring LDL levels lower physicians may need to increase statin doses particularly in those who are at high risk of heart disease The official recommendation has been to reduce LDL as much as possible but physicians dont always adjust statin dose in practice Dr Krauss said If it starts off high and it comes down to  doctors may be satisfied with that But doctors may also have been reluctant to raise doses because of the risk of serious side effects like   weakness and increased   The trend is to focus on therapeutic lifestyle modification for individuals to have a greater input into their health rather than just popping a pill Dr Giardina said  may also be limiting the effectiveness of statins You have to wonder how much obesity is contributing to this plateau Dr Giardina said Obesity raises the risks of high cholesterol   high   and   all risk factors for heart disease She believes average cholesterol levels may be higher than the study found Excluded in this analysis are disadvantaged people who dont have health care and among whom obesity is a major problem Even if new drugs are found the obesity epidemic may blunt their effects Were now to the point that a very large fraction of the adult population is obese Dr Nissen said We will not make any further progress as a society unless we find a way to deal with the obesity epidemic
