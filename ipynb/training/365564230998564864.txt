The case count has topped  in an ongoing outbreak of parasiteborne food poisoning but government health officials still have not identified whats making people sick in all of the  affected states  Last week the Food and Drug administration confirmed that  made by a Mexican division of Salinas Calif produce supplier Taylor Farms was behind cyclospora infections in Iowa and Nebraska which have sickened nearly  people in those two states  Commercial packs of salad mix sold at Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurants in those states were identified as the culprit the FDA said Bruce Taylor the chief executive for Taylor Farms told NBC News that the salad mix containing lettuce carrots and red cabbage came from Mexico  All components were grown in Mexico by contract growers adhering to Taylor Farms de Mexico strict food safety protocols Taylor wrote in an email But neither FDA nor Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials have said whats behind the stillgrowing outbreak in Texas where some  people have been sickened Officials with Darden restaurants which operate Olive Garden and Red Lobster said that Taylor Farms doesnt supply their produce in Texas  And federal officials still havent determined whether its all one outbreak or whether its a series of outbreaks that have collectively sickened  people and hospitalized at least  CDC and its public health partners are vigorously working to determine if the conclusion reached in Iowa and Nebraska helps explain the increased cases of cyclosporasis in other states the CDC website said We will update the public on the progress of the national investigation as information becomes available CDC director Dr Thomas Frieden told   that the agency doesnt know if all the cyclospora parasites are the same and that the lack of ability to sequence the genome of the organism is costing time  Not being able to analyze the genomic sequence in real time is like not being able to solve a crime without fingerprints he said But food safety experts say that state and federal health agencies have mishandled the investigation leaving the public still unsure what products may make them sick  We all recognize that this outbreak has gone on for far too long without sufficient answers said Dr Michael Osterholm a former Minnesota state epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy or CIDRAP at the University of Minnesota  Osterholm said CDC still hasnt organized a casecontrol study in which epidemiologists contact people who are sick and also healthy people to review what theyve eaten recently potentially pinpointing specific foods linked to illness  Dr Rob Tauxe deputy director of the CDCs division of foodborne waterborne and environmental illnesses said the agency is working many angles to track the rare parasite  Casecontrol studies can pinpoint a particular food item but so can tracebacks of likely food sources from settings where exposure occurred In big multistate outbreaks often it is a combination he said  In general outbreaks get solved using a mix of information he told NBC News in an email Meanwhile several consumers nationwide have sued Darden Corp and others saying that they contracted cyclospora infections after eating tainted salad Justin Haren  of Toledo Ohio filed a suit in that state this week alleging that he became ill after eating at an Olive Garden restaurant on May  He wound up in an emergency department a month later and tests confirmed he had cyclosporosis according to Simon  Luke the Houston food safety law firm that represents him  Most of the illnesses in the outbreak were reported from midJune through early July with the number of new cases falling significantly the CDC website indicates  States where cyclospora infections have been reported include Arkansas Connecticut Florida Georgia Iowa Illinois Kansas Louisiana Minnesota Missouri Nebraska New Jersey New York including New York City Ohio Texas and Wisconsin  Cyclospora is a rare parasite transmitted by human feces typically through contaminated produce or water It can cause a range of distressing symptoms typically including prolonged and intense diarrhea It can be successfully treated with common antibiotics
