You're familiar with the push-up, right? Well, trainer Bob Harper of NBC's "The Biggest Loser" has a few tweaks that he says will produce a more effective exercise.. The traditional push-up is largely a chest and shoulder exercise, done with elbows pointing out to the side while you lower the body to a few inches off the ground and then return to the starting position. And there's nothing wrong with it. But Harper's tweaks put the triceps to work and increase the range of motion.. Assume the traditional push-up position: Hands on the floor, a little wider than shoulder distance, and torso and lower legs in a plank position, engaging abs, torso and upper body. Now here's where it gets different: When lowering the body, point the elbows toward the back of the room— not out to the side. (This might require you to first reposition your hands for wrist and shoulder comfort.) Lower yourself all the way to the ground. "Chest hits the deck," Harper says. Then reverse the move to starting position. If that's too hard, put the knees on the ground, using a pad or towel for cushioning if you like.. Harper suggests Tabata training for this one because he says it's the best way to get in the toughest workout in the shortest time. It works like this: 20 seconds of movement, followed by 10 seconds of rest, for eight rounds. That means as many push-ups as you can do for 20 seconds, rest for 10 and then repeat, for eight rounds in all.
