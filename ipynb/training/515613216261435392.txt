Youre familiar with the pushup right Well trainer Bob Harper of NBCs The Biggest Loser has a few tweaks that he says will produce a more effective exercise The traditional pushup is largely a chest and shoulder exercise done with elbows pointing out to the side while you lower the body to a few inches off the ground and then return to the starting position And theres nothing wrong with it But Harpers tweaks put the triceps to work and increase the range of motion Assume the traditional pushup position Hands on the floor a little wider than shoulder distance and torso and lower legs in a plank position engaging abs torso and upper body Now heres where it gets different When lowering the body point the elbows toward the back of the room not out to the side This might require you to first reposition your hands for wrist and shoulder comfort Lower yourself all the way to the ground Chest hits the deck Harper says Then reverse the move to starting position If thats too hard put the knees on the ground using a pad or towel for cushioning if you like Harper suggests Tabata training for this one because he says its the best way to get in the toughest workout in the shortest time It works like this  seconds of movement followed by  seconds of rest for eight rounds That means as many pushups as you can do for  seconds rest for  and then repeat for eight rounds in all
