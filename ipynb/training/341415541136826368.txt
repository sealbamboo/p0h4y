Millions of children participate in organized sports activities that are important to their social and physical development While sports also may place children at risk of injuries most are preventable if participants their parents and their coaches heed some wellresearched safety measures In an article published last month in The New York Times the sportswriter Bill Pennington noted that although much attention is now focused on concussions there are   and do more to prevent Less serious but often debilitating injuries can usually be avoided by attending to guidelines developed by organizations like the   the   and the   Children should not have to pay a painful and sometimes deadly price for doing what is good for them The risks can be minimized when young athletes have proper equipment a safe environment in which to play and access to health care professionals who know when and how to intervene Whether your child plays organized sports like soccer football or basketball or participates in cheerleading or marching band the advice that follows can help prevent potentially serious injuries Much of it is based on  
Never push children into a sport they do not want to do Children should be physically and psychologically ready to participate A preparticipation exam by a physician who understands the possible risks is vital to avoiding them Ideally it should include an EKG to uncover heart defects that can cause sudden cardiac death during vigorous activity When completing a participation form be completely honest Share the childs full medical history Encourage your child to speak up if symptoms or injuries occur during or after a sports event Especially important are the signs of a concussion like dizziness memory loss difficulty with balance or undue fatigue Children should not go back into the game until all symptoms are fully resolved and then only gradually increase participation 
Most league sports rely on volunteer coaches They should be well versed in the sport and able to place the health and wellbeing of players above the desire to win Putting an injured star back in the game too soon is a recipe for longlasting injury Coaches or someone present at all practices and games should have training in basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation and know how to use an automated external defibrillator AED The athletic trainers association has produced an online course on sports safety for coaches available for    Parents may insist that their childrens coach complete it Quiz the coach about his philosophy and ability to support young players Every child on a team regardless of ability should be given a chance to play Children should be praised for trying hard whether or not they succeed on the field and no child should be publicly or privately berated for making a mistake Rather mistakes should be parlayed into learning experiences 
Make sure your child has and uses whatever protective equipment is recommended for the sport including shin guards for very young children who play soccer Check the playing surface and equipment for safety hazards including field goals basketball flooring gymnastics equipment and field turf Find out if there is an AED nearby at all practices and games and if someone who has been trained in its use is readily available An AED can save the life of a child in sudden cardiac arrest if the first shock is administered within a few minutes of collapse Be sure to complete an emergency medical authorization form available from the school or league and  provide parent contact information and permission for emergency medical care should your child need it And check whether the team has a written emergency action plan with individual assignments and needed equipment and supplies on hand 
 
Olympic athletes know the importance of acclimatization before a meet You and your child should too A child who has been in an airconditioned environment most of the time may adapt poorly to outdoor exercise when temperatures and humidity soar Heat stroke can occur suddenly and it can be fatal Different bodies adjust to heat at different rates Know your childs tolerance For most heat tolerance during vigorous exercise should be developed gradually over a period of about two weeks Both before and during practices and games adequate fluid intake   water and diluted sports drinks  is vital to prevent heatinduced illness Caffeinated beverages and caffeine pills and gums should be avoided If the childs core temperature rises and heat illness develops cooling must be started immediately even before medical help is summoned The child should be immersed in cold water applying cold towels or ammonia is not adequate which means that a tub filled with water and ice should be readily available at the event site 
Gone are the days in which young athletes were encouraged to excel in several sports The current emphasis on developing skill in just one or two sports can result in overuse injuries Young pitchers are especially at risk but any child who plays too long and hard too often may be headed for trouble The number and duration of organized practices and games should be based on a childs age According to the alliance for youth sports for children up to age  these should be held for no more than one hour three days a week for those  to  a maximum of one and a half hours four days a week and for those  and older not more than two hours four days a week The days in between and between seasons should be used for rest and recovery according to Larry Cooper chairman of the trainers associations secondary school committee 
Parents should encourage children to do their best emphasizing the importance of playing fair and having fun not winning Attend games whenever possible and find nice things to say about a young athletes performance or behavior If any health or safety concerns arise let the coach or team manager know
