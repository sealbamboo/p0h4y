Years of efforts to reduce the racial disparities in health care have so far failed to eliminate them But progress is being made in the western United States due largely to efforts by managed care plans to identify patients who were missing out on management of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease While management of blood pressure cholesterol and blood sugar improved nationwide AfricanAmericans still substantially trailed whites everywhere except the western US an area from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific as well as Alaska and Hawaii We were certainly hoping we would see indications of progress in eliminating disparities in the country as a whole said   who heads the Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation at the University of Michigan and was lead author of the study While it was disappointing that disparities persisted he said its also heartening to see that  in the West the disparities had been eliminated and that was both surprising and encouraging To find that out Ayanian and his colleagues looked at  Medicare patients who were enrolled in HMOs called Medicare Advantage plans from  to  The  was published last week in the   Disparities in health care have long been noted in American health care The researchers wrote that in  life expectancy was  years shorter for black men and  years shorter for black women than for white men and white women Heart disease and diabetes  diseases that can be better managed by controlling blood pressure cholesterol and blood sugar the risk factors measured in the study  accounted for  percent of the gap in mortality between black and white men and  percent of the gap among women the researchers said Thats why closing the racial gap on these measures is so critical Its one of the first large studies to show that its possible to eliminate deeply ingrained racial disparities in important risk factors Ayanian said He said that outcomes for Hispanics and Asians and Pacific Islanders were also encouraging Nationwide black enrollees in the study were substantially less likely than white enrollees to have adequate control of blood pressure cholesterol and blood sugar trailing whites by about  percent Hispanics were  to  percent less likely than whites to have blood pressure cholesterol or blood sugar under control Asians and Pacific Islanders were more likely than whites to have good control of blood pressure and cholesterol Blood sugar control was about the same Specifically the researchers pointed to  health plans as being successful in eliminating disparities Kaiser includes nearly half of Medicare HMO enrollees in the western region of the US Ayanian said Our findings in the West of nearly identical control of three major risk factors among black Medicare enrollees and white Medicare enrollees in Kaiser health plans and control of blood sugar in other health plans show the potential to achieve equity in these key health outcomes the researchers wrote Kaiser representatives said they did not have any advance knowledge of the publication of the study Dr Joseph Young who leads Northern California Kaisers clinical hypertension program said that Kaiser adopted a population management approach to managing chronic conditions in  Kaiser has created registries for people with various kinds of conditions so that patients who might be missing preventive care or better management of disease can be easily identified In the area of blood pressure control Kaiser changed its drug formulary to allow a combined pill  a single pill that includes two drugs to make it easier for patients to take their medication These populationbased strategies resulted in big improvements in overall outcome for Kaiser patients Young said that during the s very serious heart attacks  fell by  percent and our stroke mortality fell by  percent Kaiser does have some remaining racial disparities in its nonMedicare population and Young said they are actively focusing on closing those remaining gaps We want clinicians to do what Kaiser is doing and take seriously to provide high quality raceblind clinical care says   who leads the Healthy Communities initiative at the California Endowment Kaiser is showing it can be done He called the study very hopeful and believes that Kaisers approaches are replicable elsewhere Any other system that says its not doable has to explain how they can justify not providing the same highquality care to everyone that comes in the door Iton said California probably has less of a socioeconomic spread between whites and blacks than you do in the southeastern United States Iton noted Its a heavier lift in the Southeast than in the West But despite that its clearly doable
