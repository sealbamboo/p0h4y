sums tightly in hand the group of young nursing graduates nervously compared their English as they waited to be called for interview Few had ever left   and only one had been to Britain But if all went well they would walk out of the hotel in the centre of Madrid with an NHS nursing job in a hospital near London The situation in Spain is terrible If you want to work as a nurse you have to leave the country said one candidate Jos who declined to give his surname He had travelled six hours by train to attend the interviews Why not leave Our future is now other countries  He considered himself lucky when he managed to secure a oneyear contract in his region to replace a sick nurse When that ended two months ago the yearold began a new job search but swiftly came up against the scarcity of nursing jobs in his country Spain is very complicated he sighed  As young Spanish nurses struggle to gain a foothold in the countrys job market dozens of recruitment fairs have sprung up to bridge the gap between unemployed healthcare workers in Spain and the UK where  On a Tuesday morning in early February the interviews were being managed by Primary Care Recruitment a company that finds healthcare workers in six countries from Portugal to Poland for clients around the world including several   trusts Recruiters were looking for up to  nurses to work in several NHS hospitals north of London offering fulltime jobs and annual salaries that started at   Applicants were required to have at least intermediate English and previous experience was an asset but not necessary Successful candidates would be informed by the end of the day and could start their new jobs as early as April For Lorena  the prospect was a welcome contrast to her current two hours a day contract at a retirement home I just want a fulltime job she said with palpable frustration After graduating last June quartertime work had been the best she could find  She had little hope that today would be her lucky day I barely know how to say hi in English she laughed adding that she was taking language classes She had simply come for the interview experience and to get a better sense of what an NHS job would entail Ive never even left Madrid  I have no idea what going to England means  Spanish nurses are in high demand in the NHS as Spains fouryear nursing programmes often devote many hours to practical experience in dealing with patients said Ignacio Santos of Primary Care Recruitment But English remains the greatest obstacle for most nursing hopefuls  In Portugal and Spain nurses have been massively recruited for around five or six years already So the nurses looking to go abroad now are often new grads or nurses with a little bit of experience but not much He pointed to countries such as Croatia where foreign recruitment had only recently began The nurses you can find there have lots of experience  Before applicants can attend any interviews they undergo assessment to find out if their English is up to scratch Santos then works with those who make it through to ensure they have a good idea of the job and its expectations The final stage is the interview which often includes a dosage calculation test patient case studies and an interview with the clients in this case two representatives from the NHS trust Last year his company placed  Spanish nurses in UK hospitals said Santos  As the nursing hopefuls waited for their interviews to begin Aurelia paced the hallway A nurse with more than  years of experience she had taken the day off to drive her daughter  a recent nursing graduate   miles so she could attend the interviews I dont want her to go but what other options is there she said  She shook her head as she detailed the Spanish healthcare systems cutbacks and staffing shortages even as it exported highly qualified nurses abroad  Spains Canary Islands had recently opened a competition for nurses she said and she was urging her daughter to apply to those instead I wouldnt want to work in England without speaking English perfectly What happens when youre working with difficult patients or administering dangerous medications   Her daughter Marta agreed with her Im a little worried about my English admitted the yearold If I get something in Spain I might take that instead But the offers coming from abroad are much better  The decision it turned out wouldnt have to be made on this day As the afternoon of interviews came to an end news came that only one of the six candidates had been offered an NHS contract Santos said the number was low Usually the percentage is higher I would say  sometimes higher In this case the hospital was being quite picky  and theyre in their right to do so They want really strong English Some of those who werent selected would have probably been chosen by other NHS trusts he said You never know Youre not inside the room so you dont know how theyre doing in the interview  maybe they just freeze with nervousness Some of these nurses have just graduated and its their first proper interview and its in English Pamela Tonietti  was the days only successful candidate With a high level of English gleaned from an Erasmus stint in Oxford she was eager to move to London Since graduating two years ago she had been searching for a nursing job but the closest she could find was work in a radiology lab She wasnt sure if her move to the UK would be permanent or temporary Ill probably end up staying because theyre at least giving me an opportunity She wondered how her parents would react to the news but said it would come as a surprise to them In my graduating class there were  of us and I think that  of us have left Spain The few that stayed are studying for masters or other degrees  they havent found work
