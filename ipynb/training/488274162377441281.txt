The government is piloting ways to get more people with mental health problems into work by combining earlier treatment with employment support Ministers want to cut benefits spending and get more people into jobs Thousands of Employment and Support Allowance ESA claimants could be affected by the changes The Department for Work and Pensions said treatment would not be mandatory in the pilot scheme but that remained an idea for the future Those seeking to claim ESA  income support for people who are too ill or disabled to work  currently undergo mandatory tests carried out by a doctor or healthcare professional These are known as Work Capability Assessments and are aimed at discovering if people are eligible for benefits or if they are actually fit enough to work  Critics of the checks say delays and wrong decisions have caused distress to disabled and vulnerable people  These new pilot schemes will now see mental health assessments focusing on such issues as anxiety and depression included in that process Any subsequent therapy recommendations are not currently mandatory It has been   have mental health issues Martin Elliot  from Guildford Surrey has bipolar disorder and depression He visited his local JobCentre Plus in  after losing his job as an engineer in the oil and gas industry I was interviewed there by job centre people and at the time they wanted to send me on a prepare to return to work course But I wasnt able to work because of the problems I had They made it quite clear that if I didnt go they would stop my incapacity benefits But then in the same building I later had to attend a mental health assessment This just corroborated all the things that had been said by the NHS and my private psychologists With these new pilot schemes why duplicate whats available at the JobCentre Pluses with whats already available on the NHS Making it mandatory to have treatment is very very risky because any treatment needs to match your needs and its already difficult for NHS mental health teams to get it right There needs to be flexibility to understand peoples problems If they made me do a treatment through this scheme to keep my Employment and Support Allowance then Id probably complain officially but do it anyway Or I might tell them to get stuffed like I have done in the past Several government programmes already assess and support those with mental health difficulties into work or keeping their job but the new schemes are intended to be conducted earlier than is currently the case  A report   said there were significant challenges in current provision of services The first of four government pilots is being trialled at four job centres  Durham and Tees Valley Surrey and Sussex Black Country and Midland Shires This pilot will test whether combining talking therapy with employment support based on the individual placement and support model works better than the usual jobcentre or mental health support for ESA claimants said the DWP Talking therapy usually involves a onetoone discussion with a therapist The other pilots will begin later this year The government has not yet said what form these will take  but the DWPs January report suggested  Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb moved to quash speculation that the counselling could be mandatory and come with a threat to withdraw peoples benefits saying that simply wont work It is not a question of whether tough love is a good concept he told the newspaper  You actually need someone to go into therapy willingly Tom Pollard policy and campaigns manager at Mind said If people are not getting access to the support they need the government should address levels of funding for mental health services rather than putting even more pressure on those supported by benefits and not currently well enough to work  Talking therapies can be effective but it is often a combination of treatments which allow people to best manage their symptoms and engaging in therapy should be voluntary A DWP source described the policy as very much at the ideas stage and a spokeswoman said there had not yet been any discussion as to how the pilots might be expanded or the costs involved in doing so People on ESA currently receive up to  a week if they are placed in the workrelated activity group where an adviser assists with training and skills Those placed in the ESA support group because of severe restrictions caused by illness or disability receive up to  a week The government says it spends around bn a year on ESA and incapacity benefits It estimates that it could save  for every  it spends on this new mental health treatment
