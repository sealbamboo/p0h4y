A pair of rush hours every day rapidly change the way tissues throughout the body work scientists have discovered  The animal study   monitored the function of cells in  tissues through the day  It found large shifts in activity just before dawn and dusk   Experts said the findings could help time medication to hit sweetspots in the body clock The bodys internal clock is known to drive huge changes  it alters alertness mood physical strength and even the risk of a heart attack in a daily rhythm A team at the University of Pennsylvania investigated the impact of the time of day on the way DNA functions in experiments on mice  Every two hours they looked at samples from the kidney liver lung adrenal gland aorta brainstem cerebellum brown fat white fat heart hypothalamus lung and skeletal muscle They showed that  of genes sections of DNA involved in protein manufacture altered their activity throughout the day   Different genes had different activity patterns in different tissues so the research team conservatively estimate that more than half of genes would show daily fluctuations if every tissues type was sampled  The liver was the most dynamic with  genes showing a daily pattern compared with just  in the hypothalamus Two major windows of activity were observed in the study  dawn and dusk It is already known that some drugs work better at certain times of the day  Heart disease is driven by arteryclogging cholesterol which is mostly made in the liver at night Taking statins in the evening makes them more effective  The researchers said  of the top  selling drugs and nearly half of the World Health Organizations list of essential medicines acted on genes which were now known to have this daily oscillation  Dr John Hogenesch told the BBC News website Im hopeful that we can use this information to design better therapies with existing drugs and thats huge because its not going to cost any more money I think there is a real opportunity to improve current medication in a way that will be impactful Dr Simon Archer a body clock scientist from the University of Surrey told the BBC If you move away from one tissue we looked at gene expression just in the blood and look at the whole organism then that precise temporal organisation applies to much more than people previously realised If  of genes are going up and down over hours and these are drug targets then its going to be important Thousands millions of people potentially could benefit from taking their medication at a different time of day and raising this kind of awareness is important Prof Andrew Loudon from the University of Manchester said it was a really important study  He said all drugs were a tradeoff of benefits and sideeffects such as liver damage Drug companies do everything they can to make long acting pills that can be taken once a day but we need targeted drugs with a short halflife and time them for maximal effect and minimal sideeffects
