Children born to women who had gestational diabetes have a substantially higher likelihood of developing Type  diabetes as teenagers a new study shows The researchers followed  obese adolescents over the course of roughly three years about one in five of whom had been exposed to gestational diabetes in the womb At the start of the study   tests showed that all of the adolescents had normal glucose tolerance But three years later teenagers born to mothers with gestational diabetes were six times more likely to have progressed to prediabetes or diabetes themselves than those born to mothers without the condition  Children exposed to gestational diabetes already had signs of reduced function in the insulinproducing beta cells of the pancreas at the studys start said Dr Sonia Caprio a study author and professor of pediatric endocrinology at Yale She suspects there may be environmental factors at play in the first few years of life or unique epigenetic changes in the womb that impair beta cell function  The findings are particularly concerning because gestational diabetes is on the rise in the United States  We need to reduce the onset of gestational diabetes Dr Caprio said There is a lot of focus on trying to prevent women from gaining a lot of weight during pregnancy Not only could it prevent the onset of diabetes in the woman but in the child as well
