 Bad news for all of you with pearshaped bodies  new research finds that this body type may not be better than an apple shape after all at least for some atrisk people Its a commonly held belief that people who have    meaning they carry fat around the abdomen  are more at risk for conditions like   and heart disease compared with their pearshaped counterparts who carry weight more in their buttocks hips and thighs The idea behind the pearshaped is better conceit is that   to lead to type  diabetes especially for women according to previous studies including one from Athens University in Athens Greece But according to researchers at the University of California Davis fat stored in the buttocks area also known as gluteal adipose tissue secretes abnormal levels of proteins that can lead to inflammation and insulin resistance in those with early metabolic syndrome which refers to a group of risk factors that double the risk for heart disease and increase the risk for diabetes To conduct the study the UC Davis researchers found  patients with early metabolic syndrome defined as having at least three risk factors for metabolic syndrome including obesity high blood pressure insulin resistance high triglyceride levels and low levels of good cholesterol or highdensity lipoproteins HDL A control group of  subjects had fewer than two risk factors for metabolic syndrome and normal glucose and triglyceride levels Both groups were matched for age and gender Researchers measured blood counts cholesterol levels and blood glucose blood pressure and Creactive protein levels in all participants Levels of proteins secreted by fat tissue  chemerin resistin visfatin and omentin  were measured in blood and in subcutaneous fat samples from buttocks tissue Subcutaneous fat is found just beneath the skin as opposed to visceral fat which is found around the organs in the abdomen They found that in both blood and gluteal fat of subjects with metabolic syndrome levels of the protein chemerin were higher and levels of omentin were lower than in those in the control group who did not have metabolic syndrome High chemerin levels correlated with four of the five characteristics of metabolic syndrome and may be a promising biomarker for metabolic syndrome said Ishwarlal Jialal PhD lead author of the study and professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and of internal medicine at UC Davis   As its also an indicator of inflammation and insulin resistance it could also emerge as part of a biomarker panel to define highrisk obesity states The protein omentin is correlated with good or HDL cholesterol and inversely correlated with levels of  glucose and triglycerides which are risk factors for developing metabolic syndrome Dr Jialal said future studies should focus on evaluating the role of chemerin as a biomarker for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in metabolic syndrome Instead of focusing on   your best strategy for living a long healthy life might be to focus on maintaining a healthy weight and getting regular exercise The good news is that with weight loss you can reduce chemerin levels along with the risk for metabolic syndrome said Jialal The study was published in the
