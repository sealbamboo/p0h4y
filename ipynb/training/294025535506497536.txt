 Patients with type A B or AB blood are at significantly greater risk for coronary heart disease CHD than those with type O blood researchers found Two large prospective cohort studies showed those with a nonO blood type had a higher risk of developing CHD according to Lu Qi PhD of the Harvard School of Public Health and colleagues It has long been acknowledged that human ABO blood type might affect the risk factors of cardiovascular disease the authors noted in their introduction To further explore the issue they gathered data through the Nurses Health Study  a cohort initiated in  that included  women ages  to  at baseline  and the Health Professionals Followup Study  a second cohort initiated in  that included  men ages  to  at baseline Those in each study were followed up to  Participants answered questionnaires on health data and lifestyle as well as periodic food frequency data They also were asked to report their blood type and Rh Factor negative or positive if known Measures were adjusted for age smoking status body mass index alcohol intake parental history of CHD before age  aspirin use menopausal status and hormone use in women history of hypertension history of high blood cholesterol and history of diabetes The researchers also conducted a metaanalysis of seven studies consisting of a combined  mostly white men and women A combined  cases of CHD occurred in the two cohorts while there were  cases of CHD in the metaanalysis Among participants in the cohort those with type O blood were significantly less likely to develop CHD when compared against types B and AB with a trend toward a higher risk for patients with type A blood A composite analysis of CHD risk in patients with nontype O blood against those with type O blood showed nontype O blood was significantly associated with risk of developing CHD Associations between blood type and CHD risk were not modified by age physical activity alcohol consumption smoking status or diabetes history in men or women the authors wrote However BMI and blood type had a positive interaction with CHD risk in women Differences in Rh type were not significantly associated with CHD risk The authors noted one of the included studies indicated a significant inverse association with nonO blood type and CHD risk After excluding the outlier study the remaining six studies showed a significant association between nonO blood type and CHD risk The highest risk was observed for blood group AB followed by blood groups B and A Qi and colleagues wrote adding that a possible mechanism of action has been seen in studies that reported that plasma levels of factor VIIIVWF complex in nonO individuals were approximately  percent higher than in group O individuals They explained that the von Willebrand factor VWF mediates platelet adhesion to the vascular wall and also participates in platelet aggregation and in development of atherosclerosis The researchers identified several limitations with the study including varying ethnicities of study participants population stratification possible marker status for blood type instead of direct involvement with CHD risk possible blood group misreporting and possible unreported lifestyle factors related to CHD risk Source
