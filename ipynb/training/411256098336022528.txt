Theres been a lot of talk about meningitis B lately Thats the type responsible for outbreaks at Princeton and the University of California in Santa Barbara And it got us thinking How come this form of the illness isnt fazed by the   given routinely to most young people in the US This week Princeton is administering an imported vaccine not approved for general use in this country with special permission from the Food and Drug Administration The vaccine called Bexsero is fairly new Swiss drug giant   which manufactures the vaccine   early last year and   to sell the vaccine in Europe last November It turns out that the meningitis B bacteria are tricky little things They have a sugar coating thats very similar to sugars found on the surface of certain cells in the human brain and body Dr Walter Orenstein associate director of   says this sugar coating complicates the development of an effective meningitis B vaccine The older more common vaccine which protects against strains A C W and Y works by training the bodys immune cells to recognize the sugar on the meningitiscausing bacteria as something bad Orenstein tells Shots The same approach wont work for the Btype bacteria When immune cells encounter the meningitis B sugar coating theyre more likely to identify it as belonging to a friend rather than a foe Orenstein says Theyre used to seeing the same sugar all over the human cells There are ways to teach our immune system that the meningitis B coating is bad but that could be risky he says In the hunt for meningitis bacteria the immune system could start attacking human cells by mistake The obvious solution is to train the immune system to recognize meningitis B by some other characteristic But there are hundreds of strains and sometimes the only thing they all have in common is that darned sugar coating  head of Novartis vaccine and diagnostics unit says researchers analyzed the genes of hundreds of meningitis B strains before they found a few chemicals that most of the strains seemed to share But substrates are different around the globe Oswald tells Shots And even within a single country the meningitis strains can change over time Even so some protection is better than none and Oswald says he hopes the FDA will approve Bexsero for broader use in the US sometime soon Oswald says the Novartis vaccine protects against at least  percent of meningitis B strains  and up to  percent of strains in some countries The   include fever sleepiness and pain at the site of injection So Bexseros not perfect But Emorys Orenstein says at the moment the Novartis vaccine seems like the best bet I think its as good as we can get for now he says Certainly if I had a kid at Princeton Id want my kid to get the vaccine
