Top of the morning to you. A delicious cool breeze and shiny sun are hovering over the Pharmalot campus, where birds are singing, mascots are barking and another cup of stimulation is brewing. A fine start to the day, yes? Hopefully, things will continue on this trajectory. We trust that you relate. In any event, the time has come to get busy. We would also like to remind you that we will be hosting a .  with USC health economist Dana Goldman from 8-9 pm ET. Stop by #pharmalotchat and join the conversation. Meanwhile, here are some tidbits. Hope you have a smashing day…. As for tidbits, GlaxoSmithKline does not have plans to spin off its consumer health-care division; drugs that have been investigated to increase HDL, or so-called “good” cholesterol, may not prevent deaths, heart attacks or strokes; four weeks have passed since MannKind won approval for its Afrezza inhaled insulin, but so far, a marketing partner has not been announced, and The Alexandria Center for Life Science in Manhattan has raised $51 millon to recruit startups to boost New York’s biotech industry.
