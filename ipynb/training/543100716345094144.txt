Broadmoor is to test a camera that remotely monitors patients vital signs such as heart and breathing rate It is hoped the device will alert staff early to any attempts to selfharm and spare patients disruptive night checks Testing with the remote monitoring devices will begin in the new year initially with volunteer staff If successful the technology may be extended to other settings including prisons care homes and even car dashboards Broadmoor is notorious for housing violent criminals But it is a highsecurity psychiatric hospital not a prison taking care of  men with severe mental health problems including paranoia schizophrenia or personality disorders It is now helping to develop a new system of patient surveillance using cameras or optical monitors in secure rooms to detect patients vital signs  initially their breathing and heart rates At the moment staff have to carry out routine checks on patients up to four times an hour through the night This often entails flashing a torch switching on a light or entering a secure room  The clinical director at Broadmoor consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Amlan Basu says if this job could be done by cameras it would allow staff to concentrate on the patients who need help most My hope is that by achieving accuracy of data and reassurance nursing staff will be freed up to perhaps spend their time more effectively by actually engaging with patients rather than having to walk round a ward checking on patients being alive and well A patient I spoke to who has been at Broadmoor for nearly four years told me the nighttime checks were frustrating and disturbing  He welcomed the idea behind the cameras though he felt some patients may not want them I think its a better solution than staff going around and turning the lights on at night time and checking on people every half an hour because youre in the dark and they dont know if youre breathing or not  Turning on the light theyve got to wait to see if youre breathing  but an infrared camera that films you and can see is better than the human eye Broadmoor is working with the hitech firm Oxehealth which has already tested this technology alongside conventional monitors with kidney patients and premature babies at Oxford University Hospitals Trust  The initial results  peerreviewed and published  were good The camera works by monitoring chest movement to estimate the breathing rate  It also detects subtle changes in skin colour on the face  or microblushes  produced by movement of the blood driven by pulsebeats Then  using sophisticated algorithms  it calculates the heart rate  The device  which works in bright light or darkness  is being developed to identify blood oxygen levels blood pressure and the patients temperature  Oxehealths chief executive Jonathan Chevallier says there is no problem with privacy because the camera does not send images  He suggests the technology has great potential for use in the home  If youre over the age of  you probably have friends whove had a stroke  You probably dont spend too much time thinking about it because its a bit scary but if you knew there was a technology you could have in your home silently monitoring you just checking youre OK and its going to detect when youre developing an irregular heartbeat so you can see your doctor and avoid a stroke I think thats a massive benefit  Placed discreetly in the wall of a secure room the camera will be tried out with staff volunteers at Broadmoor in the new year  Then if all goes well it will be tested with patients who have given their consent  A senior nurse at Broadmoor Neil Ragoobar says many will welcome the opportunity for undisrupted sleep  He says this type of remote monitoring should help relations between staff and patients and improve safety  If they know theyve got a patient whos a chronic selfharmer and those vital signs are going outside of the normal parameters it alerts the nurse that there could be something going on here under the covers or whatever and they can investigate before it becomes a lifethreatening situation
