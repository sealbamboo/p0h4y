When Waltraud Ross relocated from Tucson to Phoenix last year the yearold sought a new medical facility she could visit for her   and other routine tests She was happy to find John C Lincoln Hospital because it boasted cuttingedge technology and the facility was close to her office The day Ross showed up for her mammogram the radiologist told her she would have both a regular digital mammogram and a more detailed type which is standard protocol at the hospital for all women who come in for breast cancer screening What Ross didnt know was this new technology  called a threedimensional mammogram or tomosynthesis  would save her life She had no family history of   and had faithfully gone for these breast cancer screenings   which is the recommended age to begin screening mammograms based on guidelines outlined by the US Preventive Task Force In that time her tests had always been normal So when her doctor informed her that the tomosynthesis results identified a centimeter mass in her right breast she was both devastated and surprised Tomosythesis is the latest advancement in breast cancer screening technology It became available in Europe and other countries in  and in the United States in  The first largescale trial on tomosynthesis  conducted in Oslo Norway and partially funded by Hologic Inc the only company that manufactures the technology in the United States  found that the D imaging device increased the   detection rate by as much as  percent The study which was recently published in the journal   and was based on a sample of  women ages  to  years old also found that tomosynthesis improved detection of both invasive and noninvasive breast cancers by  percent and reduced the rate of false positive mammograms by  percent Shortly after learning that she had breast cancer Ross returned to her doctor for a followup mammogram and an ultrasound to verify the results Her doctors didnt waste any time They conducted a breast biopsy and then prescribed six weeks of   The following month around the time she finished chemotherapy her doctor performed a lumpectomy What I was told was the tumor was so small it would not have appeared on the regular mammogram says Ross who works in the accounting department for a health insurance company Depending on where she went for her screening and what kind of mammography system the facility used Ross may not have found out she had cancer until it had progressed Currently there are three types of mammograms available to patients The first analog on film largely has been replaced by digital detector images that are processed in the same manner as regular digital photography Both analog and digital mammograms produces D images though analog mammography has mostly fallen out of favor because it provides a less detailed image of breast tissue An Irish study published in  compared the accuracy of digital and analog mammography and found cancer detection rates were  for digital and  for analog per  patients Tomosynthesis which adds only a few additional seconds to the standard mammogram testing procedure provides doctors with a D picture A highpowered Xray takes multiple images and the result is a series of photos that allow a doctor to view breast tissue layer by layer rather than in a single superimposed image In order to capture a full image of breast tissue the mammography machine flattens  or compresses  the breast before taking a picture The average   is  to  centimeters wide Digital mammography produces a single image of the compression whereas tomosynthesis parses out the images of breast tissue by millimeters so one digital image becomes six or seven says Linda Greer MD a radiologist at John C Lincoln Breast Health and Research Center where Ross received treatment If were catching things earlier we can cut down on people who need chemo and mastectomies  says Dr Greer  who began practicing radiology in  and has used all three types of diagnostic imaging at different points in her career She adds that callbacks for followup mammograms have gone down  percent since the hospital installed the D technology since April  We were shocked by how many things were not seen by the very routine mammogram And we got scared about what we were missing for so many years says Greer D mammography is especially useful for screening women with dense breasts say the Oslo study researchers As a woman ages her breast tissue becomes fattier and irregular cells are easier to see in a D picture According to Are You Dense a breast cancer advocacy organization more than  percent of premenopausal women and  percent of postmenopausal women have dense breast tissue which makes a tumor difficult to spot because the tumor and healthy tissue both appear as white in the image A growth in a breast thats less dense shows up grey in a D scan Since  tomosynthesis has increasingly made its way into radiology facilities and hospitals throughout the country and is now available in  US states As of last September Hologic had installed some  tomosynthesis systems at medical facilities across the country By fall  they expect that number to double say Hologic executives However because tomosynthesis is a relatively new technology in the United States many insurance companies have yet to extend coverage Melissa Banks senior director of global products marketing at Hologic says many healthcare providers accommodate their patients by billing insurance companies extra for standard digital mammography even though the patient may have had a D scan Other facilities may charge the patient an outofpocket fee from around  to  she says Greer says John C Lincoln Hospital doesnt charge patients additional fees for tomosynthesis because several staff members have been treated for breast cancer and the hospital is committed to offering its patients the most advance technology But Susan Brown MS RN director of community health at the Susan G Komen Breast Cancer Foundation isnt convinced theres yet enough evidence to prove tomosynthesis is more effective than digital mammography Women should make a decision about using this after a discussion with their healthcare provider and insurance company she says Its important to discuss the tests drawbacks especially because the technology is still fairly new The main drawback is the potential longterm effect on a womans health One of things I understand is it does require a higher exposure to radiation Brown says which is a detail that was verified by both the Oslo study researchers and representatives from Hologic But Brown adds If this technology reduces the callback rate then perhaps this higher dose of radiation is acceptable Still Ross  who is now cancerfree on a fiveyear course of tamoxifen returns to her doctor for a followup mammogram every six months  gives little thought to possible drawbacksI was pretty lucky because things like that advance pretty fast she says I tell my friends to make sure to go to a D mammogram place
