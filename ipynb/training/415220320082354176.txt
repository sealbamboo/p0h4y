Many older adults want to live independently without relying on assistance from others for as long as they can But how often does that actually happen    A study published recently in the American Journal of Public Health attempts to answer the question by examining   an issue that hasnt received much scholarly attention  Disability in the academic sense refers to a reduced ability to perform activities such as bathing using the toilet getting around cooking or shopping because of deteriorating strength mobility pain or other physical or cognitive challenges The study divided  million older adults enrolled in Medicare into five categories  people who live independently without any assistance those with a disability who successfully use assistive technology see   people who have cut back on activities but dont acknowledge limitations those who admit its hard to cope on their own but still do so and those who rely on assistance from others Think of this as a spectrum of adaptation  The first two groups are doing just fine while the next two groups have issues but are still finding ways to manage  By contrast the fifth group has accepted that complete independence is no longer possible How do the numbers break out   In their new study researchers from the University of Michigan Johns Hopkins University the Urban Institute and other institutions analyzed a nationally representative sample of more than  seniors on Medicare from the National Health and Aging Trends Study including a small subset of nursing home residents The data were gathered in  mostly through inperson interviews From the findings the researchers estimated the numbers of people in each category in the general population  And the results an estimated  million older adults are fully able to manage on their own without any type of help  percent of all seniors on Medicare   million have successfully adapted to disability  percent  million have reduced their activities without acknowledging limitations  percent  million find it hard to function independently  percent and  million received assistance with at least one task over the last month about  percent including  million seniors living in nursing homes These are the first national figures of their kind and they paint a more nuanced portrait of seniors than found in the many studies that take a binary approach lumping older Americans into disabled or independent categories  This is a much finer way to break down older people with physical limitations and understand how theyre functioning in their environments said Dr Jack Guralnik a professor of public health and epidemiology at the University of Maryland who was not involved in the research Three groups in this new study are of particular interest to researchers The first are the successful adapters who change their home environments or how they approach  activities and get along well on their own Think of older adults who install grab bars in the bathroom use a cane install a seat in the shower or rely on a hearing aid  and who otherwise seem unimpaired This group has been hidden from prior attempts to measure disability in the older population said Vicki Freedman lead author of the new study and a professor at the University of Michigans Institute for Social Research  Traditionally weve focused on people who cant perform specific functions and who need help not people who have found a way to manage The size of this group is striking as is the finding that those in it experience wellbeing almost equal to that of seniors who dont rely on any type of assistance   Its extremely important for us as a society to understand that getting older and losing some degree of functioning does not have to be equated with the loss of independence said Dr Linda Fried dean of Columbia Universitys Mailman School of Public Health who has studied adaptation to disability in the elderly   Two other groups stand out by virtue of their potential vulnerability older adults who have cut back on activities such as going outside and seniors who report having problems despite efforts to use devices to compensate for physical ailments  Both are at risk of losing their independence and both might benefit from interventions such as home modifications and physical therapy and from devices such as hearing aids and walkers   Finding ways to promote independence and wellbeing in these groups now that weve identified them is an important public health goal Dr Freedman said   This doesnt have to be excessively complicated or costly Many of the accommodations that could be helpful are simple to put in place and relatively inexpensive  Helping seniors with these kinds of issues is a big part of what we do as geriatricians said Dr Fried But too often these needs are not a part of the discussion when older adults see other types of physicians What about the fifth group in this study  seniors who receive some kind of personal assistance  Some experts classify them as dependent while putting seniors who use assistive technology in the independent category But H Stephen Kaye a professor at the Institute for Health and Aging at the University of California San Francisco argues that this is a false distinction   I have a fundamental problem with the notion that the use of technology is different from the use of personal assistance he said  Both represent a way of getting help and both can be a successful accommodation to disability depending on a persons circumstances
