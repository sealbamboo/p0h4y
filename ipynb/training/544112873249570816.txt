Ganta is the Liberian city that never sleeps Thats what local businessman Prince Haward says of the town of  one of the countrys largest cities and a crossroads for travelers in the southeastern region Ganta is a nonsleeping city  a businessoriented city Its also a city that has seen its share of tragedy The scruffy town is located in Liberias eastern Nimba County where the countrys brutal civil war started in late  Many buildings were destroyed during the conflict and remain gutted others are still pocked by artillery and mortar fire from the war And theres been little investment in the gritty city since the conflict ended more than a decade ago Potholes nearly swallow up vehicles So even before Ebola Ganta was struggling And now the virus is taking a toll For many people theres very little business right now Ebola is the reason The border with neighboring Guinea was closed in July to prevent possible spread of the virus Just a hundred yards from the St John River bridge crossing young men play whist under the shade of a mango tree They used to be money changers A very unhappy Prince Dolo says the outbreak put an abrupt end to their livelihoods I have nothing to do Border is closed And Im vulnerable and unemployed Im not happy Without the border Ganta is just dead Just off Gantas rutted reddust main street yearold Bebe Gono who sells readypeeled oranges says shes struggling just like the city We are trying to find the little we can afford Comparing Liberias civil war with Ebola in her town Gono says both have been difficult Ganta has suffered a lot Weve lost a lot of people to the war and weve also lost a lot of people to Ebola As compared with the war Ebola is worse Gono never went to school and cant read or write But true to the entrepreneurial spirit of her town she has dreams of a better life If she had a little money shed like to open a business in the city that never sleeps
