UK researchers are launching a mass participation study asking people to do an online hearing test to find out if modern life has been harming our ears An estimated one in six adults in the UK has at least some hearing loss But it is not clear what role environmental factors such as listening to amplified music play in this The Medical Research Council wants people young and old to take part to answer this question  Volunteers who   will be quizzed about their listening habits and asked to complete a quick assessment of their hearing for speech in a background of noise  If a lifetime of loud music does lead to hearing loss the scientists expect to see a correlation between the participants reported previous listening habits and current hearing abilities  Over the last  years advances in electronic amplification have changed how we listen to music  Portable MP players have replaced the family piano and gramophone And in discos and clubs music is now played loud enough to be felt as well as heard Experts know that exposure to loud sounds can cause temporary hearing loss But how loud and long does the exposure have to be before it begins to affect our hearing  There is a growing concern around the more modest levels of exposure experienced on a regular basis by people who listen to music using earphones Dr Michael Akeroyd from the MRC Institute of Hearing Research is leading the project  He said Many studies of musicrelated hearing loss have focused on musicians who may be exposed to loud music almost every day But far less is known about the cumulative effects of loudmusic listening on the hearing of the general public The primary purpose of this project is to determine if there is such a link Paul Breckell of the charity Action on Hearing Loss said Damage to your hearing is irreversible  and contrary to popular opinion hearing loss is not a condition that only older people need to concern themselves with  The MRCs public experiment is such a vital piece of work to offer a robust understanding of and insight into how people stave off early loss of their hearing Currently approximately  million people in the UK have some form of hearing loss This number is expected to rise to  million by
