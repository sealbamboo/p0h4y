In a small but intriguing study researchers found that on average people with Alzheimers disease had more of the DDT metabolite DDE in their blood serum than a control group in a similar age range DDE can last in the body for a number of years said lead author Jason Richardson of RutgersRobert Wood Johnson Medical School When you are looking at DDE levels it is basically a snapshot of a persons lifetime exposure to DDT as well as DDE in the environment The findings were published in the journal JAMA Neurology Richardson said that while he expected to see a correlation between Alzheimers and DDE levels he did not expect it to be so dramatic The average amount of DDE in the serum of the  people in the Alzheimers group was four times greater than the average amount in the control group of  We cant say that DDT exposure is responsible for Alzheimers with a study like this but what we can say right now is that if you have higher levels of DDE you are more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimers said Richardson Over  of us have measurable levels of DDE in our blood that is a reality Richardson told The Times We get it from legacy contamination or food that comes from countries using DDT None of the people in the study had DDE levels that were way beyond what is found in the general population The levels we observed were not outside what you find in the top  of people in the United States he said He added that some of the participants who had high DDE levels did not have Alzheimers We need to do a lot more work to understand this association he said It may not be as simple as different levels of exposure In an editorial about the study in JAMA Neurology Steven DeKosky and Sam Gandy who study Alzheimers said that while this study should be noted its results are far from conclusive For now these conclusions should be considered as preliminary until there is independent confirmation in other populations they write Richardson is working on it We have submitted grants to follow this up in much larger groups of people he said That is the most important step  to replicate this and to have it in a much larger sample
