The Affordable Care Act is transforming more than health insurance In hospitals around the country the legislation could transform the way doctors and nurses actually care for patients Part of the law is designed to rein in the nations exploding health care costs by creating hundreds of little experiments that test new ways for hospitals to save money One example At Summa Akron City Hospital in Akron Ohio doctors are preparing for a new way of doing business Michael Firstenberg a heart surgeon at the hospital says theres something a little funny about the way he gets paid If a patient comes in for a bypass operation Firstenberg earns a certain amount of money for the hospital However if that patient that night has to go back for bleeding then I get paid for that procedure as well he says And everybodys happy because look at all the revenue Im generating independent of the quality Ken Berkovitz a cardiologist at the hospital boils it down to this Everybody in the health care system gets rewarded for doing more rather than rewarded for doing the right thing he says As a result everything is more expensive The key question for health care reformers trying to rein in costs is how to create a less expensive system that still provides good care Starting on Jan  the federal government the hospital and some of the doctors there will try a new approach Rather than paying for that bypass operation and then paying again for bleeding Medicare will pay one lump sum upfront to cover the surgery  any complications that occur after surgery One payment for one operation plus followup thats it If the patient doesnt have problems within  days of being discharged from the hospital the doctors could make even more money than they do today But if there are lots of problems after surgery they could lose money This shift in how medical providers get paid is changing how things are done at Summa Akron City Hospital in three important ways Surgeons and nurses at the hospital now carry around a sheet of paper listing every simple step theyre supposed to perform Did the patient get her antibiotics on time Check Did the catheter come out on time Check Research has long shown that documenting simple steps can significantly reduce medical error Yet hospitals have a hard time implementing checklists because doctors dont really like them When we came up with this I kind of felt a little silly for the first few weeks following a sort of checklist or menu surgeon Eric Espinal says But he concedes pilots and NASCAR drivers use checklists because they reduce complications So checklists could be better for patients  and in the new system the hospitals bottom line Traditionally Medicare paid hospitals separately from doctors But in the experiment at the Akron hospital Medicare will pay the entire team together so everyone will share in the savings or costs of each surgery Its meant to foster a culture of collaboration Berkovitz the cardiologist says this change hasnt been easy Physicians are a dedicated strongwilled independent lot and many of them went into the practice of medicine because traditionally youve been able to be the captain of your ship and thats not always equated to good care he says Before the ACA doctors didnt have a financial incentive to prevent patients from being readmitted to the hospital Now once doctors discharge someone its in their financial interest to make sure their patients stay healthy even when theyre at home In some cases that means sending nurses from the hospital to check up on patients once theyve gone home
