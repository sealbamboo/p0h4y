Within a week of my grandsons first year in high school getting enough sleep had already become an issue Their concerned mother questioned whether lights out at midnight or  am and awakening at  or  am to get to school on time provided enough sleep for yearolds to navigate a demanding school day The boys of course said yes especially since they could catch up by sleeping late on weekends But the professional literature on the sleep needs of adolescents says otherwise Few Americans these days get the hours of sleep optimal for their age but experts agree that teenagers are more likely to fall short than anyone else Researchers report that the average adolescent needs eight and a half to nine and a half hours of sleep each night But in a poll taken in  by the National Sleep Foundation   on school nights With the profusion of personal electronics the current percentage is believed to be even worse A study in Fairfax Va found that only  percent of children in the th grade and only  percent in the th grade get the recommended amount of sleep Two in three teens were found to be severely sleepdeprived losing two or more hours of sleep every night The causes can be biological behavioral or environmental And the effect on the wellbeing of adolescents  on their health and academic potential  can be profound according to   issued in August by the American Academy of Pediatrics Sleep is not optional Its a health imperative like eating breathing and   Dr Judith A Owens the statements lead author said in an interview This is a huge issue for adolescents Insufficient sleep in   increases the risks of   and heart disease   and   said Dr Owens pediatric sleep specialist at Childrens National Health System in Washington   is also linked to risktaking behavior   and suicidal ideation and car accidents Lack of sleep can be fatal she said The level of impairment associated with sleepdeprived driving is equivalent to driving drunk Would you let a kid drive who just consumed three or four beers Well guess what  kids do that every day She recommends that parents make getting enough sleep a condition for permission to drive School start times   In a  study in Virginia Beach where classes began at  to  am the crash rate for  to yearolds was  percent higher than in adjacent Chesapeake Va where school started at  to  The lead author of the study Dr Robert Vorona of Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk suggested that starting the school day later   Insufficient sleep also   decisionmaking skills and the ability to curb impulses which are in a critical stage of development in adolescence Dr Owens said And with the current intense concern about raising academic achievement it is worth noting that a study by Kyla Wahlstrom of  students in eight Minnesota public high schools showed that starting school a halfhour later resulted in an hours more sleep a night and   When the students were more alert they were able to get their work done faster and thus get to bed earlier Dr Owens said It takes a sleepy student five hours to do three hours of homework Sleep deprivation can also have a negative effect on mood Inadequate sleep raises the risk of depression and sleeping less than eight hours a night has been linked to a nearly threefold increased risk of   after other potential causes are accounted for The risk of obesity is also increased by sleep deprivation A study in  estimated that for each hour of sleep lost the odds of an adolescents being obese   Pediatricians parents and schools need to pay much more attention to the sleep needs of adolescents than they now do When children reach puberty a shift in circadian rhythm makes it harder for them to fall asleep early enough to get the requisite number of hours and still make it to school on time A teenagers sleepwake cycle can shift as much as two hours making it difficult to fall asleep before  pm If school starts at  or  and many start an hour earlier its not possible to get enough sleep Based on biological sleep needs a teenager who goes to sleep at  pm ha should be getting up around  am Middleschool and high school teachers commonly say many students are half asleep or fully asleep during the days first period Adding to the adolescent shift in circadian rhythm are myriad electronic distractions that cut further into sleep time like smartphones iPods computers and televisions A stream of text messages tweets and postings on Facebook and Instagram keep many awake long into the night Just the light from a screen   the hormone in the brain that signals sleep Parents should consider instituting an electronic curfew and perhaps even forbid sleepdistracting devices in the bedroom Dr Owens said Although my grandsons among many others use a smartphone as an alarm clock a real clock that doesnt have Twitter could easily replace it Beyond the bedroom many teenagers lead overscheduled lives that can lead to short nights Sports clubs volunteer work and paid employment can cut seriously into the time they need for schoolwork and result in delayed bedtimes Parental pressure to do well in school can also be a factor For example a  study of more than  adolescents in South Korea where great emphasis is placed on academic success found that they   Also at risk are many teenagers from lowincome and minority families where overcrowding excessive noise and safety concerns can make it difficult to get enough restful sleep the academy statement said Trying to compensate for sleep deprivation on weekends can further compromise an adolescents sleepwake cycle by inducing permanent jet lag Sleeping late on weekends shifts their internal clock making it even harder to get to sleep Sunday night and wake up on time for school Monday morning Â
