Two drug companies have attacked a decision to remove their treatments from a fund designed to give access to expensive therapies in England The Cancer Drugs Fund is overspent and   are being reassessed as price caps are brought in for the first time  Pharmaceutical companies say they are outraged at a fundamentally flawed decision that will damage patient care NHS England said the current system was unsustainable and that there were new drugs that will do more for patients  Drugs have to be costeffective for the NHS to make them routinely available Prime Minister David Cameron set up a separate pot of money in  to give patients access to expensive drugs irrespective of cost  The mayear Cancer Drugs Fund is hugely popular and has been used by about  people But as things stand it expects to be m over budget by the end of the financial year A full NHS England announcement on which drugs are being struck off the approved list is expected on Monday but rejected drugs companies have started to break ranks Sanofi says a prostate cancer drug Jevtana is being pulled  Zaltrap a bowel cancer drug that can extend life after a tumour has spread has also been removed Tarja Stenvall the companys general manager said We are hugely shocked and disappointed at this decision against Jevtana  We believe NHS Englands process for reviewing drugs currently listed on the Cancer Drugs Fund has been fundamentally flawed  It was arbitrary inflexible and relied on very questionable evaluation criteria that were not independently verified or endorsed Meanwhile Eisai has been informed that its breast cancer therapy Halaven will no longer be paid for by the fund Company president Gary Hendler said To say that we are disappointed by this decision would be a gross understatement we are outraged  We now call on the government to stop this arbitrary removal of drugs Any patient currently having a drug paid for by the fund will not be affected by any changes which come into effect in March  Professor Peter Clark an oncologist and chairman of the Cancer Drugs Fund said We need to get maximum value for every pound we spend  We can no longer sustain a position where we are funding drugs that dont offer sufficient clinical benefit when drugs that will do more for patients are coming on stream   At the same time as reassessing  current drugs the NHS is also evaluating  new therapies  The decision to introduce price restrictions has provoked a mixed reaction from cancer charities Some say it is deeply concerning and will damage patient care while others say the fund has created perverse incentives that meant drug companies did not need to make their medicines affordable and that a longterm replacement for the fund was the real issue Eric Lowe chief executive of Myeloma UK told the BBC Our feeling is the Cancer Drugs Fund is not sustainable its a policy anomaly and we dont understand why the Conservatives and Labour are intent on continuing with it in some form  The drug companies have behaved badly with their pricing and we support the Fund going back to try to reduce costs Dr Mangesh Thorat from the centre for cancer prevention at Queen Mary University of London said This issue presents me with a dilemma As a cancer clinician I am happy that this Cancer Drugs Fund prevents my patients from being denied treatments towards end of their life however on the other hand I think this fund not only undermines NICE but also discriminates against patients in similar situations who have diseases other than cancer
