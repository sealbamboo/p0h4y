Daniel and Benta Odeny married late by African standards Both were in their s And theyd only just hit their third anniversary when Benta started coughing blood The cough lasted a couple of weeks So Benta went to the doctor She had HIV But Daniel was still HIV negative She thought it was the end of the world Daniel says Benta thought that Daniel would leave her and she would die alone She had seen it happen many times to other women in her situation Benta and Daniel live near   in Kenya a region that has one of the highest HIV rates in the country More than  in  people are infected with the virus But times have changed in Kenya in the past few years In particular HIV drugs are now vastly more accessible in the country in large part because of a USfunded initiative aimed at fighting AIDS around the world Over the past decade the   or PEPFAR has invested billions of dollars to treat HIVpositive people in developing countries In  the initiative spent  million in Kenya alone So when Benta told her husband Daniel about her status he could reasonably say This isnt the end I told her No dont even bother thinking where you got the virus  Daniel says  Be focused You have a future Work toward that  So that means that I have to protect him Benta says And he also can protect me And protection doesnt just mean condoms Benta can also protect her husband by taking antiviral medications What weve learned is that treatment is effective prevention says   who directs the global health program at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention As long as an HIVpositive person suppresses the virus in their immune system with medication De Cock says he or she has little chance of spreading the disease  even through unprotected sex We know that the risk of transmission is infinitesimally small he says Still though most health workers are cautious about telling couples to throw away the condoms Most people would say Well other things can happen Adherence isnt always perfect et cetera  he says But in truth the risk of transmission is greatly greatly reduced with medication Studies both in the lab and out in real communities have   this idea PEPFAR funded many of these studies De Cock says The overriding aim of the PEPFAR program is to achieve an AIDSfree generation De Cock says Many health researchers always thought that the road to no new HIV infections would be forged through the long slog of culture change But science has suggested a potentially shorter path Getting millions more HIVpositive Africans on HIV drugs Couples like Benta and Daniel where one is positive and the other is not are critical to this strategy Theres even a special term for these couples  discordant Medical workers are extremely interested in discordant couples for two reasons One is that almost half of new infections in Kenya happen in these relationships Its one place where HIV is spreading The second reason is that when couples are open with each other about their HIV status managing HIV is more successful That was the case with Daniel and Benta After Bentas diagnosis Daniel started calling her up from work to remind her to take her pills Benta not only got her health back she got something she and Daniel always wanted a daughter With the help of prenatal counseling and   Benta gave birth to a healthy HIVnegative daughter four years ago Increasingly Benta is what health workers hope for as the new face of AIDS in Africa An HIVpositive person living happily with her HIVnegative spouse and child The World Health Organization now recommends that any HIVpositive individual in a discordant relationship be supplied HIV treatment But discordant couples are still being treated on an ad hoc basis in Kenya primarily because the funding for the medication just isnt there Making it official policy to treat thousands more HIVpositive people to protect all their spouses is going to take a lot more money And the US government and PEPFAR arent offering it up anytime soon We dont know whats coming for  in terms of funding says Katherine Perry who coordinates PEPFARs efforts in Kenya We havent been given our funding level but we are definitely not receiving   money The question of which Africans get treatment isnt just a medical one she says Its a resource issue In the US anybody who is HIV positive theyre going to go on treatment Perry says Here in Africa its very different In Africa the American taxpayer is largely paying for it And now its unclear just how much the US is going to pay going forward US officials have said that now its time for African governments to start picking up the slack Kenya for example only pays for  percent of their more than  million AIDS budget Informally the Kenyan government has indicated they will make it a policy to treat discordant couples But its unclear when that will start or where the money will come from Its a big move Perry says And of course Kenya like all countries would like to adopt these guidelines It may be a staged approach
