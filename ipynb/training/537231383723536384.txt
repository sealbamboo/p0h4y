ts a grey Thursday morning when  people gather in an airless conference room deep inside an anonymous building on a large industrial estate The setting might be mundane but what emerges over the next seven hours is anything but these professionals will discuss the terror and violence misery and threat currently being experienced by  women who are right now this citys highest risk victims of domestic abuse  or at least the ones who have been identified as such Around the table are a police officer a childrens services manager two probation workers a drugs and alcohol worker a housing officer someone from nursing and midwifery a GP link worker someone from mental health and a manager from a specialist domestic abuse service Elinor Vale not her real name from the local police force will chair todays multiagency risk assessment conference commonly known as a Marac Shes assisted by a dedicated Marac coordinator At the end of the table is Lucy Giles a Marac development officer from charity   Caada she trains and advises these panels across the country The Marac concept first emerged in Cardiff in  in response to the domestic abuserelated deaths of a toddler and an unborn child The multiagency approach to mitigating risk produced far better outcomes for high risk domestic abuse victims says Diana Barran Caadas chief executive The charity was subsequently funded by the Home Office to roll the model out nationally There are  Maracs in England Wales Northern Ireland Guernsey and Scotland which usually meet monthly Domestic abuse victims who are classified as high risk  theres a standard assessment form that lists a number of contributory factors  are always now referred to their local Marac A high risk victim is officially defined as having suffered  or potentially suffering  an event that is life threatening andor traumatic and from which recovery whether physical or psychological can be expected to be difficult or impossible  the potential event could happen at any time and the impact would be serious Each case referral is read out by Vale before she invites the panel to contribute their information and the discussion begins One woman who has been heavily controlled by her husband since their marriage and has just begun to experience violence is barely permitted to leave the marital home The panel is concerned about her level of isolation theyre worried she may not be in any position to engage with the help theyd like to provide Another woman has fled her partner whom she characterises as jealous and physically intimidating Hes now bombarding her with abusive texts Theres a child still living with him who may also be at risk Every victim discussed today is female Only a small percentage of male victims are deemed to be at high risk out of around  referrals this year this Marac has only had  for men Vales aim she says is to keep the discussion of each referral to  minutes where possible But were soon running over This seems inevitable given the complexity of some womens home lives and the danger from a partner or ex As case follows swiftly after case professionals tell in measured tones of assaults ranging from a slap around the head to a woman having her ribs stamped on by her partner One victim has been dragged outside by her ears Another who reports that her partner has strangled her says hes threatened serious consequences should she report his assaults to police Terrified for her children this woman has been at high risk for a long time her situation was previously discussed at a Marac in another part of the country One man has recently made threats to his pregnant partner which focus the attention of the panel very tightly on what is instantly grasped as a grave and immediate danger Their child made some really worrying remarks that the perpetrator wanted to kill the baby in mummys tummy reads out the Marac coordinator from the report sent by the school Pregnancy is a known trigger factor for abuse to intensify Shes tried to separate before notes Vale consulting the referral note But as information from each officers casefile is read out it becomes clear that the perpetrator is back living with the victim He has multiple convictions for violent offences and has served time Childrens services it turns out had previously investigated the family but recommended no further action NFA Its odd it was NFAd questions Vale Thats because shed broken up with him at that point explains the childrens services manager Decisions are made quickly and actions shared out Childrens services are to reopen the case to assess and address the risk to the child and unborn baby The urgency is such that Vale directs that the councils childrens services initial triage team must be bypassed so this can be done by child protection social workers who will then hold relationships with the family in the longer term The victim its discovered does not know of her partners previous convictions for battery This the panel recognises cant carry on under the domestic violence disclosure scheme  commonly known as    if the Marac feels the victim needs to be informed of a partners violent history she can be told Action by action the panel try to wrap a series of protective measures around the victim and just as importantly her child and unborn baby This is the rationale behind the Marac process by sharing information held by individual agencies about a couples history the full extent of the risk becomes better understood and hopefully effective measures can be put in place to reduce the danger Every service sector represented at the Marac is essential to bolstering a victims safety but it becomes apparent that housing is in the acute phase of a crisis absolutely critical Refuge places are in short supply and in any case many women dont want to go Refuge is also primarily offered out of a victims home area This means a woman will lose all her local support structures childrens schooling and friendships are also disrupted Understandably some women refuse But securing a council tenancy at a new address where your abuser cant find you is very hard indeed without being bumped up from a band   where its pretty hopeless even bidding acknowledges the housing officer  to a band  or higher Writing letters in support of a high risk domestic abuse victim being reprioritised on the social housing list is a frequent action resulting from todays discussions There are no guarantees of a suitable house or flat becoming free The Marac panellists deploy some creativity as they attempt to find ways to keep victims safe In one case there are worried looks at the prospect of a perpetrator being released from jail and the victim taking him back because she thinks hes a good father The man has a record of violent attacks and the question is asked Does it sound like social services might be concerned about him coming out and living with the kids Of a perpetrator who may be an arson threat one officer muses could the council injunct him away from their property On this occasion it seems not A firebox will be fitted to the letterbox at the victims property Nobody round the table looks entirely reassured Another abuser is on the run from an arrest warrant but has been signed off work could the local police be tasked to keep passing by his workplace so that when hes next in he can be picked up Its a painstaking jigsaw approach to public protection Try this Try that Hopefully a secure enough net can be placed beneath the victim for her to work through the issues that need to be addressed so she can exit safely from an abusive relationship Leaving of course is yet another trigger point for violence to escalate Becoming safer and staying safe are longterm hardwon goals Not every abuse victim dials  even though coercion control and violence may be longstanding features of their relationship We havent got a lot on them at all have we sighs Vale of one couple In cases where theres little information to share its harder than ever for agencies to protect someone vulnerable Most of the language used around the conference table today is professional and neutral Clearly everyone cares but theres a job to do and  cases to get through  theres no time to weep and wail over the shattering damage being wreaked on families in homes across the city But every so often a childs name is mentioned Suddenly you get a glimpse of a little boy whos disclosed to an adult something hes heard that has frightened him very much indeed or a young girl whos being kept from her mother by a father who will continue to control his wife by whatever means he can Its becoming better understood that the risk to a child in an abusive household can be even higher than the risk to an adult But are Maracs really working to protect the most vulnerable According to the charity Refuge  women a week on average are killed by a current or former partner That figure has not improved in a decade At Caada Barran believes that the Marac process has transformed the way that agencies respond to high risk abuse more victims are now officially recognised as being at the highest level of risk than were ever identified before she says This is backed up by research just published by Professor Hugh McLaughlin at Manchester Metropolitan Universitys school for social care research which notes a  rise in referrals to Maracs in the three years to  in his sample area It has given both the police and noncriminal justice agencies such as housing health and childrens services the tools to identify the highest risk cases of domestic abuse and a place where they can share information safely so that everyone has the full picture Barran explains Victims can now expect a coordinated safety plan and specialist support to help them become safe  although there are still only about half the number of independent domestic violence advisors we need to support victims through the Marac system adequately McLaughlins study confirmed that support for Maracs is not consistently high across adults services  social care professionals told him they felt unsupported by their managers to spend time on what tends to be regarded as an addon to their main role Making these conferences statutory  at present they are not  is a recommendation of his report to raise the priority of the monthly Marac and ensure that all key agencies attend The danger faced by children is Barrans next target she wants better links between Maracs and the multiagency safeguarding hubs that are now emerging in local authorities around the country to encourage earlier identification of cases and to make sure that the links between risk to the parent and the child are made she says Childrens services involvement in safety planning in domestic abuse households also needs to get stronger too many children in high risk households arent known to childrens services at all
