Heres an experiment you can try But please be the scientist and not the test subject Watch people cross the street and note whether theyre yakking on the phone texting or bopping to tunes while they do it If youre really ambitious time how long it takes them to cross This past summer researchers from the University of Washington did it They watched more than  pedestrians at the  intersections in Seattle that racked up the most pedestrian injuries over the last three years What did they see About  percent of walkers were doing something distracting while navigating the intersections About  percent of pedestrians were seen texting or doing something else by hand with their mobile device while crossing the street The texters were four times more likely than undistracted pedestrians to cross the street without looking both ways first Overall the texters were nearly four times more likely than the undistracted walkers to do something risky while crossing such as not looking for traffic disobeying lights or jaywalking Oh and the texters also dawdled crossing the street  taking nearly  seconds longer than undistracted walkers who needed about  seconds at the average intersection studies People listening to music walked faster no surprise there crossing intersections about a halfsecond more quickly than the undistracted walkers But maybe because they were hurrying they were also less likely to check both ways before crossing The   were published online by the journal   So what Well  pedestrians were killed in traffic accidents in  a  percent increase from    the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Around  pedestrians were injured in traffic accidents in  Inattention while crossing doesnt help your odds of making it the other side of the street in one piece And the temptations will only grow Distracted walking like distracted driving is likely to increase in parallel with the penetration of electronic devices into the consumer market the researchers wrote They suggest a mix of education better road design and enforcement to cut the risks
