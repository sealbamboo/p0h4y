Just over  years ago Dr Arnold Schecter a public health researcher in Texas started   It appeared that the compounds were carried into the milk from fat in the mothers bodies The route wasnt a surprise said Dr Schecter a professor of environmental health at the University of Texas School of Public Health in Dallas Breast milk is rich in fat and the compounds he was looking at    or PBDEs  linger in fat  The real question was how flame retardants were getting into womens bodies in the first place One unexpected source turned out to be food Dr Schecter   in lipidheavy items including butter and peanut butter bacon salmon chili with beans sliced lunch meat and more  They are present in tiny amounts he emphasized But that they are there at all raises questions that researchers find increasingly troubling If flame retardants can be found even in peanut butter then where else have they spread And what health risks come with them   Flame retardants are a family of chemical compounds that reduce flammability or inhibit the spread of fire in a range of ways  from interfering with fires ability to consume oxygen to forming a barrier to acting as chemical coolants Use of the chemicals rose greatly in the s as manufacturers increasingly put fastburning synthetic materials and plastics in their products Today about  million tons of these compounds are used globally every year Various formulations of flame retardants are linked to a variety of possible health effects all still under study Some seem to be fairly benign but others are suspected carcinogens Some appear to interfere with the normal operation of hormones   while some such as PBDEs    But to understand and measure these health risks researchers first must figure out the extent of the contamination in the environment The answer is growing clearer Flame retardants show a remarkable ability to spread everywhere  Were exposed in every known environment said  Heather Stapleton an associate professor of environmental sciences at Duke who has been studying flame retardants for  years  Some of the older chemicals like PBDEs are  and   But because they were designed to be durable resistant compounds they stubbornly persist in our surroundings  And some of their replacements such as a new generation of organophosphate flame retardants are also   Flame retardants have been   in   and   in     and indirectly in bees  honey from Brazil Morocco Spain and Portugal has been found    These chemicals also have been discovered in homes and offices subways and trains cars and airplanes Dr Stapleton worked on a recent study showing that airplane cabins   leaching from seats bins and even that curtain dividing first and coach class  She has   Recently she published a study     If a camper sets up a tent in very hot area it looks like the chemicals come off the fabric Dr Stapleton said Were worried that people are breathing them in  Human activities help spread the flame retardants but the larger drift of them across the planet derives from their longtime use in homes and businesses The compounds are often sprayed into fabrics and foams used in furniture bedding and clothing rather than chemically bonded to the material So they are gradually shed  Often they attach to dust particles which not only settle onto floors and shelves but also waft outside through open doors and windows and airconditioning systems  Once outside they can be transported anywhere by water and winds We know this from other longlasting materials like DDT Dr Stapleton said Its called the grasshopper effect Of course not all of it hops away  plenty stays right in the room  A  study concluded that most American households    A recent survey of  day care centers in California found a wide range of flame retardants including PBDEs    The dust may be especially risky for young children because they crawl on the floors and often put their hands in their mouths said the studys lead author  Asa Bradman an associate director of the Center for Environmental Research and Childrens Health at the University of California Berkeley  It doesnt surprise him that the chemicals turn up in the children themselves  An earlier study by Dr Bradman measuring flame retardant levels in childrens blood found they were   notably in poor neighborhoods where parents hesitated for safety reasons to let them play outside   Flame retardants are regulated in the United States primarily by the    which does not require studies of toxicity or longterm health effects for most industrial compounds before they are marketed Although several efforts have been made to update that legislation so far none has gained enough Congressional support At the moment theres not much you can do limit your exposure Dr Bradman recommends frequent hand washing and vacuuming particularly in environments in which children may be exposed He also suggests looking for   More effective steps he added will require national policy changes including laws that require better assessment of these chemicals and funding for studies of alternative strategies to protect against fire  Before we engage in the widespread use of chemicals with the potential to end up in everything we should stop to ask if theyre really necessary said  R Thomas Zoeller a professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who has studied the effect of flame retardants on thyroid function  He added We should do that put some of those rules in place before we put the next generation at any further risk
