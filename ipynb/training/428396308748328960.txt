Offering hope and encouragement to the many adults who have somehow neglected to exercise for the past few decades a new study suggests that becoming physically active in middle age even if someone has been sedentary for years substantially reduces the likelihood that he or she will become seriously ill or physically disabled in retirement The new study joins a growing body of research examining successful aging a topic of considerable scientific interest as the populations of the United States and Europe grow older and so do many scientists When the term is used in research successful aging means more than simply remaining alive although that obviously is the baseline requirement Successful aging involves minimal debility past the age of  or so with little or no serious chronic disease diagnoses depression cognitive decline or physical infirmities that would prevent someone from living independently Previous epidemiological studies have found that several unsurprising factors contribute to successful aging Not smoking is one as is moderate alcohol consumption and so unfairly or not is having money People with greater economic resources tend to develop fewer health problems later in life than people who are not welloff  But being physically active during adulthood is particularly important In   that looked at more than  Australian men aged between  and  those who engaged in about  minutes of exercise five or so times per week were much healthier and less likely to be dead  years after the start of the study than those who were sedentary even when the researchers adjusted for smoking habits education body mass index and other variables  Whether exercise habits need to have been established and maintained throughout adulthood however in order to affect aging has been less clear If someone has slacked off on his or her exercise resolutions during young adulthood and early middleage in other words is it too late to start exercising and still have a meaningful impact on health and longevity in later life  To address that issue researchers with the Physical Activity Research Group at University College London and other institutions turned recently to the large trove of data contained in the ongoing English Longitudinal Study of Aging which has tracked the health habits of tens of thousands of British citizens for decades checking in with participants multiple times and asking them how they currently eat exercise feel and generally live   For the study   scientists isolated responses from  healthy diseasefree British men and women aged between  and  who upon joining the original study of aging had provided clear details about their exercise habits as well as their health and who then had repeated that information after an additional eight years  The researchers stratified the chosen respondents into those who were physically active or not at the studys start using the extremely generous definition of one hour per week of moderate or vigorous activity to qualify someone as active Formal exercise was not required An hour per week of gardening cleaning the car walking at a moderate pace or dancing counted said Mark Hamer a researcher at University College London who led the study  The scientists then resorted the respondents after the eightyear followup marking them as having remained active become active remained inactive or become inactive as they moved into and through middleage They also quantified each respondents health throughout those years based on diagnosed diabetes heart disease dementia or other serious conditions And the scientists directly contacted their respondents asking each to complete objective tests of memory and thinking and a few to wear an activity monitor for a week to determine whether selfreported levels of physical activity matched actual levels of physical activity They did  In the eight years between the studys start and end the data showed those respondents who had been and remained physically active aged most successfully with the lowest incidence of major chronic diseases memory loss and physical disability But those people who became active in middleage after having been sedentary in prior years about  percent of the total  aged almost as successfully These lateinlife exercisers had about a sevenfold reduction in their risk of becoming ill or infirm after eight years compared with those who became or remained sedentary even when the researchers took into account smoking wealth and other factors Those results reaffirm both other science and common sense A   for instance found that those who started to exercise after the age of  were far less likely to die during the next  years than those who were and remained sedentary The reduction in mortality associated with increased physical activity was similar to that associated with smoking cessation the researchers concluded  But in this study the volunteers did not merely live longer they lived better than those who were not active making the message inarguable for those of us in midlife Build activity into your daily life Dr Hamer said Or in concrete terms if you dont already dance wash your car and if your talents allow mine dont combine the two
