Pfizers commitments to maintain research and jobs should it take over AstraZeneca have been dismissed as vague and insufficient  The comments were made by the President of the Royal Society Prof Sir Paul Nurse in a  seen by BBC News Sir Paul has written to the chairmen of the Commons Business and Science Select Committees The company has made a fiveyear commitment to research and guaranteed jobs in the northwest of England In written evidence to both select committees Pfizer has given a fiveyear commitment to complete AstraZenecas new research centre in Cambridge retain a factory in Macclesfield and put a fifth of its research staff in Britain if the deal goes ahead  Both committees will be hearing from the head of Pfizer Ian Read over the next two days Mr Read will appear before the Business Committee later on Tuesday and the Science Committee on Wednesday He is expected to tell MPs that AstraZenecas revenues are due to decline sharply as some of its exclusive patents expire shortly and that without Pfizers financial muscle the UK company may not be able to realise the potential of its promising research But in a letter to both select committee chairmen Nobel Prize winner Sir Paul says Pfizers commitments are vague come with caveats and have an inappropriate timescale  Sir Paul adds that a fiveyear commitment to the UK is insufficient  A commitment of  years is required Science is not a quickwin sector  it requires longterm investment Sir John Tooke President of the Academy of Medical Science has said that there is anxiety among the biosciences community because of Pfizers past behaviour The assurances they have made are welcome but they may not be able to hold on to those commitments because of commercial pressures  In response Pfizer said These commitments represent significant investment in the economy skilled workforce and scientific knowledge base of the UK With our commitment to foster research and development in the UK we are matching words with deedsand we will keep our word The company adds that the commitments are legally binding  The chairman of the Business Select Committee Labour MP Adrian Bailey told BBC News that lawyers to whom he had spoken were rather puzzled by Pfizers claim that it was bound by law to keep its promises  Pfizer argues that the Takeover Code will require it to adhere to any statement it makes should it take ownership of AstraZeneca  However Mr Bailey is concerned that the Takeover Code has flimsy legal underpinning with little if any sanction if it is breached Here you have a hugely significant strategic industry in this country of enormous significance We cant afford to have anything less than a robust procedure to bind any company to keep to its commitments Mr Bailey told the BBCs Today programme that his Business Committee hearing on Tuesday would want to know how legally binding were Pfizers commitments on UK jobs and investment Pfizer has a history of buying businesses and then closing them down he said He said it might be necessary to amend the Takeover Code  before any acquisition of AstraZeneca  to ensure that the government could intervene if any commitments were broken Pfizer he said had spoken a lot about the tax advantages of the acquisition  The last thing that we want to do is start adding to their tax pile without any benefits to the country he said Former Conservative Chancellor Lord Nigel Lawson told BBC Newsnight said Pfizer was perfectly respectable and a takeover could on balance be the better option for the UK The Financial Times has reported that Anders Hamsten the head of the Karolinska Institutet  which carries out half of the medical research in Sweden  said that Pfizer had a dismal history in his country Pfizer took over Pharmacia in  and at that point fairly strong commitments were made to invest and do research in Sweden and that didnt really turn out to be the case he told the FT Last week one of the worlds largest private funders of medical research the Wellcome Trust confirmed it had written a to Chancellor George Osborne to express its concerns The Trusts chairman Sir William Castell and its director Jeremy Farrar told the chancellor that Pfizers past acquisitions of major pharmaceutical companies have led to a substantial reduction in RD activity which would be replicated in this instance We think it essential that its RD and manufacturing capability it offers to the UK is maintained Between  and  Pfizer acquired three large companies  WarnerLambert Pharmacia and Wyeth as well a number of smaller companies after which it closed numerous research sites in the United States It also sold the site of its UK RD research headquarters in Sandwich Kent in  with the loss of  jobs In an article for the science journal Nature Reviews in  Pfizers former head of research John LaMattina pointed out that  following mergers  At times companies have invested as much as  of topline revenues into their pipeline However Pfizer now projects that in  this figure will only be  he wrote Ironically the concerns over cutbacks in AstraZenecas research may make the cutbacks more likely Resistance to the sale has driven up AstraZenecas share price  so should a takeover go through Pfizer may be forced to recoup its outlay by deeper cuts in the UK than it would otherwise have planned Follow Pallab
