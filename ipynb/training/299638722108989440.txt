  People who grew up in states where the   are more likely to be binge drinkers in adulthood according to a new study published in the journal   Researchers from the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis tracked more than  people who started drinking in the s when  states had legal drinking ages of either  or   below the current federallyimposed of  The researchers found that while people who grew up in those states didnt consume more alcohol than people in other states they were more likely to binge drink when they did Binge drinking is defined as drinking enough in a twohour span to have a blood alcohol concentration of  according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism typically that means five drinks for a man and four for a woman The author of the study Andrew Plunk PhD a postdoctoral research fellow in psychiatry says that when people start drinking at a younger age when they may not have the best judgment they may develop a bad habit of drinking to excess People who are younger are more   and theyre more like to do a lot of things to excess Dr Plunk saysÂ  Theyre less likely to think about the consequences I think its likely that it just makes bad habits Drinking at a young age probably leads to drinking heavily at an older age Daniel Koso a yearold selfproclaimed alcoholic who admits that he binge drinks several times a month is well aware of the dangers Growing up in New York State which had a drinking age of  in the s Koso began drinking even younger when he was only  years old At one point I had   and   Koso says The drinking caused the pancreatitis and led to the risky behavior that caused me to contract hepatitis Frequent binge drinking is linked to a multitude of health problems including the liver and pancreatic conditions Koso had as well as car crashes alcohol poisoning sexually transmitted diseases and neurological damage according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention While you might expect binge drinking to occur mainly on college campuses the researchers found that people who did not attend college were more likely to become frequent binge drinkers People who grew up in states where the drinking age was younger than  and who did not attend college were  percent more likely to binge drink that a collegeeducated person in a state with an older drinking age We always talk about   but we dont think about adults not in college Plunk says Its a population thats already at a little bit of a disadvantage While binge drinking may be impossible to stop completely there are some measures that could help reduce the risks A Canadian study published in the journal   found that increasing alcohol prices by  percent led to a  percent reduction in alcoholrelated deaths Plunk believes that increasing the price of alcohol in the United States could help stop underage drinking When you start increasing price people who are purchasing something illegally  like someone who is underage  fewer of those people purchase the item he says One of the things that doesnt get stressed enough is the impact of higher alcohol prices or taxes on children But Koso who is on disability and makes barely enough to live on thinks raising alcohol prices wouldnt deter drinkers young or old I think thats silly he says If the prices were to increase Id still be at the liquor store
