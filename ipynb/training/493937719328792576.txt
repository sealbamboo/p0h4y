LONDON—Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC said Monday that it would seek to list its pharmaceutical operation on the London Stock Exchange within the next 12 months, ending months of speculation.. RB Pharmaceuticals, valued by analysts at $1 billion to $4 billion, posted a 5% drop in second-quarter revenue. For the second quarter last year, RB Pharmaceuticals revenue declined 12%. The capital-markets solution hasn't come as a surprise, because Reckitt flagged the potential disposal of the ailing drug unit in October.
