   warns a   QC More than  NHS staff responded to his survey and too many of them said that speaking out about poor care was a careerthreatening risk Jeremy Hunt the health secretary responded by promising a   before the election The message must go out that we are calling time on bullying intimidation and victimisation which has no place in our NHS Quite right But Hunt might ask where this climate of fear comes from He points the finger at others below him but bullying starts at the top Every Monday at midday Simon Stevens the head of NHS England is summoned  along with the heads of   and the    to name and shame any laggard hospital failing to hit targets No  sends in Sir Jeremy Heywood Eric Pickles and Francis Maude to oversee this bad news from the NHS and heads roll Hunt hands it on down personally calling the manager of any hospital breaching the fourhour emergency targets or   and terrifying the life out of them In his office he shows off his noticeboard with Never Events listing medical disasters with no matching board for Excellent Events  all stick no carrot He is bullyinchief Sadly Franciss  report into appalling treatment at the Mid Staffordshire trust has increased the climate of fear he criticises in last weeks   He called for tougher Care Quality Commission inspections but these now make the NHS shudder A coachload of  inspectors descend with anonymous numbers on their lapels charging through looking for faults terror is their mission Small failings  a tiny blood spec on an emergency wall in one hospital I visited for example  can result in a big black X on their results This is understandable for CQC itself is under intense pressure the last head was forced to resign so everyone looks over their shoulder Targets and league tables are useful but in the NHS have become implements of torture No wonder many vacancies for hospital chief executives go unfilled Ive just spent a few days where Hunts buck stops with a GP near Mexborough outside Sheffield to see life on the front line Dr Krishna Kasaraneni originally from India and the yearold scion of a remarkable family of  doctors is a partner in a practice short of two GPs They have advertised theyve had no applicants Kasaranenis mentors were a GP couple who had just left with their five children for Alberta Canada another GP has gone to Australias Gold Coast each cost  to train As chair of the British Medical Associations BMA GP education training and workforce committee he sees the growing national shortage there was a  drop in applications last year  the year before and many places left empty Why dont doctors want to be GPs The first thing to note is the relentless work when I visited there were threeweek waits for appointments Kasaraneni arrives at am stays until pm with lunch an unhealthy white bap and crisps at his desk On the phone and in person he had  morning patients with four home visits in the afternoon  patients with  letters to read  test results to examine seven urgent clinical emails from consultants and a pile of prescriptions to sign Each partner earns  a year no longer fatcat wages But he loves it and still makes each patient feel he has all the time in the world What good value we get when the NHS pays him just  per patient per year  less than a Sky TV package  and GPs provide  of NHS care They are the magic ingredient that put the   for value quality access and equity On average patients visit  times a year but I saw one mother bringing her healthy twoyearold for a th visit because she has problems she needs to me to say everythings OK There was the drug addict trying to cheat a prescription the old man who wets the chair the depressive who said she was trying not to cry the labourer with severe arthritis who needs to lose weight the patients with coughs and colds  some indignant to leave without antibiotics the threeyearold with possible autism and the man with a skin complaint who says the walkin centre near his job has a twoweek wait so much for walking in On a home visit we saw a yearold Her drug addict grandson lives with her and steals her money But I love him to bits she said Kasaranenis practice awaits an imminent CQC inspection Hardly what it needs It needs staff and equipment to cope with rising numbers of people with multiple conditions Were firefighting he says GPs used to command  of the NHS budget thats been cut to  Nationally  of district nurses have gone since  Most hospitals are in debt beds are cut to  per  people   Meanwhile  community mental health nurses are gone plus  mental health beds The tyranny of AE targets results in operations cancelled to save bed space Half our hospitals have  of beds blocked by social care cases and that dovetails with  cuts in community care The NHS has never suffered a squeeze like it its average annual rise since  of  is five times less than the average for the previous six decades Who should be blowing whistles loudest on all of this Staff in the wards and the community of course but the loudest blasts should come from managers They are under unbearable pressure to obey political targets despite unprecedented per capita cuts in resources When Hunt calls to bully them chief executives should give an honest whistleblowers reply No minister it cant be done  The NHS is just holding together with a   but the BMA knows the truth Yesterday it launched its  campaign to warn politicians that wheezes and quick fixes wont do Voters need to know about funding the UK spends less than similar countries and the NHS needs a lot more money Bullying from Hunts office is no substitute for cash Still if he really believes there is no place for intimidation he could first rehabilitate all those whistleblowers whose careers have been wrecked Gutwrenching stories were told by victimised doctors nurses and managers at a BMA meeting last week Charlotte Monro an occupational therapist was sacked for warning her local council health scrutiny committee about a  cut in beds for stroke patients at Whipps Cross hospital east London What will bullyinchief Hunt do for her  This article was amended on  February  An earlier version said    staff gave evidence for the Francis review that speaking out about poor care is a careerthreatening risk More than  responded to a survey  of trust respondents and  of primary care respondents who had raised a concern said that they felt unsafe afterwards The article was further amended on  February  An earlier version said the last head of the Care Quality Commission was sacked ignominiously That has been amended to say she was forced to resign
