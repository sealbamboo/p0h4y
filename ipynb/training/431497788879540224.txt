Food industry beware of the power of the online petition Just a few days after food blogger Vani Hari known as Food Babe created a buzz with an   raising questions about the safety of a food additive commonly used in commercial baking sandwich giant Subway has announced plans to phase it out of its freshbaked breads The additive azodicarbonamide is used by the commercial baking industry to bleach flour and condition dough But as the petition points out the compound has been phased out in many other countries and the World Health Organization has linked it to asthma in people A spokesperson for Subway told us in an email We are already in the process of removing azodicarbonamide as part of our bread improvement efforts despite the fact that it is a USDA and FDA approved ingredient One of the things the online petition points out  which probably helped get people alarmed about this additive  is that azodicarbonamide is also used in the manufacturing of yoga mats and shoe rubber And while Subway is removing the substance many other food companies still use it in their products A statement from an FDA spokesperson says the agency is currently collecting data regarding the use of azodicarbonamide in bread  and is prepared to take appropriate action if there are safety concerns But the FDA says there is a reasonable certainty of no harm when an additive  such as azodicarbonamide which is approved for use in food  is used within the intended conditions of use Theres no evidence that Subway has ever exceeded the   on azodicarbonamide it uses in its breads The Center for Science in the Public Interest says the FDA should move to ban the use of azodicarbonamide in food Considering that many breads dont contain azodicarbonamide and that its use slightly increases exposure to a carcinogen this is hardly a chemical that we need in our food supply says CSPI Senior Scientist Lisa Lefferts in a statement She was referring to studies that have linked a breakdown product of azodicarbonamide to cancer in mice So when can Subway sandwich customers expect the change The complete conversion to have this product out of the bread will be done soon the Subway spokesperson told us This is hardly the first time that an online petition has prompted a highprofile food maker to change course Remember how moms of school kids raised concerns about   back in  And last year Kraft Foods announced plans to   from its mac and cheese products marketed to children after another petition started by Hari gained traction
