This will raise your core temperature and ensure that oxygen and blood are flowing throughout your body. , A basic rule of thumb is that you should warm up for 10 minutes when the temperature is between 35 and 45 degrees Fahrenheit. For each 10-degree temperature drop below 35, extend your warm-up by five minutes., , a health coach based in Philadelphia, recommends a combination of exercises and stretches for an effective warm-up. , Some bodyweight exercises -- like push-ups, dips, squats, lunges and bicycle crunches -- are ideal for getting your blood flowing after your warm-up walk, Mentore says. Then, after those exercises, stretch only the tightest muscle groups in your body; for most people, these groups include the hamstrings, quadriceps, chest and shoulders., Follow your warm-up with a cool-down that takes about the same amount of time. However, in addition to stretching the body's tightest muscle groups, also focus on other areas like the back, arms and calves. "This will prevent muscle soreness and enhance your overall performance during the winter," Mentore says. , Instead of giving up on winter exercise, modify the way you work out to feel and look your best throughout the winter months. Bonus? The healthy habits you pick up can be incorporated into your warm-weather workouts.
