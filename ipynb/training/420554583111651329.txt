Could a little red circle really make me bypass short ribs and mashed potatoes for some cod and rice instead Youve got to be kidding Well a team of doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital sure think so  at least sometimes  and they have a study that backs them up Its research that hits close to home Last April when NPR moved into new headquarters we got a snazzy new cafeteria And little colored circles started popping up on menus Green circles with the words Choose Often appeared next to healthful lowfat dishes Yellow tags got placed next to the notsobadforyou entrees like baked cod and rice And comfort foods packed with calories fat and salt  yes those short ribs and mashed potatoes  got branded with a bright red circle and a reminder to splurge only occasionally Sounds like a gimmick that could get me to pick the Brussels sprouts over the sweet potato fries for about week and then start to wear off right Not quite says primary care physician   She and her colleagues tried out a similar trafficlight label system in the cafeteria of their hospital Massachusetts General in Boston The colorful cues not only helped hospital employees skip the sugary sodas fattening pizzas and calorierich desserts at first but the healthier eating lasted for the entire two years of the study her team   Tuesday in the  These changes stuck with people Thorndike tells The Salt Plus the green yellow and red system could be applied in many places she says  like grocery stores restaurants and even your own kitchen In addition to using the trafficlight labels Thorndike and her team also rearranged the snacks and beverages in the cafeteria so that the most healthful options were in the front and at eye level This second strategy is called choice architecture Thorndike says We wanted to make the green choices the easiest option the default choice she says We added salads next to the pizzas and scattered water bottles all around the cafeteria As weve   these kinds of layout changes have also proven useful in nudging kids toward better choices in the school cafeteria After six months people started changing their eating habits the researchers found The number of red unhealthy items purchased in the cafeteria dropped by  percent while green purchases rose by  percent But the biggest change occurred when it came to drink choices Consumption of sugary sodas dropped by nearly  percent Could these changes really help people lose weight or improve their health I dont want to overclaim that this is a weightloss program Thorndike says But if there is an employee that was buying a ounce Coke three times a week andor every day and they reduce their calories by  a day because of the trafficlight labels then you could argue that its helping that person lose weight It has the potential For Thorndike though the tagging system is more about changing the culture around eating Its more about preventing weight gain she says This should be our new normal Cafeterias should be highlighting whats healthy Plus she says you can easily implement the red yellow and green system in your kitchen at home Just fill one drawer with healthful snacks and then label it green Kids can eat whatever they want from that drawer she says Fill another drawer with less healthful snacks and label it red Kids have to ask permission to take from this drawer or they get one of these snacks just on occasion Thorndike says Its a great concept for children because they love it when they have a choice she says We all do better when we have choice When you tell people you cant have something they go against it And dont forget choice architecture Make fruit vegetables and whole grains front center and easy to find in the kitchen Thorndike says And put those red snacks up high and in the back of shelves If you put the cookies up on the top shelf she says theyre out of sight out of mind By the time you climb up and reach them you may have decided you really dont want that cookie in the first place Its all about mindful choices
