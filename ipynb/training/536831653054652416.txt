Dr Oliver Korshin practices ophthalmology three days a week in the same small office in east Anchorage Alaska hes had for three decades Many of his patients have aged into their Medicare years right along with him For his tiny practice which employs just one parttime nurse putting all his patients medical records in an online database just doesnt make sense Korshin says It would cost too much to install and maintain  especially considering that he expects to retire in just a few years No possible business model would endorse that kind of implementation in a practice situated like mine he says Its crazy But starting next year the federal government will penalize Korshin and other doctors for not using   Medicare will withhold  percent of his payments Whats more Korshin will lose an additional  percent for failing to enroll in a federal program that requires doctors to digitally keep track of and report quality data about how their patients fare under their care And then theres the   also set to take effect in the the fall of   an overhaul of the standard method of classifying diseases and conditions Medicare and other insurers require the proper use of these codes if doctors want to get paid for the treatments and procedures they perform A cost study sponsored by the American Medical Association earlier this year   that depending on variable factors such as specialty vendor and software implementing the new coding system alone could cost a small medical practice between  and  All these technological initiatives are designed to improve medicine  to bring it into the digital age But Korshin and many other doctors with small practices say they feel overwhelmed and cant keep up This flurry of things one has to comply with means that unless you work for a large organization like a hospital that can devote staff and time to dealing with these issues theres no economy of scale Korshin laments I cant share these expenses with anybody Korshin may seem like an outlier  close to retirement with a very small practice But he has lots of company says   of the Alaska State Medical Association Most practices in Alaska are small practices Haugen says Theyre one two and threedoctor practices The number of really large practices  and thats relative in Alaska  you can probably count them on one hand Haugen says he hears a lot of complaints from doctors and worries the burden is forcing many  especially older physicians  to consider retiring early There wont be some flashing neon sign we ever see that says X number of doctors have left he says Its a very quiet process And that for me is the scary part Because you take a look at the medical association membership a year or two from now and it may be smaller And access to care in this state is a real issue Rebecca Madison thinks a lot of doctors would decide to stay in practice if they had help with the transition to electronic health records Thats Madisons job as executive director of    she wants to make it as easy as possible for providers to make the switch She tries to sell doctors on   She reminds them electronic records can make their offices more efficient and give them better data on the care theyre providing The systems can also lower billing costs she explains We work with providers to ensure that they have the best experience they can going into an electronic health record she says because it really is changing your entire practice Its not easy
