There are activities common to most humans that we enjoy immensely without much thought and as frequently as opportunity and instinct provide On occasion researchers feel they need to know why Recently experimental psychologists at Oxford University explored the function of kissing in romantic relationships Surprise Its complicated After conducting an online survey with  men and  women mostly from North America and Europe who ranged in age from  to  the researchers have concluded that   and then maintain those relationships The repurposing of the behavior is very efficient said   a doctoral candidate and lead author of the study published in   But another hypothesis about kissing  that its function is to elevate sexual arousal and ready a couple for coitus  didnt hold up While that might be an outcome researchers did not find sexual arousal to be the primary driver for kissing Participants in the survey were asked about their attitudes toward kissing in different phases of romantic relationships They were then asked about their sexual history for example whether they had been more inclined toward casual encounters or longterm committed relationships They also had to define their mate value by assessing their own attractiveness Later during data analysis the researchers looked at how individual differences affected a persons thoughts on kissing Earlier research had suggested that in a new relationship a romantic kiss serves to pull two relative strangers into each others space their faces glued together possibly transmitting pheromonal sensory even genetic cues to each others brain This could be a kind of primal interview Could this person be mating material Mr Wlodarskis results suggest a more nuanced dynamic The participants generally rated kissing in casual relationships as most important before sex less important during sex even less important after sex and least important at other times To clarify researchers defined kissing as on the lips or openmouth French Past research has shown that three types of people tend to be choosier in selecting mates who are genetically fit and compatible women those who rate themselves highly attractive and those favoring casual sex In this study these people said that kissing was important mostly at the start of a relationship That may be because for these individuals kissing turns out to be a quick easy way to sample a partners suitability  a subconscious stopgo light For them   might not be far off the mark After that first kiss these types are much more likely than other subjects to change their minds about a potential partner researchers found If its not in his kiss forget about him But other people might use different criteria to size up their mates men those who rate themselves as less sexually attractive and people looking for commitment In the grand search for a partner these individuals screen for people who seem to have the inclination and resources for the long haul And for them this study showed kissing has a lower priority at the beginning of dating Particularly for men and women looking for longterm relationships kissing serves other purposes like relationship upkeep They would use their   to mediate ameliorate and sustain their connections They rated kissing equally important before sex and at other times not related to sex For these participants kissing was least important during sex Among the studys participants who said they were in exclusive relationships frequency of kissing rather than of sexual intercourse was best correlated with relationship happiness You would think that intercourse would be even more bonding more intimate but thats not necessarily so Mr Wlodarski said Maybe you have a happy relationship and you dont need more intercourse For contented couples he said kissing continued to be a conveyor of emotion  an evolutionary biologist at the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University and a scientific adviser to   who was not involved in this research noted that kissing was so closely associated with emotional connection that sex workers often refuse to kiss their customers insisting that it is too intimate Kissing has been shaped by both society and biology Mr Wlodarski noted In many cultures kissing was one of the first opportunities for individuals to get close enough to sniff each other in socially acceptable ways he said The   of someone for whom they feel great affection gently inhaling their scent Dr Garcia a coauthor of Evolution and Human Sexual Behavior said that the Oxford study contributed to growing research into factors that promote or discourage happy romantic and sexual relationships We really only understand a small portion of that he said But we know that physical contact specifically good quality touch is really important for longterm relationships And perhaps not just for humans Some animal species approximate what humans would call kissing Chimpanzees press their mouths together Certain parrots tap their beaks Elephants put the   and   Its what we biologists call an affiliative gesture Dr Garcia said Some in Hollywood have managed to divine some of the subtleties of kissing without the benefit of Oxford researchers Michelle King who with her husband Robert is a cocreator of   thinks a great deal about whether and when her sexually charged characters lock lips We put even more emphasis on kissing than sex she said We treat it as though it has more emotional import Referring to Alicia Florrick played by Julianna Margulies who has a wary relationship with her husband Peter Chris Noth Ms King remarked You see Alicia having sex with Peter more frequently and recreationally than her kissing him But referring to the characters Diane Lockhart Christine Baranski and Kurt McVeigh Gary Cole older people who have just gotten married Ms King said you only see kissing with them and a fair amount of it Theres a soulful connection there and the kissing is more conventionally romantic Still she understood that viewers might wonder why the couple has not yet been seen having sex Production difficulties got in the way she said
