Patients from outside the EU are to be charged  of the cost of treatment in the NHS in a fresh crackdown on socalled health tourism The move is designed to incentivise NHS Trusts in England to recover the cost of operations from migrants and others The UK seeks to reclaim  of the cost of treating EU and nonEU nationals where charges are applicable  But only a fraction of the m in chargeable procedures performed every year is currently recovered   Most foreign migrants and overseas visitors can currently get free NHS care immediately or soon after arrival in the UK but they are expected to repay the cost of most procedures afterwards The charges are based on the standard tariff for a range of procedures ranging from about  for cataract surgery to about  for a hip replacement  The BBC News Channels chief political correspondent Norman Smith said many trusts did not bother chasing patients because of the time and cost involved in tracking them down compared with the financial rewards  From next year trusts will be able to charge  of the normal cost of treatment for nonEU patients who are nonpermanent residents in the UK Under these plans nonEU patients receiving a  procedure could get a bill of up to  NonUK citizens who are lawfully entitled to reside in the UK and usually live in the country will be entitled to free NHS care as they are now  But temporary migrants from outside Europe who are in the UK for longer than six months either to work or study will have to pay a new surcharge when they submit an application for leave to enter or remain in the UK In what Norman Smith said was a carrot and stick approach the NHS will be asked to identify these patients more effectively so costs can be recovered from them So how will the NHS recoup five hundred million pounds a year  First for patients with a European Health Insurance Card EHIC trusts will be reimbursed oneandaquarter times the cost of treatment if they pass details on to the Department of Health so it can then pursue payment from the appropriate European government Patients from outside Europe will be charged oneandahalf times the cost  to be paid for directly Trusts that fail to do this could be fined  There will also be a  annual health levy for temporary migrants who stay more than six months  The government says this is about ensuring a fair deal for British taxpayers  But some doctors are worried it may deter people who need treatment from coming forward to get it The new measures  which also include a tightening of the rules on eligibility for free NHS prescriptions optical vouchers and subsidised NHS dental treatment  are expected to come into force by next spring Mr Hunt said the principle that the NHS was free at the point of delivery for residents including the provision of urgent care would not be undermined But he said treating nonUK residents cost the NHS an estimated bn a year and the plans could save the health service m a year by   We have no problem with international visitors using the NHS as long as they pay for it  just as British families do through their taxes he said These plans will help recoup up to m a year making sure the NHS is better resourced and more sustainable at a time when doctors and nurses on the front line are working very hard While NHS Trusts charge nonEU patients directly the government pays hospitals for procedures on EU patients with the money being recovered from other EU member states  From next year the government will pay trusts  of the cost of treatment for EU patients up from  at the moment to encourage hospitals to submit more relevant data  The government is also trying to make it easier for hospitals to identify patients who should pay for services while not burdening staff with extra paperwork As part of simplifying the registration process trials are due to start in some AE departments this summer to explore how details can be taken from patients with an European Health Insurance Card when they register The crackdown follows plans already unveiled to charge migrants a  NHS levy when they apply for a visa Dr Mark Porter chairman of council at the British Medical Association warned Without more detail there are question marks over whether or not these proposals will be workable and if the NHS has the infrastructure and resources necessary to administrate a costeffective charging system  Plans to fine hospitals who fail to recoup costs would see them punished twice over to the detriment of other services
