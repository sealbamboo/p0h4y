The th Congress will be the first one in  years to convene without California Rep Pete Stark as a member Stark was   by a fellow Democrat under new California voting rules Stark may not be a household name but he leaves a longlasting mark on the nations health care system So just how influential has Pete Stark been on health policy in his four decades on Capitol Hill Very says John Rother head of the   Stark has been part of almost every piece of health legislation thats been enacted including the Affordable Care Act Rother says And many of the changes and improvements in Medicare trace to him as well Stark singles out two pieces of legislation of which hes particularly proud I guess in terms of results     million people probably have used it That and   Those two are major changes in the health delivery system he says COBRA is the  law that allows people to remain on their employers health insurance plan after they leave their job as long as they pay the full premium EMTALA is the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act It requires hospitals that participate in Medicare or Medicaid to see and stabilize anyone who shows up in their emergency rooms regardless of their insurance status Fellow California Democratic Rep Henry Waxman who has worked with Stark for  of the past  years says EMTALA is a much bigger deal than many people realize Imagine what it would be like in this country if somebody was brought into an emergency room and because they didnt have insurance they were just turned away to bleed to death in the streets said Waxman who chaired the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health for many of the same years Stark chaired the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health So what exactly made Stark such an effective legislator It certainly wasnt his public manner In fact Starks mouth has landed him in plenty of trouble Petes a combination of a person who speaks his mind sometimes before thinking things through but who actually does the work says Rother and has got the legislative record to prove it So while he gets people exasperated with occasional offthecuff remarks when you look at the work thats been produced under his name its truly impressive Some of the things Stark has had to apologize for include calling former GOP   who was black a disgrace to his race and suggesting that former   learned about health via pillow talk because her husband was a doctor But for all of his partisan jabs Stark had an almost legendary working relationship with   who was the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means health subcommittee for most of the time Stark was chairman Never once did we report a bill out of that subcommittee that he and I did not both cosponsor and end up supporting on the floor said Stark Gradison now teaching at Duke Universitys Fuqua School of Business says Stark went out of his way to be cooperative At the beginning of every year he and I and our senior staffs would sit down and talk about the issues that we anticipated would be coming up in that next year and talk about potential subjects for hearings and potential witnesses and there was a lot of give and take says Gradison Yes he had the gavel and he had the control over what happened but he was certainly open to suggestions But first and foremost Stark spent most of his career fighting for the Medicare program his subcommittee oversaw He devoted his career to Medicare making sure it worked that beneficiaries were protected Waxman said We got the best we could for the money we were spending and avoiding spending money that wasnt going to directly help people who are in the Medicare program And what will Stark miss most when he leaves Congress Its one of the areas in which you get up  in the morning and look at the mirror  and say Hey Im going to do something today thats going to make life better for somebody And thats pretty neat Stark says When I was a banker Id get up and say Whose car am I going to repossess or Whose house am I going to foreclose and that didnt start you out on a very nice approach for the rest of the day Stark says he hasnt decided what hell do next but it will likely involve children Children with learning disadvantages need a lot of help today and its important to get it early on so they learn to read and calculate he says Whatever it is Stark does expect him to do it with a lot of gusto
