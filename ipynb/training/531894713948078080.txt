The federal government expects only about  million people to sign up for health insurance on the new online exchanges this year  four million fewer than projected just this spring But officials say they are confident the system wont crash when it opens this coming Saturday the way it did a year ago We are confident that we will have a successful open enrollment Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said at an event sponsored by the proadministration Center for American Progress thinktank Final numbers show that just over  million people signed up for health insurance on the exchanges this year Just last April the Congressional Budget Office projected  million people would sign up during this coming years open enrollment period which starts Saturday But the Health and Human Services Department dialed that back considerably Monday What we did was we have this many people enrolled Burwell said How many of these people do we think will reenroll She said HHS determined that  percent of those now insured on the exchanges would reenroll this year Then they calculated how many new people would sign up to make a projection We think that range is about  million to  million Burwell said HHS said the CBO numbers didnt take into account a ramping up period Officials who asked not to be named struggled to explain what this meant on a conference call with reporters They suggested that CBO projections assumed more people would sign up more quickly than reallife experience shows CBO assumes that enrollment will ramp up to that steady state in just over three years which generates an estimate of  million enrollees in   million in  and  million thereafter HHS said in a statement But thats not really right HHS said If one extends CBOs rampup from three years to four or five years  the estimate of  Marketplace enrollment becomes approximately  million or approximately  million respectively the statement adds Now HHS says it will measure success not by numbers but simply on whether more people are signing up We will measure our success by whether we are making continued progress in reducing the number of uninsured Americans We will continue to work to decrease the number of uninsured Americans and expect the number to continue to decline HHS said Burwell promised the site would work better than it did last year when  the moment it opened on Oct  and didnt really work properly for week The administration ended up having to  to April Things are simpler faster and more intuitive Burwell promised She said her department had tested the site more thoroughly Last year our testing was  days This year our testing is five weeks she said Officials admitted last year they   without adequate testing The site is open for window shopping now People wont have to work as hard to sign up she said For instance people who are renewing their plans wont have to manually enter information with many pages prepopulated with details such as home address and just  screens to page through compared to  last year HHS says  million Americans now lack health insurance about a quarter fewer than this time last year The exchanges are a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act widely known as Obamacare which is designed to get more Americans covered by health insurance and to improve coverage Republicans have pledged to repeal the law although most experts say   even with new GOP control of the Senate after last weeks elections
