On average about  Americans kill themselves each week  but in the fineweather weeks of May and June the toll rises closer to  sometimes higher Every year suicide peaks with the tulips and lilacs  increasing roughly  percent over the annual average to create one of psychiatrys most consistent epidemiological patterns It may seem perverse that the period of spring and early summer as the psychologist   puts it in her splendid book   should contain a capacity for selfmurder that winter less often has Yet it does This grim spring growth confounds conventional belief that suicides peak in winter It also confounds researchers  and fascinates them As they discover more angles into the biology of mood and behavior they are finding new clues about why suicides rise with the suns arc They hope solving this puzzle will help us better understand why people commit suicide at all  and perhaps reduce the numbers yearround This effort takes an extra urgency from what Dr Adam Kaplin a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University calls a suicide epidemic  a sharp increase in both absolute and percapita rates since the recession that began in  particularly among the middleaged   in the United States in   a  percent jump from the  suicides five years before and a new high The stakes involved in figuring out the dynamics of selfmurder seem only to rise with time The spring surge in suicides is actually the largest of a few oscillations throughout the year After dropping to an annual low in February October in the southern hemisphere rates climb sharply through spring fall slowly in summer show a slight rise according to some studies in fall and then begin a steep winter drop The spring peak generally runs  to  percent above the yearly average and  to  percent above the February low The spring increase was first noticed in thcentury Europe Many studies some examining data hundreds of years back have documented it since But explaining it has proved difficult primarily because of suicides extreme complexity Theres no one reason that people do it said   a research psychologist at Emory University Rather she says people usually commit suicide because personal socialsystem and environmental factors combine to push them to a new place of energized despair In this view spring somehow adds weight to an already unbearable load But how One traditional candidate favored by both Dr Jamison and Dr Kaslow is the broken promise effect  the sometimes crushing disappointment that spring fails to bring the relief the sufferer has hoped for In addition psychiatrists have long observed that for patients with   and   spring can create a manic   that amplifies the risk of suicide  agitation that has long shown itself in a rising rate of hospitalizations for   and for manic or schizophrenic episodes in spring and summer Researchers have long suspected that this may be tied to the springtime drop in the sleepfriendly hormone melatonin a reduction that energizes us for springs longer days but may sometimes help generate dangerous agitation Yet that link like many remains elusive In the past decade or so some researchers have increasingly focused on another candidate an apparently intimate relationship between suicide and inflammation Dr Kaplin studies depression in patients with   an autoimmune inflammatory disease In MS he says depression and inflammation feed each other Even after accounting for the psychological effects of any serious illness MS heightens depression risk and depression amplifies the inflammation central to the diseases central pathologies Driving this relationship Dr Kaplin suspects are immunesystem chemical messengers called cytokines Some cytokines increase inflammation while others curb it Inflammatory cytokines play crucial roles in fighting infection but they can also cause problems When people with   are given the cytokine interferon to help fight the infection for instance up to  percent become depressed and one in  attempt suicide Other studies suggest that inflammatory cytokine activity reduces levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin and halts the growth of new brain cells  two hallmarks of depression If inflammation heightens the risk of depression how might that lead to a spring surge in suicide Dr Kaplin and others point to several possibilities  all speculative he says not findings to act on but clues to follow In every case the suggested risk comes not from a direct effect but from an additional sensitivity to inflammation that could be a final straw or irritant One possibility is that many people enter spring sensitized to inflammation by latewinter battles with seasonal infections like   and   A second possibility involves tree pollen   a psychiatrist at the University of Maryland believes that large amounts of it may cause cytokinedriven inflammatory responses A study he did links high spring tree pollen counts with high seasonal suicide rates another examined the brains of  suicide victims and found geneexpression patterns consistent with cytokinedriven inflammation Yet another possibility involves vitamin D The low levels caused by lack of sunlight in the winter are thought to lead to inflammation   Dr Kaplin thus wonders if people already at risk for suicide may increase their risk if they enter spring with inflammatory systems sensitized by   deficiencies The answer to this puzzle is probably some form of all of the aboveÂ  he said Even if these inflammatory factors prove out they will be just some among many  mood disorders divorce job loss grief trauma  that fertilize springs darkest bloom But the more factors researchers can identify the better we can understand not just the spring surge but the larger mysteries of suicide Still if researchers are ever to identify the seasonal culprits they may need to hurry One of the most intriguing findings in the seasonality of suicide is that this ancient pattern appears to be fading  possibly because we all spend more time indoors A   between  and  for instance showed the springsummer curve growing flatter with each successive year period Like too many lives lost as we struggle to comprehend suicide this spring surge may slip away before we can fully glean its unique offerings
