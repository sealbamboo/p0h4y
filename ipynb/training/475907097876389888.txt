In the emergency department at Childrens Medical Center in Dallas pharmacists who specialize in emergency medicine review each medication to make sure its the right one in the right dose Its part of the hospitals efforts to cut down on medication errors and dangerous   which contribute to more than  deaths across the country each year Medication errors can be caused by something as simple as bad handwriting confusion between drugs with similar names poor packaging design or confusion between metric or other dosing units according to the   But theyre often due to a combination of factors which makes them harder to prevent At   in Dallas there are  fulltime emergency pharmacists more than anywhere else in the country and they are on call  hours a day The pharmacists provide a vital safety net according to   chief quality officer and a pediatric ER physician Every single order I put in Morse says is reviewed in real time by a pharmacist in the emergency department prior to dispensing and administering the medication That may sound obvious but Morse says doctors like him are used to jotting down a type and quantity of drugs and moving on If theres a problem a pharmacist will hopefully catch it and get in touch later But later wont work in the emergency room The extra review is particularly important at Childrens because medication errors are three times more likely to occur with children than with adults Thats because kids are not just little adults says   the clinical pharmacy manager for Childrens Medical Center They have completely different metabolic rates that you have to look at Darling says so you have to know your patients On any given week pharmacists at Childrens review nearly  prescriptions and medication orders looking at things like the childs weight allergies medications and health insurance There are also automatic reviews by an electronic medical record system designed to essentially spell check orders to prevent errors You need both says   associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of Wisconsin because the electronic medical record doesnt catch all errors Svenson coauthored a  in the   that found that even with an electronic medical record  percent of childrens prescriptions had errors as did  percent of adults Now his hospital also has a pharmacist in the emergency department  hours a day So why doesnt every hospital do this The main reason Svenson says is money If youre in a small ER its hard enough just to have adequate staffing for your patients in terms of nursing and techs let alone to have a pharmacist sitting down If the volume isnt there its hard to justify Hiring pharmacists is expensive but Morse points to research showing prescription review   thereby saving money and lives People do make mistakes Morse says and you need to make sure a patient doesnt get a drug that could potentially stop them breathing because its the wrong dose
