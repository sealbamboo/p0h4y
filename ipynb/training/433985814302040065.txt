When I teach medical students about alcoholism it is never easy Students arrive with preconceived notions and stereotypes obtained from books television and films  and their personal upbringings  about the subject So I am especially glad that medical nursing and other graduate students from my institution New York University have been attending the play   as part of their studies The drama about the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous is a great way to learn how designating something as a disease is only a starting point for understanding the patients who experience it Yet as I watched the   I was struck by how little has changed through the years in our beliefs about alcoholism and what we can do about it Bill W and Dr Bob were Bill Wilson and Dr Bob Smith the two alcoholics who started AA in the late s Prior to that time heavy drinking was largely seen as a moral failing Organizations like the Womens Christian Temperance Union promoted the notion that drunks and sots were sinners too weak to stand up to demon rum beer and other alcoholic beverages The treatment for this condition was to embrace both abstinence and an evangelical Christianity  With the emergence of the AntiSaloon League in the s the focus shifted to legislative control of alcohol which culminated in  with the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution prohibiting the production sale and transport of intoxicating beverages Although the Drys had triumphed their success was limited By  Americans had turned against Prohibition which was repealed by the TwentyFirst Amendment Now able to obtain alcohol freely heavy drinkers once again began experiencing high rates of liver disease alcohol withdrawal delirium tremens and other complications of their pastime Attitudes however were changing What if heavy drinking  alcoholism  was not a sin or a sign of weakness but a disease In  scientists established the Research Council on Problems of Alcohol which studied alcohol metabolism and drinking behaviors while trying to avoid moral judgments  But the most notable development in the s was the founding of AA As depicted in the play AA resulted from the chance meeting of Bill Wilson a New York stockbroker and Dr Bob Smith an Akron surgeon in  Both drank heavily and were destroying their marriages and lives You want to drink more than you want to live Bobs wife Anne screams at him at one point  Although it did not specifically term alcoholism a disease AA popularized this notion Bill had heard this language from his doctor Alcoholism he explains during the play is like tuberculosis Later on he calls his condition an alcohol allergy The point was that some men  and the disease was originally believed to affect almost entirely men  could simply not drink in moderation The only solution was abstinence What made AA unique was its emphasis on alcoholics helping one another stay sober Bill hopes that he and Bob can create a chain reaction to reach all the drunks in the world As Bob says Our service keeps us sober There was a religious component to AA Five of the original  Steps followed by AA members mention God But Bill W and Dr Bob largely emphasizes a nondenominational spiritual awakening in which alcoholics admit that they are powerless as the first step to abstinence and recovery Of course calling something a disease did not automatically eliminate the entrenched cultural beliefs about the condition As with patients who developed lung cancer from smoking or diabetes from being overweight alcoholics were still often viewed as lazy and merely lacking the willpower to stop an unhealthy habit On rounds at my hospital chronic alcoholics who promise future sobriety are generally met with eyerolling and at times derision These reactions still occur even though scientists have recently identified a genetic component to alcoholism According to the   there are a series of genes that are responsible for roughly half the risk of someone becoming an alcoholic Another facet of alcoholism that remains familiar is the lack of good treatment options Detoxification and rehabilitation programs are expensive and not that effective And while new research suggests that drugs can be used to facilitate drinking in moderation I still refer the vast majority of my alcoholic patients to AA just as other doctors did  years ago Yet even AAs ability to maintain ongoing sobriety among its participants is only about  percent although certain populations with stronger social supports do better Perhaps the greatest virtue of Bill W and Dr Bob is how it humanizes alcoholics Both main characters display a wide range of behaviors ranging from empowered to helpless to angry to remorseful It is hard not to sympathize with them Anne and Bills wife Lois realize that they too belong to a community of sufferers They founded AlAnon in  to assist the spouses and families of alcoholics Take the cotton out of your ears and put it in your mouth is an expression used by AA members to get recalcitrant alcoholics to keep quiet and listen to their brethren It is good advice
