Many Americans are swamped with stress but there may be ways to ease the tension without changing the circumstances Almost half of all adults say theyve experienced a major stressful event in the past year according to a   conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health Meditation can help people cope says author Sharon Salzberg cofounder of the Insight Meditation Society in Barre Mass Salzberg teaches mindfulness which she describes as a way of looking at the world without bias fears or assumptions We have the opportunity to take a fresh look at our experience she tells NPRs Tamara Keith Salzberg says getting that new perspective starts with taking a deep breath Its focusing on everything so that were with it as it actually is With pleasant and wonderful things maybe were so distracted we dont get to enjoy them With painful and difficult things maybe we add on shame and blame and dread and all of these things which make the bad  or difficult situation so much worse And with neutral experience just ordinary routine we tend to rely on intensity in order to feel alive Mindfulness training is about changing your relationship to everything Its not changing the thing but were different with our experience I think it can because the way we hold an experience like that you know sometimes we feel tremendously alone we feel isolated were caught in this kind of corrosive selfhatred One of the ways of understanding meditation is that its about connection its connecting to other aspects of yourself so that youre not only the diagnosis That might be a benefit Often we start just by listening to sound like ocean waves  Then bring your attention to the feeling of the breath See if you can feel just one breath If you find your attention slipping away you get lost in thought spun out in fantasy or youre falling asleep dont worry about it You can practice just letting go gracefully and bring your attention back to the feeling of the breath
