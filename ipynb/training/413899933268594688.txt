Just in time to protect patients from the dangers of holiday cheer a new scholarly review from a British medical journal describes many harmful effects wrought by laughter   Among the alarms it sounds The force of laughing can dislocate jaws prompt asthma attacks cause headaches make hernias protrude It can provoke cardiac arrhythmia syncope or even emphysema this last according to a clinical lecturer in   Laughter can trigger the rare but possibly grievous PilgaardDahl and Boerhaaves syndromes see explanation below And ponder briefly the mortifying impact of sustained laughter on the urinary tract detailed in a   entitled Giggle Incontinence At the very least the new review could be considered an affirmation for the perpetually dour If  was the year of the worried well the authors imply that  is poised to be the year of the humorless healthy  The analysis   was drawn from about  studies It appears in BMJ formerly known as The British Medical Journal which for more than  years has traditionally featured   A deputy editor Dr Tony Delamothe said that the MIRTH study was indeed peerreviewed  presumably by a doctor with a carefully managed sense of humor or humour This year companion studies in the issue include       and    among the cautions Before flinging identify your target and the area beyond it and Never fling an instrument straight up into the air Last spring the coauthors Dr Robin E Ferner an honorary professor of clinical pharmacology at the University of Birmingham and Jeffrey K Aronson a fellow in clinical pharmacology at Oxford who study the benefits and harms of medicines discussed what benefitharm they could explore in a gambit to win a coveted berth in BMJs Christmas issue According to Dr  Delamothe BMJ receives nearly  submissions and accepts about  Dr Ferner and Dr Aronson considered holiday foods for example but their tastes were not in concert He likes sweet wines and I like dry wines Dr Ferner explained Then they found common cause But we both like dry humor They winnowed down the papers that mentioned laughter to  putting them into three categories benefits  harms  and conditions causing pathological laughter  The question was timely they argue because BMJ had not addressed laughter in a serious fashion in over a century In  it had published a case study of heart failure in a yearold girl following prolonged laughter The next year the laughter problem was raised again when an editorial writer in response to an Italian doctors suggestion that telling jokes could treat bronchitis dismissively proposed the term gelototherapy Gelos was the Greek god of laughter in Italian gelato is ice cream  Laughter as therapy was slow to gain traction in  The Journal of the American Medical Association gave short shrift to Dr James J Walshs book Laughter and Health The harms however have been scrutinized A  discussion of Boerhaaves syndrome a spontaneous perforation of the esophagus a rare though potentially lethal event mentioned that one unusual precipitating cause is laughter Then there is the mysterious PilgaardDahl syndrome identified in a    as a pneumothorax in middleaged male smokers induced by laughter It takes its name from Ulf Pilgaard and Lisbet Dahl the Danish revue performers I dont think of the Danes as uproariously funny Dr Ferner said and having seen their show on YouTube I still dont though of course I dont speak Danish  There were other respiratory threats occasioned by laughter he said The popping of alveoli the air sacs in the lungs which together typically contain about  million  If youre going to make asthmatics laugh heartily Dr Ferner said they might want to have an inhaler by their side This extrapolated from a  experiment on the mechanism of laughter in asthmatics There are choking hazards such as ingesting food during belly laughs  The MIRTH review did take an evenhanded costbenefit approach to laughter noting ample evidence of its salutary effects It concluded that laughters benefits included reduced anger anxiety and stress reduced cardiovascular tension blood glucose concentration and risk of myocardial infarction The benefitharm balance the authors wrote is probably favourable  Studies in recent years concluded that laughter reduces arterial wall stiffness and improves endothelial function And a   with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease concluded that laughter inspired by Pello the clown improved lung function  Indeed medical clowning has been observed and embraced But one study left Dr Ferner almost speechless A   when a clown dressed as a chef de cuisine entertained wouldbe mothers for  to  minutes after in vitro fertilization and embryo transfers the pregnancy rate was  percent compared with  percent among a control group that was not entertained Why a chef de cuisine Dr Ferner asked plaintively Despite such a comprehensive look at the medical literature on laughter Dr Ferner felt there was still territory to be charted We dont know how much laughter is safe he said Theres probably a Ushaped curve laughter is good for you but enormous amounts are bad perhaps Its not a problem in England Nonetheless if you choose to peruse the MIRTH study or others in BMJs Christmas issue the risk of outbursts of laughter ranging from snickers to groans to guffaws could be perilously high You have been warned
