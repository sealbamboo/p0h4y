If you think sailing at  mph sounds challenging imagine doing it all alone without the use of your arms or legs or without hearing or with limited vision Every weekend in San Francisco a group of sailors with disabilities does just that taking to the water to push their bodies to the limit Cristina Rubke and her father Chris are members of the Bay Area Association of Disabled Sailors On a recent Saturday they were at San Franciscos Pier  where the dock is awash in activity Chris explains what hes doing as he situates Cristina in her boat Im getting ready to tie down the board that holds her chin control under her chin he says Cristina Rubke was born with arthrogryposis a rare condition that makes her unable to use her arms or legs Even so Rubke became a corporate lawyer and gets around town on her own But sailing using just her chin once seemed crazy even to her I was just coming by here and met some of the folks I mean the funny thing was that they were telling me they could rig a boat with a chin control and that I could sail with my chin she says And I really really didnt believe them But then a few months later it happened This is how it works In the boat a small mechanical box with one joystick and two levers sits on a board beneath Rubkes chin Pushing the joystick to the left or right controls the direction of the boat If she pushes it front to back the sails move in or out All of the boats are specially made so that theyre almost impossible to flip But this is a volunteer organization and as many volunteer organizations go parts frequently break down That means the volunteers like Rubkes dad are often fixitasyougo mechanics Im making this up as I go along Chris says When asked how complicated the boats are to rig he laughs Just complicated enough  Theyre not that bad  theres just a lot of little tricks For the sailors this group provides a sense of freedom Just being out on the water is enough for some participants For others like Kathi Pugh the drive is more competitive Pugh was a serious athlete before she broke her neck in a skiing accident when she was  So to have something that lets me really compete again is really exciting Pugh says She placed third in the US Disabled Sailing Championships last year Pugh is hoisted up out of her wheelchair and lowered into the boat with a crane Onebyone she and the other sailors push off to race each other around buoys in the bay with volunteer Charles Cunningham helming a motorboat to keep an eye on the sailors The boats round a buoy and Rubke and Pugh are neck and neck Then just barely Rubke edges out her competitor A short while later theres a distress signal from Pugh The electronic switches she relies on to manage the boat have stopped working As Cunningham pulls up next to her shes amazingly calm We have been having problems with our circuit board Pugh explains as Cunningham prepares to tow her in And now I have like no tiller no jib sporadic main At the end of the day Rubkes won four of the days five races But in this sailing club it doesnt matter if you can use your arms or legs or if you win or lose a given race Its being free out on the water that counts
