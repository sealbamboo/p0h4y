 Intuitive Surgical Inc. declined to estimate its expectations for sales in 2014, citing "limited visibility" into how the federal health-care overhaul will affect its business this year.. The decision to not issue sales guidance followed on what Chief Executive Gary Guthart called a "challenging year" in 2013, during which sales of the company's hallmark da Vinci surgical robots declined for the first time and the company's share price fell by 22%.
