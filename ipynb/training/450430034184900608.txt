The Nursing and Midwifery Council is facing more criticism over its handling of disciplinary cases in a report by the Professional Standards Authority In particular the report highlights failings over the handling of cases relating to the scandalhit MidStaffordshire NHS Trust  Investigations were poor decisionmaking flawed and recordkeeping lax says the PSA The NMC is responsible for regulating  nurses and midwives in the UK It has previously been accused of failing to protect patients and has admitted substantial failings in the past  but says the latest report recognises the progress it has made  The report by the PSA  the body that oversees health regulators  shows the Nursing and Midwifery Council is struggling to move on from its troubled past  A huge backlog of cases and long delays led to accusations that it was failing at every level  This latest report saw the PSA carry out an audit of  cases dealt with by the NMCs disciplinary committee  The report acknowledged that there had been some improvements under a new management team at the NMC but outlines a number of areas where the organisation is still failing  The report adds that there is an ongoing weakness in the NMCs ability to identify for itself where improvements are needed The PSA said We were disappointed that the NMCs internal review in July  of its handling of cases that involved registrants employed by Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust did not identify a number of serious issues that we picked up in our audit The report also highlighted concerns over the use of voluntary removal where a nurse or midwife facing a disciplinary hearing can apply to be removed from the register without a full public hearing  We identified concerns in all  of the cases we audited that were closed following the grant of applications for voluntary removal and have urged the NMCs Council to ensure that our concerns about the NMCs procedures are addressed quickly Chief executive and registrar of the NMC Jackie Smith said she was pleased the report highlighted the improvements made to the way the disciplinary process for nurses and midwives works  We know that there is still more we need to do she said  However it recognises the progress we have made and confirms the commitment we made to improving performance But Katherine Murphy chief executive of the Patients Association described the findings as deeply worrying Delays in processing hearing cases and seeking interim orders would result in incompetent staff continuing to provide poor care to patients  The NMC is letting down those patients who have received substandard care from these incompetent care professionals who are free to continue to practice  It is disgraceful to see that lessons are still not being learnt from the Francis Inquiry and serious issues relating to registrants from the Mid Staffordshire trust have not been picked up   The Regulator needs to address these fundamental issues now and act urgently to protect the public Campaigner Julie Bailey of Cure The NHS said it was time to accept that the NMC was not fit for purpose  The public expect patients to be protected and this is another instance where the NMC have failed us
