Senators criticized Dr Mehmet Oz during a hearing on false dietproduct ads on Tuesday  but does the nations most telegenic doctor have any control over the Dr Oz Effect lawmakers say contributes to a whole market of sometimes questionable health products According to other physicians who monitor the Dr Oz brand the sales pattern is now well worn On air Oz talks up certain foods drinks supplements or other products  often with little science to support them Soon  are pitching  apparently without the doctors approval  Ozs quotations as outright endorsements hawking alleged cures to anyone with an Internet connection and a credit card including white mulberry red palm oil and brown seaweed The products are often promised to slash pounds shed years boost sleep or conquer the flu among other claims On Tuesday during a Senate hearing on false dietproduct ads  for indirectly perpetuating ad scams Missouri Sen Claire McCaskill a Democrat cited several examples Oz called green coffee extract a magic weight loss cure Raspberry ketone was the number one miracle in a bottle to burn your fat He said Garcina cambogia may be the simple solution youve been looking for to bust your body fat for good McCaskill told Oz When you feature a product on your show it creates what has become known as the Dr Oz Effect  dramatically boosting sales and driving scam artists to pop up overnight using false and deceptive ads to sell questionable products NBC News requested an interview Wednesday with Oz who also is vicechairman of the department of surgery at the   College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York Oz referred NBC News to a statement he released after the hearing I was pleased that the hearing today dealt with some complicated issues and had all the players present whose cooperation will be necessary to move forward in protecting the consumer For years I felt that because I did not sell any products that I could be enthusiastic in my coverage and I believe the research surrounding the products I cover has value I took part in todays hearing because I am accountable for my role in the proliferation of these scams and I recognize that my enthusiastic language has made the problem worse at times Oz added in his statement To not have the conversation about supplements at all however would be a disservice to the viewer In addition to exercising an abundance of caution in discussing promising research and products in the future I look forward to working with all those present today in finding a way to deal with the problems of weight loss scams Oprah Winfrey was the first person to dub Oz  then a frequent guest on her program  Americas doctor Today the Emmy Awardwinning Dr Oz Show is one of the toprated daily TV programs in the country and Oz has authored a series of books all of it turning him into a medicalmedia franchise But some other doctors are not buying the latest pitch from Oz Hes well aware that these companies are promoting things without any evidence of benefits but he doesnt do anything to preempt it said Dr Eric J Topol director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute in La Jolla California He can claim its all done unwittingly or unknowingly and that these things are being taken out of context But his own shows demonstrate that is not that case Topol added This has been perpetuated for a long time These things he calls miracles for example What do you think is going to happen when you call something a miracle and there is absolutely no evidence The real magic Topol said is the size of Ozs viewing audience For years scientifically unproven products were peddled on latenight infomercials seen by a few blearyeyed insomniacs But Oz he said has taken it to an uber level of dissemination that wasnt possible before He does sometimes seem like a televangelist added Dr David Gorski assistant professor of surgery at Wayne State University A lot of it just has to do with his gushing over a product People seem to believe Dr Oz I dont know why but they do Gorski said Any product that theres a hunger for  if you have millions of viewers every day and if youve built up this brand quoteunquote Americas doctor  youre going to get people wanting to buy whatever it is you say is great Through his initial affiliation with Oprahs TV show Oz has slowly built his name and stature in front of TV cameras as a doctor and heart surgeon Gorski said So he has a lot of reasons for people to trust him Hes very telegenic Its not just the size of the audience Its also his personality Gorski said Oz told senators that he avoided endorsing specific brands  and that had been the biggest disservice to his audience As a result a marketplace would spring up with fake stuff real stuff it doesnt frankly matter and start to use my name to start to sell But Oz does endorse certain brands and products as well On his website he lists six   Aquaphor Eucerin Metamucil Omron Schiff and Walgreens On air he also has openly showcased some products In an episode devoted to   one closeup camera shot showed five cans of beverages that claim to help people calm down Soon on the Internet a liquid sleep aid called   boasted Dr Oz is talking about a new way to wind down with relaxation drinks They are the newest trend in helping you relax and calm down and the best news is they contain natural ingredients already known to promote relaxation To the point made by Oz iChill was not one of the drinks featured on that episode
