Its known that being overweight can lead to various health problems including heart disease and   Now evidence is building that being overweight early in life might also increase the chance of developing   later in life With MS the bodys immune system attacks the central nervous system leading to the deterioration of the myelin sheath  the fatty substance that protects nerve fibers  and sometimes even the nerve fibers themselves This destruction creates scar tissue that can interrupt communication between the brain and the rest of the body   weakness numbness tingling and issues with vision and balance Although the underlying cause of MS remains unknown   suggests that obesity is an important factor in the development of MS in people with a genetic susceptibility to the disease The link may be inflammation Obesity is associated with chronic lowgrade inflammation and it may be that obesityrelated inflammation triggers the autoimmune attack that occurs in MS Researchers in Argentina compared  people with MS with  otherwise similar people who didnt have MS and found that obesity  defined as a body mass index BMI of  or more  at age  was associated with a much higher risk of developing MS than a BMI of less than    According to   clinical professor of neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford Health Care in Stanford California the results of the Argentinian study suggest an odds ratio of two to one meaning that yearolds with a BMI of  or greater are twice as likely to develop MS as those with lower BMIs Overweight children as young as  also face a higher risk for developing MS later in life says   a neurology professor with a clinical specialty in MS at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia In a study including  girls ages  through  each unit increase in BMI was associated with a greater risk for MS In the  boys in the study a similar but somewhat lower risk was found The research   was led by   doctor of science project director of the Neuroepidemiology Research Group at the Harvard University TH Chan School of Public Health in Boston While   is associated with as much as a twofold increase in MS risk Dr Munger adds that other environmental factors also impact a persons risk such as smoking and   In addition to inflammation linking obesity to increased MS risk blood levels of vitamin D may also play a vital role says Dr Dunn adding that vitamin D and MS are inversely proportional As your BMI increases your vitamin D blood levels decrease while your risk for developing MS increases One theory for why obese people have low blood levels of vitamin D is that vitamin D being a fatsoluble vitamin gets absorbed into and stored in fat cells making it unavailable to circulate in the bloodstream But obesity is not the only cause of low vitamin D  examined whether people with genetically low vitamin D levels had an increased risk of MS and found that they did Another study in which Munger was an investigator and that was   showed that higher vitamin D levels in people with   meaning they had a single episode of damage to the myelin sheath predicted reduced MS activity and slower progression On the other hand lower levels of vitamin D in people with CIS were a strong risk factor for longterm MS activity and progression Study subjects BMI did not affect the results in this study Obesity may not just increase the risk of developing MS but there may also be a connection between the course and progression of MS and obesity Dr Berger says Obese people with MS had a greater risk for relapses progression of their disease and new brain lesions seen on an MRI scan than people with MS who were not obese   Its not known whether losing weight can reduce these risks in people with obesity and MS But stresses Dunn its important to maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle for every aspect of your life
