New scientific research appears to suggest the drug Thalidomide may have caused a wider range of deformities than previously thought  A new group of Thalidomiders now believe they should get compensation for their disabilities  Gary Grayson from Ipswich shows me the very first pair of wooden legs he had to wear as a child  They are painted pink but are heavy and ungainly   The feet are not hinged and there is a complicated harness of steel and leather They used to call me peg leg and wooden leg They didnt have a lot of imagination he says about some of his former schoolmates He was born in  with extensive deformities to his lower limbs  His mother says that staff at the hospital reacted with horror   When I was born she heard the nurse gasp and leave the room Before he was two years old he was admitted to hospital and had both his lower legs amputated He was walking on artificial limbs within months His mother has signed an affidavit stating that she took Thalidomide but he has never received any compensation for his injuries Thalidomide was originally marketed as a sedative but from the late s was prescribed to women around the world to combat morning sickness By  it was clear that it was causing serious birth defects and by late  it was withdrawn in the UK Ten thousand children were born worldwide with terrible disabilities  It is thought many more died in the womb After a year legal battle in  the British distributors Distillers agreed to pay compensation in the UK   The Thalidomide Trust was set up and more than  children were admitted to the group as beneficiaries The German manufacturers Grunenthal have never admitted liability to the British victims nor have they contributed to the   A statement from Grunenthal said Thalidomide is part of our history and always will be and we have accepted a responsibility to offer help We have no legal responsibility to compensate individuals affected Gary Graysons parents applied to the Thalidomide Trust but doctors said his injuries werent typical of Thalidomide He did not let his disability hold him back and did well at school before joining the Ministry of Defence   The yearolds work took him around the world he rode motorbikes married and had children  Hes now an information security specialist In my younger years I did not see myself as a victim he says But now he has researched deeper into his own medical history and believes the proof is there He said Compensation in todays world must naturally follow His case has been taken up by several law firms under the banner of the  which is representing a number of other clients in the UK The legal action has temporarily stalled over funding and insurance but elsewhere in the world other cases continue As those affected get older their health is failing   Today in Spain  people affected by Thalidomide are taking Grunenthal to court  They have never received compensation from the German company and are now seeking more than m in damages In Australia last year the distributors of the drug agreed to pay damages to fiftyyearold Lynette Rowe  More cases are expected to be settled later this year In Britain the legal picture is complex The Thalidomide Trust receives money from both the UK Government and Diageo the company which acquired Distillers  Since  Diageo has put in an average of  million per year and has committed to do so until  The Trust has only admitted one new beneficiary in the last year and applies strict criteria for inclusion   Those who feel they were harmed by the drug but do not qualify for the Trust turn to legal action in the hope of getting compensation    Their cases may be assisted by new research being carried out at the University of Aberdeen by Dr Neil Vargesson His work involves observing the effect of Thalidomide on the development of chick and fish embryos He has in the past written expert reports for two of the solicitors acting for the new cases  In the s experts decided that babies were damaged by the drug during a very short period in pregnancy  between  and  days after conception Dr Vargesson says questions can be raised about this timesensitive window and the way the medicine reacted on each individual The timesensitive window was based on interviews with parents of severely affected children and relates to outward damage and severe internal damage He concludes that Given the range of damage in Thalidomide survivors and given animal studies that show in one litter each foetus is damaged differently its clear to me the drug acts differently in each individual and embryo That would mean that it is possible Thalidomide caused a wider range of damage than was first thought But he admits that We will never know the true range its so difficult to go back  years and say well lets have a look at these people because most of them we dont even know who those people are  His work though is highly controversial  Other experts in the field disagree with his conclusions Gary Grayson is busy with his career in IT and does all his own DIY   But he can see a time in the future when his health may deteriorate and hell need more help For that reason he is determined to continue with his legal action but also for a much more personal reason too It would mean the world to me to be able to ring my mother and say theyve admitted theyve made a mistake
