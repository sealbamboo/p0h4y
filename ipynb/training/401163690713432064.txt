The million most frail patients in England are to be identified and given a named GP to coordinate their care The move has been agreed by the British Medical Association and NHS England in talks over next years GP contract Ministers had been pushing for doctors to take greater responsibility for the most vulnerable patients in society to relieve pressure on hospitals An analysis by NHS England showed many of the winter pressures on AE came from frail elderly patients Contrary to common perception it found that summer was the busiest time for AE units in terms of numbers but winter was when the difficulties arose because of the rise in the numbers of elderly patients needing care A third of emergency admissions are among the overs  many of which could be avoided if they received earlier and better care in the community This is where the agreement with GPs  which will kick in next April  will help ministers say Under the terms of the deal doctors have agreed to carry out a trawl of their registers to identify the frailest  of patients This is likely to include people at the end of life in care homes and those who are frequently in and out of hospital They will then take responsibility for overseeing their care across the NHS and social care sectors The aim is to create a much more proactive services whereby their needs  from home adaptations to intensive nursing support  are met much more quickly They will also need to offer these patients sameday telephone consultations as well as checking up on them after discharge from hospital This contrasts with what the government and doctors leaders agree is the more reactive service many patients are currently getting And those over  around four million in total will be given a named GP  at the moment patients are registered to a practice rather than individual doctor It is hoped this will lead to greater continuity of care for those patients who visit GPs the most Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt hailed as the return of the oldfashioned family doctor and an end to the current boxticking culture We are bringing back the named GPs for the vulnerable elderly This means proper family doctors able to focus on giving elderly people the care they need and prevent unnecessary trips to hospital In return doctors have been freed from what they considered some of the most burdensome aspects of the formfilling they had to do for their performancerelated pay This means requirements such as having to annually ask men with diabetes if they experienced erectile dysfunction at their checkups will be removed as will the need to ask those with high blood pressure in detail about their activity levels with what doctors say were often irrelevant questions  But Labours Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham told BBC Radio s Today programme The bottom line is under this government it has got harder to get a GP appointment And nothing in todays announcement will correct that  People will still face the frustration of phoning the surgery at nine oclock in the morning being told theres nothing available for days and then some having to turn to A  E He added David Cameron cut Labours scheme of evening and weekend opening and the guarantee of seeing a doctor within  hours Mr Burnham added This announcement will not put an end to patients phoning the surgery at am and finding it impossible to get an appointment  many of whom not happy with a phone consultation will still turn to AE People will fail to see how this package delivers the public commitment David Cameron gave last month to keep GP surgeries open from am to pm Dr Richard Vautrey of the British Medical Associations GPs committee told the BBC It will help to a degree It certainly wont be a panacea but it will start to focus on the needs of the most vulnerable and those patients who do go into hospital more frequently  And it will give GPs that bit more time to be able to spend with their patients to try and meet their needs
