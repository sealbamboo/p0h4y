Im continuing this week with my summer pantry cleanout determined to put some of the partly filled bags of grains Im finding to new uses One item I found was a halffilled packet of Israeli couscous which also goes by its North African names of moghrabiyeh and muhammas Whatever you call it its a spherical product made like regular couscous from durum wheat more akin to pasta than to grains but I use it like a grain in salads big bowls and casseroles  I took advantage of my gardens tomato bounty and made a pastalike dish with sauted cherry tomatoes and a sort of eggplant Parmesan casserole with a layer of Israeli couscous at the bottom The couscous absorbs the wonderful flavors of the tomato sauce and eggplant I also pulled some leftover cooked beans from my freezer and tossed them with the couscous a tomato concass and lots of basil for a wonderful main dish salad There were three bright peppers each a different color lingering in my crisper left over from recipe testing for my   a few weeks ago I cut them into very small dice and tossed them with couscous chopped mint and lemon juice  I then tossed this confettilike combo with lots of romaine lettuce for a salad that was crunchy and refreshing but substantial too because of the couscous Im still focused on salads as the warm weather continues So with the halfcup of brown rice two tablespoons of red lentils and third of a cup of barley that were lingering in the pantry I made a maindish mixedgrains salad with a creamy curry dressing Its amazing how you can make grains and legumes stretch to make a filling meal
