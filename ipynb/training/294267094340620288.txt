FRIDAY Mar    Youve got to hand it to Sara Blakely At age  the inventor of SPANX is the youngest woman to make  s  list of world billionaires and she did it all as the magazine says without help from a husband or an inheritance Her body shapers have been worn by thousands of women of all shapes ages and sizes from Academy Awardwinner   who famously admitted wearing three at a time on the red carpet to Miley Cyrus who called them a gift from God towell this writer And lets not forget SPANX for Men Tom Hanks says he wore them to tone up his tush under some baggier skivvies while filming a scene in   So it may be a bit Grinchy to point out that these popular undergarments have some health hazards attached  but the fact is they do It all started with a blog post from   who wrote on the Consumer Reports site in March  about a yearold patient who was suffering from numbness and tingling in her left thigh As it turned out the girl who played soccer on her high school team was wearing SPANX under her uniform causing a compressed nerve in her pelvis as well as stomach pain after meals But she wasnt the only SPANX devotee  the entire team was wearing them Spandex the same material that allows SPANX to hold in your muffin top may make you look sleeker But its tightness can also squeeze the nerve that runs down the abdomen to below the hipbone causing a disorder known as meralgia paresthetica In an earlier post on Consumer Reports Dr Avitzer noted that more and more young women were coming into doctors offices with signs of the condition like leg pain and aching Other skintight   like skinny jeans or leggings can also cause meralgia paresthetica A  paper published in the journal   reported on two cases in US soldiers stationed in Iraq who were wearing protective body armor  isnt the only health issue linked to SPANX On an episode of his popular show   told an audience member who admitted to wearing spandex shapewear every day that their tightness makes it easy for bacteria to move from the anus to the vaginal area causing   if theyre not washed often He also advised not wearing shapewear after eating to avoid heartburn Most of these potential problems can be averted through good common sense Like any tight clothing SPANX shouldnt be worn for days on end and its a smart idea to wash them after each wearing to get rid of bacteria Even meraglia paresthetica will go away on its own if you stop wearing tight clothing although if theres extensive damage to the nerve it may take a while But no matter the health concerns its a sure bet that most devotees whether theyre celebrities or your nextdoor neighbors wouldnt give up their SPANX for the world
