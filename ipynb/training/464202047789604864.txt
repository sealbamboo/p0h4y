The medieval Black Death led to better health for future generations according to an analysis of skeletons in London cemeteries Tens of millions of people died in the epidemic but their descendants lived longer and had better health than ever before a study shows The Black Death was one of the most devastating epidemics in human history  But survivors benefited from rising standards of living and better diets in the aftermath of the disaster  The improvements in health only occurred because of the death of huge numbers of people said a US scientist It is evidence of how infectious disease has the power to shape patterns of health in populations said Dr Sharon DeWitte of South Carolina University The Black Death killed to of the European population in the th Century causing terror as victims broke out in lumps and black spots then died within days The elderly and the sick were most at risk of catching the bacterial infection which was probably spread through sneezes and coughs according to the latest theory The outbreak had a huge impact on society leaving villages to face starvation with no workers left to plough the fields or bring in the harvest However despite analysis of historical records little is known about the general health and death rates of the population before and after the disease struck  Dr DeWitte investigated how the deaths of frail people during the Black Death affected the population in London after the epidemic  She analysed nearly  skeletons buried in London cemeteries to estimate age ranges birth rates and causes of death for medieval Londoners living before and after the epidemic Samples dating several hundred years after the Black Death suggest survival and general health had improved dramatically by the th Century with people living much longer than before the epidemic broke out  The study published in   journal highlights the power of infectious diseases to shape patterns of health and population levels across history said Dr DeWitte It really does emphasise how dramatically the Black Death shaped the population she told BBC News The period Im looking at after the Black Death from about  hundred years after the epidemic What Im seeing in that time period is very clear positive changes in demography and health She said although general health might have been improving the aftermath of the epidemic would have been horrifying and devastating for those who survived Those improvements in health only occurred because of the death of huge numbers of people Dr DeWitte said This study suggests that even in the face of major threats to health such as repeated plague outbreaks several generations of people who lived after the Black Death were healthier in general than people who lived before the epidemic she added The bacterium that caused the Black Death  has evolved and mutated and is still killing today According to the   the modern day disease is spread to humans either by the bite of infected fleas or when handling infected rodents  Recent outbreaks have shown that plague may reoccur in areas that have long remained silent
