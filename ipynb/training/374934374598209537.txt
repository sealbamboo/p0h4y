If the volume of reader email is any indication people are finally thinking hard about how the health care overhaul will affect them Online health insurance marketplaces will open in less than a month Some people who get insurance through employers want to know if its OK to buy a plan on an exchange instead The answer is yes but the purchasers may not qualify for subsidies Those with individual coverage want to know how the plans will compare with what they already have The answer Generally better coverage and potentially higher premiums offset by subsidies for some people And those who have been unable to afford a plan or were turned down because they have medical problems want to know if the marketplaces will provide better options than they currently have The answer to that one is that they should As I read through the emails whats striking is the complexity of some of the health insurance problems people are trying to sort out Getting answers will be no simple task The navigators certified application counselors brokers and others whose job it is to help people figure out the new insurance landscape are going to have their work cut out for them Expect families with their sometimes complicated legal and financial connections to present especially messy insurance snarls to untangle Consider the selfemployed divorced couple whose annual income ranges between  and  and who share custody of their children They want to know whether theyll qualify for subsidized coverage on the exchanges The forms dont address these things they write Or what about coverage options for an infant whose young adult parents are each covered under their respective parents health plans One of the laws popular provisions allows adult children to stay on their parents insurance until age  even if theyre married and financially independent This particular couples child has been covered since birth under the states   plan for lowincome kids but one of the young adult parents recently received a raise Now the couples income exceeds the eligibility threshold Neither of the young adult parents has access to health insurance through their jobs This will be a steep learning curve says Sabrina Corlette project director for Georgetown Universitys Center on Health Insurance Reforms She likened it to the   in  At first beneficiaries trying to enroll encountered snags in getting accurate information Heres a case in point A woman writes in asking about coverage options for her family including their two kids with special medical needs My husband and I carry dual coverage through his employer and my employer group plans because neither plan covers our childrens needs adequately individually she writes Because of our childrens special needs it is a hardship for both of us to work We would like to drop one or both plans and purchase insurance on the exchange in October when open enrollment begins Is this possible Yes its possible But that may not be the best answer for this family Most people can shop for coverage on the health insurance marketplaces also called exchanges But if people have access to employer coverage thats considered adequate and affordable under the law they wont be eligible for subsidies to reduce the cost of an exchange plan A   is available to people with incomes up to  percent of the federal poverty level or  for a family of four And   to reduce deductibles and copays will be available to those earning up to  percent of poverty or  for a family of four Since employers typically subsidize a good portion of their employees health insurance costs buying an unsubsidized plan on the exchange might not make financial sense If both parents dropped down to parttime status they might no longer be eligible for their companies health insurance plans and could buy subsidized coverage on the exchange But if one of the parents kept working full time and had access to good family coverage on the job no family member would be eligible for subsidized exchange coverage Its also unclear whether the plans offered on the exchange would better meet their childrens needs than the employer coverage they currently have say experts The couple would have to compare coverage specifics and costs carefully Theres another coverage wrinkle that could affect this family Depending on their income and the state in which they live and their childrens health care needs some or all family members could be eligible for any one of a number of Medicaidrelated health insurance programs says Edwin Park vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities How one of the enrollment assisters will handle a family like this one is uncertain Under   assisters will generally be required to undergo at least  hours of training and some states require more Brokers generally are required to have fewer hours of training about the exchanges Many people who contact the exchanges will be dealing with disabilities or complex family situations and assisters should be prepared to either help them or refer them to appropriate state programs or communitybased organizations I think most navigator training should be able to identify these people who need extra special help says Elisabeth Benjamin vice president of health initiatives at   which will contract with  communitybased organizations statewide to provide navigator services in New York Sometimes even though the questions are complicated the answers may not be In the case of the infant whose two parents are covered on their own parents plans for example experts say the baby would be eligible for a childonly policy on the health insurance marketplace and if the parents income is less than  percent of the federal poverty level  for a family of three in  they could receive a premium tax credit Still figuring out how to work through a multilayered question to get to the simple answer will take practice You almost have to be doing this stuff on a daily basis in order to learn it says Corlette But the assisters will get up to speed and theyll probably get up to speed really quickly
