More than twothirds of healthy Americans are teeming with HPV a new survey finds But dont worry  most are benign types of virus the survey indicates In fact having harmless wart virus infections may help control the types that cause warts and cancer the researchers told a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology There are  known different types of   They cause warts and other lesions and two in particular HPV  and HPV  cause cancers of the cervix anus and penis as well as the mouth and throat Types  and  can cause lesions and genital warts and there are  that protect against either two or four of these types that are now recommended for all children Dr Zhiheng Pei and colleagues at New York Universitys Langone Medical Center surveyed tissue samples from  men and women looking at samples from the mouth skin genitals and guts They ran a DNA analysis looking for HPV DNA They found that  percent of volunteers were infected with one or more of  strains of human papillomavirus HPV Only four of them had either HPV  or  Most of the infections   percent  were on the skin HPV was found in  percent of samples taken from the vagina  percent from the mouth and  percent of the gut samples The HPV community in healthy people is surprisingly more vast and complex than previously thought and much further monitoring and research is needed to determine how the various noncancercausing HPV genotypes interact with the cancercausing strains such as genotypes  and  and what causes these strains to trigger cancer Yingfei Ma who worked on the study said in a statement Such a community is called a microbiome and scientists are learning that the populations of bacteria yeast and viruses living in and on our bodies help in digestion help control diseasecausing bacteria and may affect obesity cancer and even mental health Our study offers initial and broad evidence of a seemingly normal HPV viral biome in people that does not necessarily cause disease and that could very well mimic the highly varied bacterial environment in the body or microbiome which is key to maintaining good health Pei added The study found that  percent of the HPV types live only on the skin The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   become newly infected each year with the   CDC says most sexually active men and women will get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives but the infections usually clear up without causing harm
