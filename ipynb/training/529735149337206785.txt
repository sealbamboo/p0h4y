Brittany Maynards   Saturday drove new dialogue on aid in dying but her illness also reminded the world that science seems stuck in its bid to cure the most common type of brain cancer Maynard  had glioblastoma a fastinvading malignancy that according to the National Brain Tumor Society is the most deadly most prevalent form Even after surgery and chemotherapy the tumor typically kills people in about  months the group says Then on Sunday    stirred cheers and tears by notching two baskets for her Ohio college despite playing with a brain tumor that doctors project could claim her in weeks Like Maynard Hills tumor is in the glioma family Her cancer is on the brain stem which controls breathing and pulse leaving surgeons unable to remove it while   has been found to effectively treat it They are two more casualties of a cancer that attacks the most sacred of all human flesh  an organ that that creates our identities and that remains utterly vulnerable to the most frequent class of malignancies to emerge there Brain tumors particularly but not exclusively the malignant ones  are in such an eloquent area of the body that surgical intervention may not be possible and other interventions such as RT radiation therapy may come with a fierce price said Dr Henry S Friedman deputy director of the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke University Medical Center They represent an orphan disease with so few diagnosed annually in the USA  about  primary malignant tumors  that research funds to push the field forward are not nearly as available as for the far more common cancers Friedman added  We do not have enough weapons to deal with these tumors Why are most malignant brain tumors  particularly gliomas  so lethal especially when the fiveyear survival rate for all cancers combined has increased to   from  percent in the mids In short There are few good medical options for gliomas said Carrie Treadwell chief research officer at the   a nonprofit dedicated to helping Americans with the disease Surgeons can extract portions of cancerous clumps from the brain But gliomas are more like fingers that creep into healthy tissue Treadwell said You can only do so much You dont want to destroy that patient completely So you cant be as aggressive as you can be with other organs because if so youre compromising the very essence of who they are Treadwell said Youre never going to get all of the glioma tumor It is impossible to get every single tumor cell Recurrence is inevitable Meanwhile the hunt for effective brain tumor drugs has a poor track record The US Food and Drug Administration has approved only four therapies to treat brain tumors according to a   by PhRMA an association representing leading biopharmaceutical and technology companies During human clinical trials spanning the past  years  potential braincancer drugs were shown to be unsafe and or ineffective while just three won FDA approval  a to failure ratio PhRMA reported As cancer researchers often admit We have cured cancer in mice thousands of times already but weve yet to do it in humans Whatever we find is working in that mouse model may not translate well into humans Treadwell said  We dont understand why were failing The largest obstacle to a drug breakthrough is the bloodbrain barrier a natural wall that separates circulating blood from brain fluid to protect the brain from bacteria Treadwell said The very thing that keeps us healthy also prevents us from getting drugs to the tumors Treadwell said Sometimes in clinical trials we dont even know if some of the drugs that were putting in there are actually reaching the tumor Yet heres an equally terrifying fact Researchers still cant pinpoint the cause of a vast share of brain cancers Treadwell said You pray it doesnt happen to you But the reality is it could Treadwell said We do not understand  beyond a few genetic predispositions  why our patients are being diagnosed with brain tumors So its frightening because it could be any one of us that is diagnosed And then theres the money spread During fiscal year  National Cancer Institute funding totaled  billion The NCI appropriated  million to research cancers of the brain and central nervous system  less than it spent for studying breast cancer  million lung cancer  million prostate cancer  million colorectal cancer  million and leukemia  million  The raw number of deaths for many forms of cancer are far higher however based primarily on the incidence of diagnosis In  for instance more than  Americans died from lung cancer and more than  US women died from breast cancer according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention About  Americans die from brain cancer each year says the National Brain Tumor Society We just finished October when everything is pink I got really angry because everybody wants to save the boobies said Cori Hatch  diagnosed in July  with level  glioblastoma She underwent surgery one month later and takes oral chemotherapy pills five days a week Brain cancer has a color too  gray I didnt even know it had its own dedicated color Hatch said People with breast cancer live a long time With brain cancer most people are dead in three years so they dont want to throw money at brain cancer because its just seen as gloom and doom Aside from her disdain for funding priorities Hatch has adopted a cheerful attitude about her diagnosis Surgery to remove her tumor affects her speaking and she had to relearn walking But she lives fully she said recently driving an allterrain vehicle near her Henderson Nevada home I tell people Im not afraid to die I feel blessed Hatch said I have healed relationships I feel loved I appreciate every breath Nobody gets promised another day
