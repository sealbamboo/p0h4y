Baldness may indicate an increased risk for coronary heart disease The risk is associated only with male pattern baldness the kind that starts at the top or back of the head and not with a receding hairline according to researchers who reviewed six studies that included  participants   The analysis   found that baldness increased the risk for heart disease by between  and  percent compared with men with a full head of hair They found the association among men  to  as well as among older men and the more severe the baldness the greater the risk The reason for the association is unclear but the authors suggest that known risk factors for heart disease  hypertension high cholesterol smoking and others  may affect both conditions and that baldness may be a marker of atherosclerosis In previous studies baldness has been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer diabetes and high blood pressure It may be premature to confirm this relationship on the basis of only six studies said a coauthor Dr Kazuo Hara an associate professor of medicine at the University of Tokyo But the ultimate aim is to be able to predict the risk for heart disease more precisely in clinical practice
