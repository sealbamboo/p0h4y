Exercise may help to safeguard the mind against depression through previously unknown effects on working muscles according to a new study involving mice The findings may have broad implications for anyone whose stress levels threaten to become emotionally overwhelming Mental health experts have long been aware that even mild repeated stress can contribute to the development of depression and other mood disorders in animals and people  Scientists have also known that exercise seems to cushion against depression Working out somehow makes people and animals emotionally resilient studies have shown But precisely how exercise a physical activity can lessen someones risk for depression a mood state has been mysterious  So for the   researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm delved into the brains and behavior of mice in an intricate and novel fashion  Mouse emotions are of course opaque to us We cant ask mice if they are feeling cheerful or full of woe Instead researchers have delineated certain behaviors that indicate depression in mice If animals lose weight stop seeking out a sugar solution when its available  because presumably they no longer experience normal pleasures  or give up trying to escape from a coldwater maze and just freeze in place they are categorized as depressed And in the new experiment after five weeks of frequent but intermittent lowlevel stress such as being restrained or lightly shocked mice displayed exactly those behaviors They became depressed       The scientists could then have tested whether exercise blunts the risk of developing depression after stress by having mice run first But frankly from earlier research they knew it would They wanted to parse how  So they bred preexercised mice  A wealth of earlier research by these scientists and others had shown that aerobic exercise in both mice and people increases the production within muscles of an enzyme called PGCalpha In particular exercise raises levels of a specific subtype of the enzyme known unimaginatively as PGCalpha The Karolinska scientists suspected that this enzyme somehow creates conditions within the body that protect the brain against depression  But to determine if that theory was true they had to isolate the PGCalpha from all the other substances pumped out by the muscles during and after exercise So they created mice that even without exercising were awash in high levels of PGCalpha Their muscles produced lots of it even when they were lazing around  The scientists then exposed these animals to five weeks of mild stress The mice responded with slight symptoms of worry They lost weight But they did not develop fullblown rodent depression They continued to seek out sugar and fought to get out of the coldwater maze Their high levels of PGCalpha appeared to render them depressionresistant But the scientists knew that the PGCalpha was almost certainly not directly protecting the animals brains It doesnt work that way acting directly on cells Rather it is whats known as a promoter sparking activity in genes which in turn express proteins that then affect various physiological processes throughout the body  So the scientists looked for which processes were being most notably intensified in their PGCalpharich mice They found one in particular involving a substance called kynurenine that accumulates in human and animal bloodstreams after stress Kynurenine can pass the bloodbrain barrier and in animal studies has been shown to cause damaging inflammation in the brain leading it is thought to depression  But in the mice with high levels of PGCalpha the kynurenine produced by stress was set upon almost immediately by another protein expressed in response to signals from the PGCalpha This protein changed the kynurenine breaking it into its component parts which interestingly could not pass the bloodbrain barrier In effect the extra PGCalpha had called up guards that defused the threat to the animals brains and mood from frequent stress  Finally to ensure that these findings are relevant to people the researchers had a group of adult volunteers complete three weeks of frequent endurance training consisting of  to  minutes of moderate cycling or jogging The scientists conducted muscle biopsies before and after the program and found that by the end of the three weeks the volunteers muscle cells contained substantially more PGCalpha and the substance that breaks down kynurenine than at the studys start   The upshot of these results in the simplest terms is that you reduce the risk of getting depression when you exercise said Maria Lindskog a researcher in the department of neuroscience at the Karolinska Institute and a study coauthor   Whether the same biochemical processes likewise combat depression that already exists is less certain said Jorge Ruas a principal investigator at the Karolinska Institute and the studys senior author But he is hopeful We think that this mechanism would be efficient if activated after depression has begun he said He and his colleagues hoped to test that possibility in mice soon  In the meantime if work and other pressures mount it may be a good idea to go for a jog It may just keep your kynurenine in check
