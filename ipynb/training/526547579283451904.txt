New York Gov Andrew Cuomo said anyone arriving in the state after contact with Ebola victims in West African countries will be told to stay at home for  days an approach thats more in line with federal recommendations and released after   for putting a returning nurse in quarantine But lawyers said the modified approach still would violate the civil rights of Americans coming back from helping to fight the virus abroad Cuomo   at a press conference with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio  Its a home quarantine but it is a mandatory quarantine Cuomo said noting he thought those who would be subject to it would be receptive and understanding Its not like a terrible task is being asked of you  you stay at home he said Health care workers will check on individuals twice a day to monitor their symptoms Facilities will be provided for those who dont have a place to stay Cuomo said it would probably be the safest protocol in the US and that should give people tremendous comfort The rules apply to anyone not just medical workers returning from West Africa after contact with Ebola victims he said The state will pay to transport people home and health care workers that dont get paid for the quarantine period by their employers will be compensated by the state Cuomos comments came as lawyers for a New Jersey woman quarantined upon her arrival in Newark from West Africa   to have her released and file a constitutional challenge to such state restrictions One of the womans attorneys Steven Hyman said New Yorks plan was different now Theyre starting to run from this I think because of the absurdity of putting people like this in essentially detention when theres nothing wrong with them he added But the new policy still has major flaws he told NBC News Youre telling somebody who is an American citizen with the right to live and work and be in this country that they have to stay home They dont have to be in jail or in a tent but they have to be home Unless there is a medical basis for it they cannot do that As much as Gov Cuomo thinks that he has come up with some solution he has not Late Sunday Cuomos office denied that there had been any shift in policy A senior administration official told NBC News on Sunday afternoon that state policies for health care workers returning from Ebolastricken countries could backfire  We have let the governors of New York New Jersey and others states know that we have concerns with the unintended consequences of policies not grounded in science may have on efforts to combat Ebola at its source in West Africa the administration official said We have also let these states know that we are working on new guidelines for returning healthcare workers that will protect the American people against imported cases while at the same time enabling us to continue to tackle this epidemic in West Africa But Cuomo said that the White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have yet to establish their protocol We have to operate now
