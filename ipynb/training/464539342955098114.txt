Patient number  probably only had a few months to live when she walked into the chief of surgerys office at the National Cancer Institute Dr Steven Rosenberg ought to know  hes been in the job for more than  years Now  whose real name is Melinda Bachini is at home in Billings Montana her hair growing back and chasing after her three youngest kids And the story of how Rosenbergs team fought back her cancer using a highly personalized approach is reported in the journal Science Using a combination of leadingedge genomics and new insights into the human immune system Eric Tran and the rest of the team in Rosenbergs lab found a very few immune system cells that had just the right tools to fight Bachinis tumor They grew these cells in the lab and reinfused them into Bachini Theyve now been shrinking her tumors for six months Its the first time we have been able to actually target a specific mutation in the immune system Rosenberg said It represents a blueprint for how to do this It is a new method for potentially attacking any kind of cancer Bachini knows its early days and she knows her cancer is not gone at least not yet I just feel like itll get better and better each and every day Bachini  told NBC News It is amazing because this cancer is really nasty It was her sons th birthday in December  when Bachini was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma a rare bile duct cancer Only  new cases are diagnosed each year in the United States Bachini was not even feeling that ill They were looking for gallstones and I had a mass in my liver she said Cancer was totally not on my radar she adds The fiveyear relative survival rate for early stage cholangiocarcinoma is only about  percent Bachini knew her chances were not good but went ahead with the standard chemotherapy which was highly toxic and damaged the nerves in her ears hands and feet It didnt shrink anything she said One day I was at the computer and I stumbled on this clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health She enrolled and started treatment in March of  Doctors have known for decades that the body can fight cancer Immune cells called CD Tcells can recognize tumor cells and often destroy them But they often get overwhelmed too Cancer immunotherapy seeks to identify the right Tcells and amplify them for patients It seems simple but it has not been easy In fact doctors have been trying with little luck for decades The only approach thats worked well has been   and thats in part because   are just loaded with mutations says Rosenberg If you try to do that in common epithelial cancers you cant find them You cant use these cells for treatment said Rosenberg a pioneer of modern cancer immunotherapy Epithelial cancers  solid tumors  account for  percent of all cancers from colon cancer to ovarian and breast cancer But advances in genetic sequencing have made it more possible Rosenbergs team took a tumor out of Bachinis left lung and found the CD cells that were attacking it They pulled cells off the tumor that the body sends there to fight the cancer and they grow them in the lab for a month Bachini said Bachini had to undergo a strong chemotherapy treatment to kill off many of her other immune cells and then was infused with the Tcells that seemed to best attack the tumor It seemed to work quickly at first Bachini says Within two weeks of being home the chronic cough I had had gone away she said For six months the tumors shrank For the second six months they were stable But then they started to grow back Rosenbergs lab had developed a new DNA sequencing technique in the meantime We had to sequence the tumor itself to find all the mutations that are present in the cancer he said They strung together all the mutated DNA and then tested it against a sampling of Bachinis own CD Tcells This would not have been possible before the days of whats called highthroughput genome sequencing Superfast sequencers get through a whole genome in a day compared to the  years and  billion it took to sequence the first human genome The National Cancer Institute team found the precise Tcells that were configured to attack only the tumors Bachini had them  just not enough of them to destroy the cancer The researchers cultivated and grew these cells in the lab and once again infused them back into Bachinis body Its been six months and the tumors are still shrinking Rosenberg said My guess is she had a few months left to live when we first saw her Rosenberg said Bachini is due for another checkup in June But shes hopeful I am slowly coming back she said When I went into this trial I felt like I had nothing to lose but everything to gain As a mother of six kids she says its important to get back to normal Life definitely doesnt stop because you have cancer she said And she wants people to know that clinical trials like this one really can make a difference I know I am patient number  in the Science article but I have never felt like a number she said One person is never a cure and it will take a long time to find enough patients to test and see if the approach works Other experts are cautious But Rosenberg says his team has found two patients with colon cancer who might make good candidates for this trial and they are working with los Angelesbased   to develop the treatment
