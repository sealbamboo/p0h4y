Life expectancy for diabetes patients in Scotland has improved a Dundee University study has found A major study carried out by the university and the Scottish Diabetes Research Network showed that people with type  diabetes die significantly younger than the general population Men with the condition live about  years less than those without it while women live about  years less However previous research had reported a gap of between  and  years Major advances have occurred in the treatment of type  diabetes over the last  years and scientists said the life expectancy study could help future care plans and in the setting of insurance premiums  which leaves the body unable to control blood sugar levels with type  causing the pancreas to stop producing insulin a hormone which regulates the amount of glucose in blood Diabetes charities such as Diabetes UK generally cite losses of life expectancy of between  and  years for type  patients while estimates from the United States in the s reported a loss of  years However the study run by Prof Helen Colhoun and Shona Livingstone at the university shows contemporary life expectancy has improved They studied the cases of more than  individuals with type  diabetes who were aged  or older between  and  They found that  of men and  of women with the condition survived to age  compared to  of men and  of women without it On average men with diabetes lived for  further years after turning  compared to  years for men without it  Average life expectancy for women with the condition from the age of  was an additional  years compared to  years among women without it The key culprit in the reduced life expectancy for diabetes patients was related to ischemic heart disease while kidney disease was also an important contributor The findings have been published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Sarah Ward deputy national director of Diabetes Scotland said This large study adds to our understanding of the serious impact of type  diabetes on length of life  The suggested increase in life expectancy is likely due to the improvements we have seen in diabetes care over the last  to  years such as home blood glucose testing earlier detection of diabetes and management of complications of the condition  While this report is encouraging much more work remains to ensure better routine care for people with type  diabetes to enable them to manage their condition and live longer healthier lives
