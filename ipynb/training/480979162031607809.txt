This story is in no way an endorsement of suicide Its a description of one womans choice and what came of it Five years ago after doctors told her that she had Alzheimers disease that would eventually steal her ability to read write and recognize people Sandy Bem decided to kill herself Sandy was  years old an unsentimental woman and strong willed For her  a life without books and the ability to recognize the people she loved wasnt a life she wanted And so she decided there was only one thing to do Sandys plan was to wait until the last conceivable moment that it was physically possible for her to commit suicide alone then go off and kill herself  wasnt a stranger to suicide She and her husband   were both psychologists professors emeritus at Cornell University in Ithaca NY Both had volunteered at a suicide hotline and so had an intimate appreciation of just how destructive the act of suicide could be Typically in the wake of a suicide family members are devastated Rates of depression in those left behind are much higher than when a loved one dies a natural death So was it possible for Sandy to end her life without hurting the people around her That was the question For the Bems the answer was to make Sandys suicide a public process a collective experience that Sandy and Daryl and the people they loved all went through together From the beginning the suicide was talked about openly Sandy was constantly reminding the people around her that her suicide was an immovable fact looming somewhere in the not too distant future She talked about it a lot says Sandys daughter Emily Bem It was just sort of sprinkled throughout life She would often say Well in two years Im going to do it and then two years would go by and she hadnt declined enough where it warranted it Then she would say Well two more years There was a sort of matteroffact way that she talked about it which was very her And although she supported her mothers choice at least in theory Emily says all the talk about suicide began to grate Across the years I did sort of say Look dont talk about this so much Or find someone else to talk about it with  And then two months ago shortly before her th birthday Sandys plan to kill herself started to become a reality Over the past year Sandys cognitive abilities had declined to the point where she sometimes couldnt figure out who was her daughters mother or how she was related to her sister Her window of opportunity for killing herself without assistance was closing quickly So if Sandy really wanted to do it herself she needed an actual date So we looked at the calendar and said OK if its going to be next week what day is it going to be And we just picked one Daryl says They settled on Tuesday May  and announced the date to the family at a meeting at their home in Ithaca And even though Emily Bem had supported her mothers decision this date  the cold reality of it  was very hard to accept I said she seemed too well and it seemed too soon I felt really angry I felt they were all wrong Emily says And so to ease the process for their daughter and their friends Sandy and Daryl announced that the Sunday before everyone would gather to honor Sandy We thought that would be a nice thing says Daryl Bem It made a lot more sense than a funeral where she wouldnt be On that Sunday family and friends sat on the white couch in the living room to talk about Sandys life much of which according to Emily Sandy had by that point forgotten She just listened and listened and listened and at the end she would say Wow I did that Amazing Amazing  Emily says when she showed up at the meeting she was still very angry convinced that her mother should hold on Emily who also lives in Ithaca has a toddler She wanted more time with her mother But over the course of the meeting this feeling began to ebb It was just so obvious that this is about as good as it gets for a human exit Emily says She was surrounded by everyone who loved her they were telling her how and why they loved her This was not a bad way to go Two days later Sandys friends and family gathered again this time at the home of Sandys best friend They all met for dinner as Sandy across town got ready to kill herself Sandy with Daryl at her side went on a long walk and watched a last movie    one of the few films Sandy could still follow Assisted suicide is not legal in New York so Sandy went into the bedroom alone to drink the drug overdose shed ordered online She followed it with a glass of wine Finally Sandy called her husband of  years into the room to ask for a last favor She asked if I would get into the bed with her Daryl says which he did I held her and I could hear her breathing Just sort of watching every moment until her breathing just kind of stopped And here is the thing The relatives and friend I spoke to agree that something in this process made dealing with Sandys death much easier This is going to sound really funny but I wouldnt have had it any other way Emily Bem says It made it less like a grieving process and less like a sort of horrible thing that had happened and more like something that made sense and felt right and actually had some joy to it in its own way Obviously there is no systematic research on suicides like this  there are not enough of them But some research has been done on assisted suicide in Oregon where   became legal in  One study followed  family members left behind after assisted suicide for  months and compared them to family members left behind after natural death The   are somewhat shocking   a professor of psychiatry at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland did assessments of depression complicated grief and other psychological measures in survivors and found that the relatives of people who choose assisted suicide did slightly better But Ganzini thinks its very clear that the difference is not whether a family member chooses to end his or her own life Its because the dying person prepared their family for the inevitability of their death she says It turns out that a lot of the people who chose assisted suicide in Oregon went through a process somewhat similar to that of the Bem family They gathered the people they loved and acknowledged that life was ending This is something that doesnt happen as often with natural deaths because its so much more difficult to predict when death will occur But it can happen Life does come to an end I know that all too well now with my wifes passing just a few weeks ago She died at the end of May says  Toffler is a physician in Portland Ore who opposes assisted suicide He is critical of Ganzinis study saying that it includes too few people to make the assertions it makes about assisted suicide not harming family members particularly since it doesnt include family members like him who fundamentally oppose suicide for any reason I know personally having lived in Oregon that there are people who are hurt  grieved very much by a loved one who thought so little of their relationship that they ended their life Toffler says But Toffler does agree that finding a way to gather before death to memorialize life and acknowledge its end is profoundly helpful Like the Bems his family went through the dying process with his wife Marlene Benedetti Toffler At the very end there were four of them there  Bill a daughter and a son and a close friend They gathered around this person they loved helping her  and themselves  as she passed
