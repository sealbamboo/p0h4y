On Thanksgiving morning Ill be making pies with my mom just as I have ever since I was a girl But at some point I know well be talking about more than shortening versus butter Well be talking about how she would like to die A few months ago my mom fell at home and ended up being admitted to the ICU with four broken ribs and internal injuries She was lucky After two weeks in the hospital and a few more in a rehab unit shes back home using her new blue walker to get around Before she was discharged she signed a   form short for a Physician Order for LifeSustaining Treatment Id heard of   which spell out the kind of medical care a person would want if they become too ill to communicate those wishes But Id never heard of POLST In Oregon where my mother lives its a onepage   that bluntly asks if you want to have CPR performed if your heart stops and youre not breathing Three other check boxes ask how much medical intervention you want going to the hospital and an intensive care unit perhaps the hospital but no ICU or skip the hospital altogether A third question asks if you want to be fed through a tube Thats it Because its signed by a doctor or other provider a POLST has teeth It overrides the legal obligation of an EMT or a hospital to provide CPR and other emergency care that for old and sick people can lead to a long miserable hospital stay Its not for healthy people says   director of the Center for Ethics in Health Care at Oregon Health Science University Instead its for someone who is aware that they may soon die We would encourage doctors to reach out to patients if they would not be surprised if they died in the coming year Tolle says or if they had advanced frailty The little old lady hunched over their walker thats the definition of frailty Thats also the definition of my yearold mom She can still beat me handily at hearts but shes physically weaker each time I see her Do everything is the default mode for American medicine but that allout approach often doesnt serve the very old well CPR works only about  percent of the time in the general population Tolle told me and its even less successful in a frail old lady First if someone at that age collapses its usually because theres a serious medical problem like a heart attack or stroke And performing CPR on someone with osteoporosis breaks ribs rather than circulating blood That isnt walking off the film set looking good with your hair nicely combed Tolle says Thats going to the ICU on a ventilator In studies Tolle who helped develop the POLST form has found that just about  percent of permanent nursing home residents would want to go to an ICU Most say I want to go to the hospital to get the easy things fixed but I dont want the ICU I dont want CPR  POLST forms work well in nursing homes where theyre often taped on a residents bathroom door But they can be harder to put in force when people are still living in the community Oregon has an electronic POLST registry that EMTs and hospitals can check remotely But only   have POLST programs in place though many more have them in the works Most have no registry meaning that someone intent on having the directions on their POLST form followed would need to wear a medical alert bracelet Some members of the disability community have questioned whether POLST is being too broadly applied Rather than give people more control over endoflife medical care they say it could mean interpreting disabled to mean on deaths door Our concern is that its being used with nonterminal people says John Kelly a yearold quadriplegic who lives in Boston He was taken aback when a nurse showed up with Massachusetts version of the form called a MOLST I joke that Ive got my pink MOLST on the fridge and Im afraid that the firemen will come in and glance at the refrigerator and say OK hes got a donotresuscitate order They interpret it as meaning no treatment at all POLST is almost certainly inappropriate for someone disabled but otherwise healthy Tolle says People are handing out the form a little too early sometimes and we want to push back on that she says Its for people who we can say are in the winter of their lives They have advanced illness and frailty They have declining health My mom has been quite clear about what treatments she doesnt want though I realize that her desires may change and that the POLST form should then change too I know well be talking about this more even though I have a hard time thinking about it without tearing up Family gatherings like Thanksgiving can be a good time for adult children to ask aging parents about their wishes for endoflife care and whether those wishes would be best expressed through an advance directive or a POLST A number of groups offer   with questions that arent entirely scary like Would you rather die at home or in a hospital Its also a good time for parents to speak their minds if the kids dont ask Lean into it step up to the plate Tolle says On Thanksgiving after dinner tell your children what you want You really will lift a burden
