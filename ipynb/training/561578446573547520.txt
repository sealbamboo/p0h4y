In theory you should be able to digest just about any type of food you put in your mouth But changes in food processing and preparation think fried not to mention lifestyle think sedentary mean our stomachs dont always react well to everything we eat Its best to avoid some foodlike fatty meatsto avoid upset tummies But fortunately nature also provides foods that can ease our   Heres a guide to whats good and whats bad when it comes to keeping your system running smoothly Both highfat and fried food can overwhelm the stomach resulting in acid reflux and heartburn The body can only handle so much at one time says Jessica Anderson RD a diabetes educator with the Texas AM Health Science Center Coastal Bend Health Education Center in Corpus Christi Highfat food also can result in palecolored stool a phenomenon called steatorrhea which is essentially excess fat in the feces A lot of people with irritable bowel syndrome need to stay away from foods high in fat she says including butter and cream because they can cause digestive problems This staple of spicy cuisine can irritate the esophagus and lead to heartburn pain This can be a particular problem for people with irritable bowel syndrome or those who already suffer from chronic heartburn says Tim McCashland MD a gastroenterologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha Worst You need calcium in your diet and an easy way to get it is from dairy products such as milk and cheese But for the lactose intolerant these can cause diarrhea gas and abdominal bloating and cramps Lactose intolerance a common problem occurs when people dont make enough lactase an enzyme that breaks down lactose the sugar found in milk Celiac disease Crohns disease and chemotherapy can damage the intestines which also can lead to lactose intolerance If youre lactose intolerant staying away from dairy is probably your best bet Alcohol relaxes the body but unfortunately it also relaxes the esophageal sphincter This can lead to acid reflux or heartburn Drinking also can inflame the stomach lining impairing certain enzymes and preventing nutrients from being absorbed Anderson says Too much alcohol can cause diarrhea and cramping but unless you have a gastrointestinal disorder moderate amounts of alcohol shouldnt irritate the digestive tract Guidelines suggest no more than two drinks a day for men and one for women Berries are good for your health but ones with tiny seeds can be a problem for people who have diverticulitis or pockets that develop in the intestine usually the large intestine that become inflamed or infected The theory is that the seeds will obstruct the pockets and pose a risk of infection Dr McCashland says Its never been proven in a study but its always been theorized If you find that seeds including sunflower or pumpkin seeds irritate your intestines stay away from them A  study suggested that chocolate may be a problem in those with irritable bowel syndrome or chronic constipation But chocolate itself may not be the villain Anderson says For people with milk allergies the real culprit could be the milk contained in many chocolate treats And chocolate has caffeine in it which can stimulate cramps bloating and diarrhea Coffee tea and carbonated beverages not only overrelax the esophageal sphincter which keeps stomach acid confined to the stomach but they also can act as diuretics which can lead to diarrhea and cramping Anderson says Caffeinated beverages can be a particular problem especially for people with gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD If you have GERD or heartburn you should avoid mint tea it can however also calm the stomach Anderson says Fiberrich corn is good for you but it also contains cellulose a type of fiber that humans cant break down easily because we lack a necessary enzyme Our evolutionary ancestors were probably able to break it down with bigger stronger teeth Anderson says If you chew corn longer you can probably digest it just fine she says But wolf it down and it may pass through you undigested and cause gas and abdominal pain You have trillions of bacteria in your gut that help you digest food and yogurt contains some types of these healthy bacteria Although not all yogurts have themcheck for live and active cultures on the label Yogurt has bacteria which replenishes the normal flora within the gastrointestinal tract so its healthy Dr McCashland says Kimchi is a Korean favorite usually made with cabbage radish or onion along with lots of spices The main ingredient is usually cabbage which promotes the growth of healthy bacteria in the colon And cabbage is a type of fiber thats not digested so it helps eliminate waste keeping bowel movements regular Anderson says Sauerkraut is good for the same reasons This dish can be spicy however so it might not be a good option if youve found that spicy foods trigger digestive problems for you If youre going to eat meat go for chicken fish and other lean meatstheyll go down a lot easier than a juicy steak Red meats tend to be fattier Anderson says Your body can handle lean meats and fish and chicken a whole lot better than prime rib And lean meats and fish have not been associated with an increased risk of colon cancer like highfat red meats have Whole grains such as wholewheat bread oats and brown rice are a good source of fiber which helps digestion If theres one thing America lacks its fiber Anderson says We need  to  grams a day and we maybe get  Fiber also can help you feel full and lower cholesterol but it can cause bloating gas and other problems in people who quickly ramp up their intakeits better to take it slow when consuming more And wheat grains are a nono for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance Bananas help restore normal bowel function especially if you have diarrhea say from too much alcohol And they restore electrolytes and potassium that may be lost due to runny stool This fruit also has lots of fiber to aid digestion A banana a day is what I always say Anderson says This spice has been used for thousands of years as a safe way to relieve nausea vomiting motion sickness morning sickness gas loss of appetite and colic But its best to consume it in moderation High doses of ginger can backfire more than  to  grams per day can cause heartburn
