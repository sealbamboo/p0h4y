It doesnt seem to be the social environment it doesnt seem to be the parents or peers that make you gay said Gerulf Rieger a lecturer in the department of psychology at the University of Essex in England It seems to be something that comes from within  Sexual orientation is biologically determined added Cynthia StruckmanJohnson a professor of psychology at the University of South Dakota I dont think any educated person aware of the research would argue differently In a statement Wednesday Carson apologized for what he said on CNN and softened his words saying the verdict is still out on whether people are born with their sexual preference  I do not pretend to know how every individual came to their sexual orientation he added  While science is seldom definitive about anything especially something as complicated as why we love who we love researchers say the preponderance of the evidence shows sexual orientation is not chosen  They point to studies showing children are aware of their sexual orientation at a young age Plus genetic studies suggest homosexuality runs in families  Finally researchers have found that the very structure of the brain  specifically regions of the hypothalamus  differs in gay and heterosexual men  Ask a bunch of straight guys if they could switch to being gay and they would tell you Are you kidding me Rieger said So the other way around doesnt work either  So what was Carsons scientific support for his argument that being gay is a choice He pointed to prisons  A lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight  and when they come out theyre gay So did something happen while they were in there Ask yourself that question Carson told CNNs Chris Cuomo  Experts on sexual activity in prisons challenged the very premise of Carsons statement calling it preposterous and appalling  To in any way suggest that a person would go in as a heterosexual and then somehow become a homosexual as a result thats simply preposterous Theres no evidence to support that said Robert Dumond a mental health counselor whos testified to the Department of Justice about rape in prison  Prisoners do engage in homosexual practices but that doesnt mean theyve gone from straight to gay the experts said  Prisoners are often raped they say or coerced to engage in sex in exchange for protection from violent prisoners  Theyre physically forced or forced through blackmail to engage in sex StruckmanJohnson said To have someone say this is chosen is just showing such great disregard for what we know about the world of sexual assault in prison  The prisoners who are perpetrating the rape are often either gay to begin with or are heterosexual and rape to subjugate other prisoners  Its more about power than sex said Chris Hensley a criminologist at the University of Tennessee whos done extensive research on sexuality in prison These men dont see what theyre doing as homosexual and they will leave their incarceration heterosexual  Other prisoners do willingly engage in homosexual activity but the experts say its more of a way to release sexual tension and have some degree of intimacy  It doesnt mean they would choose someone of the same gender in any other situation StruckmanJohnson said  Critics of these studies point out other research they say indicates that orientation is a choice namely studies that show sexual orientation can change over the course of a lifetime and that socialization can alter orientation  Overall the scientists with whom we spoke said they were shocked at Carsons arguments  Im deeply saddened on multiple levels that someone in the st century would take this position Dumond said
