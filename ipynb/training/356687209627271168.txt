Every year more than a quarter of a million Americans have total hip replacement surgery Its almost always a successful operation that frees patients from whats often described as disabling pain But in recent years theres been lots of discussion on the Internet about anterior approach hip replacement a surgical technique thats different than the standard procedure Its one that proponents say can lead to quicker recovery three to four weeks compared to six to eight weeks for typical surgery Some people have been willing to give it a try even though theres no conclusive research showing its better than other approaches Take the case of Michael Pagliaro  who lives in Scarsdale NY and runs a company that rents and sells musical instruments to schools Hes an active man has a personal trainer rides horses and works hard So when his hip started hurting last year he says he got very sad When he walked the pain from his hip made his knee buckle He was diagnosed with    blood was not adequately flowing to the hip joint causing the bone to degenerate Doctors told him he needed surgery to replace the damaged bone and cartilage in his hip with an artificial ball and socket He explained that its a very eventful surgery that Id be incapacitated for six weeks have to sleep with a pillow between my legs cant do this cant do that says Pagliaro That he says was a real buzz kill Overwhelmed by what sounded like a difficult recovery period Pagliaro searched for alternatives He tried physical therapy and avoided certain activities But the pain persisted and he came to realize that surgery was inevitable When he searched online he discovered a surgical approach to hip replacement that sounded a lot less overwhelming than what the doctor described Soon Pagliaro found his way to   an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City Alexiades is one of the surgeons responsible for the recent resurgence of interest in whats called the   In this case surgeons enter the hip joint from the front of the thigh rather than the more conventional posterior approach from the back When I did the anterior approach it was dramatic how quickly the patients were getting up and walking and how quickly they were ready to leave the hospital says Alexiades They were leaving the hospital a lot quicker than my posterior approach patients He says the anterior approach cut recovery time in half for some patients The fast recovery may have to do with less muscle being cut and stretched during the anterior procedure Alexiades says Patients also reported less pain with this approach Michael Pagliaro was sold had the surgery and was out of the hospital in two days I was at home having lunch at my favorite restaurant with my friend and my wife everyone said it was amazing Didnt you just eh eh eh Pagliaro had a cane for support but didnt really need it The following Monday just one week after surgery he was back on the job And not even taking pain medication just aspirin as needed But hes still not back to riding horses According to Alexiades I would think probably nine out of  people who need a straightforward total hip replacement for the first time are good candidates for an anterior approach But there are patients who arent good candidates That includes those with major bone deformities since birth or those getting a redo a second or third replacement surgery or patients who are obese In these more complicated cases surgeons can actually see better using the posterior technique It also takes less time and according to orthopedic surgeon   also at the Hospital for Special Surgery offers other benefits Theres less blood loss no need for Xray during procedure and in my experience the recovery is as quick as with the anterior approach he says In over  years of practice Sculco has performed over  hip replacements and like most surgeons today relies on the posterior approach for   for most of his patients Im slow to change to something else unless I can see some real advantage to changing he says And I really dont see any advantage to changing in this case either in terms of outcomes or in terms of recovery Patients looking for clinical trials that directly compare complication rates pain and recovery time for the two techniques are going to be frustrated There arent any A    of studies on both techniques found there wasnt enough evidence to say which was better There is a lot of research on the posterior approach which has been used since the s but much less on the anterior approach Small trials that have been done on the anterior procedure have found a higher rate of bone fractures during surgery But its unclear if those results come from the fact that many surgeons arent experienced with the procedure or from other issues Theres also no data on how often the anterior approach is performed The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons says that about  percent of their members know how to perform the surgery Critics say the increased interest in anterior approach surgery may be more due to marketing from doctors hospitals and companies that sell specialized operating tables and other gear rather than any benefits to patients Clinical trials comparing the two methods are underway at the Mayo Clinic and at the Hospital for Special Surgery but it may well be five years before that data is available In the meantime doctors says its important to look at the big picture Today most healthy patients recover quickly no matter which surgical technique is used says orthopedic surgeon   with the Mayo Clinic Claims that less muscle is cut when entering from the front of the thigh for the anterior approach isnt true for most patients Pagnano says Small muscles often end up being cut in both procedures he says as surgeons work to stretch and move muscles in order to get into the joint So why all the Internet hype about the anterior approach Something that sounds new and different is appealing says Pagnano and many procedures are promoted on the Web as new That doesnt necessarily make them better he adds What patients really need is knowledge says Pagnano the Internet is great for providing information but it lacks a context in which to interpret that How does a patient sift through all the information and make an informed decision   president of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons says patients should investigate information on a reputable website like the   which can also help them find a surgeon One key question to ask an orthopedic surgeon is about the number of times he or she performs this procedure in a year Like most things in medicine practice makes perfect And being expert says Jacobs means performing a surgery at least  times a year Once patients have found a doctor they should talk the physician which technique is best given the patients history and preferences Jacobs emphasizes that   over the years with fewer complications and faster recovery times All approaches to hip replacement have gotten less invasive over time because of our understanding of anatomy more sophisticated surgical tools and instruments that allow better access with a smaller incision he says All the surgical approaches are less invasive than they were seven to  years ago
