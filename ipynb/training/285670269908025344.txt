For scientists who study a dangerous form of bird flu  is ending as it began  with uncertainty about what the future holds for their research but a hope that some contentious issues will soon be resolved Last January dozens of flu experts around the world agreed to what was supposed to be a   in controversial experiments on the HN bird flu virus But none of them resumed work as planned because all year long the debate over the benefits and the risks just wasnt going away Virologist   of Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands says he reluctantly went along with the moratorium but Ive not been a great advocate of it because there is urgency in this type of research Fouchier gets funding from the National Institutes of Health to study   which is widespread in poultry in parts of Asia and the Middle East HN rarely infects humans but more than half of those known to have gotten sick with it have died Scientists have long wanted to know if this bird flu could mutate in a way that could make the virus start spreading between people and cause a pandemic So Fouchiers lab experimented with the virus and   that certain genetic changes did make it capable of spreading through the coughs and sneezes of ferrets which are the lab standins for people This discovery provided important new clues about how future pandemics might emerge from nature But at the same time the findings were basically the recipe for creating a superflu  one that might kill millions Thats why a panel of government advisers initially recommended against publicly revealing the details of both this experiment and another one like it done at the University of WisconsinMadison I think the biggest fear that we had was that these experiments were going on without the appropriate public dialogue says   a microbiologist at Northern Arizona University who chaired the panel For years biologists have talked about the question of how to handle legitimate research that might produce information that could be misused to cause harm But this socalled   problem was largely theoretical in the life sciences The bird flu research made it painfully real It upped the ante both in terms of whats at stake here in terms of public health and whats at stake here in terms of potential risks   who helps to direct the NIHs Office of Science Policy says It captured peoples attention Months went by as everyone scrambled to figure out what to do Scientists argued at conferences and published opeds The World Health Organization held a closeddoor meeting of flu experts Officials tried unsuccessfully to find some legal way of giving the key details only to people who needed to know In the end science journals did openly publish full reports describing the studies in detail But the research moratorium continued and people asked Well now what Is it back to business as usual Or is there a line that should not be crossed The NIH just held a public meeting to discuss whether and under what conditions it should fund future experiments that might make this form of bird flu more dangerous Officials have drawn up a set of draft criteria for making decisions and they want to know what people think Theyre accepting   until Jan  At the same time government officials are finishing up a review of what kind of lab safety measures should be used when doing this type of work Fouchier for one says its still unclear to him how things will go Its critical who is going to do the vetting on this research who decides what can be done and what cannot be done Fouchier says If you ask infectious disease specialists about what should be done youre going to get different answers than if you ask security specialists Some researchers who dont have to follow the NIH rules may decide to just go ahead with these experiments despite the lingering uncertainties I suspect that we will be seeing a lifting of the moratorium on the part of people who are not NIHfunded   who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said after the NIH conference They will do that according to their own guidelines of their own funders and the country in which they are doing the research And if everything still seems unresolved thats because this situation is really hard NIH director   said at the end of the recent meeting If this was a circumstance where there was an easy path forward where you could simply write down in an afternoon how best to handle this well we would have done that Collins said He thinks this bird flu situation will hopefully get people better prepared for the next time something in biology raises similar concerns And if we can get this one right then the hope is we can go on to some of those other issues undergirded by something more in the way of a foundation than weve previously had Collins said Because if theres one thing that everyone can agree on its that the challenge of potentially dangerous information in biology is not going to go away
