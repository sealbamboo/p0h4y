Last month the only hospital in the sleepy town of Belhaven in eastern North Carolina closed its doors prompting Belhaven Mayor Adam ONeal to step out of party lines and call for an expansion of Medicaid in North Carolina And then he took a lot more steps The Republican mayor and selfproclaimed conservative spent the last two weeks walking the  miles from eastern North Carolina to Washington DC to raise awareness of the need to save his and other rural hospitals around the nation ONeal did it with the support of the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP ONeal Belhaven residents and NAACP members met on the front steps of a US Senate building on Monday They demanded the reopening of the hospital and hoped to draw attention to what they call a rural health care crisis The protesters fear that the  residents of Beaufort and Hyde counties will have to travel as far as  miles for emergency department facilities ONeal asserts that people will die as a result of the hospitals closure and that one woman yearold Portia Gibbs was the first victim of  s shameless and immoral decision to close the hospital Barry Gibbs husband of Portia Gibbs joined   at the rally in DC He says his wife died as a result of delayed care waiting for a helicopter to airlift her to Norfolk Va because the hospital in Belhaven had closed There arent any doctor practices or hospitals in Hyde County In general rural hospitals are more   have lower profit margins than their urban counterparts and are disproportionately affected by states decisions to opt out of Medicaid expansion according to   director of the   The Vidant Pungo Hospital is one of dozens that have closed since last January Holmes says that  of the  rural hospitals that have closed in the last  months are in Southern states that chose to not expand Medicaid Vidant Health is the largest health care provider in an area historically referred to as the Stroke Belt Since the company announced last September that the hospital would close town officials residents and the NAACP have been actively fighting to keep the hospitals lights on The North Carolina chapter of the NAACP filed a complaint against Vidant Health in January alleging discrimination against residents who are very poor minorities and need access to emergency department services due to a high burden of chronic diseases In April the town of Belhaven the NAACP and Vidant Health signed an agreement brokered by the US Department of Justice to transfer ownership of the hospital from Vidant Health to a communitybased board and the complaint was dropped But what had been hailed as a promising and historic agreement between these parties fell through and on June  the NAACP refiled the complaint Instead of a transfer of ownership the hospital doors were padlocked and bolted The closure of the Vidant Pungo Hospital has caused a wave of anxiety among Belhaven residents both for the loss of health care and for the loss of jobs and people They say the closure of a communitys sole hospital can risk putting the local economy in a   from which its very difficult to recover Roads leading into this town that once had a thriving shrimping and lumber industry are conspicuously lined with signs reading Save our Hospital Belhavens local businesses property values and tax base depend on attracting retirees who not only seek warm weather and beaches but also access to health care the mayor says They have ripped our economic heart out of our community ONeal said in a recent interview How many people go retire somewhere where it doesnt even have a hospital Roger Robertson president of Vidant Community Hospitals said that the decision to close the hospital was influenced by a number of reasons including the hospitals location in a flood zone the deteriorating building and the states decision to opt out of Medicaid expansion as allowed for under the Affordable Care Act We had to factor in a lot of different things Medicaid expansion is one factor out of many he says It does influence peoples access to that form of payment As of now  states have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act including   In North Carolina   poor and uninsured adults would be eligible for Medicaid if the state expands it ONeal and the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP are determined to see the hospital in Belhaven up and running again Were not going anywhere until people quit dying from lack of emergency room services ONeal says
