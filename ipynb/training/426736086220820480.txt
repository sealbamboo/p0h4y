CANBERRA—Texting pedestrians aren't just an annoyance to their fellow walkers, Australian researchers armed with movie special-effects technology have determined scientifically: They're a menace to themselves.. Using motion-capture technology similar to that used for films such as "The Hobbit," University of Queensland researchers concluded that texting while walking not only affects balance and the ability to walk in a straight line, but can actually damage a texter's posture.
