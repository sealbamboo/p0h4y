If you want to know what is wrong with American health care today exhibit A might be the two new   the Mayo Clinic has begun building one in Minnesota the other in Arizona at a cost of more than  million dollars each They are part of a medical arms race for proton beam machines which could cost taxpayers billions of dollars for a treatment that in many cases appears to be no better than cheaper alternatives Proton beam therapy is a kind of radiation used to treat cancers The particles are made of atomic nuclei rather than the usual Xrays and theoretically can be focused more precisely on cancerous tissue minimizing the danger to healthy tissue surrounding it But the machines are tremendously expensive requiring a particle accelerator encased in a footballfieldsize building with concrete walls As a result Medicare will pay around  for proton beam therapy for a patient with prostate cancer roughly twice as much as it would if the patient received another type of radiation The higher price would be worth it if proton beam therapy cured more people or significantly reduced side effects But there is no evidence showing that this is true except for a handful of rare pediatric cancers like brain and spinal cord cancer For children the treatment does a better job of limiting damage to normal brain cells and reducing the risk of cognitive impairment and hearing loss But  fortunately  fewer than  American children get these cancers each year It is impossible to keep all nine existing proton beam centers in full use much less the approximately  others in planning or construction with so few patients To generate sufficient revenue proton beam facilities need to treat patients with other types of cancer Consequently they have been promoted for patients with lung esophageal breast head and neck cancers But the biggest target by far has been prostate cancer diagnosed in nearly a quarter of a million men each year There is no convincing evidence that proton beam therapy is as good as  much less better than  cheaper types of radiation for any one of these cancers There has not been a single randomized trial only small shortterm studies Such trials cannot evaluate the therapys longterm outcomes nor resolve the concerns that some experts have raised regarding a potentially increased risk of hip fractures bowel problems or other delayed effects associated with the therapys treatment for prostate cancer So why is the venerable Mayo Clinic building two proton beam facilities Because its competing against Massachusetts General Hospital M D Anderson in Texas the University of Pennsylvania Loma Linda in California  all of which have one With Medicare reimbursement so generous and patients and doctors eager for the latest technology building new machines is sane profitable business for hospitals like Mayo But it is crazy medicine and unsustainable public policy One solution is for Medicare to simply refuse to pay for proton beam treatment except for diseases where there is valid evidence that it is clinically superior as many private insurers do This would certainly help keep costs down and it would also encourage manufacturers and researchers to actually conduct studies comparing proton beam therapy to other treatments However it is often difficult to begin clinical trials without some reimbursement for the treatment that is being studied So a second option is coverage with evidence development In this approach Medicare would pay for proton beam treatment for patients with prostate and other cancers but only if the patients were enrolled in a randomized trial that would compare the outcomes of their treatment to those from surgery other kinds of radiation or active surveillance Medicare has used this approach sparingly but it should be applied to more cases like this one The most promising option is a new approach called dynamic pricing Medicare would pay more for proton beam therapy but only for diseases that are proven to be treated more effectively by the therapy than by other forms of radiation For cancers like prostate it would pay only what it pays for the cheaper alternatives But if studies were done showing that proton beam therapy was better than other treatments the payment would go up If no studies were done or the new evidence demonstrated no advantages then coverage would continue but at the lower reimbursement Of course hospitals could continue charging patients more for proton beam therapy and patients who wanted the treatment could pay the difference themselves But this should not be seen as unfair to those who cant afford it because there are alternatives that are just as effective Everyone wants the best available care especially for lifethreatening diseases like cancer But that doesnt mean Americans should pay exorbitant costs for treatments that cant be shown to be better than other cheaper options If the United States is ever going to control our health care costs we have to demand better evidence of effectiveness and stop handing out taxpayer dollars with no questions asked
