Children who have repeatedly moved schools may be more likely to develop psychoticlike symptoms as young teenagers a study has found Researchers said children that had moved schools three times or more before the age of  were  more likely to develop at least one psychotic symptom as young teenagers  Psychotic traits include hallucinations and delusions and can be a precursor to psychotic disorders The study involved  children  Scientists led by Prof Swaran Singh at the University of Warwick tracked the movements of children by analysing data from a birth cohort study which began in   In the cohort parents filled in questionnaires every year after their child was born and their children attended annual assessment clinics including faceto face interviews psychological and physical tests Children were interviewed at  years of age to see if they had experienced any psychoticlike traits in the last six months  Prof Singh said the study filled a gap in linking school mobility and psychotic traits  He said Our study found that the process of moving schools may itself increase the risk of psychotic symptoms independent of other factors But additionally being involved in bullying sometimes as a consequence of repeated school moves may exacerbate risk for the individual Previous work he said had focused on the impact of urban environments marginalisation exclusion coming from a broken family and bullying  He said he wanted to study school mobility after noticing a link between psychotic symptoms and migrant populations  He said the traits were not linked to children moving because they were adopted which could signify an unstable background as the cohort involved only birth parents But he added There may be something else going on We do not know what we do not know  Where there is light that we are seeing there are areas of darkness we have not explored  He said his next move was to assess the children at age  adding   and  were the usual ages of onset for psychosis  Dr Craig Morgan senior lecturer at the Institute of Psychiatry Kings College London said the study was really quite interesting and tied in with a fair amount of research  But he said it was important to remember  of cases where psychotic traits were shown did not lead to psychosis Prof Gordon Claridge at the University of Oxfords department of experimental psychology said One might ask why the target children were bullied  They might have been inherently stranger in some way and therefore attracted bullying  Lucie Russell director of campaigns at YoungMinds said Young people need stability and the process of moving school can be traumatic  If you are a young person who is already vulnerable then moving school is often the final straw
