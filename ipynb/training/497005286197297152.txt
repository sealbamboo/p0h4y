Good morning, folks. And how are you today? We are in fine spirits, thanks to a sunny sky and a delightful breeze that are enveloping the Pharmalot campus. Of course, there is little time to enjoy the moment since there is so much to be done. It is the middle of the week, after all. No doubt, you can relate. So time to get cracking. Let’s grab that cup of stimulation and attack the to-do list. Meanwhile, here are some items of interest. Hope you conquer the world today and keep us in mind if you hear anything interesting…. Walgreen will buy the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots it does not already own, but the drug store chain plans to keep headquarters in the U.S. and not pursue a tax inversion; a scientist who co-authored disputed stem cell papers that were recentl y retracted committed suicide by hanging himself, and a bioethics professor writes that some clinical trials may unfairly take advantage of the homeless and mentally ill as they seek to enroll participants.
