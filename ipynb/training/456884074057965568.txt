Maybe you paint keep a journal or knit Or maybe you play bass in a punk rock band Whatever hobby you have keep at it A little study published this week suggests that having a creative outlet outside the office might help people perform better at work Psychologists from San Francisco State University found that the more people engaged in their hobbies the more likely they were to come up with creative solutions to problems on the job And no matter what the hobby was these people were also more likely to go out of their way to help coworkers The findings were   Wednesday in the  We found that in general the more you engage in creative activities the better youll do says Kevin Eschleman an assistant professor of psychology at San Francisco State and the studys lead author The researchers surveyed about  people with a variety of jobs and a variety of hobbies about what they did in their free time and also asked about their behavior at work Those who said they engaged fairly often in a creative activity scored  to  percent higher on performance rankings than those who engaged in creative activities only ccasionally The researchers also surveyed a second group of  US Air Force captains The psychologists knew that these folks were already trained to solve tough problems and help others  so they wanted to see if having a hobby affected their performance in any way In addition to asking the officers about their own work performance the researchers checked performance reviews from the captains coworkers and bosses It turned out that for both groups having a creative outlet boosted work performance And thats after the scientists took into account other things that might influence performance  like personality Some people have a personality thats more creative   tells Shots To judge how naturally creative participants were the researchers asked them for example to rate on a scale from  to  how open they are to new experiences and how much they value art The study only confirms that having a creative outlet and being creative at work are correlated Eschleman says He cant really say if one causes the other But he says he suspects that behaviors at work and home reinforce each other Its very possible that those who are performing better at their jobs also have more energy to pursue these creative activities he says And in turn participating in creative activities may help people feel more energized and engaged at work You almost kind of spiral in a positive direction he says And while the paper doesnt pin down exactly how or why your weekend forays into the wonderful world of soapmaking might help your professional life Eschleman says its likely because hobbies can help people learn more about their own strengths and weaknesses Creative activities really can provide you the opportunity to learn something new about yourself Hobbies can also provide an escape from everyday stresses Youre using that time to recharge he says So bosses should encourage employees to take up hobbies Eschleman says Maybe even consider hooking workers up with discount coupons for a pottery class
