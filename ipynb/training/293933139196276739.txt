Depriving   cells of good cholesterol may offer a new drugfree approach to eradicating the disease according to a study just released from Northwestern University where scientists have uncovered a clever nontoxic way to do so by feeding the cells tiny bits of gold NonHodgkins and Hodgkins lymphomas are cancers that originate from Bcells which are derived from bone marrow Around one in  Americans will develop nonHodgkins lymphoma which primarily affects people over the age of  Hodgkins lymphoma a less common form of the disease mostly impacts people between  and  years of age especially in the twenties Lymphoma cells require   to survive and proliferate according to Leo Gordon MD the Abby and John Friend professor of Oncology Research at Northwestern Universitys Feinberg School of Medicine coauthor of the study He used nanoparticles  or microscopic pieces of matter made of actual gold  to fool the cancerous cells and kill them off The discovery happened nearly by accident in tests conducted on cells in test tubes as well as in tests on mice says Gordon whose study was published in the     We were interested in looking at ways to deliver chemo to lymphoma cells using nanoparticles as a way to pull cholesterol out of vascular cells explains Gordon We thought we would attach chemotherapy to the nanoparticles For the control group in the study the researchers attached gold particles that werent infused with chemotherapy drugs The outside of the nanoparticles Gordon tested are identical to the outside of HDL cholesterol particles We think the cells see the particles and think its cholesterol says Gordon To the researchers surprise cancer cells were killed more effectively in the control group  the cells that received the gold nanoparticles   the chemotherapy drug The results could lead to a new way of treating lymphoma Developments in treatment have greatly increased the survival rate for Hodgkins lymphoma around  percent for one year  percent for five years and  percent for  years The fiveyear survival rate for nonHodgkins lymphoma is around  percent and the year survival rate is  percent according to the American Cancer Society In the past few decades treatment for both types of lymphoma has dramatically improved and extended life expectancy for a majority of patients Treatment includes both radiation and chemotherapy along with Rituxan a firstline drug for the majority of lymphoma patients thats also commonly used for a number of   including multiple sclerosis and   Gordon says that while statistics show current treatments are effective they still are not enough because were not curing everybody He thinks nanoparticles could potentially be used as adjunct therapy We dont know what role its going to have yet until we get some more clinical data Gold salts have been used in drugs such as Ridaura and Solganal for diseases such as   Experts say the gold accumulates in the body over time and attacks certain cells that are responsible for the bodys inflammatory response Its a pretty nontoxic substance Gordon says The next step is to find out how genes are altered in lymphoma cells when cholesterol is pulled out of the membranes Gordon will conduct further studies of the nanoparticles on mammals His team hopes to start clinical trials of these nanoparticles on humans in the next few years Additionally he says they will look at whether nanoparticles are effective for killing other cancers such as breast cancer and certain types of leukemia
