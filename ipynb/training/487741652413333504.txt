My Pilates teacher jokes in class that we shouldnt feel tired after all were mostly lying down But Pilates is hard and I find that his jokes help me smile and take my mind off my straining abs Thats one way of saying that the atmosphere of a class truly matters At JK Zen the atmosphere was Were all in this together and students helped one another out with positions and equipment Several students were regulars and made me feel at home   N Robertson Blvd Suite  Los Angeles   Juliet Kaska the JK in the title and a trainer to several actors has a small modern studio in the heart of the chic Robertson Boulevard shopping district Still the women in class were friendly and not all had perfect bodies Its a warm and welcoming place  If you want to work muscles that dont normally get used Pilates will do it It also helps keep me thinking about posture for days afterward which is good Getting set up on the equipment is just about the only break time There are various levels available including prenatal Serious but with the idea that we were all treating ourselves well by showing up for class   with discounts for multipleclass packages Parking is  for two hours so theres time for a latte or window shopping after class If you have suggestions for classes please let me know by email or Twitter
