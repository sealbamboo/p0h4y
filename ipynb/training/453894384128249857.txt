Authors of the firstever global guidelines for treating hepatitis C went big Tuesday advocating for worldwide use of two of the most expensive specialty drugs in the world The   from the World Health Organization give strong endorsement to the two newest drugs Gilead Sciences Sovaldi costs  per pill or  for a week course of treatment Olysio sold by Johnson  Johnsons Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit costs  for a threemonth course The high prices have ignited a   of   In the United States doctors and insurers argue that the cost of the drugs will make their widespread use impossible And critics say even if the prices are heavily discounted in other countries the drugs will still be unaffordable in most of the world The WHO   of treatment with Sovaldi and Olysio was made without taking the cost of the two drugs into consideration Thats because the price of the drugs outside the US was unknown in December when the WHO panel wrapped up its work But the price of the drugs isnt the only issue The WHO recommends that all  million or so people around the globe with chronic hepatitis C infection be assessed for treatment  a gargantuan task in itself Authors of the report are quick to acknowledge that neither the assessment of peoples health status nor actual treatment will happen anytime soon A lot has to happen for this to really take off in a big way says the guidelines chief architect   Even if prices came down dramatically tomorrow that doesnt mean there would be an immediate rush to treatment Screening programs for hepatitis C need to be ramped up Labs to determine the genetic type of the virus crucial in choosing treatment regimens have to be built and staffed Medical personnel need to be able to assess when viral liver damage has progressed to the point when treatment is urgent And drugs have to be chosen wisely and administered carefully Fewer   of Americans with chronic hepatitis C currently have had or are getting any treatment In Europe treatment has reached only  percent And in most countries Wiktor says hardly anyone is getting treatment The WHO guidelines are setting a deliberately high standard in the hope Wiktor says of replicating the remarkable dissemination of antiviral therapy for HIV Starting from a similar point of little distribution  years ago antiviral treatment for HIV   around  million people most of them in the poorest countries of subSaharan Africa HIV infects more than  million people globally and almost a third of those also have hepatitis C That makes chronic hepatitis C infection at least four times more prevalent But HIV requires lifelong antiviral treatment The big difference with hepatitis C is that suddenly there are drugs that can actually cure more than  percent of patients with a threemonth regimen Treatments are getting better shorter and safer Wiktor says The controversy over the cost is apparently beginning to have an effect on pricing Egypt which has the worlds highest infection rates  somewhere around  percent of the population  has negotiated a  percent discount on Sovaldi to  for a week course Gilead Sovaldis maker is tiering prices for the drug in other countries too      and reportedly around   that may be licensed to several Indian companies But those discounts dont impress   such as Rohit Malpani of   When youre starting from such an exorbitant price in the US the price Gilead will offer middleincome countries like Thailand and Indonesia may seem like a good discount Malpani says But it will still be too expensive for many of these countries to scale up treatment Other forces may drive prices lower A number of other medicines are coming down the pike  at least  WHOs Wiktor says That in itself will provide competition as companies try to assure market share A flood of new data on the effectiveness of new medicines is expected this week at an   in London where the new WHO guidelines were unveiled The dynamism around hep C is really remarkable Wiktor says Once you know you can cure somebody that really changes the tone of the conversation But until the prices fall and until or unless pressure develops to shake loose massive new amounts of funding to pay for access to the new drugs hard choices loom For instance the WHO guidelines say that treatments will have to be rationed starting with patients whose livers are heavily scarred or cirrhotic  putting them at high risk for liver cancer or the need for liver transplants We dont have reliable figures but about  percent of people with chronic hep C are in that stage he says That would be  to  million people globally Or around three times the number receiving HIV treatment
