Saturday is the day the Obama administration promised it would have HealthCaregov working smoothly for the majority of people who need to sign up for health insurance As the Obama administration scrambles to fix the glitchplagued site experts are beginning to worry about another problem that may further impair the rollout of the Affordable Care Act Health insurance companies say theyre seeing numerous errors in a form that plays a vital part in the enrollment process The problems are manageable so far but many worry about what will happen if enrollment surges in the weeks to come Its safe to say that the vast majority of consumers have never heard of an  EDI transmission form despite its crucial role in the process of signing up for health insurance Its a kind of digital resume that tells an insurance companys computer everything it needs to know about an applicant says Bob Laszewski a health policy consultant It contains all of the persons enrollment information all the information that an insurance company needs to get this person entered as a policy holder Laszewski says The  has been around for a long time The architects of the Affordable Care Act intended for it to play a central role in the signup process says Tim Jost a professor of law at Washington and Lee University The  information is information the insurers have to have to get people enrolled in coverage which of course is the point of going through the marketplace Jost says But health insurance companies say the s they are receiving from applicants on the federal and state exchanges have sometimes been riddled with errors Laszewski says Duplicate enrollments people enrolling and unenrolling inaccurate data about whos a child and whos a spouse files just not being readable he says Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of West Virginia has been steadily processing new customers ever since the launch of Obamacare this fall But Highmark President Fred Earley says mistakes in the s are making the job harder Weve had some situations where the records dont track or weve seen duplicates Earley says Weve had situations where well get a record to show that someone canceled coverage when weve never had a record to show they enrolled in the first place Earley says his firm has been dealing with the problems by calling up state and federal officials and correcting the mistakes The exact cause of the problems is unclear The Obama administration has been slowly making fixes and officials say theyre making progress But Laszewski says the fixes are not fast enough The error rates have been falling he says HealthCaregov has been making progress but were not to the point yet where people can trust that highvolume enrollment can occur and we wont have serious customer service problems Laszewski says the test will come over the next few weeks People who want coverage to begin on Jan  have until just before Christmas to sign up and theres likely to be a surge of new applicants in the weeks to come What happens if we start getting hundreds of thousands or millions of people signing up by the Dec  deadline and the insurance industry is receiving hundreds or thousands of these a day he says Thats what everyones worried about
