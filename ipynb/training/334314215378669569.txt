Vermont will become the fourth state to make it legal for a physician to prescribe lethal medication to a terminally ill mentally competent patient who wants to end his life It has also become the first state to approve the practice through legislation instead of via a public referendum as in Oregon and Washington or a court decision   The Vermont House of Representatives approved the measure by a to vote on Monday night after to approval in the Senate last week Gov Peter Shumlin has said he will sign it into law Its been a long road in Vermont said Kathryn Tucker director of legal affairs for the national Compassion and Choices organization who testified in both chambers in favor of the bill Supporters of what advocates call death with dignity and opponents sometimes label physicianassisted suicide have been introducing similar legislation in Vermont since the mid s In the only previous vote a bill went down to defeat in the state house in  Given polls that consistently show broad support among Vermont voters a referendum might well have passed years ago said Michael Sirotkin one of the lawyers representing the group   But the state doesnt permit ballot initiatives so organizers turned to the legislature Id say this is actually a harder path because often the public is ahead of legislators on controversial issues Mr Sirotkin said Socalled aid in dying will look different in Vermont than elsewhere because of an thhour compromise required to win over two state senators who initially voted for the proposed law then changed their positions You saw a real tension between legislators who wanted to ensure freedom of choice on this enormously personal issue and on the other side legislators reluctant to bring government into the practice of medicine Ms Tucker said Therefore when the law takes effect after the governor signs it it will initially closely follow the Oregon model with numerous statutory procedures and safeguards meant to protect patients against coercion or changes of heart It adopts the same day waiting period between the patients first request for medication and the second for example and requires a second physicians evaluation But three years later those requirements drop away and a lethal prescription for a mentally competent patient expected to die within six months becomes largely a private matter between doctor and patient After July   the law will protect physicians from civil or criminal liability and from professional misconduct charges And it still requires informed consent mandating that doctors inform patients of all feasible endoflife services including palliative care and hospice and of the medications risks Otherwise it no longer mandates when or how doctors respond to requests as long as the patient makes an independent decision to selfadminister a lethal dose of medication We view it as an elegant compromise Mr Sirotkin said In three years supporters hope physicians will have become more comfortable with the process and the data theyre required to compile on such actions will show no coercion or abuse The flexibility to reach this sort of compromise shows the advantage of the legislative process Ms Tucker said In ballot initiatives like the one   last year a statutes language becomes locked in And because activists on both sides have been trying to persuade  Vermont legislators instead of the entire voting public the media campaign has been quieter and less expensive But its also easier for legislation to be revisited or reversed by a future legislature No one really believes this is going to go away Edward Mahoney a religion professor and president of   the primary opponent of the law told me before the vote Few Vermonters are likely to use the law given the states size Oregon where last year  patients received lethal prescriptions has more than six times Vermonts population and Washington  such prescriptions in  is more than ten times larger But the prospect raises strong emotions nonetheless This type of legislation has been introduced in something like  to  states and has never passed a legislature Dr Mahoney told me before the vote Theyve had defeat after defeat and they want a victory Thats why its being pushed Now supporters have that victory This will be something of a tipping point said Ms Tucker of Compassion and Choices I think it will galvanize efforts around the country But it might also galvanize the opposition in Vermont This could very well get fought all over again in three years Mr Sirotkin said For the moment though a small group of advocates gathered for a lowkey celebration in Montpelier on Monday night
