A month on from Typhoon Haiyan the situation is moving from emergency to early recovery programmes health experts say The World Health Organization WHO says major priorities are now getting essential health care including neonatal care and treatment of chronic diseases to more people and starting to get clinics and hospitals damaged or destroyed by the storm up and running again  The death toll from Typhoon Haiyan stands at over   Around  million people were affected by the storm more than   were injured more than four million displaced  with many now living in cramped unsanitary temporary accommodation  Such conditions increase the risk of the spread of disease  WHO spokeswoman Aphaluck Bhatiasevi said  The emergency phase is supporting people in the affected areas with their immediate needs things like helping them get into some temporary shelter and supporting them with basics like food and water We are now moving into the recovery stage which is reestablishing the health systems which have been disrupted or destroyed The vast majority of hospitals and health centres in the areas hit by the typhoon were either badly damaged or destroyed  Sixtyfive foreign medical teams are delivering care in field hospitals across the affected areas along with  local medical teams So far the WHO says its helped distribute more than  tonnes of medicines and supplies  A mass immunisation campaign to vaccinate children under five in affected areas against measles and polio has been underway for  days  So far around  children have been vaccinated in the worst hit areas in and around Tacloban The WHO says there havent been significant reports of infectious disease yet The majority of diseases that have been reported are related to respiratory infections fever diarrhoea high blood pressure some skin infections and wounds caused as a result of injuries sustained during the typhoon said Ms Bhatiasevi  Medical teams are also dealing with the normal health needs of communities including maternal and child health care  An average of  women give birth every day in the affected areas with around  of them experiencing complications In the remote area of Guiuan medical charity Medicines Sans Frontiers MSF have set up a field hospital in tents on the site of the towns main hospital which was almost completely destroyed  Anna Halford originally from Colchester is the field coordinator there She said We now have bed capacity our operating theatre is functional We had four Csections back to back yesterday nine deliveries of babies in total A third of our consultations in the last week have been followups of wounds received during the typhoon but we are seeing more respiratory illnesses which are probably linked to the fact that people are more exposed to outside because their homes were destroyed  We have also had a couple of suspect dengue cases and typhoid cases Anna has been in Guiun for three weeks now and says peoples needs have changed  At the beginning MSF were doing distribution of tents as emergency night shelter  Within two weeks people had another priority so we are now giving people construction kits which is all the materials needed to build a m ft square habitation with walls floor and a roof including tools But she says there is still a long way to go Bodies are still being pulled from the debris Around  people are thought to have died in Guian including up to  who are still missing Anna is one of those with the grim task of helping retrieve the bodies along with local volunteers  They are sifting through an area of about m by m ft by ft which is still up to m ft deep in debris  She said This particular location has between  people still unaccounted Its got to the point where its difficult for a community of volunteers to start scrabbling around in there so MSF will be helping with mental health support and also simple logistics and organisation to start recovering those bodies Many foreign medical teams are preparing to leave especially in the runup to Christmas  Some will be replaced and teams are also trying to hand services back to local health authorities  But the WHO says its critically important that gaps in services do not emerge and that international attention and support to the health sector does not wane Dr Julie Hall WHO representative in the Philippines said We must ensure that essential health services are not interrupted and that in the months to come the Philippine government as well as humanitarian aid organizations and other key partners have adequate resources to restore health services across the affected regions
