For many people with posttraumatic stress disorder   youve ever been at the worst possible moment I always see his face says Will who did tours in Iraq and Afghanistan with the Army And in my dreams its the same thing  I always walk over to him and instead of this Afghani kid thats laying there its my little brother The memory that triggers Wills nightmare happened during his tour in Afghanistan Will  who asked that NPR not use his last name was on patrol when a kid came up to the Humvee asking for water Then he bashed Wills medic in the face with a rock The boys father appeared with a gun and started shooting Amid a scuffle the child picked up the gun and Will shot him at close range After I did that all I remember is that I was shaking Will says And one of my soldiers took my weapon away and said Its OK   cousin Its gonna be OK  Troops coming home from war like Will are often prescribed drugs for PTSD and other conditions Hundreds of thousands of veterans are on opiates for pain and  in  veterans polled say they are on  different medications While there is concern about overmedicating and selfmedicating  using alcohol or drugs without a doctors approval  there are also some veterans who are trying to do the opposite Theyre kicking the drugs against doctors orders Will has other upsetting stories Theyre noteworthy not for the intensity of the firefight or the size of the bombs but for the bad pictures they conjure up in his head He remembers pulling a friend out of a river in Iraq only to find there was nothing left of him below the waterline He recalls discovering his buddy is dead by finding a huge scrap of his tattoo And theres guilt Those guys had wives and kids You know everybody in my Humvee we were all single I felt guilty It should have been us it shouldnt have been them Will came away he says with only two ruined knees a wrecked back a piece of bone fragment that sort of floats on his hip a mild traumatic brain injury and PTSD And for all those things Will has been prescribed medications  lots and lots of medications It takes him about six minutes to list all his pills There are   On average servicemen and women are prescribed narcotic painkillers three times more often than civilians But despite the pain and PTSD some of them have decided without telling their doctors to stop taking their medications Leo Kalberg served in the Army for six years His medication list includes escitalopram Prozac Klonopin morphine Percocet Vicodin tramadol Motrin cortisone lidocaine and Seroquel among others At points it adds up to  or more pills a day He realized he was addicted to Percocet because hed get nervous if he only had a few pills left Plus Karlberg says the side effects make him feel like a zombie Id take all my medication and Id sit down and a whole entire day would pass and I would just get up and go to bed Karlberg says Thats when he decided to quit taking his medications Nancy Bryant who served in the Air Force for almost  years was in a similar situation Cymbalta Maxalt trazodone tizanidine dicyclomine hydrocodone  and her list goes on Bryant came upon the idea of stopping her medications by accident She got the stomach flu and couldnt keep any food or medications down After a few days of that  those medications clearing my system  I just realized wow I felt like a totally different person she says Rachel Stokes was in the Army and she too has a long list crowded with similar medications She started looking into what all those medications are really designed to do She was prescribed Seroquel to help her sleep But its not even for sleep Stokes says Seroquel is for people that have bipolar or schizophrenia And Im like that is not me Dr Richard Friedman director of the Psychopharmacology Clinic at Weill Cornell Medical College has heard this before Theyre using psych drugs off label  way way way off label he says Obviously they are not using them to treat the major disorders for which these drugs are designed Friedman researched the militarys use of antipsychotics like Seroquel and stimulants like Adderall and Ritalin He says those drugs have no official purpose that fits a combat zone He figures the military was using whatever drugs they could to keep troops sleeping waking up and functioning during wartime They were in a different situation where they had unprecedented levels of stress in a group of otherwise healthy people Friedman says So I think they resorted to psychopharmacology as a means to keep people in active duty Friedman says its like giving a football player painkillers so he can finish the game It gets him back on the field but might hurt him worse in the long term The Pentagon says it has safeguards to prevent overprescription or the use of drugs in harmful combinations and the Department of Veterans Affairs guidelines warn about using many of these drugs offlabel Offlabel use is common in medicine and Friedman says doctors do it with good intentions He also says stopping medications without a doctors guidance can be dangerous But Rachel Stokes says shes sick of doctors and their pills The medications  I hate all the medications she says If the scientist actually went through and did research and then really found out what really worked then thats different But it doesnt seem like theyre doing that She may have a point A   last month concluded that the VA and the Pentagon do a poor job tracking what happens when they treat PTSD with drugs  although there is a brandnew effort at the VA to educate its doctors Gavin West who heads the Opioid Safety Initiative at the VA says Weve undertaken a psychopharmacologic safety initiative where were looking across the board at more safe and more effective use of medications Will the veteran whose list of medications takes six minutes to read has stopped taking those drugs I always keep at least one month on supply Will says My next months supply comes next week so as soon as they come in I take those and I flush them And then I just scrape my name off all the pill bottles and throw them all away Will who is in the process of medically retiring from the Army keeps that months supply of pills on hand for a reason He gets drugtested to make sure he is taking his medications Thats to ensure hes not selling his drugs on the street  which isnt uncommon So every few months when he has an appointment coming up Will gets himself back on his drugs He gradually works up to the dose hes supposed to be on He recently cycled himself   the medications again after a doctors appointment Im actually feeling pretty good Will says Ive now been fully off the meds for nine days The first three days of being off them were really bad just real bad nausea diarrhea shaky Will hopes hell be out of the Army soon and can stop the roller coaster of getting on and off the drugs But for now he says its worth it When he was on the medications he was a shutin he says depressed and too doped up to drive As for dealing with his PTSD without the drugs  hes still working on it
