Premiums on the new health exchanges are lower across the board than the average premium paid by the majority of Americans who have employerbased coverage according to a new report released Thursday This suggests that the exchanges may be an appealing option for employers looking to provide enticing but affordable benefits to their workers the team at PwCs Health Research Institute said Employers today are frustrated by the cost and hassle of providing health insurance so they are looking for an affordable alternative to keep their employees healthy said Ceci Connolly managing director of PwCs Health Research Institute This may be an option for employers in the nottoodistant future Connollys team analyzed all the various insurance policies offered on the  exchanges run by states and the District of Columbia plus those run by the federal government for the rest of the states They compared them to data on employerprovided plans In  health insurance plans offered on the ACAs  new exchanges are on average comparable to or lower priced than similar employerbased plans In addition most exchange shoppers have a wider variety of plans than the typical employerbased offering the report reads Most Americans   million  get their health insurance through an employer It was a voluntary system that evolved over the past  years The    ACA enshrines this in law requiring large employers to provide it The law also aims to get insurance coverage to the  million or so Americans who dont have it and provides for the state and federal health insurance exchanges to help provide it The law sets rules for all insurers aimed at ending what the White House has termed the worst abuses of the insurance industry  turning away people seeking coverage ending coverage for people whose care gets too expensive and refusing to pay for certain areas of care So far the federal government says  have signed up for coverage on the exchanges The exchanges set up four levels of coverage bronze which pays for  percent of medical costs but which has the lowest premiums silver which pays  percent of costs gold paying  percent and platinum which pays  percent of costs but which has the highest premiums Connollys team calculated that the average premium for a plan with coverage similar to that of the average employersponsored plan in  would be  This compared to  for a worker getting coverage from an employer The exchanges are competitive and even cheaper in some instances Connolly said If an individual chooses the lowest priced plan in each state the average exchange premium would be  or  percent lower than the average premium for comparable employersponsored coverage the report adds Come  when states will have the ability to open these exchanges to employers we believe that some employers will look to that as an alternative to the employersponsored coverage they provide and this data suggests it will be a competitive market Connolly said Some critics of the exchanges have complained about sticker shock for people either buying insurance for the first time or switching from buying their own personal health insurance But PwC says the premiums are in fact lower than what similar barebones employerprovided plans cost and that the insurance people are getting is more comprehensive than the plans they had before Prior to the ACA individual insurance coverage was more limited than employer insurance and on average comparable to bronze plans purchased on the ACAs exchanges the report reads More than half the people in the individual market had coverage below the bronze level of  percent the lowest level in the exchanges And people can get government subsidies in the form of tax breaks if they have certain income levels The average employerprovided plan pays about  percent of costs putting them somewhere between a gold and platinum plan on an exchange With lower premiums the insurance companies have to find other ways to save money so coverage is profitable and many are doing this by narrowing the networks of hospitals and providers available to patients Thats because they can make deals with the smaller groups of doctors hospitals and clinics But the PwC team says insurers working with employers are also considering this option so it may be the wave of the future anyway The highercost medical centers that have historically refused to negotiate for inclusion in some plans may need to rethink that strategy and pursue ways to lower costs the report reads CNBCs Dan Mangan contributed to this article
