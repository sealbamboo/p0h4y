Weve heard for years that a key to weight loss is swapping a few square meals a day for many minimeals throughout the day Now a small but growing body of evidence is suggesting all that grazing isnt necessarily a smart way to control your appetite In some cases it may even result in weight gain  presented this weekend at the American Diabetes Association conference found that people with type  diabetes who ate two large meals a day lost more weight than when they consumed six smaller meals with the same amount of calories The researchers led by Hana Kahleova of the Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine in Prague instructed the  study participants to follow two types of eating plans for  weeks each either six minimeals or two larger meals  just breakfast and lunch Both diet regimens included the same nutrient and caloric content  the daily caloric total reduced each persons intake by  calories Half of the participants were provided with all of the meals and registered dietitians regularly met with the volunteers  The volunteers lost weight under both eating plans But eating a big breakfast and big lunch resulted in more weight loss   points of their body mass index or BMI Eating the six smaller meals resulted in a loss of  BMI points BMI uses a persons height and weight to provide a measure of body fat A person of normal weight has a BMI between  and  The average BMI for participants in this study was  Though the study was presented at the ADA conference its important to note that its not yet been published in a peerreviewed journal  and  patients makes for a small sample size Although eating just two times a day resulted in more weight loss is skipping dinner really feasible or sustainable for the average American  with or without diabetes Not likely experts who werent involved with this new research say   suggest that most Americans including those with diabetes eat five or six times a day so to curb eating to only two times a day would be a change that would be drastic and dramatic  and unrealistic for many people says   a registered dietitian from New York Toby Smithson a spokesman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics adds that eating two large meals a day is impractical because for many dinner is the one meal that theyre able to reliably fit into their schedule She says Specifically for people with diabetes with the mechanics of our body it is best to spread out the doses of glucose  throughout the day But Madelyn Fernstrom TODAYs diet and nutrition editor says that the reallife takeaway here is less about skipping dinner and more about simply eating less frequently An earlier study showed that if you ate three times a day you got the same thing So its really cutting down how often you eat because youll tend to eat less Fernstrom told Savannah Guthrie this morning on TODAY  Three meals a day is going to be more workable Fernstrom says When you translate it to real life this could be a good way to go  hearty breakfast medium lunch and then a lighter dinner Or you can mix and match as long as you keep the calories low Because remember in this study the dieters daily calorie counts were cut by  a piece  something that Fernstrom says can translate to about a pound lost a week Because moving away from grazing  constantly grabbing something to eat during the day the minute you feel the slightest twinge of hunger Thats something many dietitians can get behind And the medical literature supports that idea too as past research has suggested that   does not necessarily result in more weight lost What I think this says is that grazing all day long may not be the best Fernstrom says A lot of people think if I want to lose weight better Id better spread my meals out eat constantly But the more you graze the more you tend to eat for many people These six mini meals turn into six major meals and people wonder why theyre not losing weight she told TODAY So this is really good documentation even though its a small study that eating less often can really help promote the same weight loss  For longterm weight management its important to learn to listen to your body Zieds rule Eat when youre hungry stop when youre satisfied and plan ahead But perhaps most importantly know what works for you and choose an eating strategy that you can really actually stick to Thats something Robert Ratner chief scientific and medical officer for the ADA says is so important in treating diabetes patients  or anyone interested in losing weight  There are some people who if you gave them the option of six meals a day would overeat at all six meals There are others who actually find grazing like that quite easy so theyre never so hungry that they consume large quantities On the other hand we all know people who miss meals Ratner told NBCNewscom  One of the take home messages here  a calorie reduction in intake regardless of how you do it results in weight loss Ratner says adding that both groups lost weight This shows that calorie reduction matters
