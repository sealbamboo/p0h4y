In a retrospective study of babies born in  researchers found that having a home birth almost doubled the relative risk of a fiveminute Apgar score of four or lower scores above seven are generally considered normal and more than tripled the risk of neonatal seizure The absolute risk for these outcomes is very small but both are predictors of cerebral palsy developmental impairment and infant death The study   compared  planned home births with  hospital births and controlled for age race gestational age at birth and other factors Mothers who gave birth at home were less likely to have their labor induced or to have an assisted delivery and home births attended by certified nursemidwives had neonatal complication rates not significantly different from hospital births Nursemidwives were present at  percent of the home births Its not necessarily so that home births are bad but women need to think about the tradeoffs said the lead author Dr Yvonne W Cheng of the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine Home births have fewer interventions but the baby is at higher risk And obstetric problems are often emergencies
