 Amgen Inc. and its subsidiary Onyx Pharmaceuticals said on Wednesday that their Kyprolis cancer drug failed to meet its primary endpoint of improving overall survival for patients with relapsed and advanced refractory multiple myeloma in a late-stage clinical trial.. The 315-patient, open-label study evaluated the response from those treated with Kyprolis compared with those who received an active control regimen of low-dose dexamethasone, or equivalent corticosteroids, and optional cyclophosphamide.
