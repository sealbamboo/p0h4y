Would it be better if the NHS bought in bulk Thats the question  that has arisen since  My piece followed the government initiative to publicise the huge variation in prices paid for supplies in different parts of the NHS And it has raised a number of questions   Perhaps the most important is  how could health chiefs do better   Tens of millions could be wasted by the failure to drive a hard bargain with suppliers  But getting a better deal for clinical waste disposal bags surgical gloves and even A paper might not be as easy as it looks   Some take the view that criticism of procurement practices is another example of NHS bashing  after all they argue the NHS was recently rated as the most efficient healthcare system amongst several leading economies by a major think tanks   Others who have worked at various levels of the NHS say they are immensely frustrated by the waste and inefficiency they see day to day One leading trust chief executive told me that lecturing health staff on the need to save money resulted in eyes glazing over   But explaining that every pound saved would be reallocated to front line services and enable better outcomes for patients was an easy message to sell   Managements though clearly have to demonstrate their own competence in cutting costs by better procurement Central government  or the top level of NHS England  would have immense clout and buying power    The idea of Whitehall involvement was dismissed as impractical by some  However its already happening   The Department of Health is working with NHS England to negotiate central deals for  items    A list of agreed prices and suppliers will be sent to trusts in the autumn    If deals for drugs for the NHS can be handled at national level why not do the same for some other products The Home Office is currently looking at haggling out a central deal for police uniforms with a small group of suppliers   Police authorities in England would then get the benefit of the lower prices   The same things is being considered for fire service uniforms  its estimated that m could be lopped off an annual budget of m Centrally negotiated supply contracts will not always be appropriate   Regional groups of NHS trusts might pool their procurement to get better prices   This has been successfully applied in the capital with the NHS London Procurement Partnership LPP   Established in  the group says it has saved more than m on behalf of members    One trust is said to be saving nearly  this year alone on screws used in spinal surgery by getting a deal through LPP rather than trying to negotiate alone with a supplier Some health experts are sceptical about centralised procurement  The former health trust chief Roy Lilley now a commentator says because of hidden distribution costs He says The more you buy the more expensive it is by the time you get to the end user   He believes it would easier to tell trusts that nonmedical suppliers should never account for more than a set proportion of turnover and let them get on with it Those who believe strongly in the merits of smarter procurement acknowledge that applying it in Whitehall is not straightforward   Alastair McKie of PA Consulting Group which advises some government departments says It takes a lot of motivated individuals who can share their experiences  across different departments to make things happen  He says that individual organisations for example NHS trusts often believe their way of doing things is best and need a lot convincing to join forces with others The NHS supply chain sounds a dry and specialist subject   But it matters so much because millions of pounds of taxpayers money is at stake   At a time of a squeeze on public funding the imperative to make better use of that money is as urgent as ever
