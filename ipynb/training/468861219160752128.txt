The next day I was like Thats it   At the August  reunion Victoria weighed  pounds and wore a size  dress Over the next nine months she lost more than  pounds by moving more and eating less  There is no secret Victoria says about weight loss All you have to do is care If you honestly care about yourself if you honestly care about getting it done  thats all you have to do Victoria didnt grow up overweight though she sometimes felt like it in her athletic family Her parents cooked healthy meals around the house and Victoria swam played tennis and ran cross country until she left for college  At the Savannah College of Art and Design in Georgia where she majored in communication arts otherwise known as comic books and poetry she jokes she ate whatever she wanted That included plenty of junk food  You eat the cheap stuff Victoria remembers It wasnt like I was getting home from the studio and being like I need some lean protein and vegetables   When she graduated and struggled to find work she ate even worse Though she lived in Savannah Georgia a walking city she never went to the gym and couldnt combat the excess calories she was consuming At   her body mass index was      In  Victoria married Lyndsay Rosenlund in a small private ceremony with family and friends in Washington state The couple moved to Atlanta and started going out for dinner frequently with friends But the day after her high school reunion Victoria went into the pantry of their home and got rid of anything with more than a few ingredients on the label She read about serving sizes and started using an app to count calories She even bought a food scale  Honestly all of it was kind of hard Victoria says At  pounds you dont actually want to do anything  Exercising was hard because I was embarrassed Nobody wants to be the fat girl working out So she stayed out of the gym and started walking with Rosenlund and their dogs Giuseppe and Romona She walked for about an hour every morning and an hour every night Eventually she gained enough confidence to jog Now she runs Ks  We tried running together when we first started our journey but it turns out I hate running Rosenlund says However we both enjoy hiking so we try and hike every chance we get The couple also tried to limit how often they ate out When they did go to a restaurant they made a game plan and made smarter choices Water instead of beer Balsamic vinaigrette instead of ranch dressing  Victoria swears she never goes hungry She relies on big salads airpopped corn and lean protein to keep her full without a lot of calories With these simple strategies she lost about  pounds a week Rosenlund also lost  pounds Victoria now wears a size  and has maintained her final weight of  pounds for nearly a year  Morgan has a lot more energy and less anxiety Rosenlund says I think that the weight loss has definitely improved her outlook on life I feel amazing Victoria agrees You feel totally different about yourself You shouldnt feel all that from weight but you do
