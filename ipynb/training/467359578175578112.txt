
 I come back to burgers in this column every year or two My quest for good vegetarian burgers has nothing to do with wanting to create something that resembles a hamburger or turkey burger Why try to mimic meat Rather my vegetarian cooking is about produce which it turns out can be the foundation for a great burger  One difficulty Ive experienced with vegetablebased burgers has been getting the right consistency so that they hold together when you brown them The solution to this occasional problem came in the form of some incredible patties that the chef Suvir Saran demonstrated this spring at the Healthy Kitchens Healthy Lives conference at the Culinary Institute of America in the Napa Valley He used farro sweet potatoes mushrooms and peanuts in his burgers and they were flawless The secret to their easytoworkwith consistency was the sweet potatoes Why hadnt I ever thought of using mashed potatoes  sweet or otherwise  to hold together a burger Mr Suvir shared several of his delectable recipes for potatobased patties with me and Ive adapted three of them in this weeks Recipes for Health They are filled with wonderful spices packed with vegetables easy to make and they can all be frozen either before or after browning Another colleague who has dedicated a lot of thought to delicious burgers is Mollie Katzen whose beautiful new cookbook The Heart of the Plate has a chapter devoted to burgers and savory pancakes She has also shared a recipe this week 
I didnt serve any of this weeks burgers on buns They are better on their own and theres no reason to add more carbohydrates to the meal Their seasonings lend themselves to Indian condiments like chutneys pickles and raitas But plain old ketchup relish and mustard will also do just fine  These spicy burgers are a striking green from the spinach  Potatoes roasted and mashed are the binder for these hearty patties  These patties are coated in ground walnuts and include finely chopped broccoli  Whole spices give these burgers amazing flavor and texture  These burgers have a Mediterranean flavor with feta and mint in the mix
