In Washington this week calls to fix the problem of people getting insurance cancellation notices are getting louder and coming from all sides But turning back the clock on health insurance cancellations turns out to be a lot harder than it sounds Republicans have been blasting the president for weeks about breaking his promise that people would be able to keep their insurance policies Later this week the GOPled House will vote on a bill called the   Whats changing is that Democrats are now starting to join the chorus Last week Sen Mary Landrieu DLa whos facing a tough reelection bid next fall   aimed at letting more people keep their plans We said to people If you had insurance that you liked you could keep it she said on the Senate floor We didnt say If you had insurance that you liked that didnt meet the minimum standards or met the minimum standards you could keep it We just said and the president said over and over If you have insurance and you like the insurance you have you can keep it That is the single focus of my bill On Tuesday former President Bill Clinton whos been dubbed the explainer in chief for the health law added his backing I personally believe even if it takes a change in the law that the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they got he said in an interview with the   Even President Obama himself has hinted that he wants to do something about the problem of people getting their policies canceled I am deeply concerned about it he told   last week and I have assigned my team to see what we can do to close some of the holes and gaps in the law So far though the administration hasnt proposed anything specific for those people in the individual insurance market getting cancellation notices And theres a good reason for that say industry experts The bottom line is that its simply too late to undo those canceled policies Its not at all feasible says Robert Laszewski president of the consulting firm   It would be wonderful Im one of the people who got my policy canceled I would like to keep it but we cant get that fix in place in  days That  days is between now and Jan  when the new standards under the Affordable Care Act kick in Laszewski says the insurance industry has spent most of the past year getting ready for this Theyve rewritten policies gotten them approved by state regulators and found and updated information with their policyholders Even if you decide to go never mind about all these cancellations he says how is the insurance company going to send out letters to all these people within the space of a couple of weeks rejigger all of their computer systems that took months to redo in the first place and get these people to decide whether they want to try for Obamacare which is the only place they can get subsidies or try to stay on their own policies Joel Ario managing director at the consulting firm   isnt quite so negative He says that just this week in California two   to offer some existing plans at least temporarily But thats a bit of a different situation he says because they settled with the states insurance commissioner Their earlier cancellations were not proper under California law says Ario and they are extending their policies  in one case by another couple months and in another case by three months So clearly it can be done by the carriers to extend current coverages But Ario who earlier headed the federal governments health exchange program says if the insurance companies did everything correctly it wouldnt be fair to require them to extend their current policies at their current rates If they were to continue coverages they would ask for a rate increase he says Typically in the individual market there are significant rate increases on a yeartoyear basis Many people would actually do better financially in the exchanges with a tax credit Ario says rather than stick with their current policy with an inflation increase They just dont realize that because they havent been able to get on the website yet to see Which brings the question back to where the Affordable Care Act has been since October Can the federal government get its balky website up and running at full strength fast enough for a critical mass of those canceled policyholders to figure out they might be OK after all
