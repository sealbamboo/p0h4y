Today more than    that huge glut of people born between  and   is unmarried And those unmarried boomers are   As this vast generation rushes into retirement theres a growing concern among experts on aging Who will take care of all these people when theyre too old to care for themselves Its a question many of the experts take personally   is what scares me says Sara Rix who works for the   studying the economic prospects of women in the workforce Because I am one of those people she says and I do think about it Oh Ive got wonderful nieces and nephews Rix says noting thats what a lot of her boomer peers claim too Well in fact theyve got their families Theyve got their inlaws Theyve got their parents And I dont think its reasonable to expect much out of them Kathleen Kelly who runs the   says shes seeing the same sort of concern in her social circle Im in my s and my friends are all talking about Could we all move in together Could we buy an apartment building and all live together There are all sorts of permutations of this conversation Kelly says But it really is something that people are thinking about particularly women And because boomers are boomers some are doing more than just thinking about it Already theres a small but apparently growing movement of boomer women forming group houses with their single peers One of those homes belongs to Bonnie Moore a something divorcee who lives in a wellkept fivebedroom house in Bowie Md a cozy suburb of Washington DC To stay in her house after her divorce Moore needed financial help But she wanted to do more than just add boarders who would help pay the bills she says The home shes organized instead is a little bit like family a little bit like roommates a little bit like a sorority house she says from the sofa of her softly lit living room It just evolves Moore an attorney isnt actually childless She has a grown son who lives in Utah and has been urging Moore to move there to be closer to him and his family Hes just sort of saying Well Mom youre old now we have to take care of you  Moore says And Im saying Im not old Ive got  years out there in my yard thank you very much  she says with a laugh Moore has been careful about selecting as housemates women who get along but who also have a sense of independence All of us we have our own separate lives she says We do our own separate things but well meet up in the kitchen and chitchat And then well all go our different ways which makes it nice None of us are joined at the hip and yet we all live together and do our own thing and live in the same house Lorene Solivan is one of Moores three current roommates  the youngest Solivan says proudly having just turned  Solivan an event manager for a food company had been living in an apartment in Northern Virginia But she was having financial troubles of her own and was looking to downsize And then I saw the ad on Craigslist GOLDEN GIRLS HOUSE I said Oh that looks like fun  she says Solivan who does much of the groups cooking says its been a nice transition for her To live with a builtin social group of people your own age is a big plus she says whether youre   or   whatever the case may be Thats why Moore is trying to take her concept and expand it She already has a   and is working on a guide to help other single boomer women set up houses like hers I think itll be fun she says And Id like to be part of various seminars and workshops for women about the whole idea of living communally and learning to get along in this kind of environment Still there are a lot of obstacles One big one is that most boomers dont realize they might need help getting or paying for longterm care if their health falters I call it the  conundrum says Bruce Chernof president and CEO of   which focuses on longterm health care issues Seventy percent of people over the age of  will need some form of longtermcare supports as they age he says But when you look at polling roughly  percent of Americans dont actually think theyre likely to need it and roughly  percent think Medicare will probably cover it when they get there The problem of course he adds is that those last two  percents are not true Then theres the numbers problem We know that  about a third of baby boomers are single says Kelly But we also know that theres a large percentage of those that are in their s and s who are getting divorced and so were going to have more single individuals in the future We just havent seen this before At the same time most boomers have had fewer children than previous generations did and many boomers have no children So theres less adult children to take the place of the caregiving cohort that currently is providing  caregiving to their parents she says And today family caregiving provides an estimated  billion a year worth of unpaid care Rix of AARP says a big problem for single boomer women is that theyre not financially prepared to hire the caregivers they might need if they dont have family members to volunteer the time These single women are still likely to be concentrated in what weve traditionally called the pink collar jobs she says which are the lowerwage lowbenefit occupations So when they reach old age they often reach old age without pension coverage Most of these women will have Social Security Rix says  assuming that they are eligible and that the rules dont change between now and when they retire But for many older women that will be all or nearly all the money they have to live on she says and its not going to pay for a lot of care  formal care So its a frightening future for a lot of women There are things women can do to make that future a little less frightening says Kelly Some suggestions are pretty obvious like maintaining a healthy active lifestyle But another bit of advice may be less intuitive Kelly says and that is to invest in social relationships and networks She doesnt mean the sort of social networks people create on the Internet but rather a community of individuals living with or near you so that you may be able to share tasks and responsibilities as you grow older That brings us back to Bonnie Moore who says that deciding to form a group house was about more than just financial necessity I think women naturally are more community oriented Moore says Its just part of the womans nature And besides she adds to come home and have someone say Hi how was your day  Thats really nice sometimes So if youre a boomer and you liked that group house you shared in college or just after good for you The United States is one of the few developed nations that have no organized public policy for providing longterm care  so group living may be in your future as well as your past
