Underneath the charm of Marthas Vineyards picturesque beaches peaceful woods and luxury homes is a problem Since August there have been six overdose deaths on the island Thats a phenomenal rate for a community of  people  and thats not to mention the overdoses that havent been fatal says Charles Silberstein an addiction specialist and psychiatrist at Marthas Vineyard Hospital Weve had overdoses for years but I dont think weve ever seen this kind of number or frequency The frequency of arrests for heroin and other opioids has also increased in this leafy community There was one heroin arrest on the island in  last year there were  Also in  there were  arrests for prescription painkillers last year there were  Its bad Once you see people on the Percocet pills or the heroin it really takes over their lives says Detective Sgt Chris Dolby of the Edgartown Police Department There are some areas on the island that police have been keeping an eye on Dolby says including a secluded beach where he says fishermen regularly find syringes The shell fishermen come down here every morning and there has been a bunch of needles found on a number of occasions here Very secluded he says Theyll buy out on the street come back here and hide and shoot up Dolby also blames drugs for an uptick in crime House breakins by thieves looking for pills have increased he says More police and jail officers are hired every summer for the high season but Dolby and others expect that resources will be stretched this year Maj Sterling Bishop deputy superintendent at the local jail says the busy season brings out a certain mindset The summer here is a totally different beast People come out and its all about making money Whether its opiates or selling Tshirts or selling whatever its all about the fast buck Bishop says Those struggling with drugs say that atmosphere helps fuel the cycle of addiction Of the twodozen inmates at the Marthas Vineyard jail  percent are there for crimes related to opioid use Benjamin Fogg  of Edgartown Mass spoke about the problem as he was being released from the jail on a drugrelated crime Ive been incarcerated for  months now he says Part of the issue Fogg says is economics He says dealers know they can sell heroin on the island for double  sometimes triple  the price they can get on the mainland If he wanted to he says it wouldnt take him long to find heroin Not even having a cellphone or a dollar in my pocket probably  to  minutes Business leaders maintain that the opioid problem has not changed the island Nancy Gardella executive director of the Marthas Vineyard Chamber of Commerce says its still a safe idyllic place We are a microcosm of the world so whatever is happening in the world is happening on Marthas Vineyard But the community works very hard to create a sense of eyes wide open  Gardella says Neighbors will report things nobody looks the other way and the businesspeople Ive talked to have a zero tolerance Business people she says have had to fire workers or refer employees to addiction treatment But that can be a challenge There is no detox stabilization facility on Marthas Vineyard so those most in need of help often have to leave paradise to get it
