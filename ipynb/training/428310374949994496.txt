When Texas teen  Saturday her father Joe called the yearold a miracle Doctors who treat traumatic injuries arent disagreeing  Considering the bone and soft tissue damage that would occur from a fall from this height the fact that she is alive and seemingly doing well really is quite miraculous  said Dr Michael Anderson a pediatric critical care specialist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland Wethington is one lucky teen The trauma surgeon who first treated Mackenzie in the ER didnt expect her to survive Im glad to be wrong about that Dr Jeffrey Bender of the University of Oklahoma Medical Center in Oklahoma City said Tuesday at a news conference  Currently Wethington is awake and breathing on her own and is listed in fair condition We see worse injuries routinely from car and ATV accidents said trauma surgeon Dr Jason Lees who is part of the Oklahoma team treating Wethington Theres a reason we wear parachutes when we step out of a plane Amazingly Wethington who suffered a lacerated liver and kidney broken teeth and multiple fractures throughout her body is expected to fully recover within about six to eight weeks Bender said Tuesday Her injuries are consistent with someone hit by a car going  mph although that doesnt mean she hit the ground at that speed he said According to the World Health Organization falls are the second leading cause of accidental or unintentional injury deaths worldwide Each year an estimated  individuals die from falls globally And it doesnt have to be a foot mishap  A person can take a fall from a standing height and the neck can break so this young girl is exceptionally fortunate in how the circumstances and force of the fall dissipated throughout her body said Dr Ryan Goodwin director of the Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Orthopedics at the Cleveland Clinic She is young and in seeming good health so she has that going for her But he adds she also had a lot of luck and physics on her side too When an individual falls from a great height survival often depends on a lot of luck as well as air resistance or drag  You can think of a fall as a form of energy explained James Kakalios the Taylor Distinguished Professor in the school of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Minnesota Basically if a person steps out of a plane you have no velocity Gravity will start to pull you down and you accelerate But as you gain speed air resistance comes into play and acts as a kind of brake slowing you down and reducing the amount of kinetic energy or in other words the force in which your body slams into the ground said Kakalios author of the Physics of Superheroes  He thinks the teen may have done some things accidentally to increase air drag slowing her fall and leading to a potentially softer yet still serious landing  Shes creating a lot of turbulence as she falling and therefore shes maximizing the time it takes for her to hit the ground he said citing that reducing the rate in which an object or person comes to a stop is critical for safety Thats why we have airbags Kakalios said citing other instances of people surviving long falls such as I W bridge collapse in Minneapolis in which  people were killed but  survived the foot fall and the case of man who survived after he fell  feet from a New York skyscraper Its noteworthy that people dont usually survive these things but some people do in the right set of circumstances he said Many people buy lottery tickets and dont win but theres always someone who does win
