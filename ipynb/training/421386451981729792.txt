Maybe your bucket list includes taking a hot air balloon ride Sounds lovely But before floating aloft please note that coming back to Earth can hurt Almost half of the  hot air balloon crashes reported from  to  in the US involved tourist flights and  percent of the  tourist crashes caused at least one serious or fatal injury a study finds Five people died The most common serious injury was lower body fractures according to   a graduate student at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who led the study People were having broken legs broken ankles Ballard told Shots Thats not surprising she says because hard landings were a factor in most of the crashes Collisions with fixed objects accounted for half of the serious injuries including trees power lines buildings and the ground Four of the deaths involved people ejecting from the gondola You talk to some people and they say Oh we just floated to the ground it was so great  Ballard says Then I imagine someone like my grandmother going on one of these and God forbid she breaks her leg or breaks her hip Ive only been ballooning once but I remember the landing as a mad scramble to get out of a basket that tipped on its side while being dragged on the ground Broken bones hadnt crossed my mind but its easy to see how that could happen Pilots are required to give passengers a preflight safety briefing but theyre not standardized for ballooning the way they are for the airlines So theres no way of knowing what people were told In two crashes pilots failed to give passengers helmets even though they were recommended by the balloons manufacturer Those crashes caused three head injuries one of which lead to the death of the pilot This may be quite enough to demolish your fantasy of floating with the breeze but it comes with a big caveat  no one knows how dangerous ballooning tours actually are Ballard gleaned this data from the National Transportation Safety Boards   Her results were   in   But theres no data on the number of balloon tour flights each year in the US so theres no way to know how often tour flights crash or the overall risk I suspect that these crashes are actually underreported Ballard says More recently  was not a good year in balloon tour safety In February a tourist balloon   over Luxor Egypt and crashed Nineteen people died In May three tourists died and more than  people were injured when   in Cappadocia Turkey If you are considering a flight Ballard says pay close attention to the safety briefing and wear a helmet Really understand the safety brief Ballard says Really understand whats going to happen during the highrisk situation which is the landing and be prepared to handle that Ballard got to wondering about balloon tour safety because she specializes in preventive medicine And shes also a pilot While serving as a Navy flight surgeon she flew   and heavy Marine helicopters During tours in Iraq and Afghanistan she also investigated crashes Shes currently in Peru studying childrens health as part of her doctoral research OK Dr Ballard whats it going to be Aviation safety or global health Im actually interested in both she says I really like getting to the root of a problem and making recommendation as far as safety and morbidity and mortality outcomes
