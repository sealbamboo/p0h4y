The maker of a  personal genome test blinked Silicon Valleys andMe   that it would comply with the Food and Drug Administrations demand that the company stop marketing healthrelated genetic tests People will still be able to pay andMe to have their DNA analyzed to learn about their ancestors And customers will get a file of their raw genetic info But while andMe tries to work things out with the FDA the company wont be telling people they have genetic profiles that predispose them to particular illnesses or predict their responses to prescription drugs In other words no more health claims We remain firmly committed to fulfilling our longterm mission to help people everywhere have access to their own genetic data and have the ability to use that information to improve their lives Anne Wojcicki cofounder and CEO of andMe said in a statement Our goal is to work cooperatively with the FDA to provide that opportunity in a way that clearly demonstrates the benefit to people and the validity of the science that underlies the test The company has a pretty deep regulatory hole to crawl out of The changes in andMes marketing come in the wake of a scathing warning letter the agency sent in late November The agency said then that it hadnt heard from the company since May and that andMe had failed to provide answers to a bunch of questions raised in  FDA also faulted andMe for failing to finish and in some cases even start studies discussed as long as five years ago that the agency said would be necessary to make a decision about the marketability of the companys personal genome services Advocates cried foul saying the agencys heavyhanded letter would stifle the development of personalized genomic information before it gets off the ground In a    this week FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg defended the agencys approach There may be a workaround On andMes Facebook page Susan Price Davis   for clarification of its new approach The company replied And with the raw data in hand motivated consumers will still be able to run health analyses using tools available online Erin Martijn another commenter on the Facebook thread   to   which uses a catalog of genetic variations to prepare a personalized genome report Its not as pretty as andMes health report charts but it works she said
