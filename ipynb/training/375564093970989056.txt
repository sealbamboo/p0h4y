Every month the Diagnosis column of The New York Times Magazine asks Well readers to try their hand at solving a diagnostic riddle Below you will find the details of a case involving a teenage gymnast who wakes up one morning to find her normally flat washboard stomach bloated and distended as if she were pregnant She has terrible diarrhea followed by months of intractable constipation Test results from the extensive workup done at three different hospitals can be reviewed As usual the first person to figure out the diagnosis gets a signed copy of my book Every Patient Tells a Story and the pleasure of figuring out a case that stumped many a specialist
