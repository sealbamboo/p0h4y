Health insurers are ending policies for what could turn out to be millions of Americans The moves have rattled consumers and stoked new debate about the health care law No one knows for sure right now how many of the estimated  million people who buy their own insurance are getting cancellation notices but the numbers appear to be big Some insurers report discontinuing  percent of their individual business while other insurers have notified up to  percent of policyholders that they will have to change plans Here are some questions and answers about whats going on See Kaiser Health News for   The health care law focused on the individual market because it hasnt worked well for many people particularly those who are older or have health problems People with preexisting conditions were often rejected for coverage charged more or had their conditions excluded from coverage Some policies provided only the barest of coverage when someone did fall ill Starting Jan  insurers cant reject people who are sick or charge them more than the healthy under the Affordable Care Act They must also beef up policies to meet minimum standards and add benefits such as prescription drug coverage maternity care and mental health services Most likely your plan didnt meet all the standards of the federal health law One type of policy being discontinued by Florida Blue for example didnt cover hospitalizations or emergency room visits and paid a maximum of  toward doctor visits Its possible your plan also had deductibles and other potential expenses  such as copayments for doctors and hospital care  that exceeded the laws annual outofpocket maximum of  for individuals or  for families Some policies that fail to meet the laws standards can still be sold but only if the insurer decides to continue them and they are grandfathered meaning they were purchased before March  and havent been changed substantially since then Kansas Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger said insurers can only discontinue entire blocks of business and cant pick and choose certain customers to cancel Those whose policies are canceled can sign up for a new plan and cant be rejected because of their health Insurers say they are ending policies that dont meet the laws standards or werent grandfathered In some states insurers are offering selected policyholders a chance to renew early meaning they can continue their existing plan through next year even if it doesnt meet all the laws standards If you choose this option your premium may still go up but the cause would be medical inflation rather benefits added because of the health law Not all states allow early renewals
