Free samples of prescription drugs may seem like a great deal for patients But even when doctors think theyre doing patients a favor by handing out the freebies the real beneficiaries are the drug manufacturers according to new research in the journal JAMA Dermatology Medical groups have grown increasingly wary about free drug samples and theyve already been banned by Kaiser Permanente many academic medical centers the Veterans Health Administration the US military and plenty of private medical clinics   say it encourages doctors to prescribe drugs that are more expensive and potentially less safeÂ  than the workhorse generics that are just as effective If the goal is to make costly medications available to lowincome and uninsured patients there are better ways they say Yet  billion worth of free samples were handed out to doctors in  according to the market research firm Cegedim Strategic Data   by American Medical News Among physicians dermatologists are particularly likely to give free samples to their patients A group of researchers from Stanford University took   at how those free samples might be influencing the prescriptions written by dermatologists They focused on prescriptions for patients with a new diagnosis of adult acne either acne vulgaris or rosacea Based on survey data from the   the researchers found that dermatologists were still enamored with free samples In   of all prescriptions they wrote came with a free sample up from  in  That was in marked contrast to doctors from other specialties Only  of their combined prescriptions were accompanied by a free sample in  down from  in  Dermatologists were especially likely to give free samples to their adult acne patients   of their prescriptions came with a free sample in  up from  in  Very often the drugs that were most frequently prescribed with a free sample were also the most frequently prescribed overall In  for instance the four acne medications most often prescribed with a free sample  Differin Duac Benzaclin and RetinA Micro  were the four mostprescribed acne drugs as well the researchers found Its not just that these four drugs were perennial favorites The list of top five acne drugs changed considerably between  and  according to the study But the favorites were usually closely aligned with the drugs that doctors had available for free in their offices In  nine of the  most popular acne drugs nationwide were either brandname drugs or branded generics which companies sell at a premium and free samples for them are typically available To get a sense of whether things would be different in the absence of free samples the researchers examined the prescribing behavior of dermatologists at an academic medical center that had a policy against freebies In this group nine of the  most popular acne drugs were lowcost generics which dont come with free samples Similarly in   of acne prescriptions in private practices were for namebrand or branded generic drugs compared with  of prescriptions written by the academic dermatologists Prescribing preferences are at least in part related to what is contemporaneously available as free samples the Stanford researchers wrote It doesnt seem that the free samples wound up saving patients much money Those who were seen in private practices walked away with prescriptions for  worth of medications on average while the patients treated at the academic medical center got prescriptions that cost about  to fill In other words the national mean retail cost of the prescriptions received at an office visit for acne is conservatively two imes higher compared with the AMC academic medical center where samples were unavailable the researchers concluded In   that accompanied the study three dermatologists noted that this pattern had been documented before A  study in the journal Medical Care found that patients seeking treatment for a variety of ailments   when they got free samples compared with patients who didnt But everyone pays since samples increase the cost of medicines for all patients by encouraging doctors to prescribe more expensive drugs they wrote The trio called on their fellow dermatologists and other physicians to steer clear of free samples Alongside those other inappropriate tools of drug marketing  sports tickets Caribbean junkets and free pens  samples belong not in dermatologists closets but in our dustbins    and like   on Facebook
