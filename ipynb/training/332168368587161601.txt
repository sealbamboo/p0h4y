Adults with older parents or even grandparents will soon be searching for suitable Mothers Day and Fathers Day gifts If these presents are not consumables  a box of chocolates or a bottle of spirits  then they will only enlarge the material convoy that accompanies Mom and Dad through their later years Older people want our love and affection but they probably dont need more stuff A  survey of Americans  and older found that   Fully  percent said that the thought of dealing with their things made them somewhat or very reluctant to think about moving  So why pile on more Instead I suggest that you help whittle things down by making yourself available to receive some belongings your elders would like to offload  Its a myth that older people cling to their possessions Of course they cherish certain things but most homes hold uncounted thousands of objects only some of them special My studies of household downsizing in Kansas City and Detroit reveal that    Transfers of possessions from older to younger family members normally require some occasion such as a wedding or graduation lest the gesture coming out of the blue be viewed with alarm Youre giving me the antique table Youre not planning on dying are you And the younger generations readiness to embrace whats on offer  the crystal the matched floor lamps the baseball card collection  cannot be assumed  But Mothers Day and Fathers Day afford the perfect occasions for the unqualified reception of stuff   You can approach this a few different ways For example write this in a Mothers Day card   Or you can suggest belongings she might give you Lest anyone accuse you of stripping the shelves propose things that live deep in the recesses of the home vacation videos excess flowerpots sporting goods or longignored books Stuff in the basement the attic the closets the shed the garage   Ask for photo albums now while elders can still tell you who all those people are Suggest nothing that like the tufted family rocking chair will set off World War III among your siblings In fact siblings can organize themselves to receive things as a group thereby forestalling the charge of having taken unfair advantage  Another technique Wrap an empty box as a present with a note inside that says Fill me please The gift will initially seem puzzling but this becomes your chance to explain your intentions And if the box is eventually filled and passed back to you empty it and begin the cycle again The transfers might become a habit  If you try this for Mothers Day your father will almost certainly ask whether you are going to pull the same thing next month For you especially would be a good reply  When the jewelry random houseplants random hand tools and back issues of National Geographic come you can archive curate sell donate or regift them All you need at the moment of exchange is a smile and the promise that you know just the right place for these things Leave it at that  The lookingglass nature of human connection means that receiving is giving that taking things is a gesture of generosity Honor your mother and father by welcoming their things no matter what and then welcoming yet more
