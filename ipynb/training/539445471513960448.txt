So whats the best way for HIV discordant couples like the Hartmanns to have children Its a question being asked more often as people with HIV are living somewhat normal lives with the disease and perhaps getting married and wanting to start a family It is something at the top of mind on this   which this year is focused on achieving an AIDSfree generation   The CDC estimates there are  mixedstatus heterosexual couples but that number is based on a  study  experts say the number is much higher today The Hartmanns are open about their journey to parenthood because they hope others will benefit from their experience Dan Hartmann was diagnosed with HIV when he was  infected by contaminated blood products he received as treatment for hemophilia a rare genetic blood disorder It was scary Dan remembers There was definitely a time period  toward the end of high school college you know I wasnt sure I would be here now            It was the s and AIDS was all over the news So was the story of an HIVpositive teen named Ryan White who was expelled from his high school in Russiaville Indiana after revealing he had the disease   In Annapolis Maryland ninth grader Dan Hartmann was telling his school he too was HIV positive Susan Slingluff was in the gym when Hartmann and his father a physician spoke to the school Its OK to touch him Its OK to share your pencil with him Its OK to drink from the water fountain You can use the same lavatory she remembers being told The discussion laid the groundwork for her connection to the HIV community Susan and Dan went to prom together and then lost touch Six years passed before Dan called Susan out of the blue That phone call lasted two hours and sparked a bicoastal relationship Eventually Dan relocated from Syracuse New York to San Francisco to be with Susan They bought a house and got married Susan dreamed of having children But how I was  and it wasnt immediately needed so I just knew that we would start asking questions and do the research and figure out what we were going to do Susan says Susan read everything she could find about how a heterosexual married couple with one HIV partner could make a family but couldnt find answers Not in research and not from their own health care providers I dont think that doctors didnt want to share it I just think they didnt have it Susan says Were just not the usual clientele In March  the couple testified at a California Senate Health Committee hearing to repeal a law banning assisted reproduction techniques using HIVinfected sperm The law was repealed and through the process they met experts who had the answers they were seeking Over dinner one night one such expert made a suggestion the Hartmanns describe as shocking having unprotected sex Because Dan had an undetectable viral load and they were in a monogamous relationship the physician explained the risk of Susan becoming infected with HIV from unprotected sex with her husband was low Susan says it was somewhere between a  in  and  in  chance every time It wouldnt mean throwing away the condoms This was timed according to Susans ovulation on her most fertile days theyd try They decided to try this approach for a few months If either one of them changed their mind at any point they would stop You check in and youre like Im feeling really nervous about this today are you still OK with this And vice versa Dan says Some days he woke up reminding himself that Susan was more likely to get struck by lightning than to become infected this way Other days hed wake up wondering what on earth they were doing After five tries in two months Susan was pregnant The excitement was building but it was too early to breathe a sigh of relief They still didnt know if Susan was infected with HIV At three months Susans test results came back negative which tempered concerns as they shared the news of Susans pregnancy with family and friends Subsequent tests at six and nine months were also negative At that point they knew their daughter would be OK Now  Ryan is healthy and happy just like her mom She loves My Little Pony swimming and even likes green vegetables She doesnt know that her parents might be considered pioneers by some  that theyve paved the way for other HIV discordant couples She knows her dad has hemophilia and takes medicine Theyll explain the rest later Susan and Dan say Susan insists it wasnt about luck she says their decision was supported by science Dan agrees Its sort of like getting in the car We wore our seat belts It would have been more shocking for Susan to have gotten HIV than to have not he says Susan doesnt think about HIV every day She says its like a third silent partner in their marriage The Hartmanns may decide to expand their family and if they do they will see what science says at the time They say they may decide to take the same approach Or Dan says when the time comes they may try assisted reproduction  For now Dan is living the life he once thought hed never live to see Hell get to die of a heart attack in his s Susan jokes just like everyone else
