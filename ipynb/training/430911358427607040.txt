The NHS in England has changed for the better in the year since the Francis Inquiry the health secretary says The report published on  February last year accused the NHS system of betraying the public over the Stafford Hospital scandal The criticisms led to a series of changes including a new inspection regime and tougher measures for failing hospitals Jeremy Hunt will say later these moves are making a difference Addressing a health conference in London he will also point to data from the Health and Social Care Information Centre from October   the latest available information  which shows the number of hospital nurses has been risen by more than  in the past  months to top  Although data from the centre also shows that overall nurse numbers  once those employed outside of hospitals is taken into account  have fallen since the last election Mr Hunt will say Twelve months on we cannot expect to have solved everything or have completely transformed the culture of the countrys largest and finest institution But we have seen a real shift in priorities  new inspections more nurses and a stronger voice for patients with compassionate care starting to replace tickbox targets as the major focus on boards and wards Since the report was published  hospitals have been placed in special measures  with management either replaced or supported to make improvements A new post of chief inspector of hospitals has been created and the Care Quality Commission has overhauled the way it inspects hospitals This is leading to a new Ofstedstyle rating system that will be rolled out later this year What is more from April hospitals will have to publish staffing levels on wards and state whether they fall short of recommended numbers But Labour focused on the overall nurse figures which had shown a drop Shadow health minister Jamie Reed said This winter hes left the NHS facing an AE crisis with thousands fewer nurses It is yet more proof that you cant trust the Tories with the NHS Royal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said there had been some good news But he added We are also not seeing nursing staff spread evenly across the health system  we have severe shortages in mental health and in the community and district nurse numbers are down which is very worrying and has many knockon effects We need to see the government put forward a longterm vision for workforce planning and make sure NHS patients get the care they deserve wherever they receive it The inquiry was chaired by Robert Francis QC following events at Stafford Hospital
