Lack of a proper national policy to get UK children to do more exercise amounts to mass child neglect the British Journal of Sports Medicine says  An editorial in the magazine says successive governments have failed to implement a comprehensive national policy to promote childrens exercise  A sedentary lifestyle risks storing up health and other problems it argues Former Childrens Minister Tim Loughton called the comments alarmist and unhelpful   The editorial says that despite a wealth of evidence showing the immediate and longterm benefits of regular exercise in childhood and the expanding waistlines of UK children leadership and strategy on the issue are totally absent Coauthor Dr Richard Weiler a consultant in sport and exercise medicine at University College London and club doctor at West Ham football club said There has been a persistent failure from this government and former governments to meet childrens basic physical and psychological needs  He told BBC Radios Today programme that this failure meets the governments own definition of child neglect  He called the level of finance allocated to promote physical activity among children pitiful   He said schools had a key role to play in promoting physical activity as children dont choose who their parents are     At the moment there is no statutory obligation for schools even to provide physical activity and physical literacy and Ofsted dont monitor it he added  But Mr Loughton said I dont know if the British Journal of Sports Medicine is trying to promote a Christmas special but this sort of sensationalist story is really unhelpful  I agree we need to do much more for kids and sport making it a part of their growing up something that they want to do because its fun and enjoyable as well as being good for them  but child neglect is a persistent failure to meet a childs basic physical and psychological needs resulting in serious impairment of health and that is a world of difference from kids not doing enough sport Is Dr Weiler suggesting we should be taking millions more children into the care of the state Because thats not the solution  Mr Loughton said he agreed with Dr Weilers diagnosis but accused him of alarmist finger wagging adding that parents also had a role to play and that making sport and physical activity mandatory in schools risked putting children off from a very early age    He added the governments programme for the School Games a national competition for elite young athletes would promote more physical activity and sport and had already proved a tremendous success    But Dr Weiler said it was naive and shortsighted to focus on sport rather than physical activity showing a lack of understanding of childrens heath and wellbeing and their development  The editorial calls for current and future governments and educational bodies to act to create a comprehensive childcentred physical activity policy to give children from all backgrounds and sporting abilities every opportunity to be active on a daily basis
