More than  million people are dying prematurely every year from air pollution in China according to a new analysis This is the highest toll in the world and it really reflects the very high levels of air pollution that exist in China today says Robert OKeefe of the   in Boston who presented the findings in Beijing this week Alarm   in recent years about the air in China On many days in many cities its thick with smog When you get off the airplane if you were to travel to Beijing you would immediately feel your eyes stinging and your throat rasping says   director of the Natural Resources Defense Councils China program based in Beijing Its so bad that people commonly walk the streets wearing masks Parents wont let their kids play outside There are many days where we cannot see the building across the street she says Its a pea soup of pollution OKeefe and other researchers decided to take a closer look at   about the worlds health problems that was released in December by the journal   They found that in China approximately  million people die prematurely from exposure to outdoor air pollution In fact about twothirds of all the deaths from air pollution are now occurring in Asia most of them in China And air pollution has become the fourth leading cause of death in China For the most part the air pollution effects are generally manifested in frail populations  people with asthma are generally more susceptible to the effects of air pollution OKeefe says Also the very young and children who live in highly polluted areas for extended periods of time The main reason air pollution is such a huge and growing problem is clear Chinas explosive growth Cars are being added and trucks are being added to the streets in major cities at record numbers Power plants burn significant amounts of very lowgrade coal and the energy consumption in China is rising dramatically OKeefe says But he says there are hints the government is starting to take the issue more seriously Just the fact that the government allowed OKeefe to present his report at an open forum in the nations capital is promising he says There was a large amount of Chinese media there I was very encouraged by that he says And I think its another signal that the government is serious about beginning to engage on this very significant public health problem The government also recently started doing something else to acknowledge the problem Theyve put in place  and this is quite remarkable  a nationwide monitoring network that is reporting in real time levels of air pollution OKeefe says So for the first time the Chinese government is providing transparent levels of air pollution that the public can actually see Others agree that the new public monitoring system is a sign of progress Only a few years ago people just didnt realize what was happening I remember going down the street and people saying Very foggy day today  Finamore says They didnt recognize that it was smog and certainly deadly smog until that information started becoming available on a realtime basis Finamore is encouraged by other steps the government is taking including efforts to clean up exhaust from cars and trucks and cut sulfur dioxide from   power plants in half So I think the tide has turned in China The government recognizes that the people are demanding cleaner air cleaner water cleaner food And they have at least said they are going to do something about it she says But Finamore says the key will be whether the government follows through on its promises to start cleaning up Chinas filthy air
