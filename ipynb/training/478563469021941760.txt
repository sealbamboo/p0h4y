SAN RAFAEL Calif  Pam Ross showed up at Ponsfords Place Bakery  Innovation Center at  pm sharp just minutes after the owner Craig Ponsford put out the sidewalk bread man sculpture that alerts customers Pizza night is on  Its just healthy Ms Ross said of the thincrust pizzas made with wholemilled locally grown wholewheat flour Theres nothing white about it nothing processed I dont eat pastries but Ill eat these Ponsfords Place is part of a new movement in whole grains Led by groups like the Oaklandbased organization   the grains are grown locally and consist of varieties unlike most of the flour available today The Californiagrown grains are milled without ever separating the germ the embryo of a grain kernel and the bran the protective outer layer  Customers swear by the difference After eating this pizza I dont feel like Ive eaten wet lead said Deborah Stapleton who tries hard not to miss a Ponsford pizza night This being Marin County Ms Stapleton is also among the regulars who bring their pizza boxes from last time for reuse Currently most of the flour we get is processed by industrialscale roller milling that removes a wheat kernels nutrientrich germ and bran turning the remaining endosperm  the starchy least nutritious part  into white flour Many of todays products that are labeled whole wheat are made with this refined flour with the germ and bran added back in The only requirement for a product to be labeled whole grain is that the three parts be represented in their natural proportions  This industrial milling many healthy food advocates argue is taking its toll not just on our taste buds but on our health As the author Michael Pollan noted at a recent whole grains conference at Oliveto restaurant in Oakland in March which some referred to as the Woodstock of the whole grains movement every innovation in food processing improved human health  until we hit the roller mill  Whole grains include foods like brown rice quinoa oatmeal popcorn and whole wheat But the varieties of wheat we know are bred for a large easily separated endosperm so that they can best be refined By contrast this new system involves well a return to the old system Local farmers grow different wheat varieties and sell them to bakers who use inhouse mills The result is locally grown freshly milled freshly baked wholegrain products  Local grain economies are cropping up in a number of areas on a small scale such as The Mill in San Francisco and Becks Bakery in Humboldt County farther north Others include Hayden Flour Mills in Arizona the Maine Grain Alliance which is hosting its  Kneading Conference in July and The Bread Lab in Washington State which is hosting its  Grain Gathering in August The goal says Bob Klein the founder of Community Grains is to scale up so that it can be profitable for farmers and competitively priced for consumers We want it to be a true alternative to an industrial economy he said  Eating whole grains has been linked to better health in numerous studies including a reduced risk of Type  diabetes heart disease and some cancers Whole grains is the single greatest indicator of overall health that I have ever seen said David Jacobs a public health professor at the University of Minnesota  But few studies have been conducted on these minimally processed whole grains largely because it is hard to get funding for studies that are about whole foods rather than isolated nutrients researchers involved with the movement say Some researchers suggest that the whole kernel with bran and germ intact may have a synergistic effect in which benefits  such as improved control of blood sugar levels  are greater than the sum of the constituent parts David Killilea a staff scientist in the Nutrition and Metabolism Center at Childrens Hospital Oakland Research Institute says that boosting the percentage of whole grains of any kind in the diet may blunt ones overall exposure to gluten Gluten is predominantly found in the endosperm but the germ and bran contain many other proteins that may lower the likelihood of gut irritation Dr Killilea says Refined flour discards these protective components of wheat  Someone with celiac disease would still not be able to tolerate whole grains he says but some people who say they are gluten sensitive have reported that they can enjoy breads made from whole grains Dr Killilea recently began a collaboration with The Bread Lab to assess how the milling process might affect a persons sensitivity to gluten Public health professionals have struggled for years to get people to eat more whole grains without much success A paper published last year in The Journal of Nutrition noted that the top barriers to consumption of whole grains included color price texture and taste The authors write the products benefit no one if they fail to provide the taste profile consumers expect  Thats where many in the new whole grains movement are stepping in By hosting wheat tastings and helping farmers breed different varieties of wheat Community Grains is introducing people not only to new tastes but also to terroir the sense of place dear to French winemakers  Once you have a chocolatechip cookie with wholewheat flour you never go back said Sherry Yard a former executive pastry chef for Wolfgang Puck who also bakes with Community Grains flour She notes its layers of flavors and beautiful richness  In  she revamped Spagos entire menu to whole grains I crossed my fingers on opening night thinking Im gonna get hung on Sunset Boulevard Ms Yard said Instead No one missed it Now heading up Culinary Direction at iPic Entertainment Ms Yard is planning to open her own shop next year in Los Angeles Helms Bakery where whole grains will take center stage
