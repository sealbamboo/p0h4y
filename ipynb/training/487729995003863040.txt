In the course of trying to understand a laboratory accident involving anthrax officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stumbled upon another major blunder  involving a deadly flu virus The flu incident apparently posed no health risk but it went unreported to top brass for six weeks Those officials now recognize a   in their worldclass laboratory And these incidents are raising broader questions about the safety of highsecurity germ labs The flu incident started earlier this year when scientists at the US Department of Agriculture asked the CDC for samples of an ordinary flu virus for some experiments But the USDA scientists noticed the virus wasnt behaving as they expected On close inspection they determined that it actually contained a deadly flu strain called HN Everything we know today suggests there was no human exposure  the materials are all either destroyed or contained says Dr   director of the CDC But he found the incident distressing The CDCs flu lab has a sterling reputation and to me the fact that something like this could happen in such a superb laboratory is unsettling It suggests deeper safety problems at the CDC Frieden also said he was disturbed that he didnt learn about the incident until this week  even though the error came to light six weeks ago Its very important to have a culture of safety that says if youve got a problem talk about it he said at a news conference As Frieden dug deeper into this incident  and into a similar recent case in which anthrax was mishandled  he reviewed six lab errors over the years that stemmed from failures in CDC safety procedures He says each time people fixed the smaller problem at hand without realizing that there was a deeper problem in the systems designed to reduce the risk of laboratory errors Frieden today announced a series of actions to address the bigger problem including a moratorium on moving material out of the CDCs highestsecurity labs and a safety review that includes outside experts One bit of more positive news is that an accident   last month apparently did not end up exposing anyone to this deadly germ Scientists who discovered the problem were concerned that some anthrax spores might have survived a chemical treatment designed to kill it  but subsequent tests suggest its unlikely any did Even so dozens of workers at the CDC had been put at risk and some took a potent antibiotic to protect themselves just in case That stressful accident is something that I feel terrible about and I wish had not happened Frieden said Its fortunate that these have not posed a real safety risk to either laboratory workers or the general public but they could have says   who is with the American Society for Microbiology and is a professor at the University of Louisville He says its a stark reminder to lab workers everywhere that you can get lulled into a sense of complacency even when working with dangerous materials  an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health takes that concern one step further I dont think this is a CDC problem  I think the CDC is being open about what has happened in several instances there Lipsitch says But their own prior research has shown that around the country in highcontainment laboratories there are errors on almost a weekly basis Those apparently havent ended up causing big problems he says in part because most of the microbes in question dont spread very easily The problem is that now people are starting do experiments with much more contagious pathogens particularly making novel contagious strains of flu and the human error factor cant be reduced Lipsitch says As a result he and other scientists are calling for this type of research to be reined in
