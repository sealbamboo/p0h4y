Many years ago I spent a lunch hour in a doctors dining room eavesdropping on two whitecoated men of a certain age idly discussing a colleague who worked at the city hospital next door While they themselves saw mostly insured patients she worked exclusively among the destitute a de facto onewoman charitable health organization Most of the hospital community thought she was a saint These two doctors to put it mildly were not impressed Its easy to do that kind of work one concluded putting down his napkin and standing up The hard thing is taking care of patients who are exactly like you That thought has stayed with me through the years rearing up at odd moments when I am fed up with a patient or a patient is disgusted with me when one female patient balks at a referral to a male gynecologist and the next specifically requests one Just last month it surfaced when I came across a picture of a smiling vet examining a small white dog Sometimes that seems like the only viable place to wield a stethoscope  over a soft fuzzy nonhuman chest Professional training may not remove the interpersonal chemistry that binds us to some and estranges us from others but it can neutralize these forces somewhat enough to enable civilized and productive dialogue among all comers Yet until the day when we deal only in cells organs and genes and not their human containers we will for better or worse always see ourselves in some patients our friends and relatives in others and our patients will likewise instinctively experience doctor as mother or father buddy or virtual stranger Are the ties that bind us for better medically or are they for worse Is health care more effective when patient and doctor are the same  the same sex class race tax bracket sore feet and   level Or does essential objectivity require some differences When your doctor looks at you and sees a mirrored reflection is that good for you or bad Anecdotes abound One woman loves her gynecologist because she knows just how I feel Another hates the same gynecologist because she thinks she knows everything The subject of discord was   the doctor uttering the fatal phrase Theyre just not all that bad That was it for the second patient off to a man whose reactions would presumably be governed by sympathetic imagination not personal experience Most of the research into imagination versus experience looks at the easiest parameters to measure sex and race In the world of gynecology a recent article summarizing a decades worth of polling data concluded that   although not because they were united in sisterhood but because they communicated better Another group of researchers found that when   for a general medical visit the visits were longer and friendlier and patients were a tiny bit happier But when it comes to actual health outcomes the results are all over the place One study found that having a   with good   control  the important thing was whether the patient trusted the doctor regardless of either ones race Another found that   when they were prescribed by a black doctor but the same did not hold true for Asians and Asian doctors Yet another looked at   finding that diet advice was deemed significantly more trustworthy when dispensed by a larger doctor But having a   did not seem to help patients lose weight And those are just the externals The fallacy that undermines all this research as well as the reasoning of the two sagacious commentators in the Doctors Dining Room is the assumption that measurable variables define people and their interactions Impossible to measure and hence impossible to study are the real cues  the twitch of a lip or turn of phrase  that tell two humans they are members of the same psychic quasi species You walk down a medical office corridor and a low hum of conversation can be heard from all the rooms but one From that one come howls of laughter as two happily compatible humans bond over the Mets the stock market the difficulty of finding size  extranarrow shoes Do these two soul mates also bond over medications tests disease management Or are the medical subjects elided and minimized lost in the general flow of good feeling We know that pairings between likeminded individuals make life worth living and populate the planet We assume they make health care a more pleasant process What they do to its outcome we have no clue
