On a hot July day last summer I was lying on the beach at Coney Island with my younger brother when he noticed a dark mole on the back of my arm You should really get that checked at the dermatologist he said in a worried tone It turned out that the mole on my arm was fine but another one on my cheek was basal cell skin cancer A few weeks later I had surgery to remove it and left the plastic surgeons office with a inch scar sloping down my right cheek Friends and colleagues were surprised to see the scar because I was only  Even the medical resident who attended my operation said I was the youngest skin cancer patient she had met But as I learned more about skin cancer I discovered that it is becoming increasingly common especially among young women A   found that melanoma the most serious type had increased eightfold for women under  since    There is this thought that It wont happen to me because Im young but thats not true anymore said Dr Jerry Brewer a dermatologist at the Mayo Clinic and an author of the study Experts say that tanning beds are a major factor behind the increase in all three types of skin cancer for young women More than  million people use tanning beds each year and   are young white women who are at increased risk of developing skin cancer The lamps in tanning beds can give off  to  times the UVA radiation of normal sun exposure accelerating the process of skin damage Instead of getting skin cancer  or  years down the line many young women are getting it  or  years later Dr Brewer said  Though I have never used a tanning bed my dermatologist said I had an unlucky trio of risk factors fair skin and blue eyes an upbringing in Texas where I spent long days in the sun growing up and a family history of skin cancer My grandmother and aunt had melanoma and survived and my mother had basal cell carcinoma too While more than three million cases of basal and squamous cell carcinoma are diagnosed each year only about  people a year die from these nonmelanoma skin cancers Melanoma is a far more ominous diagnosis causing about  deaths each year in the United States Dr Darrell Rigel a dermatology professor at NYU Langone Medical Center says that every month at his New York practice about two women in their s are found to have early melanoma a dramatic rise from  years ago Once melanoma is the size of a dime there is a good chance that it has already spread and treatment may not work Dr Rigel said I know Im looking at a death sentence on their arm and they feel perfectly fine he said Its absolutely awful This year the  for tanning beds that require them to have labels warning that they are not recommended for people under  And in April   in passing a law to prohibit indoor tanning for those under  Even children can get melanoma A   found that the number of cases among children and adolescents has been increasing each year by about  percent  Another recent study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association found that while young women are more likely to be given a diagnosis of melanoma young men are more likely to die from it Researchers said the disparity was probably a consequence of behavioral tendencies   men are less likely to see a doctor or perform a skin selfexamination  and possibly biological differences as well My brush with skin cancer has certainly changed how I view the sun I dont want another scar  or worse a diagnosis of melanoma I wear a  SPF sunscreen on my face every day and bought several sunprotective longsleeve shirts to wear outdoors this summer I am visiting my dermatologist every three months for a full body scan One annual checkup is recommended for those without a previous diagnosis I returned to Texas in April for a friends wedding at a resort in the woods After a long winter in New York my husband and I were excited to go swimming at a pool near our cabin In the past I would have grabbed a lounge chair in the sun seeing it as the perfect opportunity to arrive at the ceremony with a sunkissed glow But this time I picked a chair under a wide umbrella Its just not worth it anymore  Even a few sunburns can significantly raise your risk of skin cancer Dr Brewer said Deciding how much sun you want to get is like asking how much cyanide you want in your breakfast cereal he said There is no amount of tan that is healthy
