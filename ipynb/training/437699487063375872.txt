A mysterious illness that mimics the worst symptoms of polio has infected as many as  children in California since  leaving them with paralyzed limbs doctors say The infections possibly caused by a virus are still very rare and theres no widespread cause for alarm But researchers say theyre concerned about the problem detected in kids ages  to  including up to  new cases since last summer Were seeing them throughout California said Dr Keith Van Haren a pediatric neurologist at Stanford Universitys Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital The farthest north is in the Bay Area and the farthest south is in San Diego In all of the cases the children developed sudden weakness in their limbs that couldnt be explained by more common causes such as GuillainBarre syndrome or botulism poisoning They all had been vaccinated against polio Van Haren and his colleagues have been working with the California Department of Public Health to track the illnesses At first there were just one or two cases but when it became clear there may be more the scientists decided to review a large database Californias Neurologic and Surveillance Testing program to see if there was a wider problem They found initial reports of five children all in the larger San Francisco Bay Area who had unexplained paralysis between August  and July  Two of the children tested positive for human enterovirus which previously had been associated with poliolike symptoms but three did not HEV is a rare form of very common enteroviruses which cause between  million and  million infections in the US every year according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Like polio infections most enterovirus cases cause no symptoms or only mild illness but a fraction of cases can turn terribly serious Polio infections once paralyzed up to  people a year in the US mostly children until a vaccine eradicated the disease in the US and   worldwide Similar enterovirus outbreaks have caused poliolike symptoms in children in Asia and Australia the researchers said The chance of infection remains very rare Van Haren said He urged parents of children with unexplained limb weakness to contact their doctors Health officials in California will continue to track the problem he added It does represent a rather distinct increase in what weve seen historically he said This is something different
