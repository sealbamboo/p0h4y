One of the biggest challenges American hospitals face right now is moving to electronic medical records from oldfashioned paper files The switch is costing tens of billions of dollars eating up tons of staff time and its especially tough for the countrys  rural and smalltown hospitals Rural hospitals are typically short on cash and people with information technology skills So a lot of small hospitals are turning to bigger hospitals for help and giving up some independence in exchange The bed Beartooth Billings Clinic in Red Lodge Mont is one hospital that did Red Lodge a historic mining town just outside Yellowstone National Park is about  miles west of Billings On a recent spring day the only thing slowing cars on Main Street in Red Lodge is a flock of wild turkeys strutting across the pavement Just days before though the road was covered with two feet of snow Getting in and out of Red Lodge can be a real problem as   knows He lives just a few miles from Beartooth Billings Clinic at the hospital here There was a time that the nurses wont let me forget he says I drove my tractor to work one day because I couldnt get my truck here I had to plow with the tractor all the way to the hospital and I just kept it here On days like that Oley and his patients are particularly grateful for his hospitals electronic medical records He can share patient information instantly and securely with the big hospital in Billings and get expert advice whenever he needs it We see a lot of patients who are able to not have to travel or see specialists or do different things because we can just take care of it here Oley says Sharing electronic records sounds simple But for a lot of little hospitals doing that while meeting new   means coming up with  million or more up front Thats a tall order when the average rural hospital runs at a financial loss of  percent a year So the Red Lodge hospital became part of the bigger Billings Clinic system in part to get help with IT When hospitals align or merge they give up some or maybe all control of their operations  everything from which records system theyll use to which doctors and services are available where But affiliating with a big network often has benefits and can improve the care available in small towns Scott Duke with the Billings Clinic system says a lot of small hospitals are weighing tradeoffs like Red Lodges in return for help for EMRs To almost everyone we talk to the EMR is right there as a top concern Duke says But for many rural hospitals its a point of pride and matter of survival to stay independent and make their own decisions about the future A fourhour drive west from Red Lodge the little town of Anaconda Mont sits in a fold of steep mountains and lush forests The hospital there is a scrappy independent and a proven survivor Its got  beds and executive Meg Boynton says people in the area rely on it for everything from complex surgeries to routine care We average about  to  births a year she says This building opened in  The year before a giant copper smelter   leaving a lot of empty buildings in town The economy remains marginal Steve McNeece the hospitals CEO says it survives because they never get too comfortable Part of our goal and mission is to have a culture that embraces change and challenge he says McNeeces hospital unlike many in small towns can find the  million it needs to finance the digital upgrade He says its an obvious improvement over the old way they used to transfer patient information Put in a manilla folder and put it on the patients abdomen when theyre in the ambulance going to Saint Pats he laughs Anacondas hospital looks as though its going to be able to adopt the latest information technology and stay independent But its fate is still tied to bigger hospitals in the area It only makes sense for Anaconda to use the same records system as the places where the hospital refers patients for more specialized care That was really the main driver in our decisionmaking From a patient care perspective this seemed like a safe and wise decision says McNeece Whether rural hospitals choose to do their digital upgrade independently or partner with a bigger system its important they have a conscious digital strategy says Brock Slabach a vice president with the   Were very concerned about a digital divide that might be created going forward between the urban haves if you will and the rural havenots he says Slabach worries hundreds of hospitals arent meeting new digital benchmarks as time to take advantage of federal help is running out Starting this October hospitals that dont meet digital records standards will be hit with   which would make the digital leap even harder to pull off
