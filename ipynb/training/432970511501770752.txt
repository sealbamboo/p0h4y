No one would mistake Olga Kotelko for one of the   competing in Sochi Russia but at age  she holds more world records than most  to be exact including agegroup bests in the high jump the hammer throw and the meter run Not bad for someone who took up track and field at age  Bruce Grierson met Ms Kotelko in  while writing about her for   and swiftly became obsessed His interest was personal The title of his previous book UTurn What If You Woke Up One Morning and Realized You Were Living the Wrong Life might also describe his mindset at the time He was  and had abruptly realized that he could no longer see his feet beneath his growing potbelly His stamina drive memory even the hair on his head were disappearing too Whatever was happening with her he writes in the prologue of his latest bookwas the opposite of what was happening to me If he could identify the reasons she was aging so well perhaps he could reset his own course Eventually they struck a deal We would explore the mystery of her together She would offer herself up to science while I took notes The result is this jolly book which follows the pair as they consult researchers in fields like gerontology   physiology and   for insights into Ms Kotelkos remarkable youthfulness What they find are countless opinions but little definitive proof Genes diet temperament the theories abound Mr Grierson rules out performanceenhancing drugs Or maybe its the exercise itself Research on twins suggests that heredity accounts for only about  percent to  percent of longevity so it is not enough simply to label Ms Kotelko a genetic freak Besides tests show she lacks at least one gene associated with longevity and it turns out that her telomeres chromosome caps that shorten with age are merely average in length As for her diet it is abundant and promiscuous Her staples include red meat sauerkraut cottage cheese and sour milk and she eats immoderate amounts of tapioca pudding A centenarian friend of hers the Australian shotputter Ruth Frith eschews vegetables altogether Ms Kotelkos kitchen contains a few promising items probiotic bacteria in her beloved fermented foods might bolster her immune system   in the beef and nuts she devours could possibly offer some protection against   But readers looking for dietary tips will find little satisfaction here Among the potential antiaging elixirs Mr Grierson explores exercise appears most potent This old standby doesnt just keep hearts pumping and muscles strong studies suggest   by promoting the formation of neurons in the hippocampus  a part of the brain associated with memory For building cognition Sudoku is a shovel and exercise is a bulldozer Mr Grierson writes Since she began her track and field career Ms Kotelko has rarely remained still and that active lifestyle may be more important than her workouts at the track Both Olga and I exercise but she moves when shes not exercising and I dont Mr Grierson writes Olga is older than I am But  percent of the time I am   faster than she is Burgeoning research on the inactivity epidemic suggests that one important habit he could acquire is standing up The book concludes with a tidy list of rules for living The nine maxims which include keep moving believe in something dont do it if you dont love it and begin now  convey nothing that a consumer of health news and popular psychology hasnt already heard a million times Perhaps thats the point For now the best antiaging tools science can offer are habits we already know we should be doing but perhaps like Mr Grierson are not exercising regularly sleeping enough limiting sedentary behavior and maintaining meaningful social connections To his credit the author does not oversell the stillunfolding science of aging and hes quick to acknowledge that a single example cannot explain why some people age better than others While this book provides an accessible overview of the current science on aging its charm comes from the tale of a woman who refuses to hang up her track shoes and the younger man she inspires to stop acting so old In one of the books most engrossing chapters Mr Grierson decides to enter the meter run  miles at the  World Masters Athletics competition in Sacramento Calif He runs like a hairy goat and finishes second to last but he gains an important insight These competitions are about the camaraderie Comfort doesnt promote togetherness he writes Discomfort does Strong social ties track with longevity and the confidence derived from finishing a race probably doesnt hurt either Ms Kotelko turns  next month No one would blame her if she chose to rest on her laurels instead shes looking forward to chasing more records when she enters the next age group  to  I finished this quick read on my birthday after crosscountry skiing my age in kilometers Since I began this annual tradition in my early s people have asked me at what age I will quit This book convinced me that the answer is never Read an excerpt of
