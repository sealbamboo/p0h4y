New research on patients with deadly septic shock shows that a widely accepted treatment using a catheter to monitor blood-oxygen levels was no better at saving lives than an older, simpler form of therapy.. A study published online Tuesday by the New England Journal of Medicine included 1,341 septic-shock patients at 31 U.S. emergency departments. It found that the treatment known as early goal-directed therapy didn't improve patients' health outcomes.
