Ambrose stressed that Canadians should not be worried about contracting the virus   As Canadas Health Minister I want to reassure the public this is an isolated case Ambrose said The risk of HN to Canadians is very low  There is no evidence of sustained humantohuman transmission  It is also important for Canadians to know that this case is not part of the seasonal flu which circulates in Canada every year  According to the World Health Organization most   do not cause disease in humans However some like HN are zoonotic which means they can infect humans and cause disease even death  The HN virus has been primarily found in poultry in parts of Asia and northeastern Africa where some people have contracted the virus and died  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention most of the  human cases of HN infections that have been detected since  have occurred in people with direct or close contact with poultry  The CDC considers that the health risk to people in the Americas posed by the detection of this one case is very low  The US agency is not recommending that the public take any special actions regarding HN virus in response to the Canadian case
