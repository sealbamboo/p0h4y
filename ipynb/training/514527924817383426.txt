David Combs has been a health insurance broker in London Ky for more than  years When the Affordable Care Act became law he read it from cover to cover Then he sold his agency The mainstay of his business had been selling insurance coverage to small companies and the way he saw it here was the government stepping in and offering to sell it online instead Combs and many others thought brokers would go the way of travel agents no longer needed in a doityourself online marketplace But he started to think about the law in a new way once he learned that brokers could still earn a commission for selling coverage through the exchange I knew there was going to be a massive change in our industry and anytime theres a massive change theres opportunity says Combs So he started a new agency in  Some of the states that were most successful in enrolling consumers via the exchanges embraced brokers In California  percent of people who signed up for a private exchange plan enrolled with a broker in Kentucky the number reached  percent Combs key insight was that many of his smallbusiness clients could do better dropping their small group coverage and helping their workers sign up for individual insurance on the exchange The law   with fewer than  fulltime workers not to offer insurance  a bustling franchise diner off the highway in London is the kind of small business where Combs always sold insurance The restaurants policy was available only to fulltime workers and in the past it was expensive  costing the company and the workers each  a month per person On top of that they were facing an  percent rate increase in  Before the federal health law offered new options few of the restaurants workers who were eligible to buy insurance policies through Frischs actually did so Given the new options of Obamacare it didnt make sense for the restaurant to continue to offer health insurance explains Combs It was actually a detriment to their employees Heres why Because most of the restaurants employees were lowincome they would qualify for free or lowcost coverage on    Kentuckys state health insurance exchange Switching everybody over to the exchange was winwinwin cheaper for the restaurant cheaper for the employees plus more people got coverage including some parttime workers I thought to some degree it was too good to be true what people were paying says the franchise diners coowner Herman Hatfield But it worked out to where a lot of people got better care for less money Combs earns a commission of  per month for each person he enrolls including spouses and children That commission is paid by the insurer and is already built into premiums Combs enrolled all the employees at Hatfields London Ky diner in just two days Before the advent of Obamacare waitress Mary Gray was one of only  people at the restaurant who bought her health insurance  the old expensive policy  through Frischs This year she enrolled in a silver plan through Kynect that was completely subsidized so she pays nothing toward her premium She is one of the  employees at Frischs whom Combs helped enroll in a private Kynect plan most of the rest of the  full and parttime employees at the London restaurant qualified for Medicaid while a few had employersponsored coverage through a spouse or parent Virtually all the small businesses Combs had sold coverage to in the past were eligible to make a transition similar to the one the London diner made Were running into an industry as many of our fellow brokers are running out he says because instead of signing up small companies the other brokers are signing up individual people one at a time If you take that approach Combs says youll go broke But brokers roles are not so significant everywhere In Kentucky  percent of consumers who bought private health plans bought them through brokers that compares with just  percent nationwide according to a   from the Kaiser Family Foundation In   brokers fought against the health law and against navigators the government workers who help people sign up for Obamacare But in Kentucky Kynects director Carrie Banahan set up a special committee for brokers and navigators that got them talking It was contentious at first Banahan admits But once they got to know each other they built a level of trust and they get along very well If brokers want to survive Combs says they have to embrace the federal health law even if they dont like it The ones that dont want to get into it and educate themselves about health reform  I think they are going to become kind of a dinosaur fairly soon he says But those brokers who can evolve have a huge opportunity Combs believes By December  he expects his new agency to hit  million in revenue  the most business hes done in his  years as a broker in Kentucky
