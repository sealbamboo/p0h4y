These are glorious days to run in New York City The weather has been in that elusive sweet spot with temperatures we were pining for a couple of months ago and will again a couple from now Everyone has a favorite route a jog around Central Park or along the rivers through   and down brownstone blocks the senses serenaded by blooming trees and planted tulips Its hard to go wrong this time of year But my nomination for the most scenic and tranquil run in the city goes to the   In addition to being one of the nations premier gardens and research centers this one offers early morning access to exercisers hours before it opens So not only can you jog there between  and  am you can have a private audience    First I bought a community grounds pass for  good for a year It offers access to the grounds but not to exhibits Basic members can add this access for a small fee and its free at higher membership levels Youll want to take care of this before going there to run  call    because the ticket people wont be there yet  The MetroNorth train to the Botanical Garden stop takes about  minutes from Grand Central Terminal but since I try to squeeze the juice out of my unlimited MetroCard I rode the No  train to   That took me about an hour from th Street in Manhattan but much of the ride in the Bronx is elevated and outdoors with stops that feature   and bucolicsounding names like West Farms Square  From Allerton Avenue the treetops are visible in   home to both the garden and the   I ran in that direction staying on Allerton as it changed names but wrapped directly around to the gardens Mosholu Gate entrance It was an easy onemile warmup but the B D and No  trains offer even shorter routes to the garden I showed my pass at the security gate and was on my way With the gardens stately headquarters to the left and conservatory to the right I ran down a treecovered path called   It was here that I saw the first of   by the Spanish artist Manolo Valds These large works in aluminum and steel feature a female head at the base with various headdresses that blend splendidly with the garden surroundings I continued jogging passing a lawn sprinkled with white and yellow flowers set among the bursting cherry blossoms and said to myself This is going to be good My notional plan to run the perimeter of the garden first fell apart quickly as I was tempted by a winding hilly path that cut back to the right But here it doesnt matter which path you choose Getting lost among these  acres is part of the joy and you are in secure boundaries never too far from an exit Passing the entrance to the rock garden no grounds pass access I next encountered the gardens newest addition the   which opened on May  A bit farther along with the   to the right and the   to the left I chose the azaleas first I spent several minutes running the curvy hilly woodland paths  there is almost a miles worth in this area alone My jaw dropped at the exploding pinks and purples of the rhododendrons and azaleas  Next I entered the forest This is the real deal what the gardens Web site calls the largest remaining tract of original forest that once covered most of New York City The Bronx River the citys only freshwater river cuts through it Paths line the rivers banks and the Hester Bridge links the two sides offering a view of the Bronx River Waterfalls mellow cascade  The surfaces in the forest are a runners dream pillowy soft with wood chips but stable enough to allow you to look up and soak in the sea of green The sounds in the forest erase the stress of the city I could hear singing birds and the gentle rush of the river In certain spots the whoosh of traffic on the Bronx River Parkway was audible but even that was more like white noise than the incessant honking of Midtown After crossing the river I passed the Stone Mill a landmark  structure that was once a tobacco processing house and is now an event space   Exiting the forest I returned to the garden paths looping around the rose garden and then jogging through the conifers and the wetland path and the herb garden and  well you get the picture Road races are social and energizing but this run offers something different a thoughtprovoking solitude that is not easy to obtain in the city  After running about four miles of paths I found my way back to where I entered This is an ideal starting point for other Bronx runs The Mosholu Parkway has a greenway that leads all the way to Van Cortlandt Park the heart of crosscountry running in New York City On the way back to Allerton Avenue there are chances to hop onto the Bronx River Greenway where the eventual goal is to have a contiguous path from the East River all the way up to the Kensico Dam in Westchester County So much exploring to do and so little time Near the gardens exit I made a brief stop and a friendly security officer named Mary Gill pulled up to see if I needed any help She was a retired New York Police Department sergeant who spoke fondly about working at the garden You really learn to take it down she said signaling with her hand a lowering of intensity from her previous career Take it down Thats exactly what you do at this magical place
