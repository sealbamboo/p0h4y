Parkinsons patients often have trouble walking and talking Symptoms include slowness of movement a loss of balance and slurred speech With Parkinsons disease you may have a decreased ability to perform unconscious movements including blinking smiling or swinging your arms when you walk the Mayo Clinic says The symptoms are often worse on one side of the body  Approximately  million people have Parkinsons disease in the United States according to the   Men are more likely to get it than women and it usually affects people over   Your body uses a chemical called dopamine to control movement according to the National Institutes of Health Dopamine is produced by neurons in the brain which begin to die with Parkinsons disease With fewer live cells a dopamine deficit occurs causing movement issues  Scientists dont know what exactly causes these cells to start to deteriorate but believe its a combination of genes and environmental causes About   of Parkinsons patients have a family member with the disease the Parkinsons Disease Foundation says In some cases researchers have identified a single gene mutation thats passed from generation to generation according to the   Mutations in the LRRK gene are the greatest genetic contributor to Parkinsons disease discovered to date the site states But in most cases the cause is probably a combination of gene mutations Studies have also linked chemicals like   to Parkinsons though the relationship has not been proved A simple exposure to an environmental toxin is never enough to cause Parkinsons the Parkinsons Disease Foundation states In fact there is no conclusive evidence that any environmental factor alone can be considered a cause of the disease There is no cure for Parkinsons disease   but doctors can help patients cope with symptoms  A medication called levodopa is often given to patients to help their brains make more dopamine Its often prescribed with carbidopa which helps bring the levodopa into the brain  The US Food and Drug Administration has approved deep brain stimulation which is also   to reduce symptoms in Parkinsons patients Electrodes are implanted into the brain and connected to a small device that emits programmed pulses to help control movement  Other patients prefer less invasive forms of therapy like    A recent study done at Harvard University that patients with Parkinsons improved after researchers transplanted tissue from fetal dopamine cells into their brains Patients with severe symptoms experienced  fewer symptoms in the years after surgery People who had been taking medication to control their Parkinsons but found that the medicine no longer worked also saw significant improvements after surgery
