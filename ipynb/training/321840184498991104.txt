Two new experiments one involving people and the other animals suggest that regular exercise can substantially improve memory although different types of exercise seem to affect the brain quite differently The news may offer consolation for the growing numbers of us who are entering age groups most at risk for cognitive decline  It was back in the s that   for Biological Studies in La Jolla Calif first discovered that exercise bulks up the brain In groundbreaking experiments they showed that mice given access to running wheels produced far more cells in an area of the brain controlling memory creation than animals that didnt run The exercised animals then performed better on memory tests than their sedentary labmates  Since then scientists have been working to understand precisely how at a molecular level exercise improves memory as well as whether all types of exercise including weight training are beneficial The new studies provide some additional and inspiring clarity on those issues as well as incidentally on how you can get lab rats to weight train For the human study   scientists at the University of British Columbia recruited dozens of women ages  to  who had been found to have mild cognitive impairment a condition that makes a persons memory and thinking more muddled than would be expected at a given age  Mild cognitive impairment is also a recognized risk factor for increasing dementia Seniors with the condition develop Alzheimers disease at much higher rates than those of the same age with sharper memories Earlier the same group of researchers had found that after weight training older women with mild cognitive impairment improved their associative memory or the ability to recall things in context  a strangers name and how you were introduced for instance  Now the scientists wanted to look at more essential types of memory and at endurance exercise as well So they randomly assigned their volunteers to six months of supervised exercise Some of the women lifted weights twice a week Others briskly walked And some as a control measure skipped endurance exercise and instead stretched and toned  At the start and end of the six months the women completed a battery of tests designed to study their verbal and spatial memory Verbal memory is among other things your ability to remember words and spatial memory is your remembrance of where things once were placed in space Both deteriorate with age a loss thats exaggerated in people with mild cognitive impairment And in this study after six months the women in the toning group scored worse on the memory tests than they had at the start of the study Their cognitive impairment had grown  But the women who had exercised either by walking or weight training performed better on almost all of the cognitive tests after six months than they had before  There were however differences  While both exercise groups improved almost equally on tests of spatial memory the women who had walked showed greater gains in verbal memory than the women who had lifted weights  What these findings suggest the authors conclude is that endurance training and weight training may have different physiological effects within the brain and cause improvements in different types of memory That idea tallies nicely with the results of the   in which lab rats either ran on wheels or to the extent possible lifted weights Specifically the researchers taped weights to the animals tails and had them repeatedly climb little ladders to simulate resistance training  After six weeks the animals in both exercise groups scored better on memory tests than they had before they trained But it was what was going on in their bodies and brains that was revelatory The scientists found that the runners brains showed increased levels of a protein known as BDNF or brainderived neurotrophic factor which is known to support the health of existing neurons and coax the creation of new brain cells The rat weighttrainers brains did not show increased levels of BDNF  The tail trainers however did have significantly higher levels of another protein insulinlike growth factor in their brains and blood than the runners did This substance too promotes cell division and growth and most likely helps fragile newborn neurons to survive What all of this new research suggests says Teresa LiuAmbrose an associate professor in the Brain Research Center at the University of British Columbia who oversaw the experiments with older women is that for the most robust brain health its probably advisable to incorporate both aerobic and resistance training It seems that each type of exercise selectively targets different aspects of cognition she says probably by sparking the release of different proteins in the body and brain  But she continues no need to worry if you choose to concentrate solely on aerobic or resistance training at least in terms of memory improvements The differences in the effects of each type of exercise were subtle she says while the effects of exercise  any exercise  on overall cognitive function were profound  When we started these experiments she says most of us thought that at best wed see less decline in memory function among the volunteers who exercised which still would have represented success But beyond merely stemming peoples memory loss she says we saw actual improvements an outcome that if youre waffling about exercising today is worth remembering
