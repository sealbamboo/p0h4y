American families with kids bought  fewer calories per person per day in packaged foods in  than they did in  according to an analysis of a pledge by big food companies to reduce calories in the marketplace Its an impressive accomplishment but not sufficient to reverse childhood obesity experts say The assessments published Wednesday in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine follow on an earlier report on the work of the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation   big food companies that agreed to reduce by  trillion the total calories they sold by   An earlier version of this post cited the Vitality Foundation It is the Vitality Institute  That mark has been exceeded significantly The companies  which together account for about a third of all the calories in the marketplace  reduced calories sold from  through  by an average of  per person or  trillion total That is an impressive accomplishment but wont reverse the epidemic of childhood obesity especially among poor people and some minority groups according to independent evaluations of the project conducted by scientists funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation There has been a cultural shift in this country  especially households with kids have really started buying fewer calories Barry Popkin a professor in the School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina said Monday by phone Popkin and Shu Wen Ng also of the University of North Carolina wrote the evaluation of what people bought using Nielsen Homescan data of more than  households they and Meghan Slining evaluated what was sold The calories purchased has really gone down And most of the decline is in the kind of food you and I would call junk food or junk beverages Popkin said But not all the news is positive he said What we dont have is an increase in beans whole grains produce  change that might come if those foods became cheaper relative to packaged products The steepest declines in sales were reported for the least healthy products The net effect being that as total calories sold declined there has been a shift towards healthier foods purchased In other words  both food quantity and quality is starting to improve Derek Yach executive director of the health research firm the Vitality Institute said in an email The  companies worked diligently to reduce calories in the marketplace by either introducing new lowercalorie products singleserve packages andor changing the recipes of existing products Lisa Gable president of the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation said in a statement Popkin and Ng wrote that the  calories per household with children was made up up  calories from the  companies  from other namebrand products and  calories from privatelabel products such as supermarket brands The lowercalorie products are driving the bus said Hank Cardello a Hudson Institute analyst and former food industry executive His analysis found that  of the  million in sales growth for the  companies came from lowercalorie foods These changes come amid some other positive news of progress against obesity in some groups of AmericansÂ  But the overall average reduction of  calories a day is less than half of whats needed for children ages  to  to reduce obesity rates to those before the epidemic Popkin and colleagues wrote Even larger reductions are needed among African American young people and lowincome Americans Big food companies have a tremendous influence on nutrition trends and eating habits Dr Risa LavizzoMounry C Tracy Orleans and Dr James Marks wrote in a commentary published with the evaluations Therefore we both congratulate these companies and call upon them and other industry leaders  to go even further Marks senior vice president at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation said continued vigilance is needed If you were to catch me at my most optimistic I might say that this is clearly not the end of where we need to be But we might be at the end of the beginning he said Tuesday by telephone Researchers plan to keep watching them and take a closer look at privatelabel brands as well as various population groups Popkin said This weeks evaluations follow an earlier evaluation by the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation that one focused on calories sold  the trillion figure Popkin and his colleagues wanted to look at the other end of the process  what households bought When they adjusted for factors such as the recession that began at the end of  and changing preferences for healthful foods they said the calorie decline was even greater  calories per person per day for households with children But they said they found that from  to  there was a plateau which raises a major public health concern What it means remains unclear they said The companies pledge was part of First Lady Michelle Obamas work to end childhood obesity Its all part of the culture She focused on kids and kids eating healthy She brought a lot of attention to it Popkin said She did a big announcement with these companies and that put some pressure on them The Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation was met with initial skepticism but has resulted in tangible progress in reducing calories in the marketplace Yach said The independent evaluations represents a new way of ensuring that privatepublic partnerships have the impact they often claim Packaged foods account for nearly twothirds of the calories Americans eat Popkin Ng and Slining wrote Some of the criticism of the companies pledge was motivated by the belief that people need to eat more fresh produce legumes and whole grains rather than packaged foods Food companies recognize that the challenge of reducing obesity is one that requires everyone to do their part the Grocery Manufacturers of America said in a statement Toward that goal the trade group said the industry has introduced more than  products with fewer calories less fat and sugar and more whole grains among other steps The group also noted that fullcalorie soft drinks have been removed from schools
