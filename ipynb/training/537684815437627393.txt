A recent dinner with my friends went something like this So I guess I understand why older folk fret that youngsters these days are losing out on authentic social connections because of social media But it looks like the kids are going to be all right researchers say High school students in  reported lower levels of loneliness than their counterparts in  according to a   published Monday in the   Researchers from the University of Queensland in Australia arrived at that conclusion after analyzing data from the   which surveys about  American high school students annually The survey gauged loneliness by explicitly asking students how lonely they felt and by assessing how included and supported they felt among friends Though the researchers didnt find any dramatic changes the survey results suggest that loneliness has been declining  slowly and ever so slightly  for the past  years The report also found that teens these days may have fewer close confidants  but they also feel less of a need to make more friends This was a bit unexpected says   a PhD candidate at the University of Queenslands department of psychology who led the study It could be that young people today are more individualistic than they used to be they may not need as much social interaction to feel satisfied Clark notes But at this point researchers cant explain what is responsible for these trends More than anything this shows that things arent as bad as people might think he says It also shows that while the Internet has changed the way we communicate it hasnt necessarily changed much else says   a social and developmental psychologist at the University of California Davis who wasnt involved in the research Theres a lot researchers still dont understand about the impact of social media on mental health and its clear that some ways of using social media are healthier than others Trzesniewski says But its unlikely that Facebook and Twitter are fundamentally altering human nature Despite their penchant for selfies on average the teens of Generation Me arent any more egotistical or selfassured than teens of generations past according to a   Trzesniewski led in  Theres been a lot of concern that the social media is harming peoples social lives she says But the research shows that overall the Internet and social networking dont seem to be having a negative impact
