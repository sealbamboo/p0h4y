My dad was never a morning person No matter how many alarm clocks he would set nothing could ever wake him My mom often had to squirt him with cold water and I would have to tickle him under the chin so he could get to work on time When he was little his mother my Bubbe Mary used to leave for work early One morning while my dad was sleeping there was a grease fire in a neighbors apartment and my father slept through the sirens the screaming and the firefighters breaking down the front door of his building My dad said that when he slept his best ideas came to him  including some of the awardwinning slogans for the campaigns he created But as much as he enjoyed sleeping he loved eating and being pampered Every Fathers Day my sister and I would make decorative cards clean the house make him a scrumptious breakfast in bed and straighten his wall of shirts that were stacked in every corner of our brownstone  representing each new weight Figuring out what to prepare depended on the diet du jour and the number on the big chalkboard above the scale in our bathroom that showed his current weight My dad weighed himself every morning every night and after each meal carefully displaying every victory and every setback in white chalk He usually weighed around  pounds but would often fluctuate a hundred pounds on either end We usually knew how our day would be if the numbers were going up or down If the numbers were going down it might be a cheat day in which case a sweet treat was in order If the numbers were going up it was time for a different diet so a day of reprieve to eat whatever he craved was mandatory to reboot his metabolism Since Fathers Day is always on a Sunday there was a lot more freedom in my menu selection I always enjoyed making something new I had made sweet cheese blintzes a Jewish crepe from scratch several times with my maternal grandmother Beauty when we lived in Chicago but never by myself  When I called Beauty for guidance she said that since I was almost  which was her age when she started making the blintzes for her family and the boarders who lived in her home she knew I could do it But my grandmother always thought I could do everything perfectly which was not always the case  especially when it came to singing and dancing which were my sisters fortes The trick to not being overwhelmed was to make the blintzes in two parts In the evening I could make the crepes for the shell and fill them so they would have time to set overnight and be ready for frying in the morning Beauty said the smell of the blintzes frying in butter could arouse even the deepest of sleepers With my grandmothers encouragement I began gathering the cheese for the filling and the sour cream powdered sugar and strawberries for the topping According to Beauty the secret to making the perfect blintzes was to get the crepe paperthin It is all in all the wrist she would say I remember when I was little watching her effortlessly tilt the hot pan as she poured in the batter of flour egg and milk She would carefully swirl the batter to coat the bottom of the castiron skillet evenly After about  seconds she would run a knife around the edge of the crepe to prevent it from sticking I had seen my grandmother prepare the blintzes so many times that I was confident that I could replicate them Ever since I was big enough to reach the counter with a step stool I had helped mix fill and roll I decided to wait till my parents went out to begin the process for a couple of reasons One my mother was usually annoyed when I took on elaborate cooking projects the kitchen was too small she said and her papers spread over the counters would get ruined Usually her only clue that I had used the kitchen was that her papers were put back much more neatly than before she left And two I wanted my dad to be totally surprised Blintzes were one of his favorite dishes from his childhood  something saved for very special occasions With my mother out of the house I carefully made the crepes just as my grandmother had showed me filling them with sweetened cheese and a touch of lemon When I began frying them the next morning the buttery aroma that filled the air did not wake my dad but my mother and sister flew into the kitchen Even my mother who was not usually excited about food begged for a bite My mother and sister helped me arrange the wooden tray to take to my dad in bed It took only moments for him to arise as we presented him with the tray of blintzes and a cup of Tasters Choice instant coffee  his favorite coffee since he created the advertising campaign that introduced the brand in the United States and made it the No  coffee As we all nibbled on the blintzes I realized Fathers Day was not only about spoiling my dad but also about coming together as a family  using the recipes that had conjured fond memories from my parents past and creating new ones together My grandmother used to call these little packages of love Thin dough around sweetened cheese topped with fresh fruit Perfect for brunch or anytime you want to make loved ones feel special For the crepe batter
