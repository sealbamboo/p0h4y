Theres another reason to keep an eye on your moles Two new studies suggest that women with more moles may have a higher risk of breast cancer are already linked with a higher risk of melanoma  the deadliest form of skin cancer The two new studies cannot explain how moles might be related to breast cancer but theres a lot of research showing that moles like breast cancer can be influenced by hormone levels Moles are formed naturally by cells in the skin and the vast majority of moles are completely harmless But dermatologists say its a good idea for people to keep an eye on their moles and report any changes such as sudden growth itching or bleeding In the new studies two teams of researchers one in France and one in the United States looked at large surveys of tens of thousands of women In both women were asked about how many moles they had in addition to a batch of other questions They were then followed for years to see what happened to their health In the US study Jiali Han and colleagues from Indiana University and Harvard University studied  female nurses who had been watched for  years Those who had  or more moles were  percent more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than women who said they didnt have any After  years women with no moles had about an  percent chance of developing breast cancer but the women with  or more had an  percent risk That doesnt mean that women who have lots of moles need to worry says Dr Deanna Attai a breast surgeon in Burbank California who was not involved in the studies A cause for alarm in women that have lots of moles No I dont think so she said I would still put more emphasis on   and family history The women with more moles their medical name is nevi also seemed to have higher levels of hormones Hans team reported in the Public Library of Science journal  Postmenopausal women with six or more nevi had a  percent higher level of free estradiol and a  percent higher level of free testosterone compared to those with no nevi they wrote Older women with higher circulating levels of sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone have more moles They also have higher risks of breast cancer and melanocytes the cells involved in melanoma and in making moles have built in docking points for hormones called receptors And moles often darken or grow when women are pregnant another piece of evidence showing they can be influenced by hormones Nevi may be a marker of exposure to sex hormones Barbara Fuhrman and Victor Cardenas of the University of Arkansas  And it was only socalled hormone receptor positive breast cancer  the type fueled by estrogen  that was more common in the women with many moles another piece of evidence pointing to hormones But Attai notes while this holds true in large populations it doesnt mean much for an individual woman You cant always make a direct link between hormone levels and the risk of breast cancer in an individual patient she said The French study shed some more light on the question They looked at a similar large study of  French women who were aged  to  when they enrolled in  The women who said they had very many moles at the beginning were  percent more likely to develop breast cancer We found a modest association between number of nevi and overall breast cancer risk they wrote Not only are moles linked with melanoma but some studies suggest the risk of melanoma may be related to breast cancer Marina Kvaskoff of the French research institute Inserm and colleagues said And some people with many moles and with melanoma have a mutation in the CDKNA gene There may be an association with mutations in this gene and some cases of breast cancer And there may be links between having a lot of moles and other hormonerelated conditions such as thyroid disease and endometriosis Kvaskoffs team said Fuhrman and Cardenas said it might be possible to use moles as one more factor in the calculations used to advise women about their risk of breast cancer  calculations that include questions such as whether a mother or sister has ever had breast cancer and the number of biopsies that have been done because of suspiciouslooking breast lumps But they added the associations between moles and breast cancer are really pretty weak As is so often the case with medical reports more study is needed the researchers agree
