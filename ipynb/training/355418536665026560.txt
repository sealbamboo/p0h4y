On March   the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law Its aimed at making health insurance more affordable and reducing the overall costs of health care Some parts of the law have already gone into effect Insurers cant impose lifetime dollar limits on essential benefits like hospital stays children can stay on their parents plan until theyre  children with preexisting conditions cant be denied coverage and all new insurance plans must cover preventive care and medical screenings On Jan   the heart of the law is scheduled to be up and running as well State exchanges are being established where people who dont get health insurance through their workplace will be able to shop for a plan Signups will begin Oct  These plans must meet certain standards of quality and must be explained clearly with no fine print And federal subsidies will be available for those who qualify for financial help Even as that date approaches critics of the health care law are trying to halt the changes Just last week when the Obama administration announced it would delay for a year the requirement that employers with  or more fulltime workers offer health insurance critics said the move showed the law is fundamentally flawed and its implementation a mess Will the exchanges be up and running in every state Will insurance be affordable for everyone Will this radical restructuring of the business of insurance actually work Wendell Potter a senior analyst at the Center for Public Integrity thinks there will be glitches but he sees that the Affordable Care Act is moving ahead He believes that getting more people insured will lower costs in the end People who dont have insurance they still get sick and they get injured he tells  s Dave Davies and most of them when they do go to the emergency room Hospitals cant often collect money from those folks because they often dont have the money to pay for it They cant turn them away its called uncompensated care but thats a misnomer Somebody has to pay for that care and that somebody is you and me if we have private coverage Potter worked inside the insurance industry for  years most recently as head of communications for Cigna He left that job and now advocates for ways the industry can reform Were seeing that the competition is working in keeping the rates low and in some cases insurers that were offering policies or saying they were going to charge more than their competitors have come back and said After we saw the competitors rates were going to resubmit      In todays world theres no standard definition of things like coinsurance or copayments People dont know necessarily what a lot of the terms are but theyll have to be spelled out by any health plan that is offering coverage through the exchange Well be able to compare one plan with another and information will have to be presented in a standardized format not unlike the food labels and nutrition labels on food that we buy in the grocery store In fact that was kind of a model that Congress looked at  And something that will be going away will be the fine print And thats where a lot of the most important information has been hidden  Insurance companies will no longer be able to hide the most important elements of what is covered and whats not It will have to be stated very explicitly and in language that people can understand     There are junk plans that are out there today and some of the biggest insurance companies sell them and theyre very profitable for insurance companies And a lot of people dont know theyre in junk plans until they get sick or injured And they find out at a time when its really  quite frankly  too late that theyre not adequately covered And some plans have lifetime or annual caps on how much the insurance companies will pay And increasingly plans have very high deductibles Insurance companies in these cases dont pay anything for coverage until youve paid quite a bit of money out of your own pocket Thats not a big deal for people who are quite wealthy or healthy or dont really need insurance but for the rest of us  for folks who get sick occasionally or get very sick or injured or who are not as young and healthy as we once were  these plans are not necessarily the best things since sliced bread
