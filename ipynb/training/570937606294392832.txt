But check with your doctor first if you take any medications, as grapefruit and grapefruit juice can interfere with some prescription drugs..

                  . 
                  Nutritionally, almond butter is comparable to peanut butter, and they each have about 100 calories per tablespoon. Almond butter contains slightly less saturated fat, though—a definite point in its favor, even for people who aren't allergic to peanuts..

                  . 
                  Blueberries are also lower in calories than a lot of other fruits (they contain just 80 per cup), so you can pile them onto your cereal without worrying about your waistline..

Cranberry juice—not to be confused with cranberry juice cocktail—isn't as sugary as other fruit juices, but its high acidity can sometimes contribute to .  besides UTIs.. "Cereal can be tricky, because there are so many different kinds out there," Giovinazzo says. "Something with at least 5 grams of fiber and less than 5 grams of sugar is probably your best bet.".

They're perfect as an addition to cereal or yogurt, or mixed into a smoothie for a quick, drink-on-the-go breakfast.. Carbohydrates are a breakfast mainstay, but the type of carbs you choose can make a big difference in the overall health of your meal.

                  What you put on it matters, as well. "Slathering your toast with butter or jelly just adds empty fat and calories," says Giovinazzo. "Instead, get some protein by adding an egg or some almond butter."
