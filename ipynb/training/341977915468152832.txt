Smoking is expensive and not just for the person buying the cigs Employers are taking hard looks at the cost of employing smokers as they try to cut health insurance costs with some refusing to hire people who say they smoke But figures on the cost of smoking have been rough estimates at best with a very   of  billion a year nationwide Researchers now say theyre got much tighter focus on the number  per smoker per year And the biggest chunk of that comes not in health care costs but in work lost during all those smoke breaks That came in at  based on an estimate of five smoke breaks during the work day The smoking breaks added up to a lot more than we expected says Micah Berman an incoming assistant professor of law and public policy at Ohio State University who led the   which was published in   The researchers tried to be conservative in estimating the number of smoke breaks figuring on five minute breaks in an eighthour workday three of which took place during sanctioned break times So the cost could well be higher Other costs include more sick days due to health problems at  per smoker and  a year for lower productivity while working because of withdrawal symptoms which kick in within  minutes of that last drag In recent years some hospitals including the Cleveland Clinic have decided to no longer   But more than half of states make it   in the hiring process Some employers charge higher health insurance premiums to employees who smoke But that could keep smokers from getting much needed medical care and smoking cessation programs critics argue A small number of states have   protecting smokers against a provision in the Federal Affordable Care Act that lets smokers be charged more Im not sure what impact that is going to have on people making decisions starting to smoke or quitting Berman says of efforts to put the financial hurt on smokers Most people start to smoke when theyre minors  not a time when theyre thinking about future health insurance premiums Quitting he tells Shots is extremely difficult and usually takes a lot of attempts to be successful But could smokers turn out to be cheaper hires because they   avoiding the need for years of health care and retirement benefits Not so Berman says Theres a potential cost savings only if the employer has a defined benefit plan that gives retirees a guaranteed pension Berman and his colleagues say Those kinds of retirement plans are increasingly rare But if a company has one they can save  a year in pension costs by hiring a smoker the researchers say Still thats far outweighed by the cost of all those smoke breaks
