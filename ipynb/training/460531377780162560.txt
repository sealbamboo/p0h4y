This month NASA revealed new details of the plan to send humans to Mars by  Its an elaborate and expensive mission involving a giant deepspace rocket and roping an asteroid into the moons orbit to use as a stepping stone to Mars But there are still some serious questions about a manned expedition to Mars Namely is it safe Thats where astronauts Scott and Mark Kelly come in The Kelly brothers are identical twins and the only siblings ever to both fly in space Starting next March Scott Kelly will spend a year at the International Space Station While hes up there he will be a part of some novel scientific experiments comparing his health to his brothers down on Earth The idea is to learn about the effects of longterm space travel on the human body which will influence how NASA proceeds with the Mars mission and other space travel initiatives The twins are ideal candidates for studying how these extended trips can affect genetics It was kind of ironic or interesting  maybe serendipitous  that after this flight I will have flown about  days compared to Marks  so an order of magnitude more Scott tells NPRs Eric Westervelt Its known that being in space can affect bone and muscle mass and the exposure to radiation can increase the risk of cancer The astronauts hope this experiment will also shed light on how space travel affects the immune system In one test   both brothers will be given a flu vaccine to see how their systems react While there are a number of possible health issues associated with being in space Scott will also be exercising a lot while hes up there and that might encourage Mark   to run an extra mile or two in the meantime The details of the   havent been finalized yet but they will likely include drawing blood ultrasounds CT scans and urine samples The kids usually get a little laugh out of Dads pee being in the refrigerator Mark says After  years of being a NASA astronaut he says Ive had a lot of science done on me already so I kind of know what Im getting myself into
