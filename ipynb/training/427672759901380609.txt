Prevention recently told me Its astonishing how bad it is Dr Frieden and public health specialists everywhere are seeking better ways to help the   to quit and to keep young people from getting hooked on cigarettes Fewer than  percent of doctors smoke Why cant we get to that rate in society as a whole he wondered One reason Smoking rates are highest among the poor poorly educated and people with mental illness populations hard to reach with educational messages and quitsmoking aids But when I mentioned to Dr Frieden a former New York City health commissioner that the citys streets are filled with young adult smokers who appear to be well educated and well dressed he said television seems to have had an outsize influence Focus groups of white girls in New York private schools have suggested a Sex in the City effect he said Girls think smoking makes them look sexy In the last two years middleaged men too have begun smoking in increasing numbers after a halfcentury decline Dr Frieden cited Mad Men the popular TV series featuring admen in the early s when well over half of American men smoked Dr Frieden said that an antismoking effort begun in  by the World Health Organization can make a huge difference in curbing smoking and we should fully implement what we know works The program is called     M stands for monitoring   and the effectiveness of prevention programs like antismoking videos on YouTube   P for protecting people from secondhand smoke Half the country still lacks laws mandating smokefree public places The latest national health survey found that about half of children from nonsmoking households have metabolites of tobacco in their blood Dr Frieden said   O for offering help to the  percent of smokers who say they would like to quit Tobacco use remains egregiously undertreated in health care settings Dr Helene M Cole associate editor of JAMA The Journal of the American Medical Association and   a professor of medicine at the University of Wisconsin   in the journal Medical aids for quitting smoking which can triple the likelihood of success should become available without a copay to many more people under the   Dr Frieden said   W for warning about smoking hazards through larger and more graphic messages on cigarette packs and paid advertising on radio and television   E for enforcing bans on tobacco marketing advertising promotion and sponsorships In bodegas throughout the country Dr Frieden said tobacco ads are used as wallpaper Smoking is freely depicted in movies and popular TV shows   R for raising taxes which studies have shown is the single most effective way to reduce smoking in the population especially among teens A higher cigarette tax is not a regressive tax because it would help poor people even more than the welltodo Dr Frieden noted President Obama has proposed an additional centperpack tax on cigarettes which would yield  billion to fund universal prekindergarten Smokers ready to quit can choose from among a cornucopia of aids as wideranging as   substitutes lowdose   hypnosis and   While none by itself has a high rate of success different methods have proved effective for different people Many former smokers required several attempts before they managed to quit for good But quitting smoking does not necessarily require assistance As two public health specialists Andrea L Smith and Simon Chapman at the University of Sydney in Australia   The vast majority of quitters do so unaided A   in the United States found that only  percent of exsmokers attributed their success to nicotine replacement therapy patches gum or prescribed drugs these experts noted In contrast  percent attributed their success to quitting cold turkey and  percent to willpower commitment or mind over matter They added For many smokers having a reason to quit a why was more important than having a method to quit a how For my husband who smoked a pack a day for  years the why was his distress at seeing two beautiful young nieces smoking he made a pact with them to quit if they would and he followed through Techniques that can help people trying to quit when troubled by the urge to smoke include waiting  minutes and distracting yourself avoiding situations you associate with smoking at least until you have become a committed exsmoker using stress reducers like   yoga   muscle relaxation and selfhypnosis seeking moral support from a nonsmoking friend family member or online stopsmoking program and oral distractions like chewing sugarless gum or raw vegetables Electronic cigarettes are being promoted by some as a way to resist the real thing Ecigarettes invented in  by a Chinese pharmacist contain liquid nicotine that is heated to produce a vapor not smoke More than  brands are now on the market they combine nicotine with flavorings like chocolate and tobacco But their contents are not regulated and their longterm safety has not been established In one study  percent were found to produce known carcinogens Dr Frieden said that while ecigarettes have the potential to help some people quit the method would backfire if it gets kids to start smoking gets smokers who would have quit to continue to smoke gets exsmokers to go back to smoking or reglamorizes smoking Nearly two million children in American middle and high schools have already used ecigarettes Dr Frieden said In   in the Canadian Medical Association Journal last year   an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Toronto suggested that fruitflavored ecigarettes and   by movie stars could lure teens who would not otherwise smoke into acquiring a nicotine habit  of  South Korean youths in grades  through  by researchers at the University of California San Francisco
