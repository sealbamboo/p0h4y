The people of the farming community of Roka in Cambodia are living through exactly the nightmare scenario that the World Health Organisation wants to stamp out with a new policy on syringes In wooden huts and farmhouses dotted among paddy fields families are struggling to cope with the bombshell of a sudden and frightening mass infection of HIV To the astonishment and shock of this rural backwater babies schoolchildren and even the yearold abbot of the local Buddhist temple who is celibate have all tested HIVpositive   And there is one common factor that links them directly or indirectly nearly all of them received injections from an unlicensed doctor suspected of reusing his syringes  The virus would have been spread from one patient to another resulting in an escalating tally of infections that now stands at  with further rises expected as more tests are carried out  Four of the victims  three elderly women and a baby  have since died Every year millions of people around the world are infected when syringes are used on more than one person not only spreading HIV but also Hepatitis B and C and other diseases  The WHOs hope is to try to achieve a global switch to what are called autodisable syringes that are designed with a feature which effectively breaks them once an injection has been given    But for the people of Roka all that is too late Looking tired and desperate with her fourmonthold daughter Tola on her lap Yong Sothom described to me how she became infected with HIV and then unwittingly passed on the virus through her breast milk I feel sad very very sad she said because its a pity for my child  she is innocent yet she is also infected For her the outbreak has become almost apocalyptic in that it has stretched across four generations of her extended family hitting no fewer than  relations   The familys matriarch yearold Chay Yao spoke with great dignity and determination as she tried to convey the scale of the tragedy that has struck an otherwise calm existence  It is not like a normal sadness its so difficult especially for these small children  Its no worry for me to die but I feel pity for the children about their future about how they will make a living how they will get food this is what I am thinking about So amid the soaring temperatures and dust of the dry season here a sombre mood has descended over a community wholly unprepared for what has developed into a national health crisis Most of the victims including the abbot Mom Heng have now been prescribed anti retroviral drugs but in an effort to head off panic hes been working with a local charity to persuade people not to worry  We travelled with him to one particularly unfortunate family where the mother and four of her five children are all infected with HIV The father Sokhaa Vech a local chief recalled seeing the unlicensed medic visiting a neighbouring family before coming to his and he noticed how the man handled his equipment The syringe was in his bag he told me He pulled it out of its plastic wrapping gave an injection put it back in its wrapping  and then I saw him using it again on everyone else  The medic Yem Chrin was by all accounts a popular figure in the area dispensing injections at a far cheaper price than charged by the local government clinic and prepared to make home visits  We also heard that he offered his treatments on credit and was content to be paid in commodities such as rice  One charity worker described him as uncle easy and the abbot and Chay Yao the matriarch of the family with  victims are among those to emphasise his attentiveness Since the crisis started Chrin has been in custody and now faces an array of charges including murder One striking feature of this outbreak is how the villagers are evidently keen on injections preferring them to pills often receiving dozens of jabs for ailments such as dysentery and fever This is a cultural phenomenon  not just in Cambodia but in many developing countries  in which the technology of a highly visible procedure is sought after and the risks are probably not considered This is the reality facing campaigners who have long argued that the safety of syringes is pivotal to cutting infection rates  With us on the visit to Roka was Marc Koska the British inventor of a type of syringe that is disabled once used For years through his charity SafePoint he has argued  with health authorities at conferences and in the media  that the world needs to ditch the standard kind of syringe because it carries too many dangers  When we encountered a team of medics sent in from the capital Phnom Penh to help cope with the outbreak he had a chance to demonstrate how his system works Marc unwrapped one of his syringes depressed the plunger as if giving an injection and then when he tried to pull the plunger out showed how it snapped  making reuse impossible  The medics all specialists in HIVAids were amazed and immediately saw the benefit One of the team Te Naisam smiled at the sight and said Ive never seen this before Ive been a nurse for more than  years and Ive just seen today this modern syringe If they are available imported into my country it would be very good to help reduce the HIVAids infection In fact these autodisable syringes have been in use for international immunisation programmes for the past decade and a growing number of companies produce them But immunisations account for less than  of the estimated  billion injections given globally every year  so the real challenge is to persuade the manufacturers and national governments to agree to work towards a total switch  Marc Koska said Whats happening here in Roka should just never have occurred Ive got a design and there are other designs for safety syringes that you simply cannot use more than once And theyre the same price as a normal needle and syringe Weve just got to get on with this and then we can stop any similar outbreak around the world Our final stop was at the home of the man at the centre of the crisis Yem Chrins shop was closed up but his sisterinlaw agreed to fetch a copy of his driving licence so we could see his picture She then revealed something none of us had heard before that she was among those infected with HIV along with Chrins motherinlaw and grandson presumably treated in the same way as all the others The plight of the grandson seems especially poignant an innocent in a crisis infected in his own home and all because of something as simple as a dirty syringe
