Many teenagers even those who have never smoked are experimenting with ecigarettes researchers in northwest England say  Questionnaires completed by   to yearolds   showed one in five had tried or bought ecigarettes The researchers said ecigarettes were the alcopops of the nicotine world and needed tougher controls Experts said it was important to find out how many were becoming addicted Electronic cigarettes mimic the effects of real ones producing a vapour that is less harmful than cigarette smoke but the vapour usually contains nicotine the addictive substance in cigarettes They divide opinion Some see them as a vital tool for helping people to quit while others argue they normalise smoking and may act as a gateway One major area of contention is the impact they have on children The analysis by Liverpool John Moores University showed that  of those who responded had tried vaping Ecigarettes were used by  of teenagers who had never smoked  of former smokers and  of light smokers The link was even stronger in children who drank alcohol or whose parents smoked Prof Mark Bellis told the BBC News website To many people the numbers weve identified might come as a bit of a shock This is just being drawn into a repertoire  another drug that people can use to experiment with rather than being seen as an alternative to tobacco  On nicotine he said ecigarettes were providing a concentrated form of a highly addictive substance with known problems associated with it and we need to be very cautious about that and how we protect our young people A ban on the sale of electronic cigarettes to unders will be introduced in England Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland Katherine Devlin president of the Electronic Cigarette Industry Trade Association told the BBC Obviously teenagers accessing vaping products is a serious concern  However since the survey only records a single access it doesnt provide any information about whether or not they go on to regular use  Other statistical data indicate that this is unlikely Nevertheless we hope that the newly introduced mandated age restrictions can reduce this number Data from the   does suggest that those who use ecigarettes are almost entirely current or former smokers Dr John Middleton of the Faculty of Public Health said We need to protect children and young people from the harms of nicotine by regulating electronic cigarettes  Our concern is that if we wait for proof that electronic cigarettes could act as a gateway to smoking cigarettes it will already have happened and the tobacco industry will have been given the opportunity to recruit its next generation of smokers
