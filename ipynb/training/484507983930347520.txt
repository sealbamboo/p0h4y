Scientists claim to have developed a way of predicting which teenagers are likely to bingedrink  A combination of  factors including brain structure personality and major life events were used to produce the test It can predict with  accuracy which yearolds are likely to bingedrink at  But a simpler method would be needed to make the test practical because of the prohibitive costs of brain scans  Studies have already looked for the differences between bingedrinking teenagers and those choosing a path of sobriety  However they cannot tease out what makes someone more likely to consume copious amounts of alcohol from the changes caused by the drink An international group of scientists have now conducted the largest study of its type to find a way of predicting which teenagers will go on to bingedrink  They looked at a huge array of variables including family history exposure to alcohol neuroticism extravagance conscientiousness and other personality traits a suite of genes brain volume how the brain responds to reward and many more  Dr Robert Whelan of University College Dublin told the BBC There is no one really big thing Its a bunch of little things adding up to give you this prediction There are three main areas brain activity and brain structure personality so seeking out new things to do increases the risk whereas conscious tends to make you less likely to bingedrink and then life events such as a boyfriend or girlfriend is highly predictive  However he cautioned the test would have limited value in testing one individual as it was not accurate enough  It is very broad but you could identify a group of people  say take  kids and find the top  at a higher risk  to give them special intervention Dr Whelan added that it was important to identify those at risk of binge drinking because studies had shown alcohol has neurotoxic effects which carry on into adulthood However brain scans cost thousands of pounds per person A simplified version of the test focusing on relatively cheap personality and family history factors is more likely to be used Hugh Perry chairman of the Medical Research Council neurosciences and mental health board said Addiction and substance misuse is a major medical social and economic problem for the UK  The UK government spends more than bn annually in meeting the cost of drugrelated social and economic harm He said further research could lead to breakthroughs in this field and provide compelling evidence to inform public health policy and lay the groundwork for the design of interventions The findings will also be applied to other fields including drug abuse and smoking
