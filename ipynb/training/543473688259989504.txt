No cars for the teams seeking Ebola cases Not enough ambulances to get the sick to the hospital quickly And no cups for patients to drink from Thats how bad things have been in a remote Eastern district of Sierra Leone called Kono Kono District is a land of towering mountains and muddy diamond mines Its right next to the region where the Ebola outbreak first started Still for a long time it looked as if the virus was mostly bypassing the place Over the summer there were just a handful of cases says Winnie Romeril the World Health Organizations spokeswoman in Sierra Leone There were a few cases a week in September and October And then suddenly in November we noticed a rise in the number of cases Romeril says The actual figures were still fairly low a few dozen sick people at the districts only hospital To date the total number of confirmed cases in Kono is just over  But the suddenness of the rise was ominous We were analyzing these figures and scratching our heads and thinking well we need to go see whats going on she says Romeril was in a group of aid workers and government and international organization officials that arrived last Saturday Their first stop was the hospital They found it overwhelmed with desperately sick people Dead bodies were piling up As for the nurses You could see the toll that was taken on the staff I mean they were they were some of the most exhausted depressed looking people Ive ever seen says Romeril The only good news was that the staff had enough protective suits provided by the government in advance Everything else was lacking  even cups Thats a serious problem because Ebola patients lose a lot of fluid The key to survival is to drink large quantities of a solution of water mixed with oral rehydration salts  called ORS for short People who are so weak with the Ebola virus cant even pick up a oneliter bottle Romeril says So you have to put it in a small cup for them to sip out of And they didnt have small cups They didnt even have pitchers to make up the ORS The staff also hadnt been trained on how to set up isolation zones So they were actually carrying people who had died of Ebola to the morgue and passing the pregnancy ward for example she says And by the time we left there were already pregnant women dying Also among the dead hospital workers And it was likely that there were a lot more infected people in the community But it was hard to say for sure Michael NDolie is an expert on disease surveillance with the World Health Organization When he arrived in Kono  just a few days before Romeril  he found that the teams who check reports of suspected Ebola patients had no cars or trucks They only have motorbikes he says In fact as Im talking to you its still a challenge We still do not have one vehicle for them Even when the team members do manage to reach homes of sick people they cant then take the individual to the hospital on a motorbike So they lose precious days trying to organize ambulance rides But what about all the money the international community has been pouring into Sierra Leone How is it possible that there still arent enough vehicles or cups One reason says Romeril is that the hot spots keep shifting from one part of the country to another The resources have been diverted to areas that seemed much more needy at the moment and then another area gets neglected she explains And so even when a lot of resources have come in there are still more resources that are needed Kono at least is getting help The World Health Organization and the government of Sierra Leone are now teaming up with nongovernmental aid gropus to mobilize a rapid response Theyre sending vehicles The International Federation of the Red Cross is setting up a proper treatment center that should open within two weeks So Romeril says theres reason to hope they can stamp out this particular brush fire Still she says the episode is one more reminder of the need for constant vigilance
