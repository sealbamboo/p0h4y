Nearly a decade ago researchers in Boston decided to see whether older men who were not in very good shape could benefit from daily doses of testosterone The scientists recruited several hundred volunteers and gave them the hormone or a placebo Those taking testosterone got stronger compared with those taking the placebo and they could carry a load up stairs faster But they also had   including heart attacks and strokes and safety monitors ended the trial early Since those findings were published in  studies of testosterone treatment have produced mixed results A  study of veterans aged  and over with low testosterone found that   but more recent reports including one published last week have documented   as well as in younger men with a history of heart disease Officials at the Food and Drug Administration said on Friday that they were   in light of the recent studies and will investigate rates of stroke heart attack and death in men using the drugs In recent years testosterone has been heavily promoted as a cureall for low energy low libido depression and other ills among middleaged men Low T is a ubiquitous diagnosis heard in television commercials and locker rooms Between  and  hormone use by men  and over nearly quadrupled By the end of that period nearly   Though the drug is indicated for men with abnormally low testosterone levels a condition called   doctors have been prescribing it to many men with normal levels For people with truly low testosterone levels the benefits outweigh the risks said   of the University of Washington in Seattle and an author of the study that found testosterone could help certain veterans But for millions of others its in the same category as snake oil Many physicians have become more willing to prescribe testosterone to people who dont fit the classical diagnosis of hypogonadism and have only borderline low levels that may be related to normal agerelated hormonal declines he said Testosterone levels begin to decline by about  percent a year in men at age  There are what I would label testosterone factories out there and its terrifying because we dont know what the longterm safety profile is Dr Anawalt said Some critics say the trend is reminiscent of another hormonal regimen with a sexy allure    or as it was commonly called hormone replacement therapy  which was widely promoted to menopausal women for decades based on scanty evidence of benefit and inadequate scrutiny of the potential harm Were giving people hormones that we dont know they need for a disease that we dont know they have and we dont know if itll help them or harm them said   a professor at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice who wrote   about the marketing of low testosterone as a disease in need of a treatment   typically a combination of estrogen and synthetic   unless the woman has undergone    is used to treat menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes mood swings and low sexual desire But for years physicians were convinced that estrogen protected women from heart disease and promoted it as a longterm preventive regimen Some  percent of menopausal women were taking hormones by the time the   finally put the hypothesis to the test in a large governmentsponsored clinical trial The results stunned experts Rather than protecting women from heart disease the popular estrogen and progestin combination increased the risk of blood clots strokes and   when compared with a placebo and did not protect from heart disease Now there are calls for a similar governmentfunded clinical trial to establish the benefits and risks of testosterone hormone treatment for men The National Institutes of Health is   called the T trial designed to see whether older men who take testosterone actually experience better physical sexual and cognitive function and whether the hormone reduces risk factors for heart disease and   The trial is not designed to determine the longterm risks of treatment but rather to determine whether the treatment has health benefits Though low testosterone is associated with health problems in older men such as bone loss decreased strength and decreased sex drive it is not clear that low testosterone is the cause of these problems or that boosting testosterone reverses them said   of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA Testosterone also declines in men who are obese and dont exercise Dr Anawalt pointed out Mary Schooling a Hunter College professor of public health is convinced testosterone is harmful for older men and a trial like the Womens Health Initiative would be a mistake Its in the pharmaceutical companies interest to have a trial going on for  years she said In that time they can continue to sell testosterone Dr Anawalt has been taking a firm approach with his patients often telling them that hes not convinced that they really suffer from low testosterone There are so many men out there looking for the elixir of youth he said I say Im not going to prescribe a therapy for you for the rest of your life if Im not sure its safe for you And by the way if you could exercise a little more lose a couple pounds and eat more healthfully  theres evidence you can raise your testosterone that wayÂ
