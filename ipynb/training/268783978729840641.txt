Last spring the global health community got some   about its last best treatment for malaria The   were losing their potency at two different places in Southeast Asia in western Cambodia and along the border between   Health workers feared that it was only a matter of time before the resistant malaria would show up elsewhere Now there are signs that artemisininresistant malaria is cropping up in Vietnam and central Myanmar researchers reported Tuesday at the   of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Atlanta Showing that resistance is emerging outside of western Cambodia is a game changer says   an infectious disease specialist from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who cochaired the study There are other places up and coming that well have to be deal with now For the past year and a half Fairhurst and a team of doctors from Oxford University have closely monitored  malaria patients at  locations in Cambodia Thailand Myanmar Bangladesh Vietnam and Laos The researchers have been measuring how quickly the   parasite leaves patients blood after theyre given artemisinin Patients in the drugresistant hot spots of western Cambodia took the longest time to recover from malaria infections as researchers expected But at clinics more than  miles away in Vietnam the results were mixed Some patients wiped out the infections fast but others were quite slow to recover The team saw the same split at clinics in central Myanmar Some researchers at the meeting were hesitant to label this slow clearance of the parasite drug resistance because several factors can influence how fast the drug works including a patients age and the malaria species Plus artemisinin still kills the parasite eventually It just takes longer This is good news Fairhurst says because it means doctors can still use the drug to treat malaria in these locations They probably just have to be extra careful and perhaps add another medication to make sure they wipe out all forms of the parasite We may need to get more serious about using a second drug to kill the gametocytes one stage of the parasite he tells Shots The guidelines say to do this but it is not in widespread use Although the study is still ongoing the team hasnt found any signs of sluggish recovery in Laos or Bangladesh With careful surveillance and mapping of malaria infections Fairhurst says hes hopeful that health workers will be able to stay ahead of artemisinin resistance before it spreads to other parts of Southeast Asia
