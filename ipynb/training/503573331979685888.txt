Sheldon Yett is UNICEFs lead man in Liberia Over a long career hes been in the thick of all sorts of crises  wars earthquakes epidemics Hes seen firsthand how when disaster strikes a poor country aid workers and experts from all over the world flood the zone But with the Ebola epidemic almost no one is answering the call Im astounded by how difficult it has been to get the partners we need Yett says People are afraid I cant convince my own staff to come Its extremely extremely difficult We need skilled qualified people here With the number of Ebola cases in Liberia now topping  and many more cases thought to be unreported the need for international support has become acute Liberian officials and aid groups say they desperately need health workers and experts in disease management The effects of this outbreak will be with us for many many many months to come and we need qualified people here and we need the funds to address it Yett says The needs are enormous But something about this virus  maybe the fact that its so deadly or maybe its the images of health workers putting on fullbody protective suits to avoid getting infected  seems to have unnerved the sort of experts Liberia needs One of biggest shortages has been in care centers for people with Ebola Last weekend the aid group Doctors Without Borders opened a new center in Monrovia with  beds They were filled almost immediately The United Nations is promising to help add another  beds  but not for another six weeks and its still on a hunt for doctors The biggest concern has been as long as Ive been here is to get international staff with Ebola experience says Lindis Hurum Doctors Without Borders emergency coordinator for Monrovia Thats whats been stopping us She says theyve already brought in every available person they can But they dont actually need that many more international experts to expand the treatment centers just enough to train the Liberians who would do most of the work Even though working with Ebola patients is extremely dangerous Brett Adamson coordinator of the new Doctors Without Borders center says hes had no problem finding Liberians willing to step up It was quite surprising considering the number of health workers that have died and so theyve been amazing Adamson says We recruited    staff in a day One of the new hires Amos Togba helps disinfect gear and equipment at the center He says he knows the risks Well yes I have some fear but I have to be brave to do it Togba says Thats the only way we can attack the virus We need brave people to do it Then there are the jobs that arent hazardous but are nonetheless essential Liberias government recently set up an Ebola hotline for people to call with questions or ask for help Barkue Tubman who runs a public relations firm helped set up the center with a Facebook callout for workers On hiring day Tubman says We walked out the gates and we saw about  people in pouring rain she says Its rainy season here and when it comes down it really comes down Tubman says they had to turn hundreds of people away Liberians are also at forefront of the work that experts say is the real key to quashing the outbreak going doortodoor through every community to find out who is sick help them get tested and encourage those who came in contact with a sick person to stay away from others during the  days it takes to find out if theyve been infected Joyce Kilikpo does this by delivering supplies such as rice salt cooking oil and sanitary pads to people under quarantine Kilikpo executive director of the aid group Public Health Initiative Liberia makes these runs every day in partnership with an NGO called Action Aid But she feels like shes barely making a difference We say Sorry for everything that happened  Kilpo says There are a lot of people that are not getting food and what we are doing is just a drop in the ocean Experts also say the information being gathered by people like Kilpo is of limited use unless its fed to people with direct experience coordinating disease emergencies That expertise is missing too Hurum says she thinks experts dont step forward because they fear they would be putting themselves in immediate danger which is not necessarily true The reality she says is that working in Liberia during this outbreak is a lot like working in any other disaster Theres a lot of things you can do in this response that are not highrisk she says You do not have to put on that astronaut equipment that you see in all the pictures to respond to this crisis
