Experimental mice have been telling us this for years but potsmoking humans didnt want to believe it could happen to them Compared with a person who never smoked marijuana someone who uses marijuana regularly has on average less gray matter in his orbital frontal cortex a region that is a key node in the brains reward motivation decisionmaking and addictive behaviors network More ambiguously in regular pot smokers that region is better connected than it is in nonusers the flow of signal traffic is speedier to other parts of that motivation and decisionmaking network including across the superhighway of white matter that connects the brains hemispheres The researchers who conducted the study speculate that the orbital frontal cortexs greater level of connectednesswhich is especially pronounced in people who started smoking pot early in lifemay be the brains way of compensating for the regions underperforming gray matter Whether these complex neuroadaptive processes reverse themselves when marijuana use stops is an important unanswered question they added The   reported Monday in the journal PNAS confirm findings about chronic marijuana use from rodents But scientific evidence in humans has been more mixed Even now however the authors of the study acknowledge that they cannot discern whether a pot smokers smaller orbital frontal cortex is the cause or the result of chronic marijuana use A  study found that subjects with a smaller orbital frontal cortex at age  were more likely to start using marijuana by age  suggesting that deficits in this crucial region may predispose one to substanceabuse behaviors This study conducted by researchers from the University of Texas Center for Brain Health and the Albuquerquebased Mind Research Network did not follow subjects over time so it is at a disadvantage in showing cause and effect Instead it compared  chronic marijuana users at least four times a week over the past six months with  nonusing control subjects who were matched for age and gender with the using group Subjects were an average age of  to  years old Researchers noted that the IQ of the marijuanausing group was significantly lower than that of the nonusing groupnot a finding of the study but an incidental factor that might be indirectly linked to marijuana use
