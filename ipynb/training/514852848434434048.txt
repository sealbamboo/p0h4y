I swear I dont go looking for alarming news about benzodiazepines drugs widely prescribed for insomnia and anxiety But it shows up with some frequency so mindful of your fervidly held views on the subject I am donning a hazmat suit to bring you the latest findings from the medical journal BMJ Theyre disturbing In previous posts I reported that longterm use by older people of drugs called sedativehypnotics which includes benzos like Ativan Xanax Valium and Klonopin and the related zdrugs Ambien Lunesta has for years   Some readers took exception arguing that critics minimize the miseries of chronic sleeplessness reflexively condemn all drug dependence or condescendingly assume older people cant make smart decisions The Ambien I use is low dose and I am not an idiot commented a miffed Margaret Moffitt of Roanoke Va The doctors and health organizations I have spoken to however point to much higher rates of falls and fractures auto accidents and cognitive problems in older patients taking sedativehypnotics along with   Hence the American Geriatrics Societys inclusion of these drugs in its   list of treatments that doctors and patients should question Now French and Canadian researchers are reporting  in a study designed with particular care  that benzodiazepine use   and that the association strengthens with greater exposure to the drugs The more the cumulative days of use the higher the risk of later being diagnosed with dementia Dr Antoine Pariente a pharmacoepidemiologist at the University of Bordeaux and a coauthor of the study told me in an interview He and his colleagues reviewed medical records of almost  older people diagnosed with Alzheimers in the public health insurance program in Quebec and compared them with nearly  control subjects Most were over age  About half those with Alzheimers and  percent of the control subjects had used benzodiazepines the researchers found That translated to a  percent increase in the odds of a subsequent Alzheimers diagnosis among the benzodiazepine users It was not shortterm use that drove that finding Older people who took prescribed doses for  days or fewer over the course of the study  patients were followed for six years or longer  had no increased risk But those who took the drugs longer were more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimers In older patients who took daily doses for  to  days the risk rose  percent compared to those who took none In those who took daily doses for more than  days the risk was  percent higher The association persisted whether users took  doses over six months or over five years Dr Pariente said It also held when the researchers controlled for health and demographic factors including conditions like anxiety depression and insomnia The link was stronger to longeracting forms of the drug like Valium than to formulations that leave the body more quickly like Ativan and Xanax Annoyed comments may already be on their way so let me address a few likely objections Objection This is just another example of correlation not causation Does the study show that extended benzodiazepine use causes Alzheimers No an observational study like this can never directly answer that question But the stronger association observed for long term exposures reinforces the suspicion of a possible direct association the researchers wrote Dr Malaz Boustani a geriatrician at Indiana University Health and a coauthor of an   praised the studys design which attempts to correct for what is sometimes called reverse causation bias the danger as Dr Pariente put it that its not the drug that caused the disease Its the early symptoms of the disease that caused the drug use Because Alzheimers symptoms develop slowly and can include some of the very problems like anxiety and insomnia for which doctors prescribe benzos the study looked at Alzheimers patients who had not taken benzodiazepines for five years before their diagnoses Their use of the drugs occurred five to  years earlier than that They really did everything possible to overcome methodological issues Dr Boustani said of the researchers Objection Taking benzos only occasionally  once or twice a week perhaps  has no impact Not in this study Whether these elderly Quebecois took  daily doses in a row or spread them out over years their risk of later developing Alzheimers disease was nearly double that of people who did not take the drugs or who stopped at  doses And many people dont stop at  or stop at all The problem is chronic use especially in the very elderly Dr Pariente said You develop a tolerance and a dependency Objection What about relative versus absolute risk For some ailments an increase in risk of  percent or even  percent still means people face very low risk But dementia affects roughly  to  percent of the population over  Alzheimers accounts for about  percent of that The projected numbers are sobering To date the search for drugs treatments even basic causes has been discouraging What if instead of regarding these findings as scolding about drugs we saw them as a possible finding about Alzheimers prevention Stopping these medications is such an easy costeffective potential therapy Dr Boustani said Maybe that is a bit optimistic But remember that in a different Quebec study   helped  percent of longterm elderly benzo users to taper down no one should simply stop these drugs cold and discontinue their prescriptions within six months Another  percent reduced their dosage People dont want to part with their sleeping pills I told Dr Boustani remembering our earlier discussions They dont see why they should His reply Tell them Here is the information Take this into account when you decide to take a sleeping pill or notâ€Š If youre willing to take the risk OK he added Youre making an informed decision
