Global health advocates often argue that the tropical diseases that plague many countries such as malaria and dengue can be conquered simply with more money for health care  namely medicines and vaccines But a new   is a reminder that ecology also has a pretty big say in whether pathogens thrive or die off Using a statistical model researchers predicted that countries that lose biodiversity will have a heavier burden of vectorborne and parasitic diseases Their results appear this week in  The general logic is that the more organisms you have out there the more things there are that can interrupt the life cycle of disease and the less concentration youll have of any vector   a researcher at Harvard Medical School and the lead author of the paper tells Shots But plants mammals and birds are disappearing fast  onethird of the worlds species   with extinction according to the United Nations  And when the creatures that prey on mice mosquitoes or other vectors of disease go parasites and other diseasecausing agents discover its a lot easier to survive Scientists have already shown thats one reason for the explosion of Lyme disease in the Northeast United States A    in the   found that if you have a rich community of tick hosts like squirrels mice and other small mammals the disease is diluted among them But if the habitat is degraded and ticks carrying Lyme have only whitefooted mice as hosts the disease risk to humans can rise dramatically West Nile encephalitis a mosquitoborne disease   through communities with the help of surging bird populations according to a study in   Because of studies like these Bonds wanted to see how strong the causal relationship was between biodiversity and  common vectorborne and parasitic diseases on a global scale So he chose statistical methods from a new field that blends economics and ecology called macroecology to figure out how biodiversity loss affected disease burden controlling for several different variables Ultimately he found that if a country with a relatively high biodiversity such as Indonesia were to lose  percent of it the burden of disease would be expected to increase by about  percent His models also showed how diseases have a significant impact on economic development and explain differences in income between tropical and temperate countries I think what this shows is that the burden of disease is really important and its not just driven by health care he says These diseases spend so much of their lifecycles outside of humans so theyre part of the physical environment Nevertheless human disease is still generally viewed as a medical or public health problem  not an ecological problem Policymakers only just beginning to talk about conservation as they plan for public health
