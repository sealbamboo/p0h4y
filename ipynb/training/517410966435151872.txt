Proton beam radiation therapy has been touted as the next big thing in cancer care The idea enthusiasts say is that doctors can deliver higher more focused doses of radiation than they can in traditional therapy with a lower risk of side effects The massive machines housed in facilities the size of football fields have been sprouting up across the country for a decade There are already    centers in the US and a dozen more facilities are under construction even though each can cost  million to build But Indiana University last month announced that it plans to close down its   in Bloomington as reported by   I never thought that in my lifetime that I would see a proton center close says   an economist at Harvards Kennedy School of Government who studies the cost of American medical care Hes surprised because until now industry growth has been entirely in the other direction even though theres little evidence that proton therapy is better than standard radiation for all but a few very rare cancers But we do know it is substantially more expensive and substantially more lucrative for physicians and providers to use this technology Chandra says In the Washington DC area alone   are under construction One is at Johns Hopkins Medicines Sibley Memorial Hospital in DC Another is at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital and a third  the Maryland Proton Treatment Center  is slated to open at the University of Maryland in Baltimore next year  say they are continuing to build their centers despite the news out of Bloomington But in Indiana a review committee determined that it just wasnt worth spending the money that would be necessary to update their proton facility One reason for the closure is that   the treatment for common diseases such as prostate cancer and breast cancer Cigna for example only covers proton therapy for a single rare eye cancer says Dr David Finley the groups national medical officer When its used however for all other tumors its not been showing to be any more effective than other forms of radiation therapy says Finley Proton beam therapy costs three to six times as much as standard radiation therapy for illnesses like prostate cancer according to Finley He adds that when insurers pay for expensive care that   than the cheaper options it can increase the cost of everyones health care We said if two services offer the same result and one is much more expensive than the other one were only going to pay for the one that is less expensive Finley says Other major insurers including Aetna and Blue Shield of California have also limited what theyll cover with proton therapy But in Washington DC the hospitals building new proton therapy centers arent deterred by these coverage decisions by insurers In   all three hospitals said construction is continuing Two said that the larger population of Baltimore and the District can support a proton facility more readily than a small city like Bloomington The third hospital said it is building a smaller oneroom center that will be more costeffective One health care insurer that has not put any restrictions on proton therapy is Medicare And Medicare pays much more for the treatment than it pays for standard radiation therapy Thats the problem with Medicare payment policy says Harvards Chandra It not only covers treatments that are dubious treatmentsit also covers dubious treatments extremely generously But the doctors and researchers involved with building new proton beam facilities dont think the treatment is dubious They point to proton therapys potential to kill cancer without damaging surrounding tissue and they say that its just a matter of time before clinical trials prove that proton therapy is worth the extra money
