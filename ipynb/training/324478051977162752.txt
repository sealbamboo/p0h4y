If you went to Coachella last weekend you probably had a ball But will your ears pay the price While shortterm hearing loss caused by loud noise can be unnerving it may not be an automatic sign of permanent damage Temporary hearing loss may actually be the ears way of   itself from lasting damage suggests a   published Monday in the   Well if youre a mouse at any rate An international team of researchers reports that when mice are exposed to loud noise their inner ears release a   that causes a temporary reduction in hearing sensitivity determined by monitoring electrical signals in their brains As in humans this change in sensitivity can last for more than  hours says   chairman of physiology at Australias University of New South Wales and lead author of the study But mice bred to lack the receptor for this chemical showed no change in hearing sensitivity in response to loud noise It was really remarkable that hours of sound at that quite high level had no effect on the hearing at all says Housley At even higher levels of noise though the mice that lacked the receptor were much more vulnerable than regular mice to   hearing loss According to Housley this suggests somewhat counterintuitively that temporary loss of sensitivity to loud noise can be beneficial as it protects the inner ear from more serious longlasting damage In the past change in hearing sensitivity was thought to reflect a transient damaging response to noise says Housley In fact thats not the case  This really is adaptation And even though this study was done with mice Housley says that its relevant to human health as well He points to a   that found members of two Chinese families with a mutation in the gene encoding the same chemical receptor exhibited progressive hearing loss over time Scientists have been aware of the protective effect of shortterm hearing loss for quite some time says   director of the Kresge Hearing Research Institute at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor If you give a lowintensity noise you can protect against a highintensity noise he says This is a story that  has been around for quite a while Schacht who wasnt a member of the research team says that the real significance of this study is that it confirms a biochemical mechanism for how the ear protects itself from permanent damage Understanding this mechanism could be useful in the future for developing drugs to guard against loud noise So if temporary hearing loss actually does protect our ears does that mean that its safe to crank up the volume No says Housley When youre exposed to loud sound you have no way of really appreciating what the absolute sound levels are he says The actual sound level coming into your ear hasnt changed and can still be damaging Housley says that people often compensate for reduced sensitivity to noise by turning up the volume too high or tolerating loud noise for much longer than they should Our ears adaptive mechanisms provide us with an illusion that were in a safe moderate sound environment when in fact we may well not be he says
