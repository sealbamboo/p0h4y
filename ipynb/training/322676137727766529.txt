I began my career by studying intelligence and how that relates to good health he says Sometimes I found it easier to just tell people I was an intelligence researcher They reacted like that research was somehow important and fancy  When he talks about hope peoples eyes glaze over more often than not Nonetheless Lopez believes hope is the stuff of change recovery and healing  The positive physiological effects of hope are welldocumented most eloquently in Jerome Groopmans   where he writes Researchers are learning that a change in mindset has the power to alter neurochemistry  Belief and expectation  the key elements of hope  can block pain by releasing the brains endorphins and enkephalins mimicking the effects of morphine In some cases hope can also have important effects on fundamental physiological processes like respiration circulation and motor function  Groopmans research showed that during the course of illness belief and expectation  two mental states associated with hope  have an impact on the nervous system which in turn sets off a chain reaction that makes improvement and recovery more likely This process he points out is fundamental to the widely accepted   which is created by a hopeful outlook   It is less of a stretch to contemplate the link between hope and emotional wellbeing Have you ever met a happy hopeless person Lopez asks simply  Groopman observed that hope does not just involve a mindtobody connection but also a bodytomind connection where neural input about ones physical condition serves as a moderator of positive and negative emotions Hope Lopez says may buffer us from stress anxiety and the effects of negative life events   of workers over time suggest that hopeful employees experience more wellbeing And it comes as no surprise that in a Gallup poll of  million people the hopeful said they laughed and smiled much more often than the hopeless Lopez writes citing an unpublished analysis of data from the GallupHealthways Wellbeing Index and the Gallup Student Poll According to Lopez studies also show that hope promotes healthy behaviors including   regular exercise safe sex practices and quitting smoking  In each case writes Lopez hope for the future is clearly linked with daily habits that support health and prevent disease Thats because hope triggers a virtuous cycle Hopeful people conjure a vision that sustains them that causes them to show up for the hard work and accept setbacks Lopez says They make an investment in the future that pays off in the present in the way they eat exercise conserve energy take care of themselves and stick to their treatment plan In  Duane Bidwell an associate professor of practical theology at Claremont School of Theology in California set out to study hope among children suffering from chronic illness  We felt there was insufficient theory about hope from childrens perspectives he says Most of the research was based on and extrapolated from adult experiences and then applied to kids  Bidwell and his colleague Dr Donald Batisky a pediatric nephrologist at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta analyzed vast amounts of data from a diverse group of children suffering from endstage renal failure    The researchers identified five main pathways to hope They are     by continuing to participate in activities and relationships that help patients retain a sense of self outside diagnosis and treatment    through formal and informal connections that help patients understand they are not alone in living with disease This community is made real through conversation visitation consultation and participation in daily activities     by taking an active role in treatment by setting goals selfadvocating monitoring and maintaining ones own health     activated through religious spiritual and other contemplative practices    which involves both gaining pragmatic medical wisdom derived from ones own experience and finding ways to give back  The pathways are not hierarchical in any way Bidwell says You can access hope through any of these pathways and all of them The more of them you can access the better   Literature tends to treat hope as an existential experience virtue or emotion Bidwell says But the children Bidwell studied revealed that hope is a social resource It emerges through interactions with the people who surround us and is then internalized  Whats important says Bidwell is for the patients team members  family members doctors nurses social workers friends and chaplains among others  to do things that help create and activate hope pathways for the patient  When asked what he found most compelling or surprising about his findings Bidwell says his team asked the children to talk about a time when hope became real during their disease treatment  More often than not he recalled they told us about ordinary moments with family and friends  saying grace around the dinner table times when they were aware of the abundance they had in their lives even though  they build their lives around dialysis and medication  We so often discount these ordinary daily moments Bidwell says But those who are more intentional about the practices that bring hope right now are better able to take care of themselves The children in Bidwells study experienced mostly psychosocial suffering he says Things like being different from their peers because they were stuck to a dialysis machine or always on medication Hope enabled the children to claim power  to say Heres where the disease gets to influence my life and heres where it doesnt get to influence my life  Im normal Bidwell recalls a young girl telling him Hope helps me be more normal  There is a thin line between hope and denial and that line is an unwavering commitment to truth and reality  Groopman writes False hope does not recognize the risks and dangers that true hope does False hope can lead to intemperate choices and flawed decision making True hope takes into account the real threats that exist and seeks to navigate the best path around them  Both Lopez and Bidwell emphasize that hope is not about positive thinking Hope is half optimism Lopez explains The other half is the belief in the power that you can make it so  There is a profound difference between hoping and wishing he continues Wishing encourages passivity whereas hope represents an active stance  Wishing is the fantasy that everything is going to turn out OK Hoping is actually showing up for the hard work
