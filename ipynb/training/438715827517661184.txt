Highintensity interval training a type of workout that consists of   has become enormously popular in recent years A main reason is that although such workouts are draining they can be   often lasting only a few minutes   But people take notably different approaches to this form of exercise Some complete only one sustained allout four or five minute bike ride or sprint  a single interval  and then are done Others practice standard interval training involving repeated brief bursts of almost unbearably taxing exertion interspersed with restful minutes of gentler exercise Some people perform such sessions two or three times per week others almost every day  The science of intensive interval training has though been lagging behind the workouts popularity Past studies of HIIT as the practice is commonly known had established that as measured by changes in cellular markers  standard shortburst HIIT training may improve aerobic fitness up to  times as much as moderate endurance training But scientists had not determined whether a single sustained interval likewise improves fitness or the ideal number of HIIT sessions per week  So to clarify those issues researchers at two of the laboratories most noted for HIIT science set out to learn more about the best way to do interval training  First for a   scientists at McMaster University in Ontario gathered  healthy young men and women and divided them into groups Ten of them were asked to exercise on two separate days On one day they completed a standard HIIT session consisting of four second bouts of allout tonguelolling effort on a stationary bicycle alternating with four minutes of recovery between On another day they completed a single uninterrupted interval lasting for about four minutes by which time each rider had combusted the same amount of energy as during the stopandgo session Before and after the workouts the scientists gathered blood and muscle samples  Separately the remaining seven volunteers did the continuous fourminute workout three times a week for six weeks The researchers again collected blood and muscle samples and monitored changes in the riders athletic performance by having them ride as hard as possible for a specified period of time When collated and compared the data showed that the physiological differences among the two groups of riders were notable and in some ways strange  On the one hand the scientists found no significant variations in how the muscles of riders in the first group responded to a single session of interval training whether of the standard stopandgo variety or a sole sustained effort In both cases the riders showed immediate postexercise increases in their blood levels of certain proteins associated with eventual improvements in endurance capacity  But when the researchers checked blood and muscle tissue in the second group of riders after they had completed six weeks of singleinterval training some of the pending improvements seemed to have evaporated These riders muscle tissues now had only average  not augmented  amounts of the chemicals that help cells to produce more energy a reliable marker of fitness This finding was in stark contrast to the results of earlier work by the same researchers in which they found that six weeks of standard shortburst HIIT exercise resulted in significant sustained gains in these markers  The implications of the new study are not altogether clear said Martin Gibala the chairman of the department of kinesiology at McMaster University and senior author of the study but it would appear he said that there is something important even essential about the pulsative nature of onoff HIIT training if you wish to reap sustained physiological improvements In more practical terms before you riff on your current workout check to see whether reliable science supports your improvisation That caution is underscored by the results of the other major new study of interval training this one    and undertaken at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim Norway In it scientists asked volunteers to perform a total of  standard HIIT sessions over either three or eight weeks meaning that the volunteers exercised either three times per week or almost every day and sometimes twice on the same day At the end of the prescribed time those who had completed three HIIT sessions per week had improved their endurance capacity by almost  percent But those exercising daily displayed no such improvements and in some endurance declined Only after those volunteers had quit training altogether did their aerobic capacity creep upward after  days of rest their endurance peaked at about  percent above what it had been at the start suggesting the researchers believe that daily highintensity interval sessions are too frequent and exhausting In that situation fatigue blunts physical adaptations  The takeaway of both studies is that it is best if you wish to perform highintensity interval training to stick to what is well documented as effective a few sessions per week of  or second intervals so strenuous you moan followed by a minute or so of blessed recovery and a painful repetition or four Done correctly such sessions in my experience get you out of the gym quickly and inspire truly inventive cursing
