On Day  of my longcoveted trial of a treadmill desk I sat down Day  had been all about showing off Yes you can type while walking I chirped to my fellow reporters No you cant fall off at the machines top speed of two miles per hour I assured the ergonomics safety squad On Day  while strolling in my newsroom cubicle I had written emails made phone calls read material for a story I am researching bragged to my friends on instant message and scrolled triumphantly through my tread desk folder where I had filed such articles from my own newspaper as       and   By lunchtime on Day  at a slowbutsteady one mile per hour I had burned about  calories without noticing When I finished a long phone interview I was thirsty a little sweaty and downright cheery feeling the slight mood elevation that comes from a walk through the park But when an editor asked for the top of my story I spent half an hour straining to form a sentence Slowing down didnt help You know I need all of your energy my brain seemed to be saying if you want this to be good My obsession with treadmill desks began a few years ago when I read of the mounting research linking sitting to elevated disease risk and early death as I was glued to my chair writing a long article about   research Like about threequarters of Americans I had always performed large parts of my job sitting down I walk three miles to work each morning and sometimes ride my bike up hills on weekends But regular   the research showed did not offset the perils of sitting for several hours a day   warned Runners World magazine Shaving a few hours of sitting off your total daily sitting time appeared to help In one study women ages  to  who sat six or more hours a day   than those who sat for three hours or less Still any sitting looked to be pretty bad   found that when their leg muscles were disengaged they simply stopped producing a key molecule the body needs to process fats So I decided to work standing up I raised the height of my laptop by setting it on a pile of books But that proved uncomfortable and I figured that if I was going to stand I might as well be walking  the way everyone else on the Internet suddenly seemed to be First   treadmill desks which consist of an adjustableheight desk surface atop a treadmill optimized for use at slow speeds were clearly gaining ground Lawyers computer programmers college professors and no shortage of writers I noticed were blogging their praises and posting their workday mileage On the road away from tread desk sitting in long traincar rides Rebecca Skloot an author tweeted last year to A J Jacobs who wrote about the virtues of his tread desk from his tread desk in his own latest book The horror As bad as it seemed to have my life cut short by jobrelated sitting the idea that others with the right technology could escape the same fate made it worse Still I hesitated Unlike many treaddesk evangelists I dont work at home Nor is The New York Times newsroom one of those trendy open spaces like the Silicon Valley companies that offer tread desks along with free back massages and healthful snacks I would have to use the contraption in my footbyfoot cubicle Would it disturb my neighbors Would I be mocked Would I even be allowed to set it up What if I hated it after all that As an experiment I ordered one for home The low hum of its motor sounded like a vacuum cleaner on the hardwood floors of our Upper West Side apartment where it took up roughly twothirds of any room all of which are already fully occupied I sent it back without having put it through its paces Then by happy coincidence I received an email from the editors of this section asking for contributions on personal health technology I had been working for months mostly seated on   With what was left of my atrophied leg muscles I jumped to volunteer For the sake of the story I explained I would need to  temporarily  at least install a treadmill at my desk It took just a few minutes to remove my regular desk to make room for the  loaner from Steelcase LifeSpan Ergotron TreadDesk and others also make popular models starting around  Other than it moving under my feet its just your basic desk with a console that displays my distance time and calories burned There is a start button and a stop button one to adjust the speed and another the height There was even enough space in my allotted cube for my chair and a small table so I could sit and write After a few false starts I began to learn to adjust my speed to the task at hand Sometimes I was walking too fast to concentrate but sometimes a slow pace seemed to be a drag on my work So when I felt my body getting in the way of my brain I just pushed the treadmills up or down buttons When it comes to synthesizing a lot of information into a coherent article the hardest part of my job I still have the powerful urge to sit And I pause when editors come by to talk because it seems rude to burn calories while they stand still But ideal emailwriting speeds range from half a mile to  miles per hour and the perfect balance for phone interviews is closer to two miles per hour Not all of my colleagues share my treaddesk enthusiasm I have enough trouble doing my job as it is a Metro reporter told me Others saw it as a multitasking slippery slope One hums the   from Wizard of Oz when he passes by roughly in time with my own footfalls On the other hand it is sometimes hard to get the managing editor off my treadmill so I can get some work done He feels it should go faster and include an incline feature Many have exclaimed about the weightloss prospects One hundred calories per hour on average adds up And there has been a constant stream of visitors drawn by the bobbing of my head above the line of cubicle walls asking for a demonstration As my second week drew to a close I was logging fivemile days It seemed clear that I was reaping some of the health benefits of the treadmill desk But as I started to write this  sitting down  I wondered whether I had missed out on something almost as important that it might offer Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development I learned had found that children and young adults improved cognitive performance when walking at their preferred speed Could walking while writing actually improve my stories as well as my health And could I retrain my brain to do it Could those punchy but profound endings that I invariably conceive when Im out exercising but cant remember when Im in front of the screen be channeled by the tread desk I might just have to keep it for a while to find out
