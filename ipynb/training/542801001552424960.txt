For centuries the central challenge in health care was ignorance There simply wasnt enough information to know what was making a person sick or what to do to cure them Now health care is being flooded with information Advances in computing technology mean that gathering storing and analyzing health information is relatively cheap and its getting cheaper by the day As computers continue to fall in price the cost of sequencing a single persons genome is tumbling too Entrepreneur   is working on wearable realtime monitors to give doctors the ability to interrogate a persons individual blood cells all the way down to the atom level to see how a given drug works or why it fails The information from patients around the globe could then be compared in theory Computers could ultimately help doctors match specific treatments at the molecular level to the people for whom they would work best Software might also detect patterns in data that would suggest new uses for existing drugs Collecting biochemical and genomic data on billions of people around the world is just the tip of the data iceberg that a few dozen health information technology experts described recently in New York at a   sponsored by   magazine You now have all of health care digitized which is pretty cool said Paul Black president of the electronic health records company   But its still unclear how to make sense of all the digital information on a bigpicture scale Theres different approaches in the marketplace to how you would make this all be actually valuable to people Black said Some doctors are finding it valuable to see the community information versus just the campus information meaning if they know where their patients are going for health care beyond their hospital or office and whether theyre actually filling all the prescriptions theyve been given doctors make different treatment decisions nearly  percent of the time Black said Companies like   are betting that they can come up with ways to analyze seemingly unrelated data about how and why people use health care to improve health and save corporations money Castlights   said We can now actually marry information from corporate human resources systems  Are you a high performer in your company Whats your absenteeism been  with medical claims to really understand that among our high performers were having a lot of absenteeism because their kids asthma is not well controlled There are concerns about privacy and data security Blackberry CEO John Chen pitched his companys mobile devices as secure enough to meet federal medical privacy laws But the Forbes event was more focused on the potential benefits in the new Big Data world Theres a lot of optimism that having a more complete picture of peoples health and how they use the health care system will save insurance companies money and drive health care premiums down Kevin Nazemi coCEO of   believes that a new generation of wearable wireless sensors will soon help doctors detect health problems early enough to prevent expensive treatments But Nazemi said its still hard for insurance companies to justify investing up front in data systems when the value is reaped in Year  or  in a market where people switch insurance on average every three years You know dollar in  cents back How do you think of that David Goldhill who runs a cable TV network and is the     is skeptical that technological breakthroughs even if they make people healthier will ever tame health care spending We didnt go from  percent to  percent of GDP on health care spending because Americans got a lot less healthy he said The increase in spending in health care isnt because Oh my god were sick and if we can just cure ourselves its going to go away  he said Its a business model issue its the way we subsidize and manage demand Some see a future when wirelessly enabled skin patches are cheap common and accumulating personal health data on a massive scale and all that data leads to better cures and detects health problems before they blossom into expensive diagnoses Others an era where every minute abnormality dangerous or not are identified and money is spent needlessly treating them Yale Medical School cardiologist and   is optimistic about medicines ability to reel in meaningful insights in that vast sea of data But he says its going to require a major shift in culture in clinics and hospitals He says its still the norm for doctors to rely on their memories to determine whether a given drug is right for a particular patient as if nobodys walking with a computer on their holster
