Coverage under President Barack Obamas health care law wont be cheap but costconscious consumers hunting for lower premiums will have plenty of options according to two independent private studies A study released Thursday by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation found that government tax credits would lower the sticker price on a benchmark silver policy to a little over  a month for single people making about  regardless of their age By pairing their tax credit with a strippeddown bronze policy some younger consumers can bring their premiums down to the range of  to  a month while older people can drive their monthly cost even lower  well below   if they are willing to take a chance with higher deductibles and copays A separate study released Wednesday from Avalere Health a private data analysis firm took a wideangle view averaging the sticker prices of policies at different coverage levels Before tax credits which act like a discount premiums for a yearold buying a midrange silver policy would be about  a month the Avalere study found Listprice premiums for a yearold buying a midrange plan will average close to  For a yearold they were nearly double that at  a month Starting Oct  those who dont have health care coverage on the job can go to new online insurance markets in their states to shop for a private plan and find out if they qualify for a tax credit An estimated four out five consumers in the new markets will be eligible for some level of tax credit Come Jan  virtually all Americans will be required to have coverage or face fines At the same time insurance companies will no longer be able to turn away people in poor health The Obama administration which is running the markets or taking the lead in  states is not expected to release final premiums until close to the Oct  launch date But the two private studies provide an early look at the emerging market Caroline Pearson lead author of the Avalere study said it will be competitive but there will be big price differences among age groups states and even within states The bottom line is mixed Many consumers will like their new options particularly if they qualify for a tax credit But others may have to stretch to afford coverage We are seeing competitive offerings in every market if you buy toward the low end of whats available said Pearson a vice president of Avalere However for uninsured people who are paying nothing today this is still a big cost that theyre expected to fit into their budgets Pearson added The Obama administration said consumers will have options that are cheaper than the averages presented in the Avalere study Were consistently seeing that premiums will be lower than expected a spokeswoman said For the many people that qualify for a tax credit the cost will be even lower The Kaiser study found that while premiums will vary significantly across the country they are generally coming in lower than forecast by the governments own experts It cautioned against comparing premiums under Obamas law to what individually insured people currently pay because the new coverage is more robust Avalere crunched the numbers on premiums filed by insurers in  states and Washington DC Kaiser analyzed  states and DC Both studies included a mix of states running their own insurance markets and ones in which the federal government will take charge The states analyzed by Avalere were California Connecticut Indiana Maryland New York Ohio Rhode Island South Dakota Vermont Virginia and Washington In addition to those Kaiser included Colorado Maine Montana Nebraska New Mexico and Oregon No data on premiums were publicly available for Texas and Florida  together they are home to more than  million of the nations nearly  million uninsured people  and key to the laws success However Pearson said shes confident the premiums in the Avalere study will be quite representative of other states because clear pricing patterns emerged Four levels of plans will be available under Obamas law bronze silver gold and platinum Bronze plans will cover  percent of expected medical costs silver plans will cover  percent gold will cover  percent and platinum  percent All plans cover the same benefits but bronze features the lowest premiums paired with higher deductibles and copays Platinum plans would have the lowest outofpocket costs and the highest premiums Midrange silver plans are considered the benchmark because the tax credits will be keyed to the cost of the secondlowestcost silver plan in a local area And theres another important detail for consumers to be aware of People with modest incomes may come out ahead by sticking with a silver plan instead of going for the lower premiums with bronze Additional help with outofpocket costs like copays will only be available to people enrolling in a silver plan Although the sticker price for premiums rises dramatically above age  the tax credits are shaping up as a powerful equalizer for older consumers Thats because they work by limiting what you pay for premiums to a given percentage of your income For example someone making  would pay no more than  percent of his or her annual income    for a benchmark silver plan The amount you pay stays the same whether the total premium is  or  However those tax credits taper off rapidly for people with solid middleclass incomes above  for an individual and  for a family of four The Avalere study also found some striking price differences within certain states generally larger ones In New York with  insurers participating the difference between the cheapest and priciest silver premium was  Â
