This week the international yoga community said goodbye to a beloved teacher BKS Iyengar who died at  He is credited with   and making it accessible to every age and walk of life To learn more about what makes Iyengar yoga so special to those who practice it I spoke with Carrie Owerko a teacher at the   She was also a student of BKS Iyengar studying with him in India in February Heres an edited version of our conversation Why was BKS Iyengar such an important teacher BKS Iyengar was really a pioneer He was one of the people who brought yoga to the West and really made it popular because he made it approachable for anyone He felt that yoga was for everybody No matter what the challenges  physical challenges mental challenges or age  he didnt see any limitation  I think one of his main contributions was making yoga accessible but also the degree of attention he gave to the practices of asana or postural yoga and to pranayama the breathing exercises was immense He was also an amazing communicator He was constantly finding new ways to help his students increase their capacity to be aware of what was going on in their bodies and minds  Iyengar is a lot of the yoga people experience in the United States The teacher may not be teaching Iyengar but that teacher has been influenced by Iyengar yoga in some way What is unique about Iyengar yoga What distinguishes Iyengar yoga is the very high degree of attention paid to alignment Props may be used to increase awareness and to make the poses accessible Sometimes we hold the poses longer than students might be used to in a flowstyle class There is an emphasis on movement but then learning how to calmly abide in the body  The diversity of practice is another distinguishing element We dont do one sequence every day That is the case in other popular types of yoga where there might be a consistent sequence repeated day to day Even though we do repeat some of the same poses there is a lot of diversity in the sequencing In my experience that helps prevent injury and overuse His approach is therapeutic in nature That is a huge aspect to the practice Why did Mr Iyengar use props in his teaching Take the yoga block Everybody knows a yoga block Its something you can get at Bed Bath  Beyond The prototype of the yoga block was actually a rock or cinder block from BKS Iyengars garden When he was teaching students he would sometimes place students over his knee for a supported back arch if they couldnt support themselves The story goes that he asked his daughter to go in the yard and bring this cinder block to help That was the beginning of the yoga block He would use whatever was in the environment  tables chairs ropes The more common props  belts straps blocks and chairs this is the type of equipment that was not really used in the practice of yoga Now everybody is using them There are never enough props to go around Is there a distinguishing pose or style of pose that is unique to Iyengar yoga I dont know of a pose that we do exclusively in Iyengar that is not done in other styles But the headstand and shoulder stand are really important poses in our practice They are not always taught in other styles of yoga We have alternatives for people who are not able to do them If someone comes to an Iyengar class they know there will be some inverted pose that is taught We dont require people to do them but we try to make them accessible and safe We insist on a yoga blanket to prevent overstretching of the neck area Iyengar yoga is very cautious and mindful When did you last practice with Mr Iyengar In February of this year I was in India and BKS Iyengar was in the practice Even though his daughter and son and now his granddaughter are teaching the majority of the classes now he would be in the practice hall every single day correcting people and engaging people Even at  years old he couldnt help himself He had to teach It was his calling  Do you have any special memories of him There were several different times where we had exchanges and encounters He notices everything One memory that stands out  I hadnt been to India for a few years He saw me and said Oh a little bit thin I had only lost like three pounds and thought How could he possibly notice that We were laughing My mother doesnt even do that  Another time when he was in the United States for his book tour we had done a demonstration of poses at the City Center in New York to celebrate his book tour He loved the theatrical and we did this demonstration and he was very enthusiastic  I remember when we were at the institute he looked me in the eye and said You have to maintain To someone who doesnt practice yoga that might not mean anything but we had worked so hard It pushes you to break into new territory and challenge yourself and after doing that you might back off But that thing about maintaining the practice that really stuck Excellence is what he wanted of us Its hard to put into words what you feel for someone who has changed your life
