Americans have long been told that the cure for obesity is simple Eat fewer calories and exercise more But a new documentary challenges that notion making the case that Americans have been misled by the idea that we get fat simply because we consume more calories than we expend The film explores what it sees as some of the more insidious corporate and political forces behind the rise of childhood obesity and it examines whether increasing levels of sugar consumption have played an outsized role in the epidemic The film called Fed Up has as executive producers Katie Couric the former anchor of The CBS Evening News and Laurie David who was also a producer of the global warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth Ms Couric who narrates the film said she came up with the idea after years of covering the obesity epidemic left her with more questions than answers What struck me was that the more I reported on childhood obesity and the longer I was in this business the worse the problem seemed to be getting Ms Couric said in an interview I felt like we were never really giving people a handle on what was causing this and why the rates were skyrocketing the way they were The film draws on commentary from obesity experts and nutrition scientists and it tells the stories of several obese children around the country who struggle to lose weight despite strict dieting and in some cases hours of daily exercise But at the heart of the film is a question that is widely debated among scientists Are all calories equal Dr David Ludwig the director of the obesity program at Boston Childrens Hospital argues in the film that they are not   Dr Ludwig has shown that highcarbohydrate diets appear to slow metabolic rates compared to diets higher in fat and protein so that people expend less energy even when consuming the same number of calories Dr Ludwig has found that unlike calories from socalled low glycemic foods like beans nuts and nonstarchy vegetables those from high glycemic foods such as sugar bread and potatoes spike blood sugar and stimulate hunger and cravings which can drive people to overeat While people can certainly lose weight in the short term by focusing on calories Dr Ludwig said studies show that the majority of people on calorierestricted diets eventually fail The common explanation is that people have difficulty resisting temptation he said But another possibility is that highly processed foods undermine our metabolism and overwhelm our behavior At Harvard Medical School Dr Dariush Mozaffarian an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology whose research was cited by experts in the film said that the longheld idea that we get fat solely because we consume more calories than we expend is based on outdated science  He   that different foods have on weight gain and said that it is true that  calories of fat protein and carbohydrates are the same in a thermodynamic sense in that they release the same amount of energy when exposed to a Bunsen burner in a lab But in a complex organism like a human being he said these foods influence satiety metabolic rate brain activity blood sugar and the hormones that store fat in very different ways  that calories from different foods are not absorbed the same When people eat highfiber foods like nuts and some vegetables for example only about threequarters of the calories they contain are absorbed The rest are excreted from the body unused So the calories listed on their labels are not what the body is actually getting The implicit suggestion is that there are no bad calories just bad people eating too much Dr Mozaffarian said But the evidence is very clear that not all calories are created equal as far as weight gain and obesity If youre focusing on calories you can easily be misguided Some of the harshest criticism in the film is aimed at    led by companies like CocaCola and PepsiCo  to remove calories from their products in an effort to address obesity  If somebody is drowning in a swimming pool you could remove a few gallons of water from the pool and that person will still likely drown Dr Ludwig said Whether there is on average  calories in the food supply too many per person or  is really unlikely to make a meaningful difference What would make a difference is improvement in the quality of the foods available But Marianne Smith Edge of the International Food Information Council an industryfinanced group that   of Fed Up said the film overstates data on how much sugar Americans are consuming and wrongly portrays sugar as a lone dietary villain much as dietary fat was vilified in decades past Just as research in the last few years has vindicated some fats and shown them to be beneficial she said the science on sugar is evolving as well I think the focus on particular nutrients doesnt tell you the true story she said It really is about overall calorie consumption and reduced physical activity Ms Smith Edge who is a registered dietitian   by Y Claire Wang of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University which showed that the average child must eliminate  calories a day in order for the childhood obesity rate to fall to  percent by  a goal set by the federal government In an interview Dr Wang said that for the most part if were just talking about body weight and obesity the evidence seems to point in the direction that calories are calories Dr Wang said that studies consistently show that sugary beverages potato chips and other highglycemic foods are indeed associated with weight gain But this is because they are rapidly digested and easy to consume in large amounts not because they bypass our energy balance Dr Wang said however that reducing calories should not be the sole focus of obesity prevention programs Studies show for example that sugary beverages are linked to an increased risk of diabetes and other chronic diseases but their impact on body weight  explains only half of the increased risk Dr Wang said These foods mess up our insulin regulation system and affect other inflammatory pathways she said And that has nothing to do with how they affect body weight Ms Couric who has two children said that she became involved in making the film as a mom and a concerned citizen and that her goal was to start a national dialogue about the quality of our food supply This film doesnt purport to have all the answers Ms Couric said But this is a wakeup call that I hope will spur some solutions This is not just about carrying a few extra pounds or looking better in your bathing suit This is a national epidemic with huge societal ramifications
