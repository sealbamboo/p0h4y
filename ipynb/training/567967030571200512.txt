And now they tell me As I approach my th birthday   PHE has revealed that the flu jab I had back in September is only  effective   of the AHN virus There has been a genetic drift in the virus since the vaccine to counteract the original strain was ordered for the NHS back in February last year The virus chooses as its target frail old people with multiple comorbidities So here am I virtually defenceless against it To make it worse I heard last week that the death rate among old people this winter has gone up by almost a third  The odds dear reader are that this will the last article I write for you But be of good cheer its now February and in a month spring will be here and the flu virus will fade away Hope springs eternal in the human breast I am disturbed that officialdom has announced this unfolding disaster so late a month after smart people had already twigged what was happening At the beginning of January an acquaintance who happens to be the chairman of one of the larger London teaching hospitals started hunting for the reason for the spike in AE visits He and his advisers were aware of all the trends people like me living longer and with more complex conditions drunks stumbling in over Christmas the  service directing too many people to AE patients coming to hospital in desperation because they cannot wait two weeks for a GP appointment and some arriving with trivial complaints cuts in social services closing down community beds and causing bedblocks in hospitals  the list goes on All these well understood trends were factored into the hospitals planning for the Christmas surge but they didnt explain the spike On  January  four weeks before PHE announced that the new flu strain had outsmarted the   vaccine  my friend who has an enquiring mind and disinclined not accept without question what the managers and hospital consultants tell him emailed me He said his chief nurse had told him that this years flu jab is notably less effective than previously It is missing one strain which is now around Consequently there is more flu and given more old people this is leading to respiratory cardiac and other complications including pneumonia This of course would explain the timing of the huge increase in AE admissions because six weeks before Christmas is the beginning of the flu season His chief nurse was right as chief nurses usually are and she preempted PHE in putting her finger on the real reason for the upturn before anybody else gathered enough evidence to go public The moral here is that if you want a quick and reliable answer to a health crisis dont wait for the official statistics from national bodies or the qualified views of hospital managers whose instinct is to cover up bad news and consultants who live in hermetically sealed boxes of their specialities Ask the nurses as it is they who know what is really going on in any hospital It might leave you time to do something to mend the problem If you wait for the completed statistics and the carefully weighed and considered opinions of the bureaucrats or academics  or later the spin of the politicians  you will have missed the bus It will be too late to change things for the better My friend is particularly incensed about the political kerfuffle the AE crisis has prompted To him all the political toing and froing is so much hot air The pressure AE is under has nothing to do with all that  it is down to a mistaken flu jab formulation Look for history to repeat itself next Christmas as the  flu jab formulation will be fixed in February
