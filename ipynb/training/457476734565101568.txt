What doesnt kill us only makes us stronger right Well not when it comes to bullying Some may still consider bullying a harmless part of growing up but mounting evidence suggests that the adverse effects of being bullied arent something kids can just shake off The psychological and physical tolls like anxiety and depression can   In fact the damage doesnt stop there a British   published this week in the   suggests It actually lasts well into the adults s and s Midlife  is an important stage in life because that sets in place the process of aging says   a developmental psychologist at Kings College London and the studys senior author At age  if you have physical and mental health problems it could be downhill from here And health isnt the only thing to worry about Chronic bullyings effect on a persons socioeconomic status social life and even cognitive function can persist decades later too Arseneaults research suggests The study began with a national survey of nearly  children in England Scotland and Wales who were born during a single week in  Their parents were interviewed twice  once when the kids turned  and again when they turned   about how often the children were bullied Researchers also noted the childrens IQ score at the time and checked reports from teachers for any behavioral problems indicative of anxiety or depression in the kids Then for four decades they checked in periodically with roughly  of those children recording their health socioeconomic status and social wellbeing at ages   and again at  More than  percent of the children were reported as having been occasionally or frequently bullied at age  and   not too far from todays estimates in the US where up to   say theyve been bullied at least once within a month Researchers found that at age  those whod been bullied  particularly those who were repeatedly bullied  reported somewhat poorer physical health than those who hadnt been and also had an increased incidence of anxiety depression and suicidal thoughts They also had lower education attainment memory tests indicated that they tended as a group to have somewhat poorer cognitive function than those who werent bullied The study accounted for other factors that might have confounded the results Arseneault says such as poverty during childhood family conflict and evidence of physical and sexual abuse Though the study couldnt definitively say the bullying caused the longlasting problems Arseneault says other studies and statistical tests suggest the association is more than coincidental In terms of relationship they seem to be less likely to live with a partner and to have friends who they can speak to or rely on if theyre sick Arseneault tells Shots As they get older you would think that maybe they would grow out of it  but its not what were showing The study is impressive says   a clinical psychologist and epidemiologist at Duke University who wasnt involved in the British research but has done work on the longterm effects of bullying This is the longest followup study we have of victims of bullying to date he says People need to shift their thinking on bullying Copeland says from considering it a harmless rite of passage to this kind of critical childhood experience that can really change ones trajectory for decades and decades Bullying is somewhat different today from what it was in the s  cyberbullying on the Internet has extended its reach Copeland says the concept remains the same singling out a weaker person as the target for repeated intentional harm Its just that the abuse is no longer confined to schools and playgrounds he says It can happen in the nolongersafe haven of a childs home Victims need some place where they can get away from the abuse and feel safe Copeland tells Shots As you lose that as youre getting teased constantly that can lead people to have much worse outcomes and to feel like theres really no way they can escape As we see more and more studies like this Copeland says I think people are going to be more and more comfortable thinking of bullying in the same way we think of other sorts of maltreatment in childhood  as something thats just not tolerated
