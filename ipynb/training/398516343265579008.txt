His white beard made him look much older than his  years His overalls and the plain dress and bonnet worn by his wife sitting by his side were incongruous with the starched white of his bedsheets and the crisp officialsounding blips coming from the machine monitoring his vital signs He lay comfortably hands clasped in his lap Its nice to meet you though Im sorry its under these circumstances I said as I shook his hand his grip much stronger than mine We already had confirmation of his leukemia from a test flow cytometry that we had performed on his blood I told him this and started a discussion about treatment options Given your young age and good health I recommend we treat your leukemia with intensive chemotherapy which we give here in the hospital You would need to remain here though for four to six weeks He absorbed this information and I could see him consider the effect this would have on his business and his ability to provide for his family Well let me ask you a question he said his voice both serious and philosophical What if I chose to leave the hospital without treatment and go back home His leukemia was particularly aggressive and had already started to affect his organs He also had a fever I told him there was a good chance he would die in the next few days if he left What is your reticence in being treated I asked He set his jaw Ive seen too many folks spend their remaining time getting chemotherapy only to die anyway Ill not go through this if it means just a few more months to live He looked squarely at me This world is not my final destiny anyway I explained that sometimes the leukemia was curable and the number of chemotherapy courses finite but acknowledged that he was right with bad leukemias like his treatment could be futile Something else seemed to be troubling him Are you worried at all about the cost to your community of a hospital stay I asked Many Amish do not carry private insurance but pay for a members catastrophic illness by pooling their resources For the first time his wife spoke I think thats part of it I am a deacon and see the hospital bills that come through he said  It just doesnt seem worth the cost He made up his mind and left the hospital soon after We cobbled together the best plan we could for him to be cared for as an outpatient with a doctor I trusted in nearby Wooster Ohio Later that day I visited an yearold woman with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome in the intensive care unit As a result of her disease her platelets were very low and she had suffered a subdural hematoma a bleed into her head In contrast to the quiet of the leukemia floor the ICU was cacophonous with blaring machines and people talking loudly to be heard over them I had met her weeks before at a patient conference and recalled that she and her family had emigrated from the United Kingdom She had asked intelligent questions and set clear goals of how to manage her disease I admired her focus When I walked into her room though she was a fragment of the woman I remembered One eye was closed one open half of her face animate half slack I greeted her and held her hand but she didnt respond Her husband son and daughter were in the room and motioned for me to step out with them Her son who was a doctor spoke The neurosurgeon came by and recommended putting a burr hole in her skull to relieve the pressure The professional side of me wants to try it but I think Im outnumbered She would never want that her husband said Shes lived to be  years old and her time has come Enough is enough His voice cracked Im lucky to have had the  years with her that I did He started sobbing and his daughter hugged him tight comforting him Can we just move her someplace quiet away from all this she asked We transferred her to a palliative medicine floor and she died within hours As the Affordable Care Act is being put in place we hear a lot of debate on how best to control spiraling health care costs We should pause to consider that a critical component to true health care reform is in changing our core expectations about the use of heroic measures at the end of life and whether to treat illnesses that are likely incurable In this respect sometimes its our patients who can teach us the most
