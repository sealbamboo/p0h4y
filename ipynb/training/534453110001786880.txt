Prices for common medical tests like mammograms and MRIs are notoriously opaque Negotiated rates between insurance companies and doctors or hospitals are sealed tight by contract We know theres price variation but comparing what one insurance company pays versus another is virtually impossible Thats why we here at KQED in San Francisco turned to members of our audience to help us find out what medical tests and devices cost Together with our collaborators   and   a New York City startup dedicated to health cost transparency   to make it easy for people to share what they paid  and to make it easy for you to see applestoapples comparisons of prices Would people share Yes Since we started the project in June hundreds of people have shared prices and thousands more have searched our database to look up prices And on Monday the journal     I wrote to tell doctors about our findings We asked people to share prices for four common medical procedures mammograms lowerback MRIs IUDs and diabetes test strips  although plenty of people shared prices for other procedures too Our form can take virtually any share We started with mammograms because this test is done   across the country Since screening mammograms are a test that can be scheduled women can in theory call around and select a facility based on price We thought we would find variation and indeed we did In California commercial insurers paid from  to  for a screening mammogram In Los Angeles s insurer paid  more than the lowestcost screening mammogram reported in the area Im sure every woman whos had a mammogram had the exact same experience I did this woman said It was a friendly technician but I dont think thats worth maybe  extra dollars In lowerback MRIs we found that for CPT code  insurers paid from  to  But when we looked beyond commercial insurers we found even greater variation  from a low of  to a selfpay price of  at an academic medical center That  MRI was paid by Medicare and was just a fraction of the facilitys charge of  But the variation doesnt stop there Yet another person went to the same facility and was charged  for the same procedure same CPT code This patient had commercial insurance but paid the entire amount out of pocket the patient wrote since I had not yet met my deductible Until recently consumers didnt have much incentive to shop on price in health care They might have paid a small copay insurance picked up the rest But today many people have highdeductible health plans So it might matter to you if the price your insurer negotiated at Facility A is hundreds of dollars more than at Facility B In the comments on our PriceCheck coverage people have told of their frustration fury might be a better word We received thoughtful and pointed questions on two fronts First many people ask about quality Should people be shopping for health care procedures in the same way they shop for a computer or canned goods This is a reasonable question but the problem is that cost and quality are unfortunately not connected in health care Theres no evidence that getting the most expensive treatment or procedure will yield a better outcome People are starting to wonder why theyre paying dramatically more if that extra money isnt buying better health We also hear skepticism about the reliability of crowdsourced data Yes these data are crowdsourced and as such may contain errors But at PriceCheck we believe that pushing for cost transparency helps drive quality discussions too   requires insurers to make their prices public in advance As I wrote in   This story was produced by   KQEDs health blog
