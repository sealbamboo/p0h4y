Women have choices in contraception from pills and injections to intrauterine devices and the NuvaRing But when women discuss birth control with their doctors they may not be getting all the information they want a survey finds Doctors tend to think its most important to discuss how to use contraceptives and which methods are most effective at preventing pregnancy according to the   which was published in the journal   Women on the other hand are often more concerned about safety side effects and how the contraceptives work Researchers surveyed  women aged  to  and  health care providers The women were either using contraceptives or interested in using them While  percent of them ranked questions about safety as one of their top three concerns only  percent of the doctors thought discussing safety was a top priority That may be because providers know that for a healthy woman contraceptives are usually safer than pregnancy the study says But women may still worry about   caused by hormonal birth control like blood clots though they are relatively rare Those considering permanent contraceptive option may be worried about safety as well Recently the safety of   a device thats permanently inserted into the fallopian tubes to block them came under question when a number of women who used it complained about pain hemorrhaging and headaches The main takeaway is really that its very important for providers to speak about whats most important to women says Kyla Donnelly a reproductive health researcher at the Dartmouths   who led the study Yet providers dont always know what whats most important to their patients she tells Shots And doctors are increasingly having to manage very short consultation periods These results arent the final word  the participants were mostly white and they had to have Internet access in order to complete the survey But it does show that doctors and patients arent always on the same page Donnelly says shes working with other researchers to developing guides  called    to help health care providers and patients discuss contraceptives That way providers can feel supported with the right information
