The misery of low back pain often drives people to the doctor to seek relief But doctors are doing a pretty miserable job of treating back pain a study finds Physicians are increasingly prescribing expensive scans narcotic painkillers and other treatments that dont help in most cases and can make things a lot worse Since  in  of all primary care visits are for low back pain this is no small matter What does help Some ibuprofen or other overthecounter painkiller and maybe some physical therapy Thats the evidencebased protocol With that regimen most peoples back pain goes away within three months But when researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston looked at records of  doctor visits for simple back pain between  and  they found that doctors have actually been getting worse at prescribing scientifically based treatments Doctors were recommending NSAID pain relievers and acetaminophen less often Instead they were increasingly prescribing prescription opioids like OxyContin with use rising from  percent of cases to  percent Overthecounter painkiller use declined from  percent to  percent Other studies have found that opioids help only slightly with acute back pain and are worthless for treating chronic back pain Thats a big public health issue says Dr John Mafi chief medical resident and a fellow at Beth Israel Deaconess Mafi was the lead author of the   which was published online in   In the s doctors were criticized for ignoring patients pain Mafi says Some of that criticism was valid but doctors have overreacted What magic bullet better than a very powerful pain medication About  percent of patients taking opioids for chronic back pain also had other substance abuse disorders the researchers found In  almost  people died from overdoses of prescription opioids and   among women Opioids may be necessary in some cases Mafi says but theyre certainly not firstline Doctors were also quick to whip out the prescription pad and call for CT and MRI scans for people with lower back pain the study found The number of people getting scans rose from  to  percent Though those scans wont hurt the patient in most cases they dont find anything wrong And they are expensive costing  or more Patients are partly to blame for the rush to scan Mafi says Patients are expecting very comprehensive evaluations he tells Shots Theres a sentiment perhaps if my doctor ordered an MRI for my back pain they really listened to me Its almost validating And in an era when doctors are rated online by patients doctors have an incentive to make patients happy Mafi says Financial incentives for doctors may also be a factor This study didnt examine why doctors arent following clinical guidelines for treating back pain but other studies have found that when doctors own imaging equipment they are more likely to use it Doctors should be cut a little slack a journal   accompanying this study says because guidelines have been conflicted on back pain treatment until recently and it takes  years on average for new treatment standards to be widely adopted But creating checklisttype guidelines for doctors would help speed that process the commentary says So would requiring patients to pay more of the cost of expensive imaging and providing payment incentives for doctors who do the right thing For the majority of newonset back pain cases it gets better within three months Mafi says Unfortunately we dont have fancy treatments that cure it Time some ibuprofen and gentle exercise arent sexy But they most often do the trick
