This weekend  people from around the country will meet in a nondescript hotel room in Arlington Va and take a vote A passing stranger who stumbled on this group wouldnt see much of anything just a bunch of graying academic types sitting around a table But millions of people will be touched by that vote because the graying academic types are voting to approve the th edition of the    the bible of psychiatry The   published by the   is an enormous tome that defines every mental disorder And in defining every mental disorder it helps determine many other things such as how struggling children are treated in school If the disruptive behavior of a child is seen as a disorder  like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or autism  schools will help with subsidized services If not Well then the schools often see the child as just trouble and the child will be penalized So its no surprise that theres lots of controversy every time the   is revised with people arguing that the new definitions are too narrow or too broad And the   is no exception  its considered the single most controversial   of them all So what are the likely changes How have the many controversies been decided The APA refuses to say anything about whats in and whats out and theyve also told people associated with the   that they shouldnt speak specifically so its very hard to know But some of the changes that were published last year on the APA website theyve since been removed are likely  Aspergers Syndrome is currently a popular diagnosis but soon it may not be used by mental health professionals to identify people with mild autism Instead there will be a spectrum of autism and people who would once have been diagnosed with Aspergers will instead be diagnosed as mildly autistic Many people with Aspergers syndrome opposed this change People with Aspergers preferred that identity as opposed to being seen as part of autism spectrum I think thats been part of the complaint says   secretary of the APA  The people in charge of childhood disorders proposed this diagnosis because they felt very strongly that too many children were being categorized as having bipolar disorder and then prescribed antipsychotic drugs The hope is that psychiatrists will use this new diagnosis for kids instead of bipolar disorder and not prescribe as many drugs Critics say its not clear that the change will work out and that the history of mental health is littered with good intentions like this gone terribly wrong But the hope is that it will shut down the rise of bipolar diagnoses in children  In the last     psychiatrists were warned away from diagnosing major depression in people who had recently lost someone they loved because grief in the face of loss was seen as a normal  not abnormal  response Thats reasonable thinking and certainly no one wants to pathologize grief or sadness or call it an illness when it is an absolutely normal human experience said Dr   of the University of California San Diego But Zizook was one of the people who argued  probably successfully  to change that because he says telling psychiatrists that people who are grieving shouldnt be diagnosed as depressive excludes a bereaved person from being diagnosed with depression if they have a depression and no one wants to do that either This is a small change but to critics emblematic of a much larger and more sinister problem the expansion of behaviors considered abnormal Shyness becomes social phobia restlessness becomes ADHD  author of   is a   critic He worries the new version will label people sick when they are not Im very concerned about the number of false positives from this edition he says That is the number of people who are overdiagnosed Roger Peele of the APA obviously doesnt agree which doesnt mean that he thinks the   is infallible Its important that people not see the   as a bible he says that they respect it but dont worship it Hundreds of researchers have worked hard to make the   as good as they could figure Peele says but the entries are simply their best guesses on how to define and think about mental disorders
