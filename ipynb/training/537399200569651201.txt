Looking for ways to reduce your risk of cancer Try losing weight A new study estimates that  of cancers diagnosed around the world in  could be traced to the excess weight of patients That works out to  cases of cancer in adults who were at least  years old according to   in Lancet Oncology About  of these cancers were diagnosed in North America where the proportion of cancers that could be traced to peoples extra pounds was highest An additional  of these weightrelated cancers were diagnosed in East Asia where the risk due to extra weight was low but the population is so large that the patients added up Postmenopausal breast cancers and uterine cancers accounted for about twothirds of all new cancers linked to high BMI in women while cancers of the colon and kidneys made up twothirds of such cancers in men If the global population had not gotten fatter since  roughly  cancers that were newly diagnosed in  could have been avoided the researchers calculated Thats almost  in  cancers that were found that year But the world did get fatter And the situation is getting worse not better The continuation of current patterns of population weight gain will lead to continuing increases in the future burden of cancer the researchers concluded
