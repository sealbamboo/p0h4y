The fight against childhood obesity is beginning to show results say government researchers After rising for decades and then stabilizing somewhat in the mids the obesity rate among lowincome preschoolers declined by small but statistically significant amounts in  states and US territories between  and   t from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released Tuesday We are excited because we have seen so much work going on in the past several years at the local state and national level and we believe these changes are beginning to make a difference coauthor Heidi Michels Blanck told NBC News   Initiatives include First Lady Michele Obamas Lets Move campaign to reduce childhood obesity improvements in the nutritional content of the food provided by the federal governments Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children WIC and growth in the number of US hospitals enrolled in the World Health Organizations Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative which encourages new moms to breastfeed We know that breastfeeding leads to healthy weight in the first year said Blanck chief of the CDCs obesity prevention and control branch Still there is no proof that specific government interventions have led to the declines in obesity noted in todays report acknowledged CDC director Dr Tom Frieden in a media conference call Government researchers analyzed measured height and weight for  million preschoolers aged  to  years who participate in federally funded nutrition programs States and territories report that data to the Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System The researchers included data from  states the District of Columbia the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico and excluded others that did not report data consistently or changed their methods of collection and reporting   Children with a body mass index in the th percentile or greater for their age and sex were categorized as obese Obese preschoolers are more likely than normalweight children to be obese adolescents and are five times as likely to be obese as adults according to the CDC Obesity is associated with high cholesterol high blood sugar asthma and mental health problems It is important for us to look at this age group in that demographic says Dr Lindy Christine Fenlason director of Vanderbilt Universitys Pediatric Weight Management Clinic With financial barriers you run into limited access to healthy foods limited places for safe physical activity and sometimes limited educational resources about good nutrition says Fenlason Six of the  states and territories showing progress  Florida Georgia Missouri New Jersey South Dakota and the US Virgin Islands  had at least a one percentage point decrease in the obesity rates Twentyone states had no significant change while three states  Colorado Pennsylvania and Tennessee  saw an increase   The best way to deal with many health problems as with obesity is prevention said Frieden Thats why we are so encouraged to see these decreases even though they are small in this age group But the prevalence is still high and so there is still a lot of work to be done CDC epidemiologist and lead author Ashleigh May told NBC News  In contrast between  and  just nine states showed a significant decline in obesity among lowincome preschoolers  had no change and  had a significant increase There was wide variation in obesity rates across states in  Hawaiis  percent obesity rate for this group of young children was the lowest Californias  percent was the highest   New Jersey which showed improvement still has a relatively high rate of obesity among lowincome preschoolers of  percent In comparison Colorado though losing some ground has a relatively low obesity rate of  percent  Each state has different populations and different initiatives said May making it difficult to generalize why some states have higher obesity rates than others For example health officials in Michigan  where  percent of lowincome preschoolers were obese in  compared to  percent in   credit the slight improvement in part to a national intervention called the Nutrition and Physical Activity SelfAssessment for Child Care NAP SACC Since  the program has reached nearly  child care centers serving lowincome families in Michigan and more than  preschoolers in the state  Child care centers are an ideal place to work on obesity prevention efforts says Lonias Gilmore a public health consultant with the Michigan Department of Community Health These young children receive most of their nutrition and opportunities for physical activity in these settings The program has led to increased physical activity a reduction in salty and sweet snacks and greater availability of water and lower fat milk at centers Michigan officials hope to expand the program statewide Nationally  in  preschoolers regardless of income are obese according to government statistics That breaks down to  in  black preschoolers one in  Hispanic preschoolers and  in  nonHispanic white preschoolers To bring those rates down the CDC recommends that doctors routinely measure childrens body mass index and counsel parents about physical activity and nutrition Parents are advised to serve nutritious foods make water easily available and limit TV time And the agency calls on state and local governments to help local schools open gyms playgrounds and sports fields during nonschool hours to provide access to free drinking water in parks child care centers and schools and to make it easier for families to buy healthy affordable foods Every community can work to make the healthy choice the easy choice so that our nations children grow up and thrive according to Frieden in an online video
