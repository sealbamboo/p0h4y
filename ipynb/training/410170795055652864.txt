Evelyn met Mia while she was backpacking around Australia in the late s Mia grew up in the outback and offered to show Evelyn around Their friendship quickly grew into something more  I realized that Mia was transgender and given that Im from NYC I truly thought nothing of it Evelyn says I was immediately taken by her openness  The couple now lives in Flushing Queens Mia is a hotel consultant and   Evelyn works in publishing  At her heaviest in  Mia weighed close to  pounds Evelyn had also battled obesity her entire life Latenight binges empty bags of chips and emotional eating were common in their house  One day Mia decided shed had enough  A lot of people think once youre in a wheelchair youre just nothing she says The doctors said There there good fat person And I said Screw that   Mia ditched her motorized wheelchair and built a new one from a few broken chairs she got off Craigslist Her Frankenchair as she called it had a sporty design that allowed her to move more efficiently She started off slowly  pushing herself around the block  In the first month she lost  pounds By the time she had lost  pounds she was pushing herself a mile every morning  Evelyn and Mia decided to change their diet as well A lifelong vegan Mia had always eaten good food  but you can eat a lot of vegan food They cut back on portion sizes and started shopping for locally grown organic produce  When we set out to make this change we knew that it would be a slow road Evelyn said We wanted it to be a slow road because we knew that fast weight loss had always led to ultimate failure  To keep her goal attainable Mia told herself she would lose  pounds  times She bought a fishbowl and pulled a treat out of it every time she reached another minigoal By April  she weighed  pounds  I do cheat Mia says Its no good saying Im never going to have chocolate cake again because your wife will find you on the floor at  am with chocolate all over your face  Mia doesnt like to talk about the incident that left her partially paralyzed below the waist A physical assault when she was young damaged the nerves in her back severely weakening her spine Another accident in her early s exacerbated the condition and left her with minimal feeling in her legs  I havent stood up since Bush was president she likes to joke  But her disability hasnt stopped her from doing the activities she loves She does judo from her wheelchair She swims  miles every morning and is thinking about competing in a triathlon  Mia also loves rock climbing She and Evelyn joined the   group and started climbing two to three times a week at Brooklyn Boulders  Kareemah Batts founder of Adaptive Climbing Inc saw Mias determination her first day In the beginning Mia was frustrated that climbing didnt come easily Batts says but she wouldnt quit  Youre fighting with your body to do something that it doesnt do Batts told Mia  Mia now weighs  pounds and is still losing weight Her cholesterol and blood pressure levels are normal and she no longer has type  diabetes Shes gone from wearing a size  dress to wearing a size    The weight loss has changed her outlook on life and her selfrespect and also has given her another way to connect with her community Evelyn says It has reinvigorated our mutual interest in all kinds of things we thought were not possible
