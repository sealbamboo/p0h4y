In a trend that public health officials call encouraging fewer women are undergoing earlyterm Caesarean deliveries according to new government data The findings are part of a broad shift in the rate of Caesarean deliveries which had risen steeply since the mids From  to  the Caesarean delivery rate soared by  percent accounting for a record  percent of births nationwide The trend alarmed health officials and medical societies because many of these were earlyterm Csections performed at  weeks of gestation or earlier when the risk of complications to the infant is greater But from  to  the rate leveled out at  percent   The rate of Csection deliveries fell by  percent among women at  weeks of gestation and rose by  percent among those at  weeks of gestation This is great news said Dr George A Macones chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the medical school at Washington University in St Louis This will be the third year of a real flattening of the Csection rate over all Theres been a lot of work and attention paid to trying to prevent it from rising and it looks like that work is paying off The climb that began in the mids was driven in part by an increase in the number of pregnant women who were scheduling the procedures before  weeks of gestation even when they were not medically necessary Many women chose to induce labor or schedule a Caesarean at  or  weeks of gestation in anticipation of a large baby But the convenience of planning an earlier delivery may be outweighed by heightened risks to the baby In March the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists   advising against elective Csections and inductions before  weeks saying that the procedures raise the likelihood that infants will develop pneumonia and breathing difficulties Infants born before  weeks have a higher mortality rate than those born later and they are more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care units the college noted Dr Macones who led the committee that issued the guidelines said the prospect of increased complications after earlyterm births had received greater attention in recent years Hospitals around the country have instituted policies that limit these procedures except when mothers have conditions that can make them medically necessary like preeclampsia or poorly controlled diabetes Theres been a lot of work done to try to make sure physicians and patients understand the importance of delivery at or after  weeks especially for elective deliveries Dr Macones said The shifts occurred across all maternal age race and ethnic groups said Michelle JK Osterman an author of the report and a statistician at the National Center for Health Statistics part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The fact that the overall rate has stopped increasing is significant in and of itself she said Caesarean section comes with a lot of risks Its more expensive and theres increased morbidity for the mother and child
