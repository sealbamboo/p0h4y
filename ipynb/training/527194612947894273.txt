In an ideal world health care workers returning from West Africa would get a quick blood test to prove they arent carrying the Ebola virus A test like that would likely put to rest some of the anxiety surrounding these doctors nurses and scientists Unfortunately even the best blood test in the world cant do that The test uses a technology called PCR for polymerase chain reaction It can detect extraordinarily small traces of genetic material from the Ebola virus But the catch is the test is usually used on blood samples And   thats not where the Ebola virus hides The initial sites of replication actually are not in the blood itself  theyre mostly in tissues like spleen or liver says   a microbiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston Its   to sample these organs to look for Ebola But the virus doesnt stay there forever Geisbert explains As the infection grows virus particles are gradually released into the blood as well And as soon as a small amount of virus ends up in the blood PCR will detect it It can find one or two virus particles in a drop of blood That concentration is so low Geisbert says that an infected persons   pose a minuscule risk to others at that stage The problem is that can change pretty quickly As the disease progresses and people start to get sick he says in that same small drop of blood there can be  particles  or a thousand particles Thats the point when body fluids do pose a risk Its also the moment when the infected person starts to feel sick Youre going to start to detect the virus at about the same time youre going to have clinical signs of disease Geisbert says So  sensitive as the PCR test is  it doesnt reliably give you much advance warning that a person is infected On the plus side this pattern of infection also explains why people infected with Ebola arent a risk to others until they actually fall ill with symptoms
