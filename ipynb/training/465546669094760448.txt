I bought my first and only pregnancy test when I was  At the time I had been doing a lot of meth I was fortunate if I remembered to eat one meal a day Refilling my birthcontrol prescription had become just another missed detail in a life that had ceased to have much meaning for me I was an addict and I was staring at two very bright pink lines on a stick I showed the test to my boyfriend What are we going to do I asked He replied Have a baby I guess He wanted to see the pregnancy through I was much less certain about motherhood How would the pregnancy affect my drug and alcohol use I dont recall ever feeling as vulnerable and afraid as I did then I started drinking at age  Alcohol transformed me into a confident funny and brave person It shattered the awkward and shy shell in which I felt trapped I found a group of new friends I began to smoke pot and skip school Boys seemed to find the new me far more desirable too After I moved into adulthood I became a bartender Customers would put small packets of cocaine and meth in my tip jar and Id step into the beer cooler to inhale my reward I did everything to excess My habits created a revolving door of friends jobs and living arrangements My relationship with my family was strained I was arrested several times yet I never considered changing my behavior But after I got pregnant I did my best to do what a pregnant woman is supposed to do I went to my prenatal appointments I took my vitamins I decorated a nursery Inside I was terrified I had never before tried to quit using Being a pregnant addict was the most heartwrenching experience of my life I tried to stay sober but I couldnt live completely clean I was able to refrain from drug use but I never stayed away from alcohol for long I have memories of trying to disguise my pregnant stomach when entering liquor stores only to return home drink alone and cry by myself I talked to the baby inside of me apologizing for my shortcomings I felt some comfort when my best friend Mallory became pregnant too She told me that if I could do it she could do it I was thankful to have someone going through this with me We would get drunk and justify our behavior to one another Then I would wake up hungover gripped by guilt and selfloathing but those feelings werent enough to keep me sober Despite it all I gave birth to a healthy daughter She was beautiful She had  fingers and  toes I cried tears of joy and relief But I knew that I would continue using as soon as I could I bottlefed my daughter because breastfeeding just wasnt an option I balanced my habits with parenthood as well as I could One night while drunk I fell off of a porch breaking my wrist and ankle Our young family had to move into a relatives house while I healed I lost my job as an administrative assistant I couldnt even change my daughters diapers The years passed but the drama didnt I kept having to pick up the pieces of my toxic existence As my daughter grew older I did my best to maintain appearances give her a good life and keep my addiction from affecting her But when she was  I woke up in the midst of a blackout A man was having sex with me in a strange apartment and I had no recollection of him or how Id gotten there I was shaken I felt I had betrayed my daughter I felt I had betrayed my values I finally found the courage to walk into my first meeting To get sober I had to abandon my old life My daughters father and I split up I had to stay away from every single friend I had While I was making new and meaningful relationships in recovery I still missed my friend Mallory I left messages telling her about my sobriety She never called back My new sober life took me places I never imagined I discovered I had a voice that I could use to help others I began to work for womens rights lobbying across the state of Kansas I went back to school and earned a masters degree in public administration One day while speaking at a university I spotted Mallory in the audience After the talk I walked over and asked how she was She was sober We got together later and shared stories of loss pain and devastation She had racked up multiple DUIs and a felony record Her legal problems caused her to be separated from her son She was close to graduating with a degree in social work and was working at a womens addiction treatment center She was looking forward to her sons return I had deeply mourned the loss of her friendship and felt pure joy as she shared her success and her own journey out of using Our kids are now freshmen in high school They will soon be facing decisions about whether to use alcohol and drugs Despite  years of sobriety I worry addictions hereditary nature will affect my daughter At the same time by being honest with her I think my story may help teach her that addiction can destroy our bodies our relationships our careers and so much more Addication is a spiritcrushing disease that favors no class or intellect and escape is a matter of life and death While some recover and thrive others struggle and die seemingly through no fault of their own This is the stark reality that my daughter needs to know  no matter how painful it is for me to tell her
