For Lori Bandt who works as a medical technician and an EMT in a suburb of Madison Wis the print on vials of medication has become so difficult to read that if she forgets her reading glasses she has to resort to having a younger EMT worker read the directions The yearold says Im just stuck And shes hardly alone  in  Americans needs reading glasses or bifocals because of   With age the formerly pliable lens of the eye starts to harden That makes it harder for muscles to squeeze the lens to focus on nearby objects But eye doctors are trying to come up with options for people like Bandt Her doctor   is one of them The corneal inlay called   is a flexible doughnutshaped ring that is surgically inserted into the eye and creates a sort of artificial pupil He is working as a consultant to the company marketing the implant The surgical procedure uses a laser to make a small incision in the very front of the cornea where the ring is placed The results with a corneal inlay are immediate says Vukich restoring near vision right away And there isnt much down time for patients He says the procedure is far less complicated and invasive than   The KAMRA corneal inlay has been used in Europe since  and is also being used in South America and Asia But members of an FDA advisory panel have raised concerns about the safety of the device At the committees meeting in June the company presented   from a month trial that found that  percent of the  patients enrolled achieved visual acuity of at least  or better However that did not include  patients who dropped out of the study and had the corneal inlays removed Most of those patients  percent said the device didnt improve their vision like they expected Had the patients been included the devices efficacy rate would have   to  percent Officials also noted that even after removal of the inlay some patients still had hazy vision or fluid buildup in the cornea The FDA advisory panel determined that the device was effective voting  to  in favor But when it came to safety it voted  to  against the inlay The FDA hasnt decided whether it will approve KAMRA but it often follows the advice of its advisory committees The fact that some patients had vision problems after the inlays were removed is a problem says   an ophthalmologist and spokesperson for the   This is the windshield of the eye and the windshield of the eye needs to be crystal clear like your car windshield she says If theres haze or fluid in it its not crystal clear Even so the technology has great potential says Sumers and might prove a reasonable option for aging boomers in the near future
