A screening test for concussion that can be performed quickly on the sidelines was able to detect mild traumatic brain injury in about  in  college athletes who had sustained a concussion a forthcoming study has found The   capitalizes on a subtle but important symptom of brain injury a disruption in the eyes ability to travel smoothly across a page and to shift direction upon the brains command In a new study conducted on male and female athletes at the University of Florida most subjects who took the KingDevick test soon after suffering a concussion showed reductions in speed and accuracy that were marked enough to reveal mild traumatic brain injury When results of the KingDevick test were combined with two more comprehensive tests for concussion researchers said they were able to detect  of  concussions that occurred over a single season among  subjects The study participants were members of the University of Floridas mens football womens lacrosse and womens soccer teams The   is remarkably simple the testtaker is asked to read fast and accurately several pages of singledigit numbers that are arrayed left to right in columns that dont vertically align The test requires smooth and steady eye movement across and down the page as well as concentration the rapid recognition of numbers and fast language production Some or all of these can be compromised by a concussion making the test a good measure of at least whether an athlete should be removed from play and professionally assessed for concussion The findings which remain preliminary until published are to be presented in late April in Philadelphia at the  s annual meeting The team conducting the research was led by New York UniversityLangone Medical Center neurologist Dr Laura J Balcer To establish a baseline for an individuals performance on the test the KingDevick screening must first be conducted when the individual is healthy and wellrested and away from the field and while baseline tests are best done by a professional trained in neuropsychiatric testing the KingDevick test is easy enough to administer that even a parent could do it After that the screening test can be administered in just a couple of minutes on the side of a playing field using a flipchart or an electronic tablet An athlete who has sustained a blow to the head that is likely to result in concussion typically will be unable to match his or her baseline speed and accuracy on the test Balcer said that having a reliable quick and easily administered test available to evaluate an athlete is especially important because many are unwilling to acknowledge  or unable to detect  the confusion
