In order to keep their kids safe and healthy Emily Cunningham a stayathome mother from Charlotte North Carolina who writes the AllergenMenuMom blog and her husband keep a completely allergyfree home buying only food products that are free of any trace of their childrens triggers  But that protection comes at a high price Between breathing medications and epipens of epinephrine a drug used to treat anaphylactic shock the Cunninghams spend about  a month to safeguard their children from their allergies and thats before the grocery bill Emily estimates her family spends  a month just on rice milk About  to  of US children under age  have food allergies and the latest statistics show this percentage may be on the rise  Why so many kids are experiencing allergies to common food items still isnt clear although experts suspect that some of the trend can be attributed to improved public health and sanitation efforts that may have made us too clean to build strong enough immunity to common allergens found in food and the environment Kids not eating things like nuts and shellfish at an earlier age may also contribute to the rise in food allergies Regardless of how the shift began however researchers reporting in the journal JAMA Pediatrics say that the economic cost of food allergies is also reaching a peak with families like the Cunninghams spending an estimated  billion per year or about  per child About  billion of those costs involve direct medical fees such as medications and emergency treatments for allergic reactions with  billion going to additional yearly costs to families While other studies have investigated the economic toll of food allergies few have studied in detail how these costs affect a familys finances A  study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology for example calculated that the national cost was much lower at about  million but the authors acknowledged that they underestimated the prevalence of food allergies and excluded some other costs families cover such as higher fees for special foods and lost productivity of parents who had to sacrifice their jobs to care for their children For the new estimate the researchers looked at both direct medical costs like hospital visits copayments and medication purchases as well as other costs that are unique to families of children with food allergies  including special child care arrangements allergyfriendly summer camps and even changing schools  I am the room mom for Elenas class so I can be directly involved in planning activities says Cunningham I always make sure I know what is being brought in when another child has a birthday and during special events I provide safe alternatives for my daughter which are as similar as possible to the treats the other kids will have The study authors also accounted for less direct costs such as in lost career opportunities for parents of foodallergic children which they estimated at  billion  Overall they found that caring for a child with major food allergies harms a caregivers career primarily because many parents who live with the specter of imminent  and often emergency  care choose to be around their children more frequently to ensure they are safe from exposure Emily for example quit her job as a speech therapist to stay at home and her husband Justin left his banking job to create apps that help families find restaurants that provide detailed information about their menu ingredients How can these costs be lowered  The authors of the study say more policies that ensure safe environments for kids could provide some relief A month ago the Senate began considering a bill that would give states an incentive to make epinephrine more widely available  States that allow schools to stock epinephrine are given preferential status when they apply for federal grants for asthma funding The bill also encourages schools to allow trained staff instead of only nurses to administer epinephrine to students who may be having a reaction and requires states to ensure that administrators have legal protections when they try to help students who might be in allergic shock But will making more places safer cut back on costs In some ways yes But Dr Carla Davis  pediatric allergist and immunologist at Texas Childrens Hospital says families will start to see the greatest decreases in costs once better treatments are developed  For instance researchers are looking into oral treatments that could potentially cure children of their allergies by building their tolerance with repeated exposures to tiny amounts of the allergen Doctors are encouraged by early results that suggest such desensitization can lessen the chances that allergic children will experience anaphylactic shock if they are exposed More options for treating immediate reactions can also lower costs of devices like epinephrine devices when the new epinephrine autoinjector AuviQwhich is slimmer and more portable that previous models was launched last year more coupons and discounts were available for epi pens overall A little competition has made a big difference for a lot of families says Cunningham The number of people dealing with foods allergies is promoting more products to become available which should help with affordability and availability of options
