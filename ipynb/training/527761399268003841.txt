Im a runner Not a professional runner but one whose dedication to the sport means that I am training for a marathon putting in  hours a week toward what has become an unpaid parttime job I should be good at this by now Popular research tells me that if I put in  hours or  years of training I can become a master at anything I have been running since  and for the last  weeks have pushed myself through hill work meter repeats core workouts and doubledigit long runs in preparation for the upcoming New York City Marathon Still Im not anywhere close to becoming a master Im not even close to qualifying for the Boston Marathon and will most likely be beat by at least  of the more than  runners competing on Sunday Whether its being born into a short and stocky frame the unique makeup of my muscle fibers or just not having a high tolerance for pain I was not born into a body that was meant for distance running at any sort of speed Thats not just an excuse either according to a   There researchers looked at three different groups of athletes  Olympic champions in the  to meter races the fastest  male sprinters of all time and individual sprint qualifiers for the  NCAA national champions Within each group they found that the runners were all fast before they really started formal training Out of the  runners in the Olympic champion group  of those sprinters had not participated in organized sports of any kind before they were recognized for their talents One of the assumptions of the  hour practice model is that everybody starts out on an even plane and that there are no individuals who are gifted said Michael P Lombardo the lead author of the study and a professor of biology at Grand Valley State From my perspective as biologist that completely denies everything we know about the interaction between genetics and environment To put it another way he says look at height A small proportion of the population will be very short A small proportion of the population will be very tall Everybody else will be in the middle somewhere The same idea can be applied to things like visual acuity finger dexterity the ability to memorize long lists and yes the ability to run very very fast Most people like myself fall somewhere in the middle the median marathon finishing time for women in  was  hours  minutes  seconds   My fastest marathon time run in  was  hours  minutes  seconds While things like hill repeats and tempo runs can make me faster there is no amount of work that will make me an Olympian The best I can do is find the peak of my own ability When Brendan Cournane a Chicagobased running coach ran his first Chicago Marathon in  he finished in just under five hours Ten years later he knocked his time down to  hours and  minutes in the same race It was through training and dedication and natural ability from my ancestors he said After that though Despite that surge hes only been able to shave another two minutes off his time since When he was running most in the late s and early s he had to face facts I realized that I was probably not going to be able to break three hours in the marathon he said citing the same things that brought him down to that  hour  minute mark genetics age and life circumstances that keep him from running  miles a week Its more nature versus nurture but within limits he said All of us are blessed with a certain amount of fast twitch and slow twitch muscles If you are a slow twitch person you can do some drills to train and get faster but youre never going to be an Olympian When head coach Ben Rosario recruits athletes for Northern Arizona Elite his team of running professionals he thinks about these things too Specifically how far nurture has already taken someone with extraordinary natural talents   The PC answer is to say well they have to be motivated and all those sorts of things but they have to be talented We all have physical capabilities he says He will consider factors like previous performances but I have to judge what I think their highend potential is physically Within that small range he sees athletes who have already maxed out especially those who have run for the best NCAA teams in the country where they get to go to all the best meets and they get to train with all these amazing athletes and they get to go to Stanford and run in perfect conditions at night in a straight line If they are still ranked the fourth to eighth person on that team he is less likely to recruit them because they are already close to their potential There is not much more he can do for them versus someone who was good but at a smaller program and is already that fast and has a higher ceiling to reach Figuring out what that ceiling is though isnt easy especially for an amateur I have a job a dog family friends How much time and effort am I going to dedicate to training and how much to living a rich full life I want to keep eating cheese and keep drinking beer without thinking that it will wreck my race weight Especially the cheese But there is always a chance that this time another gear will kick in and Ill get another five   minutes faster as I did when I ran the New Jersey Marathon in  cutting  minutes off my personal record I dont know if I can top that performance but I will continue to charge up hills and run endless laps around my high schools track because even if Im not trying to hit my ceiling anymore I can at least try to brush it
