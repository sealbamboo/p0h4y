The task force an independent group of experts makes evidencebased recommendation on preventive services like screenings preventive medications and counseling services They are highly respected among screening and preventive medicine experts Their process for developing guidelines involves an extensive review of scientific studies issuing of a draft guideline for public input and publishing a final recommendation  The task force advises the US Department of Health and Human Services The Affordable Care Act mandates that health insurance cover screenings the task force deems useful   This latest recommendation is largely based on the National Cancer Institutes National Lung Screening Trial This study which began in  is one of the bestdesigned screening studies conducted on any cancer   The task force recommendation is similar to the lung screening guidelines issued by other organizations because of the quality of this trial These organizations include the American College of Chest Physicians the American Society of Clinical Oncology the American Thoracic Society the American Association for Thoracic Surgery the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Cancer Society for which I work Disagreements exist in prostate and breast cancer screening recommendations because of flaws in all major prostate and breast screening trials    The National Lung Screening Trial NLST assessed more than  smokers and showed screening caused a  decline in lung cancer deaths eight to  years later This means  of lung cancer deaths still occurred  Also smokinginduced cardiovascular disease kills far more people than lung cancer Smoking also causes a number of other serious diseases including bronchitis emphysema and at least  other cancers All current lung cancer screening recommendations note that the patient needs to understand the risks and benefits of screening and decide if it is right for them There are definite harms associated with lung cancer screening   More than one in four people screened will have a finding that leads to further testing Ultimately  out of  who get further testing will not have lung cancer   Additional testing can include more Xray testing as well as invasive tests such as biopsies and surgeries  A small proportion of patients getting additional testing will have permanent disabilities or even die as a result In the NLST roughly one person died after an invasive procedure triggered by screening for every five to six lives saved because of screening Studies also show that some people will have an overdiagnosis cancer  that is a cancer that would never progress and kill   It is still difficult for many of us in medicine to accept that there are cancers that do not need treatment This is a relatively new phenomenon due to improvements in imaging and diagnostics    There is currently no good test to determine who has a cancer that needs treatment and who has a cancer that does not need treatment therefore some screendetected patients will receive treatment that is not needed to save their life The NLST was conducted in  of the finest hospitals in the United States These hospitals were chosen for their specific expertise in radiology pulmonary medicine thoracic surgery and medical and radiation oncology   Many health care centers will have to work to ensure they have the appropriate equipment and skills to provide screening Just as with the introduction of mammography for breast cancer screening it may take years for these skills to be available throughout the country This is a test for relatively heavy smokers We need a screening test for nonsmokers and light smokers About one in six people who develop lung cancer are nonsmokers Unfortunately studies suggest that there is not great benefit to lowdose spiral CT screening in these populations but many of the potential harms remain Patients who smoke or who have smoked cigarettes should talk to their doctor about whether lowdose spiral CT is a good test for them Most importantly do not use lung cancer screening as a reason to continue smoking as all science to date tells us there is greater benefit in quitting
