 The FDA has approved a new use of bevacizumab (Avastin) as part of second-line combination therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer, the drug's manufacturer announced.. In patients who have failed a combination of bevacizumab and chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine agents such as 5-fluorouracil along with irinotecan (Camptosar) or oxaliplatin (Eloxatin), bevacizumab may be continued as other irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-containing regimens are tried as salvage therapy, Genentech said.. The FDA had not previously approved this particular use of bevacizumab in second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, according to a company statement.. Most patients diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer now receive bevacizumab along with chemotherapy as initial treatment, Genentech asserted.. The new approval was based on a phase III trial showing a 19 percent reduction in mortality when bevacizumab was used in both first- and second-line regimens compared with chemotherapy alone in the salvage regimen.. Median overall survival was 11.2 months with the bevacizumab-containing salvage therapy compared with 9.8 months with standard treatment.. Median progression-free survival was 5.7 months versus 4.1 months, according to Genentech.. Adverse events were similar to those seen in other trials of bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer.. Previously, use of bevacizumab for colorectal cancer was approved only as initial treatment of metastatic disease in combination with 5-FU-based chemotherapies. It is not indicated for adjuvant therapy, Genentech noted.. Source:
