 Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. CEO Michael Pearson said the company is nearing its goal of rounding up enough support from Allergan Inc. shareholders to secure a vote on its $53 billion hostile bid for the Botox maker.. Once Valeant gets the 25% of Allergan shareholders needed to convene the vote, "both sides know how this will come out," Mr. Pearson said in an interview Tuesday, adding that he expects Valeant's offer to be accepted.
