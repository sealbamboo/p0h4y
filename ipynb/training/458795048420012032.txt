The pharmaceutical industry is regaining its swagger as companies turn to big and sometimes daring deals to expand and reshape their operations On Tuesday alone pharmaceutical companies announced  billion worth of potential deals including an unorthodox  billion bid for   the maker of Botox and   between   of Switzerland and   of Britain More deals in the cashrich industry are expected In recent months   made a number of informal takeover approaches for AstraZeneca including one that would have been worth over  billion only to be rebuffed The moves by drug makers have helped fuel   which this year has more than doubled from the same period last year to nearly  trillion  the best start in dealmaking since  according to data from   Pharmaceutical deals made up about  percent of that activity or  billion its highest level since   The flurry of deals highlights the most extensive efforts yet by drug makers to bolster their businesses in many cases pursuing growth as onetime blockbuster products lose patent protection Instead of spending money researching new products that may yield little success several companies are instead looking to buy likely winners A couple of the biggest issues are whether or not these firms can continue to be innovative and bring out products that have strong pricing power said Damien Conover an analyst with   Innovation is improving from where it was five years ago but it isnt to the point where these firms can generate strong growth After Pfizer lost its patent for   in  it reported an  percent drop in overall sales the next year While socalled patent cliffs are not quite the issue they once were  Mr Conover said the largest drops took place in   companies are still scrambling to find new profitable products While many continue to spend money on inhouse research and development those efforts are yielding less fruit than hoped The productivity while improving is not improving fast enough he said Some drug makers regard dealmaking as a normal course of business Allergans pursuer is Valeant a Canadian pharmaceutical company whose growth strategy revolves around acquisitions On Tuesday it unveiled its unsolicited takeover bid for Allergan hoping to create a powerhouse maker of eyecare and cosmetic treatments like Botox Based outside Montreal Valeant has sought to become a major specialty drug maker over the last six years by buying up businesses that are hard to replicate Its biggest deal to date was last years   the eyecare specialist for  billion Still it has had its eye on bigger game first broaching the idea of a merger with Allergan a year and a half ago But Valeants current approach has raised eyebrows since it has teamed up with William A Ackman an outspoken hedge fund mogul known to fight loudly for change at corporations The two formed one of the most unusual corporate pairings in recent memory After reaching a handshake agreement in February to back a takeover bid by Valeant Mr Ackman began quietly accumulating shares in Allergan carefully avoiding tripping rules that would require him to disclose his holdings On Monday evening he acquired enough shares to give him control of  percent of Allergan giving him a powerful perch from which to demand a merger with his partner On Tuesday Valeant took the cover off its bid offering cash and stock that was worth about  a share During a nearly fourhour presentation for investors Mr Ackman and Valeant executives talked up the benefits of the deal Combined Allergan and Valeant would have annual sales of more than  billion while enjoying  billion in cost savings And the merged drug maker would benefit greatly from Valeants low tax rate Both Mr Ackman and J Michael Pearson Valeants chief executive estimated that a combined company would be valued at more than  a share During the presentation Mr Ackman excitedly pointed to what the combined company could do more mergers Were looking beyond this transaction the hedge fund manager said For its part Allergan responded in a statement that it was evaluating the offer with its financial and legal advisers The drug maker is likely to consider its options including questioning the bidding teams unusually stealthy approach Late on Tuesday Allergan said that it had adopted a shareholder rights plan a defensive move meant to keep shareholders to stakes of less than  percent Shares of Allergan surged  percent on Tuesday closing at  Valeant enjoyed a smaller jump in its stock which rose  percent to  suggesting that its investors approved of its approach One shareholder that publicly applauded the move was ValueAct Capital an activist hedge fund that owns a nearly  percent stake and has a seat on Valeants board Several corporate advisers said that the partnership could provide a new template for cooperative dealmaking between activists and companies By teaming up with skilled veterans of boardroom fights corporate acquirers would gain invaluable allies And hedge funds could eliminate time looking for potential buyers of companies in which they have investments making their bets more certain This structure and this partnership has not been seen before and is raising a lot of eyebrows among both investors and companies said David Hunker a banker at   who helps clients defend against activist investors But some advisers cautioned that several circumstances made the ValeantAckman team unique The two were introduced by a mutual friend who now works for Mr Ackman lending a personal touch to the partnership The two displayed a warm relationship on stage during the presentation with Mr Pearson repeatedly stressing that the expensive setup was being paid for by his hedgefund friend I want to reassure our investors that we are still trying to save every penny the Valeant executive joked And because the deal is potentially hostile Mr Ackmans involvement made sense given his experience as a Wall Street brawler As he explained during the presentation We buy stakes in companies and help them do the right thing for shareholders We have ways of doing that A number of Wall Street counselors also saw big risks in Valeants decision to work with Mr Ackman The agreement stipulates that should the deal succeed Mr Ackman must hold Valeant stock for at least a year That means Valeant will have an outspoken activist as one of its largest shareholders And if the deal fails to deliver on its promised cost savings Mr Ackman could turn on his partner I dont think youre going to see a rush of these kinds of partnerships said one corporate adviser not authorized to speak on the record about the matter But boardrooms are scared
