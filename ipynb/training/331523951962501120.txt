
 At an emergency dental clinic that treats the uninsured a receptionist told Ms Caseres that the schedule was full When she returned a second time in still greater pain the receptionist told her I cant get you seen On her third visit Ms Caseres swollen cheek bulged as if a lollipop were stuck there Still she was told that she would have to wait Why It was because I was pregnant Ms Caseres said She was in her second trimester and the receptionist said she needed a doctors note before the office would consider treating her Finally Ms Caseres found Dr George Soung a fourthyear dental student who was trained in a new prenatal program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill By that time two premolars had broken to the gums exposing nerves Her pain was so acute she was bedridden taking sleeping pills and painkillers Dr Soung extracted Ms Caseress two abscessed teeth at once because a fargone infection could spread to the jaw or even throughout the body This wasnt something that popped up a week ago he said Nobody would treat her Too many pregnant women like Ms Caseres are not getting timely   experts say There are plenty of reasons Some dentists are reluctant to treat pregnant patients in no small part because of   OBGYNs too often fail to check for oral problems and to refer women to dentists And many women fail to seek out oral care or mistakenly think its dangerous even though   itself may lead to   The problem among dentists is decades old Many were taught in dental school that you cant treat a pregnant woman said Dr Renee Samelson a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Albany Medical Center who was an editor of the first guidelines on oral health in pregnancy which were published by the New York State Department of Health and advised on two more sets of guidelines Dentists simply erred on the side of caution she added There was no evidence of harm Today although dental treatment during pregnancy is considered beneficial some dentists still hesitate to see pregnant women because they fear litigation or harm to the fetus or their knowledge of appropriate care lags behind the current evidence One  survey of  obstetrician gynecologists nationwide found  percent reported their patients had been  A lot of dentists still fear treating pregnant women and think What happens if I have to do an   or What happens if I give   or local   said Dr Howard Minkoff the chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn None of these are legitimate reasons not to provide appropriate care for women Since  a few   organizations and   associations have issued practice guidelines declaring that dental care is   and effective at any stage of pregnancy including diagnostic Xrays cavity restorations and root canals OBGYNs should check for   or oral infection and refer a patient to a dentist if her last visit was longer than six months ago according to   published in September by the National Maternal and Child Oral Health Resource Center at Georgetown University The statement advised dentists to provide emergency care in any trimester OBGYNs can be consulted as necessary if a pregnant patient is diabetic or hypertensive or if general anesthesia is required Dr Sally Cram a periodontist in Washington and a spokeswoman for the American Dental Association said dentists she knows provide complete care She added In the last  to  years a lot of dentists have promoted the importance of pregnant women having regular cleanings Delaying oral care can have serious consequences   or gum inflammation affects   and left unchecked it can become periodontal disease Untreated periodontal disease can lead to tooth loss And a mother with active   can spread cavitycausing bacteria to her child through saliva perpetuating poor oral health Pregnant women with dental pain also may selfmedicate inappropriately In a March  letter to the New York State Department of Health a doctor described a patient who was unable to get urgent care for her abscessed teeth in upstate New York She took such excessive doses of Tylenol that she developed acute liver failure and the fetus died That prompted the drafting of new state guidelines Still some OBGYNs do not address oral health during visits with pregnant women an oversight that angers some dentists If you take your dog to the vet the first thing they do is look in their mouth said Dr Nancy Newhouse a periodontist in Independence Mo and the president of the American Academy of Periodontology Many pregnant women simply dont seek dental care perhaps out of misplaced fear or neglect Some states offer dental   benefits to lowincome expectant mothers for example but utilization rates are low seek and receive services in Oklahoma In New York  percent of pregnant women on Medicaid visited dentists in  up from  percent in  Such a multifactorial problem requires a coordinated effort between OBGYNs and dentists to reach motherstobe said Dr Stefanie Russell a dentist and an epidemiologist at New York University But for women with lowrisk pregnancies she said things will change when women realize dental care is their right during pregnancy
