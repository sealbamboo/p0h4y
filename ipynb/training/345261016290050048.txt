Haiti has finally carried out a nationwide campaign to get rid of the parasitic worms that cause elephantiasis Haiti has waged other campaigns against the condition characterized by severe disfiguration of the legs and arms But until now it has never managed to adequately reach residents of the chaotic capital PortauPrince The latest effort by the Haitian Ministry of Health now puts the country on track to wipe out elephantiasis within the next four years   a study published in the   Elephantiasis  officially called    is a cruel condition Parasites invade your lymphatic system and cause grotesque swelling primarily of the legs but also at times of the arms and scrotum In some parts of the world lymphatic filariasis is called big foot But even this term downplays the extent of the disfiguration it creates Elephantiasis can cause massive folds of excess flesh to hang from a persons hips thighs and calves and sag toward the ankles It can make a mans scrotum swell to the size of a basketball People are the only known host for the roundworms that causes elephantiasis The fight against the disease focuses on mass deworming campaigns In Haiti that means getting everyone to swallow two pills The idea is that if you can get  percent of the population dewormed for several years in a row the parasites can no longer survive in the community and they disappear for good Until now Haiti hasnt been able to reach the  percent threshold in PortauPrince a metropolitan center with more than  million people The mass distribution of deworming pills will have to continue for another four years before health workers are confident that the parasite has been eliminated from Haiti The University of Floridas   has been treating Haitians with elephantiasis for nearly two decades He says the condition can be devastating Its a big burden economically and physically for that person says Beau de Rochars who worked on the current study People with the illness are often ostracized Haiti is one of just four countries in the Americas where elephantiasis remains endemic Its also still found in parts of Brazil the Dominican Republic and Guyana The successful deworming campaign in Haiti is a major step forward not just for the country but for the whole region says   an immunologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who also contributed to the current study If a country like Haiti with all of the challenges that theyve faced over the last few years is able to achieve full national coverage I think that is as an important example for other countries which are struggling to scale up their programs as well he says Eliminating elephantiasis in Haiti would also help the Dominican Republic control the disease Beau de Rochars is confident that Haiti will wipe out elephantiasis eventually I had a dream back in  when I first started working in lymphatic filariasis he says And my dream is to see the certification of elimination of lymphatic filariasis in Haiti This is my dream Im a Christian and I believe God will help me to see that
