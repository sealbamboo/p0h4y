Yet another entertainment figure has gone public with her decision to have a double mastectomy after a breast cancer diagnosis Samantha Harris is the latest in a series of entertainers whove decided on that surgery as treatment for the disease Harris a yearold mother of two and   of   said she chose this procedure after consulting with three specialists It was a difficult choice she reports but she feels it enabled her to take control and that she is so much calmer As the husband of a breast cancer survivor I can relate to what Harris says A welcome sense of control and calm follows the agony of wrestling with treatment options I have also learned that a double mastectomy is not the best choice for all breast cancer patients Nor does it eliminate fear of recurrence Nonetheless double mastectomies are on an extraordinary upward swing in the United States Twenty years ago only  to  percent of women with cancer in one breast made that choice says   chief of surgical oncology at the University of Minnesota Now the rates are    percent Many of those women have a sound medical rationale for selecting   It is appropriate treatment for a patient diagnosed with cancer in one breast and at high risk for recurrence because of family history A double mastectomy is also recommended for women not yet diagnosed if they carry the BRCA or  gene with its high risk of developing the disease That was the case for actress   The rates may have risen in part because genetic testing is identifying more women at risk for the genes says Tuttle Yet some women make the double mastectomy decision believing it will increase their odds of survival It wont Women have an exaggerated perception of their risk of getting cancer in the other breast Tuttle says He was senior author of a   showing that women with cancer in one breast thought the risk of a tumor in the other breast was around  percent in the decade ahead Its actually  to  percent And from personal experience I know that doctors do not always present surgical choices in a fairminded way After my wife had been diagnosed with a tumor in each breast our HMOs surgeon told her I can tell by the look on your face youre a worrier so Id recommend a double mastectomy I remember thinking Doc if she didnt look worried thered be something wrong My wife had always thought if she were diagnosed with breast cancer shed say Off with my breasts But the prospect of giving up her girls plunged her into a state of sorrow She didnt want to say goodbye to part of herself She was also aware that the mastectomy surgery was more invasive and recovery would take longer So she sought second and third opinions They said a lumpectomy in each breast followed by chemotherapy and radiation offered Marsha the same survival odds Double lumpectomy is what Marsha chose Thirteen years later she is in good health As Marsha and I learned the important thing is to talk to surgeons who devote a great portion of their practice to breast cancer  and then to make a decision that seems right to both doctor and patient In his practice Tuttle sees the lumpectomy vs mastectomy debate play out every day A woman comes and she has a small breast cancer Before I can even examine her shell say Ive already decided I want a double mastectomy  Tuttle told Shots He tells women that mastectomy takes four to six hours compared with an hour for a lumpectomy That the complication rate is low from lumpectomy and moderate to high for mastectomy And that in many cases with lumpectomy plus radiation there is absolutely no difference in survival for women who do not have hereditary breast cancer Some women will reply I didnt realize that Others will say Thats very interesting When can I have my double mastectomy As for the husbands role in this process he needs to understand that its not his job to tell his wife what to do But that doesnt mean hes useless He can act as a sounding board as his partner mulls over options It helps too to say those three little words I love you And then youd be wise to follow the breast cancer husbands motto Shut up and listen to your wife
