 In Sierra Leone cellphone users are as likely to get a text about hand washing as about a social gathering In an effort to contain Ebola the   IFRC has teamed up with local cellphone provider   and the Sierra Leonean government to send health reminders via text message Since the Ebola outbreak began last April the Trilogy Emergency Relief Application TERA system has sent out about  million text messages a month in Sierra Leone reminding people to seek treatment early avoid physical contact with others and not resist the efforts of community health care workers TERA a system created by Bolivian software company   and set up by the IFRC can send a text to every phone turned on in a specific region The texts are delivered free so theres no financial burden to the recipient In countries where Internet access is not ubiquitous cellphones play a vital role in communicating messages directly to a mass audience during health and other crises   of Sierra Leoneans have a cellphone connection but only  percent have a G or cellular Internet plan Every mobile phone can do text messaging says Ken Banks mobile technologist and founder of   a project that unites cellular technology with social change It doesnt matter if its the cheapest model or the most expensive This isnt the first time TERA has tackled an emergency The system was piloted in Haiti after the  earthquake and was first used in Sierra Leone during a  cholera outbreak The interactivity is appealing Recipients can text back with basic questions about Ebola and get an automated response with information about treatment options cleaning tips and medical help And since the texts are sent to specific areas of the country the messages which are drafted by the IFRC and the Sierra Leonean Ministry of Health can be personalized with regional advice Even though the country has low literacy rates    for adults  textbased services are effective ways to disseminate information In villages where there is low literacy there might only be a few people with cellphones who can read these messages says Christine Tokar West Africa programs manager for the   Tokar says those who can read share the information with the town crier who would distribute it through town meetings The texts are intended to reinforce similar messages delivered via posters radio and television ads But a text can be preserved on the phone shown to a friend and referenced later  say when Ebola comes to a previously unaffected area The Red Cross is hoping to have TERA up and running in  countries across the globe in the next five years The challenge is getting countries to put the system in place when there isnt an immediate need says Robin Burton mobile operator relations officer for the IFRC Using the Ebola outbreak as a catalyst the Red Cross is hoping to expand the program to seven West African countries in the next few months Benin Togo Ghana Mali Guinea Bissau Gambia and Burkina Faso This will require buyin from the countries as well as from a phone company which may be hesitant While these texts are seen as useful during a health crisis users might grow weary of regular preparedness messages The system has been built to appeal to both consumers and cell providers TERA can only send text messages to phones that are turned on so networks are not clogged with undelivered messages In Sierra Leone the text messages are sent at less busy times for the cell network so the company doesnt need to expand its capacity For consumers there is no violation of privacy No actual phone numbers are seen by TERA operators And theres an optout feature Thats what some Haitians did when they tired of getting messages to wash their hands regularly Long after Ebola has subsided in West Africa the TERA system will remain in place for times of conflict or natural disasters Its currently being used in Nepal for earthquake preparedness We hope this will empower people to help themselves says Burton They could send a message back to us saying Thanks for the rice but we have no way to cook it or We dont eat pork here We call it beneficial communications because it helps everyone do better
