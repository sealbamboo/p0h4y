California Democratic Rep Henry Waxman one of the last remaining members of the huge postWatergate   is calling it quits at the end of this term Most people who live outside his Los Angeles district and off Capitol Hill have likely never heard of Waxman He was never a fixture on the Sunday talk shows or in Washingtons social scene Rather during his  years in the House of Representatives Waxman focused on passing legislation  lots of legislation On the website of the    where he has served in the leadership since the s  the list of   pass would be impressive for a halfdozen people It includes health laws like the Affordable Care Act the Ryan White AIDS law and the Childrens Health Insurance Program consumer laws requiring nutrition labels and tobacco warning labels and environmental laws including updates to the Clean Air Act and to the Safe Drinking Water Act Those who specialize in watching Congress and its workings say Waxman will ultimately be remembered alongside those who commanded much more of the spotlight Waxman is really one of the Ted Kennedys of the Congress says   of the Brookings Institution Remember theyre both liberals but both had an uncanny ability to work with other members when they needed to be on both sides of the aisle to get things done Indeed Waxman has never apologized for   We need government he told NPR Wednesday We appreciate it when theres an emergency We need government when we want clean air and clean water and food thats not going to kill us and drugs that will save us But whats made Waxman so effective over the years has been that willingness to work across the aisle One of his frequent partners has been   a conservative Republican from Utah The two first teamed up on major legislation in  on a bill that paved the way for the sale of   Whats come to be known as the HatchWaxman law is on its way to saving trillions of dollars for consumers Hatch says Its already saved about  trillion Hatch who worked with Waxman on the   the   and other bills also opposed him on many issues But he says he appreciated having Waxman as an adversary as much as an ally Hes a formidable opponent because Henry is always prepared Hatch says Hes very very bright but Henry was not only bright he was articulate He understood the legislative process Hes one of the best liberal congresspeople Ive known in my whole  years in the United States Senate And while Waxman made it a point to work across the aisle he also made it a point to bring along the liberals who will carry on when hes gone He was a teacher He was a mentor He encouraged me he patiently explained complicated things to me said   DOhio who began his legislative career in Washington on the House Energy and Commerce Committee under Waxmans tutelage Brown says that among the things he learned from Waxman are how you legislate and how you work to educate the public and how you change the debate when the other partys in control Waxman is known as a tenacious negotiator  but also for being patient and methodical During the s when cutting budgets was the rule he quietly worked to   even within massive budget reduction bills And he would do it year by year so that ultimately it truly became institutionalized said   of the health advocacy group Families USA But Waxman says that even at a relatively young  he feels Congress has reached a point where he can no longer get much done Its very difficult when the party thats in control is dominated by a group of extremists from the Tea Party that think along the lines of compromise as being a dirty word and working with the other party the Democrats as complicity with the enemy he says Advocates off Capitol Hill are already wondering what Congress will be like for their issues in a postWaxman era Hes just a formidable foe for those people on the other side says Pollack And hes really a personal archive of policy and the history of health care So it will be an enormous loss to see Henry leave the Congress Others worry about the loss of Waxmans staff  long considered among the top experts in their respective fields Former Waxman staffers have often frequently gone on to top positions in Democratic administrations the current White House health policy coordinator   was a longtime Waxman chief of staff As for Waxman himself he says he hasnt decided what hell do when he finishes his term He says he loves both California and Washington DC and would like to find something that will let him continue to split his time between the two but not have to go back and forth every week  the way serving in Congress demands
