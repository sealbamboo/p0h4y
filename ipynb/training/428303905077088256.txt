It would have been hard to find a happier man than Erick Munoz on that Tuesday morning before Thanksgiving With a healthy and delightful son toddling around the house and his beautiful and successful wife pregnant with their second child the fire department paramedic had everything in life thats really important So it must have been with a feeling of disbelief and horror that Munoz knelt across the nearly lifeless body of his wife Marlise on the kitchen floor at  am his fingers linking across her heart arms pumping away in vain Shed gotten up to make a bottle for their son and had been lying there for an hour not breathing before he found her Rushed to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth Texas Marlise Munoz was hardly alive What little life she clung to would soon slip away On Thanksgiving Day doctors told her husband what he already knew His yearold wife was gone A blood clot in her lungs had killed her perhaps They werent completely sure Doctors informed Munoz and Marlises parents Lynne and Ernest Machado that the hospital wasnt going to disconnect Marlise from the ventilator Texas law prohibited it because she was pregnant The Texas Advance Directives Act states A doctor may not withdraw or withhold lifesustaining treatment from a pregnant patient Munoz and his wifes parents told the hospital that Marlise herself a veteran paramedic had made it clear to everyone she didnt want to be kept alive by machines under any circumstances The doctors and the hospital explained that it didnt matter what Marlise or her husband or anyone else wanted  their hands were tied She would stay on the ventilator until her weekold fetus was delivered or died The law protects the hospital from all liability as long as it keeps the pregnant patient on life support It doesnt actually forbid the hospital to remove support but the hospital loses its legal immunity if it does And that seemed to be the guiding light for the lawyers representing John Peter Smith Hospital Marlise was dead by Thanksgiving There was no activity at all in her brain or brain stem It seemed too macabre to be true like something out of the book   keeping dead bodies alive to harvest their organs The media no surprise came running And reporters began looking into this Texas Advance Directives Act and interviewing its authors And the authors told reporters they never meant for their law to be used to keep a pregnant dead woman alive until the hospital could deliver the baby They said if thats what John Peter Smith Hospital was doing the hospital was misreading the law The authors said they intended to keep a pregnant woman who was in a persistent vegetative state on a ventilator until she could deliver but not a dead pregnant woman This was a major development in the story but the hospital remained frozen Marlise was still in serious condition the spokeswoman affirmed As the standoff approached the end of its second month Erick Munoz had had enough He sued John Peter Smith Hospital for cruel and obscene mutilation of a corpse that corpse being the love of his life When the case got to court last Friday it quickly fell apart for the hospital Its lawyers conceded in their filing that Munoz had been braindead since Thanksgiving The hospital also agreed her fetus wasnt viable like its mother it had been deprived of oxygen for at least an hour The hospitals defense of its conduct was a tortured interpretation of the Texas Advance Directives Act If the legislature intended for life sustaining treatment to be withdrawn allowing the unborn child to die it could have expressed this intent by adding a second sentence to section  to the effect that upon the mothers death the healthcare providers must withdraw life sustaining treatment and let the unborn child die the legal response from the hospital said It did not so provide And so John Peter Smith Hospital maintained a corpse against the wishes of the family for the protection of a fetus that couldnt live As antiabortion and proMunoz protesters demonstrated outside the courtroom State District Judge RH Wallaces ruling was direct and brief Mrs Munoz is dead he wrote Defendants are ordered to pronounce Mrs Munoz dead and remove the ventilator and all other lifesustaining treatment from the body As Wallaces verdict was read Erick Munoz wept into his hands as his motherinlaw held him in her arms and cried
