Brother Jayananda offered these principles for a balanced life, based on Hindu guru Paramahansa Yogananda's teachings.. — Have everything in your life properly weighted — work, family, education, health. If you only try and balance the material side of things, it becomes impossible.. — Follow a simple diet. When it comes to food, he said, have "common sense health habits and a strong mind.". — "Remember that everything that comes to us in life is meant to come to us. By all means, try and change things. But don't resent where you are.". — Work toward simplicity, especially because the world is so complex. "Be as simple as you can be," Jayananda said. "You will be astonished to see how uncomplicated and happy your life becomes.". — "Use your mind for worthwhile endeavors: Concentrate on great books and great men. The mind will evolve at a higher spirit, and you won't be pulled down into smaller things.". — "Be cheerful and willing and ever ready to change.". — "Serve others. Rather than striving for personal happiness, try and make others happy."
