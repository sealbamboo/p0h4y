A targets and terror approach to ensure large hospital  departments in England treat admit or discharge  of patients within four hours may undermine their care a former senior NHS official has said The micromanagement culture within the NHS and Department of Health coupled with increasingly tight budgets will hasten the point at which entire urgent care system reaches breaking point says Nigel Edwards chief executive of the   thinktank Senior managers in hospitals are so busy collecting information on how they are doing each week to satisfy regulators   bosses health commissioners and politicians that they are not sorting problems on their own frontline Edwards and two coauthors claim in a briefing paper Major AEs have not hit the  mark since summer  despite all the attention paid to weekly figures in recent months they say  But emphasis on the fourhour measure distorts the picture of how big hospitals are doing in the face of a  increase in attendances at their AE units and a  increase in emergency admissions in a decade  The AE rise is entirely in line with what would be expected based on population growth according to the paper which warns that  extra hospital beds could be needed by  unless more could be done to treat people outside hospital  The NHS response was based on the anxiety of the hierarchy rather than on the care of patients and the flow of patients through the system it said  Edwards a former policy director at the NHS Confederation which represents health service leaders said the fourhour target had come to loom over every other measure in monitoring emergency care Politicians and regulators need to stop micromanaging this target and should instead examine how to put the fourhour target on an equal footing with other critical indicators like trolley wait or time to treatment   The paper also questions whether AE problems are down to changes in family doctor contracts in  making it harder to see GPs out of hours difficulties in getting GP appointments patients misusing the system or poor triaging by the NHS  service In a separate article for the   which is read by healthcare leaders Edwards said trust research found site managers who should be spending their first hours at work checking on the hospital were frequently diverted by the need to gather information and to participate in conference calls Paradoxically the point at which things become most fraught  for example when a hospital runs out of beds  is exactly the point when the demand for information actions and progress chasing becomes most intrusive said Edwards The blameengineering ritual gives comfort to people who are fielding demands for action and assurance from above but in fact have no real control over the situation and even if they did might not have the expertise to use it  and neither of this weeks interventions by Edwards names critics within the NHS  His remarks follow   They were strongly denied by NHS England and the Department of Health  In response to the Nuffield paper the department said The AE target is an important part of making sure patients get seen quickly and safely with over nine out of ten currently being seen treated or discharged in  hours Patients would expect the health secretary and senior NHS leaders to pay close attention to quality of care
