The UKs care system for dying patients with terminal illnesses is lacking and needs a major overhaul says a damning new report  According to London School of Economics researchers more than  people a year who would benefit from palliative care are not getting it  Patients are being left without sufficient pain relief and respite NHS England said it was committed to ensuring terminallyill patients got the support and services they needed The report found inequalities in access to good care with certain groups of patients more likely to miss out  With an ageing population and demand for care increasing the problem looked set to worsen it warned Those who currently miss out include Most palliative care goes to cancer patients even though the diseases account for less than a third of deaths Only a fifth of new referrals to specialist endoflife services are for people with noncancer diagnoses  According to the report commissioned by the Marie Curie charity providing palliative care to those that need it could improve the quality of life for thousands of patients and save the NHS money by preventing unwanted and distressing hospital treatment By their calculations the net potential savings are more than m in England at least m in Wales more than m in Northern Ireland and more than m in Scotland  Meanwhile a separate MORI poll of  health professionals who look after terminallyill patients  also commissioned by Marie Curie  reveals that many feel there is insufficient funding and staffing to provide the level of care needed  Likewise a recent poll of  carers  mostly family members friends or neighbours of terminallyill people  felt the current care system did not offer enough support Denis McKnight  from Northern Ireland cared for his wife Georgina who had motor neurone disease  A district nurse would visit once a week but Mr McKnight said this was nowhere near enough to meet their care needs He said I felt alone I felt almost abandoned except for my family Palliative care as it is provided by the nursing system is the best that they can possibly do Most nurses would want to do the very best job possible They just dont have the resources to do it Its the system that is cracking under the strain When Mr McKnight struggled to cope with his wifes increasingly demanding care needs as her disease progressed a friend suggested he ask Marie Curie for help Mrs McKnight was unable to walk or move for herself and could not swallow so needed to be fed via a tube Mr McKnight said Im more than grateful for what Marie Curie did even for that short period of time They stepped in as specialists and gave specialist help They were able to step into the breach  a breach thats been created through lack of resources in the ordinary healthcare system Dr Jane Collins chief executive of Marie Curie said Everyone affected by terminal illness should have access to all the care and support they need regardless of their personal circumstances This report shows that this is not the case and some groups are getting a worse deal than others We dont think this is good enough Katherine Murphy chief executive of the Patients Association called the current situation a national disgrace  These findings mirror many of the inquiries to our national helpline It is unacceptable that we continue to fail the most vulnerable in our society Dr Bee Wee national clinical director for endoflife care at NHS England said NHS England is committed to ensuring that all patients get the support and services they need towards the end of life A Welsh government spokesperson said Whether a person wishes to die in hospital in a hospice or at home we want to make sure the right level of professional caring support is available  Ensuring that care and support is effectively planned and coordinated across health and social care to meet peoples needs is one of the priorities being taken forward through our work on integration
