Young people in the United States are safer than in the s or s according to a longterm study Duke Universitys Child WellBeing Index has been recording the state of childhood in the US since  Children and teenagers are less likely to be victims of violent crime while risky behaviours like binge drinking and smoking cigarettes are in decline But researchers say safer lives could also reflect the fact children spend much more time indoors This could also be linked to another big trend the rise in childhood obesity now almost four times more prevalent than in the s Researchers say the reduction in physical danger has followed a trend for young people to spend more time at home playing computer games or using laptops or mobile phones The rising health threat is now from so many children becoming overweight The Index which draws upon official data from sources like the US Department of Justice the Census Bureau the US Department of Education the National Center for Education Statistics and the National Center for Health Statistics shows the likelihood of a teenager becoming the victim of violent crime is now lower than in  and considerably lower than in  Despite highprofile concerns about safety researchers say children are now at lower risk of violence and much less likely to die before reaching adulthood The level of violent crime victimisation up to the age of  climbed through the s peaked in the mids and then fell sharply reaching its lowest point in  It has risen again since but remains below the average for the four decades The death rate among young people up to the age of  has fallen to about a third of mids levels And over the past  years teenagers have become less likely to smoke tobacco or to binge drink alcohol In contrast the use of illicit drugs mostly cannabis has remained more constant About a quarter of  to yearolds reported having used drugs in the previous month a level similar to the late s This is still considerably below levels of youth drug use in the late s and early s says the study which also uses the Monitoring the Future research which has tracked the behaviour of  young people each year since the s The Index produced each year notes a slight improvement in the state of childrens lives in the US Family incomes have risen slightly but the impact of the recession is still apparent with typical family income below late s levels  The longterm figures show the pressure on family incomes in recent decades The current typical income of families with children when inflation is taken into account is only  higher than in  The figures on education also show only modest increases in levels of qualifications during decades when many other countries experienced much greater improvements The study also suggests many big changes in family structure and beliefs took place between the mids and the lates while the past  years has shown a more stable picture The proportion of children living in singleparent families rose sharply in the s and s But the current levels with about a quarter of children in singleparent families are similar to  years ago Young peoples attendance at religious services has also remained broadly similar after a big decline in the s and early s The current attendance rate of more than  is similar to late s levels The teenage birth rate is now at its lowest since this index was launched in  It peaked in the early s and has fallen each year since The proportion of  to yearold girls giving birth is now about a third of  numbers The report concludes that apart from rising levels of obesity the shortterm picture for young peoples wellbeing is positive with even greater improvements over the longer term Compared to  years ago US children are doing pretty well said Kenneth Laud lead author and sociology professor at Duke University
