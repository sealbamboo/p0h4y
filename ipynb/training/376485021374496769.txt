Electronic cigarettes are sparking lots of skepticism from public health types worried they may be a gateway to regular smoking But the cigarettes which use water vapor to deliver nicotine into the lungs may be as good as the patch when it comes to stopsmoking aids a study finds Smokers who used ecigarettes in an attempt to quit the oldfashioned kind of cigarettes did about as well at stopping smoking as the people who tried the patch After six months  percent of esmokers had dropped cigarettes compared to  percent of people wearing the patch Either way quitting is hard The number of people who quit was low overall  just  of the  smokers given the ecig or the patch That wasnt enough people to say for sure that one approach was better than the other What we couldnt show is that ecigarettes are definitely superior to nicotine patches says   an associate professor at the University of Auckland who led the research He and his colleagues figured that the ecigarettes would be much more successful based on consumer surveys showing that people were less than pleased with the patch Still Bullen says the low quit rates are what you might expect when people are trying to quit without much counseling or support That and the batteries kept failing in the early model ecigarettes We had to keep sending out batteries Bullen told Shots All that said some ecigarette users were able to reduce the number of cigarettes they smoked even if they didnt quit The results were presented at the European Respiratory Society meeting in Barcelona and   in   The researchers recruited  smokers in Auckland New Zealand who wanted to stop smoking Half were given ecigarettes and the other half got coupons for nicotine patches which are typically prescribed as a stopsmoking aid Another  smokers were given ecigs without nicotine as a control Those people also made progress in quitting smoking with  percent off tobacco after six months I think that speaks to the behavioral replacement Bullen says Theyre oral Theyre tactile Theres a ritualistic thing where you prepare the product and put it in your mouth and draw on it The number of children and teenagers using ecigarettes more than doubled in a year the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  this week Numbers like that have  in the United States worried that ecigarettes will serve as a gateway to smoking cigarettes which are much more toxic than ecigarettes Theres not yet evidence that thats happening Bullen says I dont think thats an inevitable pathway Efforts to regulate ecigarettes could harm current smokers he says For some people I think ecigarettes will be part of the solution But theyre not going to be a magic bullet
