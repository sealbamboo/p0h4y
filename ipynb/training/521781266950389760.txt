Would you swallow frozen poop in a pill What if you were infected by a stubborn strain of   and suffering from diarrhea bad enough to send you to a hospital It may  OK probably does  sound gross But researchers are embracing the concept of treating repeat   with fecal transplants The idea is that a healthy persons poop contains the right mix of gut bacteria to keep the gastrointestinal tract running smoothly By transplanting a sample from that microbiome into a person whose gut has been colonized by   the recipient can get his or her GI tract back in working order Americans   an estimated  billion a year battling   and the bacterium is involved in about  American   each year according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Cases appear to be rising as antibioticresistant bacteria become more prevalent so doctors are becoming more openminded about unconventional treatments Several studies have demonstrated that the transplants really work In a  published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine researchers reported that CDI patients who got a fecal transplant in addition to a bowel cleansing and the antibiotic vancomycin fared far better than those who didnt Of the  patients in the fecal transplant group  saw their infections clear up after one treatment and two of the remaining three got better after a second treatment  an overall cure rate of  That compares with a  cure rate for CDI patients treated with the antibiotic alone and a  cure rate for patients who took the antibiotic and had a bowel cleansing In that study patients received their transplants  a mixture of fresh stool and lightly salted water through a nasal tube that delivered the solution directly into the small intestine Patients had no chance to smell or taste the tested remedy Later that year another research group presented   of a trial of fresh poop pills In that study fecal donors were relatives of the patients and their poop was compacted into gelatin capsules When the researchers presented their results at a meeting of infectious disease experts they claimed success in  of the  patients they had treated Now a team from Massachusetts General Hospital Boston Childrens Hospital Harvard Medical School and Tel Aviv University in Israel has gone a step further as detailed in a   published online Saturday by the Journal of the American Medical Assn Obtaining fresh stool samples isnt practical for patients who need treatment right away Among other logistical hurdles screening potential donors and their poop can take days or weeks So they tested frozen poop pills that could be made in advance and stored until needed like traditional medications The researchers collected poop samples from four healthy donors who hadnt taken antibiotics for at least six months Their blood was screened for HIV hepatitis A B and C and a bacterium that causes syphilis In addition their feces were tested for various intestinal pathogens Four weeks after their donations they were screened again for HIV and hepatitis B and C to be sure nothing was missed the first time around The donated stool was placed in a blender and mixed with saline then strained to remove large particles The remaining slurry was concentrated and packed into capsules that contained about  grams of fecal matter apiece Then the pills were kept frozen at a chilly  degrees below zero A total of  patients received the pills between July  and January  The patients whose ages ranged from  to  had suffered at least three bouts of mild to moderate CDI or had at least two episodes that were severe enough to send them to a hospital Before they tried the frozen pills they were having diarrhea up to  times a day The volunteers swallowed  pills a day for two days in a row For  of the  patients that was enough to stop the diarrhea and keep it away for about eight weeks though one patient relapsed The six patients who were still sick took another round of  pills about a week later After that five of them saw their symptoms resolve Overall the researchers reported the frozen poop pills led to clinical resolution of diarrhea in  of the patients On average it took four days for the pills to work Thats twice as long as in other studies that tested fecal transplants administered through nasal tubes or with a colonoscope The pills caused only mild side effects  cramping and bloating  in six patients and all symptoms were resolved within three days None of the  patients threw up after taking the pills according to the JAMA study Though the researchers described the results as preliminary they said they could help make fecal transplants accessible to a wider population of patients in addition to potentially making the procedure safer The study was published ahead of print to coincide with a presentation Saturday at   a conference of infectious disease experts in Philadelphia
