Cocaine dependence is a devilishly difficult addiction to break owing to the drugs unique chemical ability both to reward users and to disrupt their impulsecontrol mechanisms But a surprising drug combination may offer an equally clever way to loosen cocaines hold on an addict a new study has found The experimental treatment regime used a mix of topiramate  an antiseizure drug that has shown promise in breaking dependence on nicotine and alcohol  and stimulant drugs  amphetamines  which in addition to being widely abused are used to treat attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder Individually both classes of drug have been tried as a treatment for cocaine dependence Topiramate has shown some promise but is slow to take effect amphetamines have not by themselves proven useful The drug duo comes at a time when no single drug has been shown effective in treating cocaine dependence But in a trial that pitted a sham medication against the topiramateamphetamine duo for  days cocaine addicts taking the combination drug were roughly twice as likely to string together three consecutive weeks of cocaine abstinence  of  cocainedependent subjects than were those who got the placebo  of  subjects or  Subjects in both groups also received psychotherapy aimed at keeping them on their medication regimens and off their street drugs Moreover the medication combo appeared to curb cocaine urges within a few weeks much faster than the eightweek period it took for topiramate alone to take effect in other studies And the combination appeared to be most effective in curbing the addiction of the studys most frequent cocaine users  typically those who are hardest to reach with standard psychotherapeutic approaches The combination appears to work to correct several of the chemical imbalances in the brain induced by frequent cocaine use surmised the authors all substanceabuse researchers from Columbia Universitys College of Surgeons and Physicians Topiramate is commercially marketed as Topamax and most recently became half of an FDAapproved combination drug for obesity Qsymia The present study which was published this week in the journal Biological Psychiatry and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse was very small Noting that drug combinations in general  and this combination specifically  may be the answer to treating cocaine dependency with medication its authors called for larger studies
