The day Michelle Wallace gave birth to her fourth child, her doctors discovered she was suffering from an advanced case of endometrial cancer.. Ms. Wallace worried she was going to die before her newborn son, Toby, grew up. "Her biggest fear was that he was not going to remember her," says Kallie Greenly, Ms. Wallace's adult daughter. So before she died in 2011 at age 43, Ms. Wallace recorded a 17-minute video for her son, talking about her life, her idea of happiness and how she wanted to be remembered.
