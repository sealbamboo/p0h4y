Do you believe youre doomed to be overweight due to a   New research indicates that whats wrong with your engine can be fixed It is possible to improve metabolic functioning and that means you can be healthier feel younger and look better Doctors once thought all our bodies worked pretty much the same way when it comes to metabolism Now they know thats not true Genes along with other biological predispositions most likely influence metabolic function You can inherit a poky metabolism it seems as easily as blue eyes A fast metabolism is easy to spot These are the people who can chow down yet remain slim Then theres your best friend who seems to live on yogurt and rice cakes but is still a size  A slow internal engine left unchecked usually leads to weight gain and obesity Right now there are no safe effective medications to speed up your metabolism and help you lose weight says Barry Goldstein MD PhD chief of endocrinology at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia Lifestyle changes are the only viable alternatives for people currently struggling with metabolic problems That means changing   and increasing your level of activity Well show you simple easy ways to get real results Think of your metabolism as an engine fueled by food Just as cars react differently to unleaded gas and diesel fuel our metabolisms react to what we eat In terms of metabolism the   that works for one individual may not work for the next says Mary Ellen Doukakis a registered dietitian with the Clinical Nutrition Center in Denver Your response to   carbs and fat depends on your individual biochemical makeup Its definitely an advantage to know what works for you  Many of us may be able to   by replacing some carbs including breads and starches with protein from meat poultry and dairy foods according to a study published in the July  issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition The participants were all overweight or obese men and women with insulin resistance When they ate a highprotein diet percent protein  percent carbohydrates and  percent fatthe women in the study not only lost fat mass but also kept more lean mass muscle during the week study period Those who didnt lose as much ate a diet consisting of  percent protein  percent carbohydrates and  percent fat So forgo the bagel for a proteinladen scrambled egg Replace the pasta salad with a piece of grilled chicken Just dont cut carbs out completely or youll be setting yourself up for other health problems says Dr Goldstein Check out wwwedietscom which offers meal plans and recipes from Atkins and the Zone along with support groups diet diaries and numerous other motivating resources Cost  a week  In a  nutrition study presented at a conference of the American Diabetes Association overweight participants made their metabolisms more efficient by eating more vegetables and fruit By gradually cutting out animal products including meat and dairy and keeping the use of vegetable oils very low for six months they saw on average a  percent improvement in their metabolic function says Neal Barnard MD who is the author of Turn Off the Fat Genes  Forget those lowfat foods and cottage cheese They have a low thermic effect which refers to how our bodies convert calories into body heat The goal is to burn off more calories and store less fat Increase the thermic effect by eating   rich in complex carbs not simple carbs such as sugar Eat an apple instead of a lowfat muffin Pass on the macaroni and cheese in favor of baked beans By substituting  percent or more of your meal with highfiber foods youll burn more calories for several hours Dr Barnard says Reorienting our eating habits can also have a real impact on how efficiently our metabolism works  Some dieters dont do well eating carbs because their portions are just too big Doukakis points out Onequarter cup of noodles might not be an issue to you But if you eat one cup of noodles your body may not respond as well This has less to do with the carbs than it does with the portion  Eating a   of less than  calories daily often ends with an eating binge resulting in rapid regain Every time you do this your body reacts by going into starvation mode which entails water retention and worse a significantly slower metabolism But theres more reason not to crash diet Often when you lose and regain weight the weight gain is in the abdominal area and leads to more centralbody obesity explains Gail DEramo Melkus EdD a nurse practitioner and community health educator at Yale University School of Nursing in New Haven Connecticut Numerous studies have shown that centralbody obesity is associated with coronary heart disease hypertension and   Instead cut the portion sizes of everything you eat by onethird suggests Melkus In restaurants eat   and take home the rest in a doggie bag or share an appetizer and an entre Calories count of course but activity in the   is key to improving how your body uses and stores what you eat Introduce exercise into your day Our research indicates that moderate exercise thirty minutes a day along with mild weight loss averaging ten pounds changes ones metabolism Mohammed Saad MD a researcher and professor of medicine at UCLA explains It also reduced the development of diabetes by as much as fiftyeight percent This is surprising Take a brisk halfhour walk and watch your   Sit on a park bench and do leg raises Throw in a few toe touches or almosttouches and waist bends Do it several times a week and the impact on your metabolism will be profound says Dr Saad Sustain your level of activity over time Exercise alone may help you trim down according to a new month study of young overweight men and women at the University of Kansas Participants were divided into two groups One did moderate supervised exercise the other didnt change their activity level Neither group dieted Both men and women in the exercise group lost significant abdominal fat while their lean muscle mass remained the same Use exercise to burn off fat Exercise triggers the bodys muscles to use up calories rather than store them as fat says Dr Goldstein Maintaining muscle mass also consumes more energy for the body In the end exercise is the key to maintaining weight loss How your body works is affected by more than doughnuts and situps For instance metabolism speeds up then slows down as we age Take nursing mothers for example Breastfeeding increases their metabolism and they must eat more to keep producing enough milk for their babies On the other hand a womans engine slows down during menopause because of the huge drop in hormone production This can lead to weight gain because testosterone helps metabolize fat So eating what used to be normal amounts actually piles on the pounds By old age many people slim down again and subsist on smaller amounts of food When asked why you think you gained weight you answered
