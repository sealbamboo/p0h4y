Men with vasectomies may be at an increased risk for the most lethal form of prostate cancer researchers have found But aggressive cancer nonetheless remains rare in these patients Earlier studies had hinted at a connection between vasectomies and prostate cancer Many experts have dismissed the idea of a link Men who have vasectomies may receive more medical attention they said and therefore may be more likely to receive a diagnosis The new study   sought to account for that possibility and for other variables Researchers at Harvard reviewed data on  men ages  to  of whom  had had vasectomies They found  cases of prostate cancer among those men from  to  The researchers found no association between a vasectomy and lowgrade cancers But men who had had a vasectomy were about  percent more likely to develop lethal prostate cancer compared with those who had not The incidence was  in  cases compared with  in  over the year period The reason for the increase is unclear but some experts have speculated that immunological changes abnormal cell growth or hormonal imbalances following a vasectomy may also affect prostate cancer risk Dr James M McKiernan interim chairman of the department of urology at Columbia said the lack of a clear causal mechanism was a drawback of the new research If someone asked for a vasectomy I would have to tell them that there is this new data in this regard but its not enough for me to change the standard of care he said I would not say that you should avoid vasectomy The lead author Lorelei A Mucci an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health emphasized that a vasectomy does not increase the risk for prostate cancer over all Were really seeing the association only for advanced state and lethal cancers she said She agreed with Dr McKiernan that the new data are not a reason to avoid a vasectomy Having a vasectomy is a highly personal decision that men should make with their families and discuss with their physicians she said This is one piece of evidence that should be considered
