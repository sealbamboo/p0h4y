Millions of Americans take ginkgo biloba supplements to boost memory and prevent   Studies have never found any solid evidence that ginkgo does any such thing but it did not seem to be doing much harm But last month scientists released the first government toxicology study of ginkgo biloba which found that the extract  one of the topselling   in the country    including an excessive number of liver and thyroid cancers as well as nasal tumors The findings were somewhat surprising because ginkgo biloba has had a long and apparently benign history of human use Although it has been associated with bleeding and cerebral hemorrhages in the elderly there have generally been few reports of serious side effects The results of the study do not confirm that ginkgo biloba is dangerous to humans but it is disturbing that the laboratory animals all tended to suffer the same sorts of injuries said Cynthia Rider of the   and the lead scientist of the ginkgo biloba study We often see different targets depending on the sex of the animal or the species finding one thing here and one thing there Dr Rider said But with the ginkgo studies it was consistent across the sexes and the species The liver was a target the thyroid was a target and the nose That consistency strengthens our conclusions she added The study concluded that there is clear evidence that ginkgo causes carcinogenic activity in the livers of mice and some evidence linking it to carcinogenic activity in rats thyroids The mice developed large numbers of multiple liver cancers including a particularly aggressive type that is rarely seen in the rodents The number of cancers exceeded the total in the comparison group In some instances the number of cancers exceeded the numbers ever seen in mice in the lab the investigators said Officials with the American Herbal Products Association a trade organization for companies that sell herbs and botanical products and the American Botanical Council a nonprofit group that publishes and educates people about medicinal plants have sharply criticized the study saying that the ginkgo extract used had a different chemical composition than the extract typically sold in the United States The government scientists say they purchased it from a major supplier to American supplement companies More important the critics questioned how applicable animal toxicity studies  long considered a mainstay in evaluating cancer risk  are to human health and how the high doses often used in these studies relate to human consumption It is a valid criticism as doses used in toxicology studies tend to be very high In the new ginkgo study mice were given up to  milligrams of extract per kilogram of body weight or just over  milligrams per pound of body weight five times a week Doses sold for human consumption range from  to  milligrams regardless of body size This says nothing about toxicity in people or what would be a safe dose in people said Steven Dentali the trade associations chief scientific officer Its just a crude tool toxicologists have to determine if something is harmful If it hurts the animals maybe it hurts people The Food and Drug Administration already bans ginkgo biloba from food and beverages and the agency has repeatedly told drink manufacturers to remove ginkgo from its products Most recently   a company in Hood River Ore that its juice drinks were adulterated with ginkgo which it called an unsafe and unapproved additive citing the new report Several beverage companies including Rockstar and Just Chill have removed ginkgo biloba from beverages after receiving letters from the FDA But when it comes to supplements the government has a different standard A substance that is considered unsafe in food items or drinks can be legally sold as a supplement We dont review supplements before they go to market said Tamara Ward an FDA spokeswoman We get involved when there is a risk to the consumer but manufacturers are responsible for making sure the products do not pose a risk to the consumer and for making sure claims are not misleading The distinction has long rankled consumer advocates The   no longer regards ginkgo biloba as safe and is urging consumers to avoid it The burden now shifts to industry to prove that it is safe said Michael F Jacobson executive director of the center There is no way to do a study in humans You would need millions of people who take ginkgo biloba and millions who dont who all eat the same diet and have the same lifestyle Government industry and academia have all generally accepted animal studies as indicators of human risk Moreover he pointed out several large clinical trials that followed thousands of elderly people to see if ginkgo biloba delayed cognitive decline failed to find any evidence that the extract was beneficial The studies included a large randomized controlled clinical trial of more than  people aged  years and older in the United States and a French study that included  people over age  who were followed for five years The FDA is reviewing the new evidence from the toxicology study and could change its guidance in the future Ms Ward said
