Two separate software glitches took HealthCare.gov offline on Monday as the site struggled to stay open during this year's final day of enrollment under the Affordable Care Act.. The new problem hit around 12 p.m. EDT and was preventing users from creating new accounts and logging in with new accounts, said a person familiar with the matter. The glitch was related to the part of the system that processes peoples' identities, the person said. Users trying to log in were told "HealthCare.gov has a lot of visitors right now"...
