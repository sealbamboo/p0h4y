Can measles really kill you Is the vaccine more dangerous than the disease People seeking answers to questions like these often search for them online And when they do they can be strongly influenced by the information they find there  even when it comes from some surprising sources a new study suggests When presented with mock public service announcements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the National Vaccine Information Center study volunteers found the information persuasive But they also welcomed advice from fake commenters researchers found We were quite surprised by the results said study lead author   a professor of marketing at Washington State Universitys Carson College of Business Given that the CDCs recommendations are based on scientific evidence and the CDCs mission is to protect individuals we expected the PSAs to be more impactful than the online comments from presumably nonexperts Nearly  in  Internet users look for health information online according to a    by the Pew Research Center Much of that information comes from official sources like the CDC the National Institutes of Health and the American Academy of Pediatrics All three endorse the   recommended by the   But visitors to health websites have a lot to share as well Kareklas and his WSU colleagues  fellow marketing professor Darrel Muehling and graduate student TJ Weber  wondered whether those comments have any effect on readers So they conducted a series of experiments to find out First they designed a pair of public service announcements featuring a photo of a tiny sleeping baby In one version the PSA was headlined Save a Life Vaccinate Underneath was a CDC logo and the following text Vaccines have significantly decreased the occurrence of lifethreatinging diseases including polio measles and pertussis whooping cough By choosing to vaccinate you may be saving a life In the other version titled Save a Life Dont Vaccinate readers were warned that vaccines have significantly increased the occurrence of lifethreatening diseases medicationresistant seizures and mental retardation By choosing not to vaccinate you may be saving a life The logo for the National Vaccine Information Center appeared in one corner The nonprofit NVIC says it does not advocate for or against the use of vaccines and   as a proponent of vaccine safety and informed consent protections in the public health system However its campaigns portray vaccines as risky and encourage people to consider alternatives like handwashing In his book Denialism How Irrational Thinking Hinders Scientific Progress Harms the Planet and Threatens Our Lives   calls the group the most powerful antivaccine organization in America Study participants rated both groups as credible in a point test that measured characteristics like honesty believability and truthfulness the CDC earned an average score of  and the NVIC got a  And the more that study participants believed in an organizatons credibility the more accepting they were of the views in their mock PSAs the researchers found In another experiment the same PSAs were followed by reaction from three fictitious commenters One was supposedly a doctor with expertise in vaccines one was a lobbyist who worked on healthcare issues and the third was a college student majoring in English literature Study participants who thought the commenters were credible were particularly swayed by the fictitious doctors strong endorsement of vaccines regardless of which PSA they saw However those who put little stock in the commenters authority were more persuaded by the fictitious lobbyists take that vaccines are completely unsafe and that there is a proven link between vaccines and autism For the record there isnt The  study that proposed such a link has been   by the journal that published it The statements made by commenters helped determine whether a PSA was able to persuade people that vaccination was important and whether they would be sure to vaccinate themselves and their families In some cases the online comments made by strangers had a greater influence than the PSAs themselves the researchers wrote The   was published online in the Journal of Advertising Kareklas said it was quite disconcerting to find that online comments from random people with no particular expertise were just as persuasive as advice from the CDC But he said it was reassuring to see that people trusted the credible commenter with no financial conflicts of interest the doctor more than the less credible commenter with potential financial conflicts the lobbyist None of this makes Kareklas think people should avoid the Internet as a source of valuable health information But they shouldnt simply trust everything they read online without evaluating the credibility of the source he added The researchers also offered some practical advice to organizations that might try to persuade people with public service announcements We dont think that the CDC should take down comments from individuals who argue against vaccines he said Instead we think they should ensure that provaccine comments from vaccinology experts are easy to find and plentiful on their website
