NHS workers in England have voted in favour of striking over pay Twothirds of Unison members which include nurses healthcare assistants and porters said they were prepared to take action Three other unions  the Royal College of Midwives GMB and Unite  have also balloted their members The results are expected in the coming weeks Ministers have given NHS staff a  increase but not for those who get automatic progressioninthejob rises These are designed to reward professional development and are given to about half of staff and are worth  a year on average But the decision by ministers went against the recommendation of the independent pay review board which had called for an acrosstheboard rise Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said This governments treatment of NHS workers has angered them and this anger has now turned into action  We know health workers dont take strike action lightly or often The last action over pay was  years ago  But we also know a demoralised and demotivated workforce isnt good for patients  If we move into industrial action we will work with NHS employers to minimise the impact on patients Unison is now expected to wait for the outcome of the other ballots before deciding what action to take and when Some  voted in favour of a strike and  for industrial action short of a strike Unison has  NHS members but when the other unions are taken into account the numbers top  It is the first time in their history that midwives have been balloted In Scotland the recommendation was agreed to in full Wales is doing the same as England but has given extra money to the lowest paid Gill Bellord of NHS Employers said the vote was disappointing and would concern thousands of patients who rely on its services I would strongly urge unions to take patients out of this dispute and instead continue constructive discussions exploring ways to come out of this period of pay restraint in a sustainable way
