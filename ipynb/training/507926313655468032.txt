Its March  the day of the Honda LA Marathon and Im about to do something foolish Again    I was remiss in my training Instead of seeking professional advice I devised a doityourself plan to ensure I would finish the race in less than four hours and wound up pushing myself harder than my middleaged body could tolerate That led to a derailing injury Im just barely better on race day but I still plan to push it to the wall    Why Because every runner dreams of finishing a marathon And as Carl Weathers told Sylvester Stallone in Rocky III There is no tomorrow    After I was humbled by injury I did get quality raceday advice from the pros Among them was sports nutrition consultant Nancy Clark who persuaded me to eat a lot and never let myself get hungry during the race Accordingly my day began at the Original Pantry on Figueroa Street with the cardiac bypass special at  am This would allow ample time for digestion before the starting gun went off at  am    I would have been suffering from sleep deprivation but I had enough adrenaline and prerace anxiety to overcome any drowsiness    The race began outside Dodger Stadium Although Id never run farther than  miles in one outing I managed to get included in the group for runners who could finish in less than four hours The sun was peeking over the horizon as former Pussycat Doll Melody Thornton belted out a deafening StarSpangled Banner    Go time    Heres how the  miles unfolded      Within  seconds a man to my left goes down hard before even crossing the start line I feel pangs of sympathy but they are quickly overshadowed by waves of relief that it wasnt me      I behold the largest display of public urination I have ever witnessed These men didnt heed the warning about drinking too much before the race      Im running at a pace of  minutes per mile and trying to ignore all the people passing me I resist the urge to bury these speed demons and repeat this mantra passed on to me by marathon veterans The race begins at Mile       Goodbye green sweat shirt It joins hundreds of discarded garments on the sidewalk that protected my fellow runners from the earlymorning cold      A spectator serenades us with Band on the Run We certainly are My heart soars and I sing along      I have never seen so much Vaseline in my life People are offering up bowling ballsized globs of it on chunks of cardboard Runners dip in and start smearing but I cant bring myself to join them Besides Id already spread Body Glide in every imaginable crevice at  am      Im trying to minimize how much I weave around fellow runners With  of us out here this is a real challenge But Ive been advised that excessive weaving can add half a mile or more to ones total distance      The tibial tendon I injured in training makes its presence known It is not yet screaming but the grumbling is certainly audible      I have never heard my name called so many times Im not famous its on my bib and spectators are calling out encouragement      I assume this is the halfway point because relay racers are switching off Im under two hours and getting tired A subfourhour finish is far from a certainty Recalling Nancys advice I combat negative thoughts with yet another SunRype FruitSource bar      Race director Nick Curl had described the route to me as the greatest tour of LA you can hope for but as I pass the Viper Room in West Hollywood I realize Ive barely noticed the landmarks All my focus has been on putting one foot in front of the other Quickly      Hey Im like totally ahead of schedule and feelin all right Far out man Endorphins have transformed me into a hippie      Thank you banana man I was getting sick of those processed fruit bars      The equivalent of a K race remains and I have  minutes before hitting the fourhour mark Despite a blister the size of Texas on my left heel I know I can do it      THE WALL Ive hit it Spasms run through my thighs they have become foot soldiers who balk at charging up a hill into a hail of gunfire      Attention legs this is Sgt Brain giving you a direct order to keep going      I strike up a conversation with fellow runners Angela and Chrystal We forge a mutually beneficial relationship chatting the rest of the way to distract ourselves from our misery The fact that they are young and attractive helps motivate me      I reach Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica and glimpse the finish line I try to imagine appropriate victory music but all that occurs to me is the  Wang Chung hit To Live and Die in LA      Angela Chrystal and I cross the finish together and share a group hug I am elated with my time of  and proudly receive my medal As I stagger to a water station wobbling like a toddler Im relieved to see many others experiencing the same ambulatory challenges    For a couple of days every attempt to descend a staircase is a fresh hell and Im destined to lose a toenail but one truth shines through    It was worth it
