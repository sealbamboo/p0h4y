Up to bn of extra funding for the NHS in England should be found ahead of the general election to prevent a crash in services says the Liberal Democrat Health Minister Norman Lamb He urged the Chancellor George Osborne to pledge the money in next months Autumn Statement  and make it available from next April  Delaying the decision risked betraying patients he warned The government says it has already increased NHS funding by about bn Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has also said if the economy becomes stronger it may be possible to   further  Speaking to the BBC Mr Lamb said The NHS could crash this is the risk  If we dont get the additional resource then you would see increasing numbers of trusts getting into financial difficulty you would see growing numbers of people waiting longer for access to treatment and longer waiting lists to get to see your GP None of this we want and I think we have to grasp the nettle now and acknowledge that the system needs more resources Mr Lamb has also called for at least bn extra funding per year in  and beyond to help plug the funding gap described last month by Simon Stevens the chief executive of NHS England who set out his   last month  Mr Lamb said Simon Stevens made the case in his forward view that the system has performed remarkably well over the last five years and weve maintained funding for the NHS throughout this period  But the fact is that across the developed world costs are rising at about  a year challenges like the fact that were all living longer weve got a big challenge with dementia with obesity and all of these things cost extra money and the judgement from very many people is that the NHS now needs additional resources for  and the Lib Dems are making the case for it But Andy Burnham shadow health secretary said You cant trust a word the Lib Dems say If the NHS is facing a crash then it is as a result of their and the Tories policies  This is breathtaking hypocrisy even for the Lib Dems Thanks to them its getting harder to see your GP waiting lists are up and bn has been wasted on a topdown reorganisation while frontline staff have been lost  This is the record of this Government an NHS going backwards under the Tories made possible thanks to the support and the votes of the Lib Dems  Rather than bickering amongst themselves the Lib Dems and Tories should be focussing on fixing the mess theyve made of the NHS
