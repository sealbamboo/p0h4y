Laura Yassky Glynn has always been an animal lover At  she had a pony named Bourbon that she kept in a neighbors barn in Valley Cottage NY where she spent her childhood I was always animal crazy says the year old Some girls play dolls I played vets office As Glynn grew older she realized owning a horse would be difficult so she turned her affection to dogs As an adult she began researching dog breeds She met a breeder who specializes in Cavalier King Charles spaniels and her curiosity fast became an obsession when five years ago she took home her first spaniel Im competitive in all I do Once I got the bug to show that was the end of the end she says I like working with the dogs and then working toward a goal Were a team together The Cavalier King Charles spaniel is a handsome mediumsize breed They are naturally mildtempered sweet affectionate and eager to please And Glynn who competes in professional dog shows has three of them Scotch Luke and Juno Theyre considered to be a comfort spaniel and thats what they are Theyre really the perfect dog says Glynn who works at her familys real estate company On Monday Glynn fulfilled one of her lifelong dreams She strutted her stuff with Chadwick Scotch on the Rocks at Hudsonview his full given name at the legendary Westminster Dog Show in New York City  the canine version of the Miss America pageant Scotch holds a dual championship with both the American Kennel Club and Cavalier King Charles Club Walking the green carpet among the crowds of pups and people is an honor for both dog and handler But for Glynn it was a triumph A little more than a year ago she was diagnosed with stage IV   In the spring of  Glynn says her life came to halt when very suddenly she became inexplicably ill It started with an upper respiratory infection which her doctor treated with antibiotics After the infection cleared Glynn developed a persistent backache Her doctor insisted she had strained a muscle but Glynn wasnt so sure Though a blood test revealed her white cell count was unusually high a telling sign of cancer her doctor insisted she wasnt sick He sat me down and told me it was all in my head that Im a type A personality and an overachiever she recalls He said Look into my eyes dont listen to anyone else Youre fine Glynn who lives in Upper Nyack NY saw a chiropractor for some time for the back pain but even frequent visits provided little relief She pleaded with her doctor to run more tests He refused to send her for an MRI At her request a family friend who is a doctor sent Glynn for an MRI which detected a tumor on her spine A week later Glynn was diagnosed with stage IV follicular nonHodgkins lymphoma a type of cancer that originates in the lymphatic or immune system The tumor on my spine saved my life she says Other than that I didnt have any signs I cant believe I was stage IV Glynn immediately began treatment at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey Every three weeks for six months she went to the hospital for RCHOP infusions a chemotherapy regimen thats used to treat nonHodgkins lymphoma   is an aggressive chemotherapy that combines the most powerful drugs on the market rituximab cyclophosphamide doxorubicin hydrochloride vincristine sulfate and prednisone Though today Glynns cancer is in remissions she still goes for regular maintenance chemotherapy A mere few days before she competed with Scotch she was at the hospital for her routine course of Rituxan a type of maintenance infusion chemotherapy for nonHodgkins lymphoma patients Typically the fiveyear relative survival rate for patients with nonHodgkins lymphoma is  percent The year relative survival rate is  percent according to the American Cancer Society As the disease progresses to later stages the survival rate can be significantly less But follicular lymphoma grows slowly and responds well to chemotherapy Glynn was now faced with endless doctor visits and sickening exhausting   treatments She relied on her friends and her boyfriend John for support The couple had recently started dating at the time of her diagnosisI immediately said to him this is probably not what you signed up for she says I think whats funny is that it never occurred to me that he wasnt going to stick around We were both devastated with the news John recalls I had asked her father for her hand in marriage a week before her diagnosis and was very excited at the prospect of us spending the rest of our lives together All of that changed in an instant But he stayed by her side As I thought about our situation I figured there could be no better time for us to refocus our energy towards the positive things in our lives that we could control By a glowing fire in their home he presented Glynn with her grandmothers engagement ring which he had obtained from her father He knelt in front of the fire and asked her to marry him Throughout her treatment Glynns dogs provided a welcome distraction and a sense of normalcy They were just very attuned to my moods and whatever my level was that day On the days when I just wanted to sleep theyd sleep  hours for me They could gauge my mood she says And on the days when Glynn was too tired to get out of bed she says she just rolled over and played with her dogs I have never met someone who loves her dogs like Laura does John says I always joke that I want to come back as one of them No matter what treatment we were going to or driving from they were always there when we got home as excited as ever to see us That is a pretty special thing when every test or treatment seemed to lead to more questions than answers Research scientists have long touted the therapeutic benefits of   Animals can have an enormous impact on human physiology They can lower a persons blood pressure and cortisol levels which is why theyve become an integral part of many cancer treatment programs Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center in New York City for example has a team of  therapy dogs and trainers Patients are able to schedule inpatient visits with one of the canines The dogs they say help provide emotional support reduce anxiety and ease a patients distress when communicating with their doctors Chemotherapy took its toll on both Glynns mind and body She gained  pounds Around the holidays her shoulderlength blondehighlighted hair began falling out in clumps The hardest part was the transformation of my body Its that feeling of being betrayed by your body thats hard she says I remember saying I just want my hair to hold on for Christmas That part of the process is so hard much harder than I thought it was going to be My scalp hurt I didnt know your scalp would hurt You cant prepare yourself for it Glynn reserves the basement of her house as a place to care for and groom her dogs One weekend shortly before the New Year she put on her dog grooming coat  the equivalent of a barbers shirt  grabbed a pair of dog clippers and climbed two flights of stairs to talk to John I told him Im going to give myself a puppy cut she recalls I was like Im tired of waiting He said to me let me help you With a few quick snips he helped her shear her remaining hair off  It was very empowering says Glynn But Glynn tried not to dwell too much on her treatments because she had a big goal in mind to prepare Scotch for the Westminster Dog Show It was on my bucket list It was something I wanted to do she says For Glynn and Scotch to make it to the big leagues they needed to compete throughout the year and win regional championships  Between draining chemotherapy treatments she primped and prepped Scotch and swept him off to  different dog shows Because Glynn didnt want to travel by plane when she was ill she went by car to each competition Once she drove with three friends and  dogs to a competition in Louisville Ky I never stopped showing I have a whole circle of friends I travel with I never accepted the fact that I was sick she says I think it made the wins all the sweeter One competition in Danbury Conn was especially memorable When he won his championship I had stubble on my head and I remember thinking my hair was so long but it was like a five oclock shadow she says There was not a dry eye when that happened Today Glynn is cancerfree She and Scotch didnt place in Westminsters preliminary competition but for her and her dog just being there was a winHaving a pet around is the way to give you something else to focus on I dont think I would have been able to make a recovery without them she says Ill be back with Scotch or another dog That is not my last Westminster That is for sure
