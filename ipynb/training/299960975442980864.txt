Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney who has been the driving force behind the creation of a statebased exchange got his answer from the feds Sure cant The US Department of Health and Human Services   Thursday making Mississippi the only state to have its exchange blueprint nixed by the federal government Instead Mississippi will have a federal exchange just like more than two dozen other states that balked at implementing the health law provision on their own The decision follows more than a month of delay from the federal government over the future of Mississippis proposal Chaney pushed ahead even though Mississippi Gov Phil Bryant opposed a statebased exchange That infighting proved to be a big problem The federal government said the split between Chaney and Bryant is at the heart of its decision Chaney   in Mississippi based on his authority to run the states highrisk insurance pool One problem with that approach It has nothing to do with Medicaid only subsidized private insurance Chaney said the state had taken the federal agencies overseeing the exchanges at face value But I fear that we have been unable to trust them at this point And Americans need to be able to trust their government I feel that I have been betrayed at this point   during a news conference Thursday evening The Affordable Care Act says that the exchanges have to be onestop shops for both private insurance   Medicaid As insurance commissioner Chaney doesnt have authority over Mississippis complicated Medicaid enrollment processes Gov Bryant sent letters to HHS expressing his opposition to statebased exchanges and questioning the commissioners legal authority to run one Chaney insisted he had the authority and was backed up in a ruling by the states Democratic attorney general In a statement Bryant praised the ruling from the federal government I have said repeatedly that the health insurance exchanges mandated by Obamacare are not freemarket exchanges he said Instead they are a portal to a massive and unaffordable new federal entitlement program They trigger new taxes on businesses and will ultimately drive more people onto Medicaid rolls I firmly maintain my position that Mississippi will not willfully implement a mechanism that will compromise our states financial stability Bryant said Mississippi would have been the only Republicanled state in the South with a health insurance exchange not run by the feds But a spokesman for HHS said the states approach wasnt feasible With the Governors refusal to work with us or the insurance commissioner there is no way to coordinate strategy with other agencies that hes in charge of an HHS spokesman told KHN Work has been underway on an insurance exchange for years and Chaney isnt sure what will become of it The Web portal for the states exchange already exists at   The commissioner is leaving the door open for Mississippi to run a statebased exchange exclusively for small businesses HHS wants Mississippi to consider a partnership Given the work the insurance department has done Mississippi is an excellent candidate for a state partnership marketplace We encourage Mississippi to apply to operate parts of its marketplace by the February   deadline the HHS spokesman said
