Top of the morning to you Another busy day is unfolding here on the Pharmalot campus where we are mulling over our cluttered calendar and plotting our next moves No doubt you can relate After all this is only the middle of the week and there is so much to be done This calls as you may imagine for a hot cup of stimulation We are sticking with the seasonal Pumpkin Spice for now by the way Feel free to join us Meanwhile here are some tidbits The world is a busy place yes Hope you make your way today Sanofi ceo Chris Viehbacher is out The board cited trust issues and asked him to leave a day after the drug maker disclosed pricing pressure on its key diabetes franchise Ranbaxy Laboratories ceo Arun Sawhney says the drug maker still has exclusive rights to launch the Nexium heartburn pill in the US despite FDA concerns over manufacturing and the recent change to US tax rules will not stop Pfizer from leaving the country for tax reasons and the drug maker in fact is still considering a deal to move abroad
