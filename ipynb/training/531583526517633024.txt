The new US plan to spend  billion fighting Ebola has a hidden agenda that aid workers approve of not only stamping out the epidemic in West Africa but starting to build a health infrastructure that can prevent this kind of thing from happening again President Barack Obamas   is an enormous amount of money  six times what the US has already committed and far more even than what the World Health Organization says is needed Most is going for full frontal assault on Ebola  one that hasnt really gotten off the ground yet months into an epidemic that has been out of control despite an outcry from international groups and governments alike But billions are also being quietly allocated to building a health care system in the countries suffering the most  a less sexy approach that could prevent another epidemic in the future Most aid groups are focused on eradicating the virus which has infected at least  people probably more and killed at least  of them Thats where the public support is donors and taxpayers alike prefer to focus on a specific goal and an emergency always gets attention We are not really a developmental organization said Dr Armand Sprecher of Mdecins Sans Frontires Doctors Without Borders one of the main groups fighting Ebola in West Africa MSF focuses on providing targeted medical care And while that has to be the first priority its important to keep an eye on the long game says Dr Raj Panjabi a founder and CEO of   an aid group focused on helping people in the most remote corners of the world The goal has to be to not just contain Ebola Panjabi told NBC News Ebola spread silently in villages and remote communities where there were no health care workers to diagnose Ebola and no way for them to report it even if they did catch it Had we had those things in place we would have detected this a lot earlier said Panjabi We know that we could have made a difference there Its unfortunate because we could have spent tens of millions of dollars to establish community health workers in every village doctors in every hospital But because we havent done enough of that now we are going to spend billions of dollars Decades of civil war in the region ravaged what health care system did exist in Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea According to the World Bank Liberia and Sierra Leone have about one doctor per  people Guinea has just  doctors for every  people Compare that to most US states with at least  doctors per  people and more like  per  in Maryland and Massachusetts It means not only that people dont get medical care but that they dont trust it The virus spread as people stayed home to care for their loved ones as villagers drove away health care workers coming to educate them about the virus and as frightened victims slipped into the forests rather than trust clinics they saw as places of death not of salvation WHO says only  percent of the  beds needed to treat Ebola in the three countries are in place One of the biggest obstacles to opening more beds is lack of skilled staff trained in infection prevention and control WHO said this week Each treatment center with  to  beds needs  to  international health care workers who are expert in clinical care and infection prevention and control as well as  to  national staff The Ebola situation  lays bare all the weaknesses in our system said virus expert Dr Daniel Bausch of Tulane Universitys Ebola task force Fixing these weaknesses he told reporters at a meeting of tropical disease experts will be an incredible task We have a sick patient who needs urgent care Bausch said However theres a sneaky way to fit in this longerterm goal and thats piggybacking on clinical trials of new drugs and vaccines Its a popular avenue  the National Institutes of Health has stepped up clinical trials of several experimental vaccines and treatments for Ebola and WHO is promising something should be ready to use by next year We hope for kind of a Marshall Plan for West Africa said Bausch Like the initiative that poured  billion in US funding into a Europe devastated by World War II a postEbola plan could give the region the shot in the arm that it needs he said These countries that been through years of civil war also suffer from a lack of funding Bausch said We have seen funding fall off Its always hard to keep funding up Clinical trials require hospitals and clinics and trained doctors and nurses and clear organization and lines of communication  all the things Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea lacked and what theyll need to conquer Ebola We are also hoping that in the coming weeks and months there will be additional capacities within the affected countries to be able to help out with clinical trials said Edward Cox of the US Food and Drug Administration FDA helps design the clinical trials and ironically most of the Ebola vaccines are being tested in the Western world  the United States and Britain  because theres just no way to test them in the affected countries If Congress grants Obamas request that kind of money will start flowing in Part of the  billion that would go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention be earmarked to establish global health security capacity in vulnerable countries to prevent detect and rapidly respond to outbreaks before they become epidemics by standing up emergency operations centers providing equipment and training needed to test patients and report data in realtime providing safe and secure laboratory capacity and developing a trained workforce to track and end outbreaks before they become epidemics the White House says in a fact sheet These are the same activities that are necessary to combat the spread of Ebola and reduce the potential for future outbreaks of infectious diseases that could follow a similarly devastating costly and destabilizing trajectory Similarly  billion to USAID would be spent on global health security activities to prevent Ebola from spreading including training people and providing communications and testing capacity This will help limit the spread of Ebola beyond Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea to other vulnerable nations and will increase preparedness and response capacity for future outbreaks the White House said
