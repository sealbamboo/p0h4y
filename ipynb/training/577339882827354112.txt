New research suggests that for women with dense breasts conventional mammography supplemented by an ultrasound scan is a costly addition unlikely to improve detection or reduce breastcancer deaths significantly But compared with conventional mammography alone D mammography  also called tomosynthesis  does increase the likelihood of detecting cancer in women with dense breasts The new findings emerge from two separate studies Collectively they suggest that for women with dense breasts  which both raises a womans risk of breast cancer and makes such malignancies harder to find on an imaging scan  tomosynthesis might be a better cancer screening technique than standard mammographyplusultrasonography But neither study compared the two screening techniques headtohead and debate over how best to catch breast cancers in such women is certain to continue More than  in  women between the ages of  and  are thought to have dense breasts In an article released Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine a team of preventivecare specialists from across the United States and the Netherlands joined forces to calculate the cost of and additional years of life gained by adding sonography to the mix of breastcancer screening mechanisms The study was commissioned by the National Cancer Institute The team found that adding sonography for all densebreasted women between  and  who come up clean on a standard mammogram drove costs up considerably but yielded only marginal health benefits Some  such women would have to get the additional sonogram for one breastcancer death to be averted By comparison the benefits of basic mammography screening for all women  to  are considerable Models show that compared with a world in which no older women are screened for breast cancer when all women in this age group get mammograms once every two years  breastcancer deaths for every  women are averted In the process sonogram scans would frequently turn up false positives prompting many women to undertake the risk cost and inconvenience of having a breast biopsy when they either do not have breast cancer or have forms of cancer that will not ultimately threaten their lives The new calculation comes as state and national legislatures debate whether to require that women with dense breasts be warned of their elevated cancer risk and offered the additional sonography screening Many breast cancer experts had hoped that handheld sonograms would offer a safe easy and inexpensive way to improve screening for breast cancer for women with dense breasts But this rigorous comparison found that it was neither inexpensive effective or even particularly safe owing to the falsepositives it turned up Most people would be surprised by our result that so few lives are saved and its at very high cost said Dr Jeanne Mandelblatt an oncologist and cancer epidemiologist at Georgetown Universitys Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center It remains possible that a betterperforming technology with targeted application to women with dense breasts or women at higher than average risk would be useful the authors of the Annals study wrote A second study presented last week at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America explored the potentialÂ  benefits of digital breast tomosynthesis  more commonly known as D mammography  in that role and found the numbers promising That study was funded by Hologic Inc a healthcare and diagnostics company that has aggressively promoted its D imaging techniques In a headtohead comparison of mammography alone with D mammography for women with dense breasts the study found that digital tomosynthesis significantly increased the cancer detection rate Researchers performed both types of scans on more than  women ages  to  and categorized the women by the density of their breasts Among women with dense breasts researchers detected  of  breast cancers when they read the scan results generated by digital mammographyplustomosynthesis When reading mammographic scans alone researchers detected only  of those breast cancers The highertech scan which recomputes the digital information captured by a mammogram to create a threedimensional image of the breast was also superior at detecting cancer in women with breasts that were less dense but more fatty  a direction in which many women move as they grow older Of the  cancers found in the entire population of  women  were detected by the D technique compared with  detected by mammography alone Tomosynthesis could be regarded as an improvement of mammography and would be much easier than MRI or ultrasound to implement in organized screening programs said the studys senior investigator Dr Per Skaane of Oslo University Hospitals Department of Radiology in Norway So the intention of our study was to see if tomosynthesis really would significantly increase the cancer detection rate in a populationbased mammography screening program Georgetowns Mandelblatt called the trial comparing mammography and D tomography a step in the right direction in helping women with dense breasts address their increased risk But she added that the true benefits of imaging techniques in detecting cancers must take into account how well they find the specific cancers that matter most  those that will rise up to threaten a patients life For that she said you just need longer followup of subjects in great numbers
