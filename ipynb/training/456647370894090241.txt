I think our experiment failed the young graduate student told me referring to our attempt to take her off the antidepressant shed been on for seven years She was back in my campus office after a difficult summer break and as she talked about feeling unsettled and upset I wondered about the broader experiment playing out on college campuses across the country Antidepressants are an excellent treatment for depression and anxiety Ive seen them improve  and sometimes save  many young lives But a growing number of young adults are taking psychiatric medicines for longer and longer periods at the very age when they are also consolidating their identities making plans for the future and navigating adult relationships  Are we using good scientific evidence to make decisions about keeping these young people on antidepressants Or are we inadvertently teaching future generations to view themselves as too fragile to cope with the adversity that life invariably brings  My patient had started medication as a college freshman after shed become depressed and spent much of her time in bed She was forced to take a medical leave but improved quickly returned to school and graduated She married soon after and worked for a few years feeling well all the while  Professional guidelines recommend six to nine months of medicine for first episodes of depression But my patient  had never been advised to stop taking it She reluctantly agreed to my recommendation to taper off her antidepressant   For a couple of months she didnt feel any different except she said things moved her more than before It wasnt that she was sad more frequently Rather she was having emotional reactions including tearfulness more readily This didnt seem problematic to either of us When I recommend to my patients that they come off antidepressants I encourage them to choose a relatively transitionfree time in their lives so that we dont mistake what might be a normal reaction to a stressful situation for symptoms of recurrent depression But because I work with university students its close to impossible to find such a time   Indeed the psychologist Jeffrey Arnett calls the young adult years the age of instability Dr Arnett coined the term emerging adulthood to define a new psychological developmental stage for  to yearolds in industrialized countries But now growing numbers of young people experience rapidly changing living situations classes jobs and relationships only while taking an antidepressant   My patient had moved away from her husband to start graduate school since his job kept him in another state Shed expected the temporary separation to be hard but navigated it smoothly focusing on school with occasional visits  In the summer she moved in with him and was surprised to feel emotionally muted It was nothing like her college depression but she worried Shed counted on the reunion being easy   As she looked back she acknowledged that moving again leaving behind new school friends and routines and not having the structure of school or work to fill her time might have challenged anyone She noticed small ways in which she and her husband were growing in different directions and this alarmed her She wanted to resume medication thinking that  maybe the summer would have gone better with an antidepressant  Major depression in adults is often recurrent half of people with first episodes will have a second episode The current standard of care is to recommend medicine indefinitely after three or more recurrences or even after a second episode if certain other risk factors are present  However these recommendations are based on evidence gathered in clinical trials of moderatetosevere depression in adults older than the students I treat Many studies were shortterm few followed patients for longer than two years Some were funded by the pharmaceutical industry which has a financial stake in keeping people on medicine indefinitely Children and adolescents increasingly take antidepressants In  a large trial called the   showed that those who took an antidepressant in conjunction with therapy for nine months were much less depressed and less suicidal in the year after stopping treatment than those without treatment  so clearly treatment is critical But for how long And is medicine on its own without therapy sufficient More students arrive on campus already on antidepressants From  to  the percentage of students treated  at college counseling centers who were using antidepressants nearly tripled from  percent to over  percent In part this reflects the introduction of SSRI antidepressants a new class of drugs thought to be safer and have fewer side effects than their predecessors  At the same time directtoconsumer advertising of prescription drugs also became commonplace Some of this very helpfully reduces stigma allowing people who are suffering from depression to get muchneeded relief But it also creates demand where genuine need may be less clear  College deans have written about incoming freshman being crispies or teacups the crispies so burned out by the pressures of high school that they get to college unable to engage in the work and the teacups so fragile or overprotected in their formative years that they fall apart at the first stress they encounter  In my experience the attempt to stop antidepressants in college students goes well less often than the prevalence of depression suggests it should Some students probably do have chronic mental health issues that require longterm treatment But others are also drinking alcohol heavily or using drugs like marijuana or their roommates Adderall or suffering from other problems such as eating disorders that theyd rather not confront  Others have just experienced loss or rejection and medicine may have become a panacea to which they turn at the first signs of unhappiness Some resume antidepressant use on their own and by the time they return to see me its impossible to assess whether they in fact had a recurrence of their depression were often then committed to another course of treatment We now know that the young adult brain is still changing and developing much more than previously assumed But we still lack a clear understanding of how psychiatric medicines might affect this brain development  My patient and I reviewed her symptoms and I assessed her for serious risks such as thoughts of suicide This is a critical part of psychiatric care and often where the psychiatric encounter ends  with a prescription That may be completely appropriate when driven by clinical judgment But sometimes its a matter of expediency The doctor doesnt have the time to go into all the other treatment options or the student lacks the time or motivation to pursue therapy or stop drinking or work on selfcare   Insurance often doesnt cover much therapy medicine is cheaper in the shortterm My patient was not in another major depressive episode but she didnt want to wait until it got to that point  We discussed the milder and more chronic form of depression known as  Though she hadnt had symptoms long enough to warrant that diagnosis the most conservative approach was still to just resume the medicine   But my patients symptoms were only one part of a compelling life story that of a young woman trying to balance personal aspirations with intimacy She was discounting her emotional reactions to difficult life events These struggles might be the very moments that precipitate personal growth  Emerging adults are at such a critical juncture in their lives it seemed important for my patient to have a chance to explore her relationship with her husband and her expectations about work and love and herself She agreed opting to try therapy first and defer medication  We walk a thinning line between diagnosing illness and teaching our youth to view any emotional upset as pathological We need a greater focus on building resilience in emerging adults We need more scientific studies  spanning years not months  on the risks and benefits of maintenance treatment in emerging adults Maybe someday treating people like this young graduate student I wont have to feel like were conducting an experiment of one
