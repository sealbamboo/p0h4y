Hospitals have fretted for years over how to make sure doctors nurses and staff keep their hands clean but with only limited success Now some are turning to technology  beepers buzzers lights and tracking systems that remind workers to sanitize and chart those who dont Health experts say poor hand cleanliness is a factor in hospitalborne infections that kill tens of thousands of Americans each year The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta estimates that one of every  patients in US hospitals gets a hospitalacquired infection each year Weve known for over  years that good hand hygiene prevents patients from getting infections said Dr John Jernigan an epidemiologist for the CDC However its been a very chronic and difficult problem to get adherence levels up as high as wed like them to be Hospitals have tried varying ways to promote better hygiene Signs are posted in restrooms Some even employ monitors who keep tabs and single out offenders Still experts believe hospital workers wash up at best about  percent of the time One St Louisarea hospital believes it can approach  percent adherence Since last year SSM St Marys Health Center in the St Louis suburb of Richmond Heights Mo has been the test site for a system developed by Biovigil Inc of Ann Arbor Mich A flashing light on a badge turns green when hands are clean red if theyre not It also tracks each handcleaning opportunity  the successes and the failures The failures have been few at the two units of St Marys where the system is being tested the hospital said One unit had  percent hand hygiene success said Dr Morey Gardner the hospitals director of infection disease and prevention The other had  percent success The holy grail of infection prevention is in our grasp Gardner said The Biovigil system is among many being tried at hospitals A method developed by Arrowsight based in Mt Kisco NY uses video monitoring It is being used in intensive care units at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset NY and the University of California San Francisco Medical Center Akron Ohiobased GOJO Industries maker of Purell hand sanitizer has developed an electronic compliance monitoring system using wireless technology to track when soap and hand sanitizer dispensers are used The SmartLink system gives the hospital data on high and lowcompliance areas The company said it has installed the system at several hospitals around the country but didnt say how many HyGreen Incs Hand Hygiene Reminder System was developed by two University of Florida doctors The Gainesville Fla company now features two systems used in seven hospitals including Veterans Administration hospitals in Chicago Wilmington Del and WilkesBarre Pa One is similar to Biovigils green badge method In HyGreens a wallmounted hand wash sensor detects alcohol on the hands The badge includes an active reminding system Unclean hands create a warning buzz If the buzz sounds three times the worker is noted for noncompliance HyGreen spokeswoman Elena Fraser said that because some hospitals are moving away from alcoholbased sanitizers HyGreen offers a second system A touch of the sanitizer dispenser clears the worker to interact with a patient If the worker shows up at the patient bed without handcleaning the series of warning buzzes begins Fraser said hospital infections have dropped  percent at units of Miami Childrens Hospital where the badge system has been implemented Nurses using the Biovigil system at St Marys near St Louis wear a badge with changeable colored lights A doorway sensor identifies when the nurse enters a patients room and the badge color changes to yellow The nurse washes his or her hands and places them close to the badge A sensor in the badge detects chemical vapors from the alcoholbased solution If hands are clean the badge illuminates a bright green hand symbol If the nurse fails to sanitize the badge stays yellow and chirps every  seconds for  seconds then flashes red Once the flashing red starts the nurse has another  seconds to wash up otherwise the badge turns solid red denoting noncompliance Either way each instance is tracked by a computer The hospital can track each individuals compliance Registered Nurse Theresa Gratton has helped lead the effort toward hand cleanliness at St Marys She heard about the Biovigil system in early  and convinced the hospital to give it a try Gratton said patients are aware of the risk of infection and frequently inquire about whether caregivers have washed their hands She said the badge relieves their anxiety Bill Rogers a yearold retiree recuperating at St Marys from back surgery and a heart scare agreed The first thing I noticed up here was the badges Rogers said It is comforting for me to know their hands are clean as soon as the badge beeps and it goes from yellow to green St Marys is expanding the Biovigil system later this year to other units of the hospital and to employees other than nurses though details are still being worked out Gardner said Eventually the system may be expanded to SSMs seven other St Louisarea hospitals he said Biovigils chief client officer Brent Nibarger said customers wont buy the system but will pay a subscription fee of about  a month per badge The CDCs Jernigan said the hightech systems can only help For a health care worker keeping their hands clean is the single most important thing they can do to protect their patients Jernigan said
