About twothirds of adults have lower back pain at some point in their lives and most are told to take acetaminophen sold under brand names like Tylenol and Panadol Medical guidelines around the world recommend acetaminophen as a firstline treatment But there has never been much research to support the recommendation and now a large rigorous trial has found that acetaminophen  Our result illustrates the problems in relying on that indirect evidence when setting guidelines said Christopher M Williams a researcher at the George Institute for Global Health in Sydney and lead author of the new study published Wednesday in The Lancet Dr Williams and his colleagues randomly assigned  people with acute low back pain to one of three groups The first was given two boxes one regular box containing milligram acetaminophen tablets and a second asneeded box also containing acetaminophen The second group received a regular box of acetaminophen and an asneeded box containing a placebo The third group received two boxes of placebos All participants were told to take six tablets every day from the regular box and up to two tablets a day from the asneeded box for pain relief The threemonth study found no differences among the groups in recovery time pain disability function symptom changes sleep or quality of life About threequarters of the patients were satisfied with their treatment whether they received medicine placebos or both Dr Bart W Koes who wrote an editorial accompanying the paper said that even though the study was large and methodologically sound it was not necessarily the last word on the subject The fact that its no more effective than placebo does not mean that it doesnt work for a given patient said Dr Koes a professor of general practice at Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam Netherlands Dr Williams said that acetaminophen had been shown to be effective for headache toothache and pain after surgery but the mechanism of back pain is different and poorly understood Doctors should not initially recommend acetaminophen to patients with acute low back pain he said But he added If patients already taking it feel they are getting a benefit then it wouldnt be wise to tell them to stop
