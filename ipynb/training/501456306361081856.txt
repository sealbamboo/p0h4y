WASHINGTON—Treasury Department officials are assembling a list of administrative options for Secretary Jacob Lew to consider for ways to deter or prevent U.S. companies from reorganizing overseas primarily to avoid paying federal taxes, an agency official said Monday.. Mr. Lew is expected to select one or more of the options as a way to address so-called tax inversions, which have become increasingly popular for U.S. companies as a means to lower their tax bills by restructuring through transactions overseas.
