Just as the food stamp program has been hit with   a small study out of Harvard has found that the program isnt doing enough to ensure that its participants get a complete and nutritious diet The researchers wanted to find out how much the benefits provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program a critical source of food aid for  million needy Americans improved individuals food security So they sampled  people who called into a Massachusetts hunger hotline About  percent got SNAP benefits while the remaining  percent didnt After three months the researchers found that although both groups saw a slight increase in food security the people in SNAP werent doing much better than those who werent in SNAP This is the first time that someone has tried to track individuals as they went from not being on to going onto SNAP to look at the impact says one of the researchers   a nutritional epidemiologist at Harvards School of Public Health While SNAP is doing some of what its intended to do Rimm tells The Salt I just dont think its doing enough One clear sign that people were struggling is that they were calling into a hunger hotline It got to a point where they needed to call for help Rimm says It would be hard to get worse because they really were in a very serious stressful condition To assess the participants food security the researchers asked them a standard set of questions developed by the US Department of Agriculture They looked at how often participants had to cut down the size of the meals or go without food altogether Overall Rimm says individuals on SNAP have a pretty bad diet  in terms of both quantity and quality Rimm says that since SNAP participants receive all their benefits at the beginning of the month they tend to spend it all at once on processed bulk items like soda and refined grains Theyre less likely to pick up fruits veggies and other fresh foods because of their short shelf lives Rimm says As for why they often run out of food Rimm says its pretty hard to properly ration to make it last all month This study which was   in the   is by no means definitive The number of participants the researchers looked at was fairly small and they werent randomized But Rimm says it does show that theres work to be done We should really think about how to administer this program Rimm says Rimm says the main takeaway is that SNAP participants should get more guidance about what to buy and how to maximize their food stamp dollars so they last all month  thats being tested out across the country is to double the value of food stamp dollars spent on fresh produce And he says that more bigger studies about how exactly the program does and doesnt increase food security would help But even with its flaws Rimm argues that the program is an essential resource for the neediest Americans It would be disastrous to get rid of the SNAP program he says And I think its even disastrous to reduce the benefits of SNAP
