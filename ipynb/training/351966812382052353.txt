As many as  million people around the world need hearing aids The vast majority of the  million people who get them annually are in the US and Europe One big reason is cost On average a set of hearing aids rings up a tab of about  Most insurance policies dont cover them A company called   is trying to do something about the limited reach of hearing aids by creating a highquality hearing device that costs less than a tenth the normal price Stavros Basseas is showing me around his development lab and hearing clinic in a strip mall in suburban Chicago Basseas began as an electrical engineer in the hearing aid industry but working with patients directly in this small clinic helped him understand their needs more deeply It was not just an engineering project anymore he says It had a human face Basseas says when people came to him for help he had a chance to talk to them about the effects of hearing loss especially the social isolation most people experience But when they put on a new hearing device Basseas says patients react right away Sometimes they cry because it was like talking to their heart because they know what is happening he says Wayne Jagusch one of Basseas patients knows the feeling Its terrible when youre with people and you cant understand what theyre saying he says You sit there and smile like an idiot and nod your head and you dont know whether theyre saying something good or bad Years ago Basseas fitted Jagusch with topquality hearing aids that cost thousands of dollars He brought them in for adjustment on the day I visited But Basseas also recently gave Jagusch a prototype of the  device the company has developed Jagusch likes it This is the best Ive had so far and Ive gone through a bunch of different devices Jagusch says I like the adjustability of it Besides cost one of the big hurdles to the use of hearing aids is the number of visits required to get the devices adjusted properly Sound World Solutions addresses that problem by making its device adjustable through a   to a smartphone The app first gives the user a hearing test using an earpiece that looks like a small Bluetooth phone receiver Then the app sets the device to compensate for your hearing loss A user can also tweak the device manually Basseas demonstrates So I have on my ear the device the CS and we are at the same time recording whatever I hear in my ear he says And the device is connected with the smartphone and Im going to go through the sequence of customizing the device If I need a little bit more clarity I can increase the trebles and so you can actually hear that the trebles are increased Or if I like to listen to music and I like a little more bass then I increase the bass The device also has presets that can be turned on and off without a smartphone  a professor of public health and an ear surgeon at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore says this kind of device provides a good alternative for the millions of adults in the US who have mild to moderate hearing loss You can get it mailed to you you put it in your ear you program it yourself with your Android phone and its going to be decent Lin says Never as good as the gold standard of course but a whole lot better than nothing Lins research shows the hearing loss is not just an irritant  its a serious public health problem Thats because hearing loss increases the likelihood of declining physical emotional and mental health The price point theyre talking about is something that makes it a much more affordable device  and more importantly their approach toward it makes it a much more accessible device Lin says Hes planning to use the Sound World Solutions device in his future research Lin says another problem with the current market for hearing aids is that the handful of companies that make them have a highprofit lowvolume strategy Thats partly driven by the fact that each company uses its own proprietary technology that costs lots of money to develop Sound World Solutions has taken another route  it uses mostly inexpensive offtheshelf Bluetooth technology for its device
