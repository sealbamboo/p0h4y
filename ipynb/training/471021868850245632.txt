Imagine a world that is completely black You cant see a thing  unless something happens to move You can see the rain falling from the sky the steam coming from your coffee cup a car passing by on the street This was the world that Milena Channing claimed to see back in  shortly after she was blinded by a stroke at  years old But when she told her doctors about these strange apparitions they looked at her brain scans the stroke had destroyed basically her entire primary visual cortex the receiving station of visual information to the brain and told her she must be hallucinating Youre blind and thats it Channing remembers them saying to her Frustrated and convinced these visions were real Channing made her way from doctor to doctor until she finally found one who believed her Dr Gordon Dutton an ophthalmologist in Glasgow He told her hed once read about such a case  a soldier in World War I who after a bullet injury to the head could only see things in motion  Dutton told her it was called named for the Scottish neurologist   who named it And then he prescribed her  a rocking chair Heres why If this is about motion only being able to see things in motion shed be able to see the stationary world at least a little if she herself started moving It helped In the weeks and months after her visit after employing other techniques like shaking her head Channing began to see the world more vividly And when she finally visited   five years after her stroke they filled in the picture It turns out that one area of her brain s cortex  an area reserved specifically for processing motion   for middle temporal area  had been preserved So even though information wasnt going through the primary visual cortex somehow it was still getting out to the part of the brain that can register objects in motion Cue the cars And the rain And the coffee steam Channing was truly seeing them But heres the catch Though this compartmentalized nature of vision may have been Channings blessing its also proving to be a quiet curse Just as there seems to be an area of the brain that processes motion there is one for faces and as much as Channings vision continues to improve she still cant recognize  even perceive  a face Channing says that every now and then that hard boundary of what she can and cant see frustrates her Who does she look like Channing wonders as she gazes straight at her daughters face For an artists rendition of Milena Channings world watch the video above which also explains a bit more about the modular nature of vision
