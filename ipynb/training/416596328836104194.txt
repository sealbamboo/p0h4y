Im not a fan of the   Not only is it the most boring piece of equipment in the gym it is also extremely ineffective  First off the elliptical doesnt use a natural body motion to work your body Workouts that use natural motions like running bending or jumping are much more effective at toning muscles Sure the gliding motion of the elliptical burns calories but thats about it  It is also easy to slack off on the elliptical With the treadmill you at least have to keep up with the pace you set On the elliptical you start off with guns blazing and  minutes later you are crawling along like a turtle  You are much better off doing a minute cross training circuit burpees jumping rope jumping squats etc than  minutes of slogging along on the elliptical  If you are looking for another low impact exercise try the   This will get your heart rate up and also work your upper body and back When it comes to working out slow and steady does not win the race Maximize your time people  Instead of working out for an hour at an easytomoderate intensity level step it up a notch Challenge yourself to  minutes of nonstop intense exercise You can take  to second breaks but move quickly from one workout to the next Give it  for  minutes instead of  for an hour  Need ideas for shorter high intensity workouts Check out   You know that girl at the gym whos always fixing her hair in the mirror Dont be her Come to the gym with a time frame and a plan  This means no wandering around no texting your boyfriend in between reps Come with a set workout to complete limiting your water breaks to specific points in your circuit for a designated amount of seconds  If this means writing down your regimen great Tattoo it to your arm Whatever Make the most of your time Get in get out No one likes a gym rat But cardio burns more calories right Not so fast lady  Sure an hour on the treadmill gives you that instant satisfaction of burning  calories Or so that little blinking screen says A quick   or cross training session however will get your heart rate up burn calories and develop your lean muscle mass Building muscle means that those muscles are able to work throughout the day burning more calories when you arent working out Sports drinks may give you a boost but are full of sugar and calories During any given daily workout hydrating with plain ol water should do the trick just fine  If you feel tired during your workout try fueling before Eating a healthy snack  minutes before your workout can give you more energy and allow you to skip the Gatorade Try some almond butter on toast When you do the same workout routine over and over your body gets used to it and it becomes easier  The Stairmaster might have been challenging at one point but pretty soon your muscles become familiar with that motion Your body only uses half the energy to complete this task that at one point had you huffing and puffing your way to the locker room Mix it up By changing your workouts daily you will trick your body into working harder and burning more calories It will also save you from boredom Take that new kickboxing class or try one of   Working out alone can be great It gives you time to clear your mind listen to music and feel the burn  However sometimes it takes a workout buddy to hold you accountable Working out with a partner not only makes it more likely that youll work out it makes most people try harder than they would on their own Your partner can cheer you on to finish that last half mile or to finish those last four deadlifts  And lets not forget the power of good oldfashioned competition If your friend is doing  lunges dont you suddenly feel inspired to do  Now that youve dropped those pesky habits try a new workout
