of Down syndrome then an amniocentesis or   CVS to make the diagnosis Shed be given the option to abort the pregnancy In the future a woman who decides to continue a Down syndrome pregnancy may also be offered prenatal treatment to temper the developmental harm to the fetus  today a routine part of obstetric care has made great strides since the mids and is now on the cusp of further revolutionary developments In the nearly four decades since amniocentesis became widely accepted new techniques have gradually improved the safety and accuracy of prenatal diagnosis Prenatal tests for more than  genetic disorders have been developed And the number of women who must undergo amniocentesis or CVS has been greatly reduced The newest screening test highly accurate and noninvasive relies on fetal genetic fragments found in the mothers blood Available commercially from four companies this test is so accurate in detecting Down syndrome that few if any affected fetuses are missed and far fewer women need an invasive procedure to confirm or refute the presence of Down according to studies in several countries The new test done late in the first trimester of pregnancy can also detect other genetic diseases like extra copies of chromosomes  and  and a missing sex chromosome It is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration however and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology currently recommends it only for women at high risk for having a baby with a chromosomal abnormality But most women can get the new screening test if a doctor orders it and they are willing to pay for it themselves according to   a neonatologist and geneticist at Tufts University School of Medicine Dr Bianchi who serves on the advisory board of a company selling fetal DNA tests said she expects these tests will soon become routine for all pregnant women because in addition to their extraordinary accuracy in detecting a Down syndrome pregnancy they can be done earlier than other tests and reduce costs and the risk of complications  Down syndrome which occurs in about one in every  births in the United States is by far the most common chromosomal abnormality It causes physical and intellectual disabilities that range from mild to severe In the past the decision to undergo an amniocentesis or CVS was based on a womans age or genetic history The older the woman the greater her risk of bearing a child with genetic defects due to an abnormal number of chromosomes It is now standard practice to offer all pregnant women a series of noninvasive screening tests in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy to assess the chances that a fetus has the extra copy of chromosome  which causes Down syndrome It is then up to the woman to decide whether to undergo CVS or an amniocentesis Taken together these older screening tests pick up about  percent of cases of Down syndrome but miss  percent And they yield falsepositive results incorrectly indicating the presence of Down in about  percent of fetuses This means a lot of women are needlessly worried and a lot have amnios that are not medically necessary Dr Bianchi explained at a meeting last December of the March of Dimes  is performed between  and  weeks of gestation and involves inserting a long needle into a womans uterus to extract some of the fluid and cells surrounding the fetus In CVS usually done at  weeks gestation the fetal cell sample is taken from the placenta The cells are then analyzed for possible genetic defects There is a small risk of miscarriage associated with both procedures But the new tests of fetal DNA from the mothers blood detect all or nearly all cases of Down syndrome and they return falsepositive results in fewer than  percent of cases Only those with a positive result need a CVS or amniocentesis to confirm a Down syndrome pregnancy and only about one woman in  who are tested requires such an invasive procedure to learn that her fetus does not have Down syndrome In a   however Stephanie Morain a doctoral candidate at Harvard who studies medical ethics and her coauthors said the fetal DNA tests have some disadvantages They miss some chromosomal abnormalities detected by standard screening techniques and they are not widely covered by insurance Prices for the tests range from about  to more than  although some companies offer introductory pricing specials at about  The new tests are also not required to meet the strict standards of safety and effectiveness established by the FDA and they are valid only in singleton pregnancies Nonetheless tens of thousands of the fetal DNA tests have been performed to date The new test requires just a small sample of a pregnant womans blood During pregnancy a womans blood contains cellfree DNA from herself and her unborn baby On average Dr Bianchi said in an interview at around  weeks of gestation about  to  percent of the DNA in a womans blood will be fetal DNA from the placenta Using modern genetic sequencing techniques the fetal DNA can be rapidly analyzed at a relatively low cost in part because multiple samples from different women can be examined simultaneously As with other screening tests the new DNA tests are not diagnostic   a geneticist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine emphasized A positive result on the test must always be confirmed by a CVS or amniocentesis Dr Bianchi is now most excited by the prospect of treating a Down syndrome fetus before birth to minimize the disorders neurological effects Studies have shown that giving pregnant mice medication that counters fetal oxidative stress results in more normal brain development of pups with Down syndrome When prenatal testing reveals that a fetus has a serious birth defect some women may consider ending their pregnancies The March of Dimes recommends that those who continue  Consult a specialist in maternalfetal medicine who is specially trained to treat highrisk pregnancies  Arrange to give birth in a hospital with a Level III newborn intensive care unit NICU staffed and equipped to provide the expert care needed by infants with special needs  Discuss the best way to deliver the baby
