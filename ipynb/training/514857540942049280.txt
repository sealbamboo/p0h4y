In a boost to Pfizer, the FDA has updated labeling on its Chantix smoking-cessation pill to indicate the drug may not carry the risks of suicidal behavior, a controversial issue that prompted the agency to include a serious warning in the labeling in 2009. The changes are being made to reflect the results of various studies. The labeling change comes just three weeks before the FDA has scheduled an October 16 meeting to discuss “safety data from observational studies and a meta-analysis,” according to a September 9 notice in the Federal Register. And Pfizer disclosed the changes on the same day that a watchdog group planned to release an analysis placing Chantix in an unflattering light.
