Firstborn children end up a little taller smarter and richer than their younger siblings on average But are the eldest kids more likely to develop diabetes and heart disease when they grow up too Thats the suggestion from a study conducted by researchers in New Zealand who found that firstborn children under age  had slightly higher blood pressure and were slightly less sensitive to insulin than their younger siblings The   were published online in the   Doctors are looking more closely at children for early signs of diabetes and heart disease as Type  diabetes and obesity have become commonplace in children and adults So are firstborns doomed Not likely First of all this researchers measured the health of  children at one point in time Its whats called an association study it cant prove that being born first caused the differences the scientists found As far as I know theres not a strong association between insulin sensitivity in an  yearold and an adult at  or  or  said Tamara Wexler an endocrinologist in private practice Theyre not relating this to pediatric obesity and pediatric diabetes The researchers found that the  firstborns had  percent less insulin sensitivity when compared to other children Being less sensitive to insulin also called   can be a precursor to diabetes The firstborns also had a small increase  about  millimeters of mercury  in blood pressure Those differences were similar to whats seen in obese children the New Zealanders noted But these children werent overweight They were taller and slimmer than their peers even when the researchers adjusted the results to account for the height and weight of the parents Theres no clear mechanism that explains the odd mixture of height weight blood pressure and glucose tolerance the researchers wrote We do think this is a risk factor says   a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Auckland who led the team But this does not mean these people will get diabetes Cutfield told Shots that this firstborn effect if it proves out could be one of many risk factors for developing diabetes in adulthood including unfortunate genes from your parents crappy diet not exercising and stress from work Studies with large numbers of adults need to be done to see if firstborns really do have more diabetes or other health issues later in life Cutfield added As for the cause Cutfield speculates that it could be because the placenta is not quite as efficient in delivering nutrients during a first pregnancy But many other factors could be involved Its really not clear he says Earlier studies on birth order and health issues arent much help The previous research tends to be more socioeconomic looking into which children get the best food and medical care Firstborns usually do well there If firstborns were slightly more likely to get diabetes Cutfield says that might not make a big difference for individuals But it could make a big difference for countries like China which has enforced a onechild policy for decades As a result  percent of people worldwide are firstborns according to Cutfield I dont think that this can be taken as a cautionary tale for firstborns at all Wexler says All those firstborns neednt panic she says The positive influence of exercise and diet holds the same regardless of birth order
