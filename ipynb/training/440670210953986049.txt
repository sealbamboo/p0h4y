Having a hot temper may increase your risk of having a heart attack or stroke according to researchers  Rage often precedes an attack and may be the trigger say the US researchers who trawled medical literature They identified a dangerous period of about two hours following an outburst when people were at heightened risk  But they say more work is needed to understand the link and find out if stressbusting strategies could avoid such complications People who have existing risk factors such as a history of heart disease are particularly susceptible they told the European Heart Journal In the two hours immediately after an angry outburst risk of a heart attack increased nearly fivefold and risk of stroke increased more than threefold the data from nine studies and involving thousands of people suggests The Harvard School of Public Health researchers say at a population level the risk with a single outburst of anger is relatively low  one extra heart attack per  people per year could be expected among people with low cardiovascular risk who were angry only once a month increasing to an extra four per  people with a high cardiovascular risk  But the risk is cumulative meaning temperprone individuals will be at higher risk still    Five episodes of anger a day would result in around  extra heart attacks per  people with a low cardiovascular risk per year increasing to about  extra heart attacks per  among those with a high cardiovascular risk Dr Elizabeth Mostofsky and colleagues calculate  Dr Mostofsky said Although the risk of experiencing an acute cardiovascular event with any single outburst of anger is relatively low the risk can accumulate for people with frequent episodes of anger Its unclear why anger might be dangerous  the researchers point out that their results do not necessarily indicate that anger causes heart and circulatory problems Experts know that chronic stress can contribute to heart disease partly because it can raise blood pressure but also because people may deal with stress in unhealthy ways  by smoking or drinking too much alcohol for example  The researchers say it is worth testing what protection stressbusting strategies such as yoga might offer Doireann Maddock senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation said Its not clear what causes this effect It may be linked to the physiological changes that anger causes to our bodies but more research is needed to explore the biology behind this The way you cope with anger and stress is also important Learning how to relax can help you move on from highpressure situations Many people find that physical activity can help to let off steam after a stressful day  If you think you are experiencing harmful levels of stress or frequent anger outbursts talk to your GP
