Overall obesity rates for American kids may have leveled off but a new report finds that children and teens at the far end of the spectrum are getting heavier faster  with about  percent now classified as severely obese  That means nearly  million US youth fall into a new category of obesity risk one that carries dangers of serious disease and early death even beyond expected harms according to a scientific statement published Monday by the American Heart Association  It appears that severe obesity is the fastestgrowing subcategory of obesity in youth write the authors in the report published in the journal Circulation Worse when children get that big its difficult to help them lose weight with traditional tools of diet and exercise or even with drugs and surgery  Once this problem gets so severe theres no turning back or theres no turning back easily said Dr Thomas Inge a coauthor of the paper and director of the Center for Bariatric Research and Innovation at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center People dont like to hear that and they dont like to know that Severely obese kids have higher rates of weightrelated disease including type  diabetes and cardiovascular disease with complications such as high blood pressure and hardening of the arteries Previous research has shown that obese kids as young as age  can have the  The new class encompasses kids ages  to  who have a bodymass index or BMI thats  percent higher than the th percentile for their gender and age or a BMI score of  or higher A child or teen in the th percentile weighs more than  percent of others his or her age  For example a yearold girl of normal height who weighs  pounds or a yearold boy of average height who weighs  pounds would be defined as severely obese the AHA said  The new category was born out of necessity as doctors and health workers have seen more kids with weights literally off the charts used to measure the ratio of height to weight said Inge About   to yearolds in the US have BMIs of  or higher the data showed That translates to a foot person who weighs  pounds  BMI is a measurement based on weight and height For adults a BMI of  to  is considered normal A BMI of  to  is considered overweight and a BMI of  or greater is considered obese For kids doctors use growth charts based on age and gender to calculate BMI Children between the th and th percentiles are overweight those at the th percentile and above are obese  The new report comes amid ongoing evidence that overall obesity rates among US adults and kids have  s with about  percent of adults and  percent of youngsters classified as obese  Severe obesity is an emerging problem with enormous medical public health and economic consequences said Dr Geetha Raghuveer a pediatric cardiologist at Childrens Mercy Hospital in Kansas City who has studied hardening of the arteries in kids and teens We should not be lulled into ignoring this due to the recent flattening of the obesity prevalence Researchers reviewed data from several cycles of the federal National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey or NHANES and from more than  kids in a Kaiser Permanente database in Southern California The numbers show a steady rise in severe obesity among kids climbing from  percent in  to  percent in  to  percent in   Its risen beyond that too with some studies suggesting that the range of severely obese children and teens varies from  percent to  percent Inge added  We need to look at these new metrics and realize that it really does have to be something that is taken seriously he said  Thats exactly what Joe Hattery a yearold high school senior from Strongsville Ohio has done He posted a BMI of  last year when he entered a program overseen by Dr Naim Alkhouri director of the Pediatric Preventive Cardiology and Metabolic Clinic at Cleveland Clinics Childrens Hospital Hes not the heaviest I have said Alkhouri who said he worries that his young patients have higher risk of disease and death I have one kid with a BMI of  Joe had been heavy since he was a toddler said his mom Martha Hattery who blamed a family diet of fast food fried chicken and cookies and milk every night before bed Theyve now changed their habits Dad John Hattery who suffered a heart attack has lost  pounds and Martha Hattery has shed about  pounds  Since joining the Cleveland program thanks to a strict highprotein diet and medical oversight Joe has dropped to a BMI of about   and its going lower  Id never really just buckled down and said I have to fix this Joe said Being fat sucks Stopping being fat sucks almost as much but its not as hard as you think Such interventions can work with kids of BMIs of  even  Inge said But once youngsters get much heavier than that it becomes very difficult to get them down to normal weight The new statement calls for increased research into behavior modification drugs and surgeries targeted to the heaviest kids  Even better health officials agree would be to start early limiting fastfood sugary soft drinks and too little exercise all habits that contribute to the  percent of preschoolers who already fall into the new category of severe obesity Many parents are   studies have shown but they need to act early well before kids reach adolescenceÂ  By the end of the first decade of life kids are set in their environment and practices and what they eat Raghuveer said Theres really no firm way to handle this problem except to prevent it in the first place
