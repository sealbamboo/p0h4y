If looking for a nursing home werent confusing and dispiriting enough  often undertaken in a hurry when a discharge planner announces that ready or not your relative has to leave the hospital  check out this perplexing finding from Ohio Of the states nursing homes ranked one star much below average on   most residents interviewed facetoface rated their satisfaction as low or very low  yet close to one in five gave these supposed losers high marks So did  percent of the families interviewed On the other extreme in Ohio nursing homes that Medicare rated five star much above average a majority of residents ranked their satisfaction as very low low or moderate and about  percent of families expressed similar discontent The star ratings say Really good said Robert Applebaum who directs the Scripps Gerontology Center at Miami University The residents say Not so good The back story In  after Senator Ron Wyden Democrat of Oregon complained that it was easier to find consumer information about washing machines than nursing homes the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services beefed up its online guide   used for restaurants and movies Consumer advocates have warned ever since against relying solely on those stars to choose nursing homes People still need to visit ask questions talk with other residents and families The inspection reports staffing data and quality measures on the Medicare site offer more specific information than the stars   the online tool developed by ProPublica lets you drill down even further Still you would expect fewer stars to equal less satisfaction with more stars making residents and families happier In a large Ohio study just published in The Gerontologist thats generally true but not consistently Medicare itself doesnt measure consumer satisfaction though it has added a few resident questions to its annual nursing home surveys A handful of states collect data from residents or family members but only Ohio and Rhode Island talk to both Ohios LongTerm Care Consumer Guide which Dr Applebaum helped begin in  gathers responses from families and residents in alternate years For this study he and his colleagues used data from  Ohio facilities almost  surveys mailed by family members a  percent response rate in  and nearly  facetoface interviews with residents in  Comparing those responses with Medicares stars they found that satisfaction scores didnt differ significantly by every star There was little difference in satisfaction between one star and two say or between four and five And as I mentioned above   expressing satisfaction with supposedly lowquality homes and disliking highquality ones One reason Dr Applebaum said is that the state surveys Medicare relies on measure clinical things like how often pressure sores occur or whether facilities handle food properly It may be that they do well in terms of cleanliness but the staff doesnt treat people respectfully so residents dont like living there he said Moreover families and residents satisfaction scores often differed Families are concerned about safety and amenities Dr Applebaum said Does the place smell Do the nurses look professional The person who lives there is much more concerned about being treated in a certain way having some control being able to do what they want to do he added They dont care about the chandelier in the lobby Its How does the person who comes to help me use the bathroom treat me For patients undergoing shortterm rehab a growing proportion of nursing home residents these findings may not matter much Its different when a nursing home becomes simply home The Miami University researchers argue that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid ought to incorporate consumers opinions in its star rankings Yes Dr Applebaum acknowledged that would add costs and nobody wants to do that in this day and age But he said if youre really trying to give consumers information to make choices not including resident and family satisfaction is a serious limitation Its like publishing a Michelin guide he said that rates how clean a restaurants kitchen is and calculates whether there are enough waiters but pays no attention to how good the food is
