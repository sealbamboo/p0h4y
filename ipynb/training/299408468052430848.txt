Powerful prescription painkillers like   and Vicodin also known as narcotics or opioids are more available now than ever with sales to pharmacies and healthcare providers increasing more than  percent since  according to the Drug Enforcement Administration And while these drugs can bring welcome relief to people coping with chronic pain or recovering from surgery or injuries theyre also prime targets for abuse The US Centers for Disease Control recently released some alarming new facts about just how dangerous these drugs can be More than  people die every day from overdoses involving narcotic pain relievers  a greater death toll than that of heroin and cocaine combined Many of these deaths are linked to nonmedical use of these drugs that is using them without a prescription or taking them to get high These statistics arent surprising at all says Reef Karim MD director and founder of The Control Center in Beverly Hills Calif and assistant clinical professor at UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience We are a society thats very fastmoving that involves a lot of technology and that sees people looking for a quick fix to deal with whatever it is they have going on in their lives Part of that quick fix may be popping a pill to feel better or to deal with their own stressors Theres a whole host of reasons why someone might be using pills for nonmedical reasons  it might be to relieve pain to escape from a difficult time or to get high Looking back yearold Leslie Miller of Newport RI believes that painkillers were actually at the very end of my history of   Although she would drink alcohol and smoke marijuana Miller thought of herself as a social drinker and was able to maintain a busy schedule running an entertainment agency But in  she was prescribed OxyContin after bowel resection surgery to relieve complications from   And thats when the horror started she says While at first Miller took the drug as prescribed  to relieve pain  she says that after a while I loved it absolutely loved it I wanted more and more Miller went on what she describes as a threemonth run carrying on when I should have been resting I was carousing around my town and partying I acted like a total nutcase Given a prescription for a months worth of OxyContin at a time Miller went back to her same surgeon for refills three times When she returned a fourth time though he said that he wouldnt continue to support my drugseeking behavior She was given the pain reliever Tylenol  Tylenol combined with codeine a much milder opiate painkiller but no referral for counseling or detox services The result Miller says was two weeks of the worst pain Ive ever had in my life After suffering in silence with shakes fevers and terrible pain Miller says her anger led her to begin abusing alcohol and other drugs It wasnt until she accompanied a friend in recovery to a step meeting in April  that she recognized that I needed help Some people that you would never think in a million years would become   will It doesnt carry the stigma of heroin or cocaine but the disease is the disease whether it comes in the form of a prescription or as a bag of heroin says Dr Karim In fact a recent study presented at the annual meeting of the American Public Health Association found that prescription opioid overdoses were more common among white middleage females  not exactly the prevalent public image of addiction  than in other demographic groups Dont be fooled by appearances says Miller People with addiction problems could be walking around in business suits She uses herself as an example Before she entered recovery Miller was making money paying her bills and looked good on the outside But she says she was emotionally neglecting her children and her relationships Id come home from work and say dont talk to me for an hour I had to have my drink first Drug addiction itself does not discriminate says Karim In the prescription pill world youre going to see housewives CEOs Fortune  heads athletes  it crosses all lines because we all see doctors and we all have pain Ive had more opportunities to use drugs from doctors than Ive had from any person on the street says Miller In  while in recovery she underwent surgery again and spoke to both of her doctors about her history I told them I want nothing by mouth afterward I dont want any opiates Yet one of her surgeons wanted to prescribe her Vicodin the other Percocet Ultimately its up to the person and the individual what they decide to put in their body says Karim But doctors can help with this crisis by only prescribing whats necessary Instead of prescribing  tabs of OxyContin if we think the patient can do well with  then we should prescribe  Most doctors overprescribe to make it easier on the patient he notes My job is to assess whos drugseeking and call them out on it But the average doctor doesnt have the luxury of the time I might have to figure it out He also says its important for doctors to let their patients know which drugs have abuse potential Another issue may be a lack of training and awareness among doctors of signs of addiction There are some medical schools where you get almost no addiction training says Karim Now because of the outbreak in addiction problems youre seeing it more Miller says I would like to see doctors get more informed about recognizing the signs of addiction and then making a referral If youre prescribed opioid medications after you undergo surgery or suffer an injury the doctor will normally tell you for about how long youll need the drug If your body is still jonesing for the drug after that time period you know theres a problem Karim says However very often the addict doesnt realize theyre an addict But he notes most people know when theyre craving a medication Ask yourself Why do I still need this Am I still in   Family and friends are also likely to notice the telltale signs of addiction  for example if the addict is no longer able to meet work or family responsibilities There are also physical signs For opiates its being a little spacey or having dilated pupils he says They could even get psychotic if they take too much Not all opioid addicts get their supply from a doctor According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health more than  percent of those who abuse prescription pain relievers get the drugs from friends or relatives If you need to take prescription pain medications there are lockboxes or drug safes available to keep pills protected from others whether family members or visitors in your home And when youre done taking a prescription medication toss it  dont let it linger in your medicine cabinet If its a pill you dont need anymore I would get rid of it Karim says Pills can be crushed or broken with a garbage disposal or with a hammer they shouldnt be dropped into the trash whole The US Drug Enforcement Administration sponsors   every six months where consumers can safely dispose of unwanted medications at specially designated sites in their communities Now celebrating seven years sober Miller works in recovery peertopeer support at the   in Pawtucket RI Shes also the liaison at Anchor for the Rhode Island Community for Addiction Recovery Efforts Inc   Addicts need both   and medical support she says adding that there are many paths to recovery  including step programs church state agencies or organizations like the United Way Go get professional help if you cant stop on your own Theres no shame in understanding that different people have different vulnerabilities with their brains and their bodies says Karim You have to get past the denial and the stigma but if you do the treatment is there All you have to do is find it This is a disease of isolation and secrets Miller says People need to know theyre not alone Reach out and get help  dont be ashamed
