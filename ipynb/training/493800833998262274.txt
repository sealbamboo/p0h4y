Basic biology has it that girls are girls because they have two X chromosomes  the things inside cells that carry our genes Boys are boys because they have one X and one Y Recently though theres been a lot of debate in scientific circles about the fate of that Y chromosome  the genetic basis of maleness Very early in the evolution of the Y chromosome explains   a geneticist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology something pretty dramatic happened The ancestral Y lost most of its genes And scientists basically ignored the little that was left The Y chromosome was essentially written off as the runt of the human genome Page says as a sort of genetic wasteland that didnt really merit anyones serious attention When the Y did get any attention it wasnt good news Some scientists like geneticist   at La Trobe University in Melbourne Australia speculated that the Y might be destined to just keep sort of    As soon as it becomes a maledetermining chromosome then the rot sets in Graves says Thats kind of the kiss of death for that chromosome meaning the Y chromosome could be headed toward oblivion  completely disappear But other scientists including Page say Not so fast Step away from my Y chromosome Ive really spent the better part of my career defending the honor of the Y chromosome in the face of insults of this sort Page says For the Y size really doesnt matter he says Page has done a detailed analysis of the chromosomes evolution and says the string of genes has been solidly stable now for millions of years The idea that the Y chromosome might disappear altogether possibly taking men with it  I think that idea has now been firmly dismissed he says In fact the relatively few precious genes that are left on the Y look like theyre special  very special There are genes on the Y chromosome that are active throughout every nook and cranny of the body Page says The skin the blood the brain the lungs  you name it They look to be sort of global entrepreneurs within the human genome They are sort of master regulators Still Graves remains skeptical I dont think that one can assume that just because theyre there and they do something useful theyll be there forever and ever she says A small accident could tip it over the edge or the evolution of a new sexdetermining system that works better Graves says she is always surprised by the ferocious reaction she gets to any suggestion that the male chromosome might be vulnerable Ive been accused in print of being you know a ballbreaking feminist she says Well no  not really Im just pointing out that things change and evolution is wonderful and it can do things lots of different ways Graves has a theory about why the reaction is so intense especially among men Theres some deepseated insecurity that men have about their Y chromosomes she says halfjoking When I give lectures about the demise of the Y chromosome I see men sort of hunching up into this protective stance as though Im physically attacking them And theres a twist in all this Even if the Y chromosome is here to stay that may be something of a doubleedged sword for men Even if those master genes on the Y chromosome are important they may also help explain why men are more prone to certain diseases than women are  and tend to live shorter lives Jan Dumanski of Uppsala University in Sweden and his colleagues recently reported for example a possible link between the Y chromosome and an increased risk for lots of cancers He sees the human Y chromosome as the Achilles heel for men Its making us men Dumanski says but also causing us some trouble when we are getting older Clearly our relationship with Y continues to be complicated And its not all about size
