Sarah Murnaghans spirit can be summed up by her personalized Monopoly character a threelegged silver pig that can stand on its own Everybody sort of expects her to decline here and she does but she fights back every time says her mother Janet Sarah who has cystic fibrosis has a reason to keep fighting Shes another step closer to getting a lung transplant Sarah has been waiting for a year and a half and doctors say she could die soon without a transplant The current system puts children at the bottom of the list for adult lungs While they are eligible for child donor lungs those are harder to come by Wednesday   that Sarah could be moved up on the adult list and considered for a new set of adults lungs based on her need not her age Sarahs family has new hope Janet Murnaghan says Sarahs heart is under a lot of strain but shes still a good transplant candidate Now theyre waiting for a match The case has triggered a swell of emotions along with a wave of arguments criticizing and defending the current organ allocation system Janet Murnaghan says her familys legal fight for Sarah is one path toward revising the transplant selection process Were not fighting for just Sarah she tells Tess Vigeland guest host of weekends on   There is a system here that is letting children die The system needs to be fairer Murnaghan says adults are favored over children even if that wasnt the original intention She believes there shouldnt be an age cutoff at all  that organs should be given based on doctors recommendations So how are those decisions made The first thing to note is that there just arent enough organs available More than   are on the list for a new organ according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network a nonprofit contracted by the federal government to regulate transplants in the US And   while still waiting Given the constraints selecting an organ recipient comes down to priorities Bioethicist Art Caplan says there are a number of factors that determine where you land on the waitlist including blood type immune system whos the sickest and who has the greatest need Among that group the system then starts to say Whos going to do best Who will survive with the greatest chance of living and living long And then beyond that youre starting to look at things like geography to find out how far the organ needs to travel he says The under rule evolved Caplan says from the   that come with putting an adult organ in a child Caplan says generally the system does a good job in trying to let medical factors and objective factors drive the distribution of organs What isnt a good situation is admission to the transplant centers One of the first tests that everybody does is a very thorough wallet biopsy he says So the ability to pay counts  Its a major driver in access to transplants Dr John Roberts chairman of the transplant networks executive committee disagrees with Caplans assessment I think there are people who have a harder time getting referred for a transplant but I dont think its necessarily an insurance wallet biopsy approach he says He says Medicaid will cover transplantation for lowincome patients but not in every state Transplants easily run   some even hitting seven figures Roberts says its the postsurgery costs that can create the biggest financial hurdle for patients The medications are lifelong and they are expensive he says As a result of the judges decision the allocation system   Roberts says that doesnt mean change is inevitable but he certainly has received a lot of feedback I received I think almost  emails now from people that are concerned about whether or not we are giving children high enough priority for all organs he says And thats sort of a societal decision Theres no great solution here What Roberts is concerned about is having transplant allocation decided by political or judicial systems working on behalf of specific children who have access to lawyers or the media On some level we cant make a decision child by child he says So far the federal judge in Pennsylvania has ruled in favor of two children putting both on the olderthan waitlist for lung transplants I surely understand the judge Roberts says He doesnt want to make a decision that the organ transplant network has to make of this child is in a situation with a lot of other children and how that is going to affect the other children Hes making a decision for the child thats in front of him Now Janet Murnaghan is looking at the child in front of her Shes not sure optimistic is the right word to describe how her familys feeling I dont know whats going to happen in  days and we still have a kid whos really seriously ill And we have a kid who may not make it  days I dont know she says I would just say for the first time in a little while here we have hope that she has a chance Just a chance
