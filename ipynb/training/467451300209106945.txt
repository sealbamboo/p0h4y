Scientists have developed an early warning system to alert authorities to the risk of dengue fever outbreaks in Brazil during the World Cup The analysis published in   estimates the chances of an outbreaks of the mosquitoborne infection disease They say the risk is high enough to warrant a highalert warning in three venues  Natal Fortaleza and Recife If they come top of their group England will play in Recife on  June About a million fans are expected to travel to the  different cities hosting matches during the World Cup which runs from  June to  July Brazil recorded more cases of dengue fever than anywhere else in the world between  and  with more than seven million cases reported Dengue is a viral infection that is transmitted between humans by  mosquitoes It can cause lifethreatening illness and there are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments Screens airconditioning and using insecticides can all reduce the risk of being bitten The earlywarning system covers  microregions across Brazil The team looked at rain and temperature data from  to  as well as population density data and altitude The risk of dengue fever is low in Brasilia Cuiaba Curitiba Porto Alegre and Sao Paulo  However they predict that there is some chance of dengue risk exceeding medium levels in Rio de Janeiro Belo Horizonte Salvador and Manaus  The three cities with the greatest chance of high dengue risk are Natal Fortaleza and Recife Dr Rachel Lowe from the Catalan Institute of Climate Sciences in Barcelona Spain who led the research said Recent concerns about dengue fever in Brazil during the World Cup have made dramatic headlines but these estimates have been based solely on averages of past dengue cases  The possibility of a large dengue fever outbreak during the World Cup capable of infecting visitors and spreading dengue back to their country of origin depends on a combination of many factors including large numbers of mosquitoes a susceptible population and a high rate of mosquitohuman contact The researchers say being able to plan in advance can give local authorities the time to implement measures to reduce or contain epidemics in their areas and to deal with the mosquito populations there Writing in the same journal David Harley and Elvina Viennet from the Australian National University in Canberra say Travellers particularly those attending matches in highrisk cities might return home with dengue Those who return home unwell will seek treatment Doctors must be aware of causes for febrile illness in World Cup spectators
