There is a lack of clarity over what the money saved in the NHS in England has been spent on say MPs The NHS is in the middle of an efficiency drive with savings expected to be reinvested in frontline care and making services more productive More than bn has been saved in the first two years with another bn forecast in  But the Health Select Committee said there was little evidence it had been used wisely The crossparty group of MPs said the plan had been to transform the way services were delivered to make the NHS sustainable in the longterm But it said to date much of the savings had come from straightforward measures such as pay freezes and cutting funding to hospitals It said as a result the pressures on the NHS and social care system were now greater than they were a few years ago Committee chairman Stephen Dorrell said We have not seen the transformation of care on the scale which is needed to meet demand and improve care quality The NHS budget is static and the social care budget is falling In these circumstances the successful integration of highquality health and care services represents a substantial and growing challenge He said it was now important to ringfence the social care budget and he also wanted to see councils getting more involved in planning care through their health and wellbeing boards as that would make joinedup care more likely The government has already acknowledged that more sustainable savings need to be made as the use of payfreezes cannot be used for the longterm And writing in the Daily Telegraph NHS England chief executive Sir David Nicholson who is retiring in April said he wanted to see a radical transformation with care being centralised in major hospitals and more integrated services provided in the community between GPs nurses and social care Our NHS does a superb job for millions of people day in day out but it cannot stand still  it needs to adapt to survive he added But Prof John Appleby of the Kings Fund think tank said In the shortterm finances are tightening significantly with a growing number of hospitals now in deficit  This raises real questions about whether the NHS will be able to maintain its recent record of balancing its books at the end of the financial year  Beyond  the prospects look even more challenging with further cuts in public spending likely whoever wins the general election  It is now almost inevitable that the next government will have to find more resources for health and social care if services are to be maintained
