A m fund has been launched to make better use of neuroscience in classrooms in England The scheme backed by the Wellcome Trust and Education Endowment Foundation wants more evidencebased research into how schoolchildrens brains process information This could include how the brains performance is damaged by sleep loss The Wellcome Trusts Hilary Leevers says there has been an evidence gap in applying neuroscience in schools The Education and Neuroscience project wants to fund research that will bring together scientists and educators It also wants to replace myths about how the brain functions with an understanding based on research Introducing the project at the Education Media Centre Dr Leevers suggested that while there had been many advances in analysing how the brain worked they had made little impact on classroom practice Where there were computerbased brain training exercises being used in schools she said there was not much reliable evidence to show whether they really brought benefits Kevan Collins chief executive of the Education Endowment Foundation said that schools needed to make better use of the research available  and warned that at present its application for classroom use was often haphazard and not well informed There was a need for evidencebased research that was politician proof he said Mr Collins said that there were many ideas that catch on in schools with the aim of aiding learning  such as playing music to pupils or making them drink lots of water  but not much clear evidence of what worked There was also the risk of doing more harm than good he warned He gave the example of the unanswered question of whether extra lessons on Saturday mornings brought benefits or whether they damaged pupils motivation Mr Collins said that the school system should know whether increasing the dosage would help or hinder pupils  and this required reliable research Paul HowardJones from the University of Bristol said there may be practical benefits from applying neuroscience research more effectively As an example he said that maths lessons could be improved if teachers had a better understanding of what stimulated the brain Neuroscience could also influence the school timetable he says if there was evidence that starting later in the day would help teenagers to learn The impact of lack of sleep on the functioning of the brain should be considered in the length of the school day and lessons he said Parents also face adverts for computerbased exercises which claim to improve childrens learning But Dr HowardJones said there was no convincing evidence to show whether or not such computer applications could boost academic achievement Mr Collins said he was convinced of the need to do more to develop and evaluate the use of neuroscience in education Sir Peter Lampl who chairs the Education Endowment Foundation and the Sutton Trust said Knowing the impact of neuroscience in the classroom will also make it easier to spot the plausible sounding fakes and fads which dont improve standards
