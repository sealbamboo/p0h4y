Do not be alarmed but you may be eating wood pulp Or at least an additive that started out as wood If you buy shredded cheeses including brands such as Organic Valley and Sargento or hit the drivethrough at McDonalds for a breakfast sandwich or a smoothie or douse some ribs with bottled barbecue sauce theres likely some cellulose thats been added to your food Cellulose is basically plant fiber and one of the most common sources is wood pulp Manufacturers grind up the wood and extract the cellulose Its odd to imagine the same kind of pulp thats used to make paper turning up in our food So its no surprise theres buzz over a spate of recent posts from   to the   on the food industrys   use of cellulose to help add texture and fiber to foods But theres not much new here The FDA long ago greenlighted the   in foodstuffs And in our bodies this cellulose passes right through our GI tracts virtually unabsorbed Food scientist   of Penn State says it doesnt matter much where the cellulose comes from In theory you could extract it from any plant from asparagus to onions but he says that would be a waste of good food A good way to think about it is to ask Would our food be any better or worse if the cellulose used was sourced from another plant And Coupland says the answer is no Cellulose is just a molecule and probably one we want more of in our diets Ah yes the wood pulp in cheese stories Elizabeth Horton of Organic Valley responded to us when we asked her about the headlines Yes Organic Valley does use cellulose in our shredded cheeses its a pretty standard anticaking agent So it helps prevent the bits of cheese from clumping together Horton says there is work in the industry to find other sources allowed for organic use but the challenge is they are not as effective at anticaking And perhaps not as costeffective either We reached out to a supplier of cellulose Sweetener Supply Corp The companys Jon Bodner told us that there have been efforts to extract cellulose from a wide range of plants including oat and soybean hulls corn stover and even hemp But establishing a new supply chain system to accumulate the plant materials is costprohibitive He points to an effort in the late s to   using corn stalks leaves and husks but it failed And now there are additional challenges to using nonwood plants For instance lots of customers Bodner says are demanding nongenetically modified products If the cellulose industry were to use corn stalks leaves and husks or sugar beets it would be a challenge to keep the supply chain free of genetically modified crop residue Bodner is accustomed to clearing up misconceptions about his industry For instance the idea that cellulose is just like saw dust Nope He says sawdust contains only about  percent cellulose Whereas the powdered cellulose used in foods contains about  percent cellulose The baking industry has been  the use of cellulose for more than  years Back in  the ITT Continental Baking Co promoted its use of cellulose as a way to boost healthy fiber We feel its important to get the facts out the baking companys John Colmey told   back then And it seems decades later the industry is still working to win consumer acceptance
