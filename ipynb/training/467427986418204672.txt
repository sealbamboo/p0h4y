You dont really need another reason to get the shingles vaccine for yourself if youre over  or your older relatives  A painful rash possible damage to vision and a substantial risk of the condition called postherpetic neuralgia which can hurt for a long time  arent those enough But heres another reason anyway courtesy of a British research team In the six months after a case of shingles more formally known as herpes zoster you may face     Using an enormous database that holds complete medical records on  percent of Britains population  the kind of helpful broadly representative trove that comes with having a national health service  epidemiologists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine identified  people whod had both shingles and a stroke between  and    Because the incidence of shingles increases with age these unlucky Britons were mostly past  median age   The researchers study just published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases showed that in the four weeks after a shingles diagnosis these individuals had a  percent higher rate of stroke than at other times  From weeks five through  their stroke risk ran  percent higher falling to  percent higher in weeks  through  Theres no increased risk after that said the lead author Sinead Langan a senior lecturer in epidemiology The reasons for the spike she said might include the inflammation associated with a viral infection or damage to blood vessels The study found an even higher stroke rate among those whose shingles spread to their eyes though most are spared that particular misery  It also found that the antiviral drugs given for shingles also reduced subsequent strokes  but only  percent of patients received them Previous studies in Taiwan and Denmark have shown elevated stroke rates after shingles Dr Langan pointed out so despite our differences from Britain Americans also may face an elevated stroke risk after an episode of shingles You have to think folks at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are gnashing their teeth about this For several years theyve been urging older Americans  those who arent immunosuppressed  to get vaccinated against shingles  The vaccine isnt  percent effective but it can cut the risk of shingles roughly in half and reduces postherpetic neuralgia by even more Yet the latest data from  show that only    paltry compared with the percentage vaccinated against flu  percent of those over age  or pneumonia  percent Early on we could blame that on    But   so the low vaccination rate has more to do with other barriers A comparatively high cost The need to keep Zostavax frozen when most physicians offices lack freezers  Coverage under Medicare Part D instead of Part B like most vaccines so that patients may have to pay up front hassle with paperwork and then get reimbursed  Still the prevalence of stroke among American adults was  percent nationally in  and   If you vaccinate people and prevent shingles you could potentially reduce the stroke rate Dr Langan said  Promptly providing shingles patients with antiviral drugs would also help her study indicates  Its more incentive to get the vaccine isnt it she said Yes It is
