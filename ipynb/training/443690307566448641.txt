There is a shocking number of birth defects among the newborn Syrian refugees In my short time in Lebanon Ive seen more cases of severe birth defects than during my entire career as a pediatric resident Many babies born have major malformations of the brain and nervous system from minor cases of spina bifida where parts of the brain or spinal cord are outside of the body to anencephalic babies born without the majority of their brain The reason for this rash of birth defects is lack of a simple vitamin folic acid In the US many of our breads and cereals are fortified with folic acidThis B vitamin is critically important for healthy development of a babys brain Without access to routine prenatal care however Syrian refugee women often present to the free clinics well into their pregnancies  too late for the folate acid to protect babies and prevent birth defects At Taanayel Hospital in Chtaura Lebanon we spoke with administrator Shady Bader The hospital was opened by Baders father in  Specializing in pediatrics and obstetrics and gynecology this bed facility is home to  physicians with more that rotate in on an as needed basis When they opened their doors in  they never dreamed that they would be serving a patient population that was primarily composed of Syrian refugees And while humanitarian organizations like UNHCR The UNs refugee agency cover the majority of the cost of care the hospital is sometimes forced to use money from its own budget to cover the difference For Bader however this is more than a question of dollars and cents  its a humanitarian prerogative The refugees are humans like us he explained As I have said before doctors dont check passports Medical care transcends borders and war zones
