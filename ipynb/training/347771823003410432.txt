Theyre sometimes called MacGyver bombs in an homage to the s TV hero who could make a bomb out of everyday items like a cold pill blow an escape route through a wall and save the day But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would probably call these homemade chemical bombs stupid things that teenage boys come up with to injure themselves and others The public health agency has been tracking the misadventures of amateur MacGyver bomb makers and it is not amused In a review of  incidents with homemade chemical bombs reported in  states from  to  the CDC found that  percent caused breathing problems and injuries like burns skin irritation and wounds Thats because the lowpower bombs are usually made with caustic household chemicals like toilet bowl cleaner or drain cleaner which are put in a plastic soda bottle sealed and shaken Gas caused by the chemical reaction inside the soda bottle expands and kawham All great fun unless you happen to be holding the bottle In one case a high school janitor interrupted a group of students making a bomb with calcium hypochlorite a swimming pool chemical When the janitor picked up the bottle it exploded releasing chlorine gas Chlorine gas was used as a chemical weapon in World War I and is considered an industrial hazard and potential terrorist weapon Exposure can   and death In that incident the janitor threw up and became ill  students and three school employees were treated for respiratory problems The high school had to be evacuated so the hazardous materials squad could clean up In another case a man picked up an innocuouslooking bottle he found in his yard It suddenly exploded The man suffered wounds to his hand and chemical burns Overall  percent of the injured people had to be admitted to the hospital for treatment  percent had to be decontaminated at the scene or at a hospital The findings were   in todays   To avoid these kinds of problems the CDC recommends calling the local bomb squad to handle or neutralize homemade chemical bombs rather than taking the DIY route Contaminated clothing should be removed immediately and skin that comes in contact with the chemicals should be rinsed with lots of water for three to five minutes Incidents peaked during the summer months and most of the cases involved teenage boys Guys take note Angus MacGyver never injured himself his friends or the high school janitor with his contraptions Only the bad guys
