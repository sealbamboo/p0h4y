  Folks rarely think about the implication of those five words when they utter them The wedding cake wouldnt taste as good if a bride or groom cataloged during the   all the possibilities that could happen in the future and what she or he would do in that circumstance  What happens when the in health part takes a major backseat to the in sickness vow When the caretaker role is disproportionate to the soul matebest friend role resentment seeps in  and it can easily break apart the bond of married life I emerged from my mothers womb depressed So my husband knew he was marrying a person with fragile wiring But he wasnt prepared for the massive breakdown I experienced after the birth of our second child After two hospital stays seven psychiatrist and  medication combinations over the period of two years I was diagnosed with   and made the gradual ascent to heath But I have felt sorry for Eric every day since I was admitted into the hospital I am painfully aware of the trickle effect that belongs to all chronic illnesses In his book Understanding Depression J Raymond DePaulo MD of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine cites a study that  percent of adults living with a depressed person experience depression themselves I imagine similar statistics exist for other forms of illness Our marriage like others challenged by chronic illness could have easily dissolved The exhaustive efforts of my recovery program coupled with his frustration at having more jobs  including most of the domestic chores  fall on him has caused strain Especially in the beginning We werent ready for the lifetime nature of my diagnosis and its implications for both of our lives Communication  and my being married to the person who I think should be the next pope    with imperfect circumstances Good Bad Ugly Sweet Funny Raw We dont hold back Even as he doesnt like hearing that Im battling death thoughts he wants to know I dont like hearing that my illness is hard for him and hes frustrated by my manic energy but I must know We abide by rules I stay accountable to him  to do everything I possibly can to stay well If I dont sleep for three nights our rules say I have to call my doctor I have to give her a ring after three days of constant crying as well When he asks me if Im suicidal I have to tell him the truth which is extremely difficult when you are planning your exit and would rather keep it to yourself The rules say that he will be with me whenever I want to take my life He could be in the midst of presenting a set of blue prints to an important client but he will drop them and run home I write him a love letter every morning I am the sick one I know he has the harder job So I thank him profusely Every single day I list all of his qualities that I love about him  starting with his dimples ending with the incredible   he shows to me and to our family  Its not enough to tell him I love him I want him to know why I love him I want him to know I think its unfair that he has to live with my sickness and put up with all the messiness that it entails that I am aware of all of his sacrifices on my behalf The end result is that weve come closer together  I credit him with most of that If it were I that were the caretaker I question my patience and resolve  I might hire some company to do the hard stuff Like all forms of disillusionment and disappointment chronic illness is a powerful force in a relationship that can scatter toxic energy into vulnerable places or that can reveal the true depth and beauty of a relationship Id like to think we chose the second road But it takes great effort to get there and to stay there
