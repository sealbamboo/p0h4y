
 As the big college basketball tournaments get underway many eyes will be on the players scrambling up and down the courts in pursuit of a national championship  But the players will not be the only ones breaking a sweat The average college basketball official runs about four miles a game and they are not taking their sweet time The referees must race to keep up with the players make splitsecond calls and decisions and try to predict every play so they can get in the right position to have a clear view of the action  To learn more about how these hardworking officials stay in shape for the job we spoke with Deldre Carr  who has spent time on the courts during the NCAA Mens Division  Basketball Championship better known as March Madness  Carr who is from Las Vegas has been officiating college and semiprofessional basketball games for about a decade he also has a fulltime job as an accounting clerk at a law firm Recently we caught up with him to talk about how a basketball ref keeps up with the players how many miles he runs during an average game and what its like drawing the ire of fans at every arena Here are edited excerpts from our conversation Were you a basketball player yourself Ive been playing since I was a child I played soccer too but basketball was my first love I played in college for a Division I school the University of Montana and finished up my playing career there in  I played shooting guard and small forward  What made you want to become a basketball referee Im roughly foot and  pounds I thought about playing overseas but if youre my height and you dont have a inch vertical youre not really going to be anything So at the end of my college career my father and I sat down and he said You need to find a hobby Take up golf Im not a fan of golf So he said I should try officiating I gave him a funny look and said I hate referees  why would I want to become one The referee is always the one you blame when you have problems  But you tried it out anyway Yes I reached out to my high school coach and I went to some local referee meetings here in Las Vegas I saw some of the officials that worked my games in college and they took me under their wings and showed me the ropes It felt like I was still part of the game like I was still playing Youre not shooting and making jumpers but youre out there making calls I found a new love with officiating  When did you start I started officiating in about  or  I refereed high school basketball for two years and moved up the ranks fairly quickly My path went from high school to semipro and then to college  Is officiating a physically demanding job I have a Nike FuelBand that I carry in my pocket I run an average of  to six miles per game We have to stay physically fit so you can get up and down the court and get into position to referee Youre running a lot and youre constantly making decisions You have to think OK was this illegal contact Was that marginal contact Was this incidental contact These are things that can all become tiresome during a game But if you take a break for a split second you can miss something major like a flagrant foul Do you exercise during the season Yes On my days off I like to get in the gym During the season I like to save my legs because I know Ill do a lot of running during games So when I go to the gym Ill do the elliptical or stationary bike Ill do  minutes of cardio and then a little maintenance workout with weights that can range from  to  minutes My heavy lifting is done in the offseason Thats when you try to get yourself in the best shape During the season its all about maintaining What is your weightlifting routine like I dont do legs during the season because of the burn that I get working games But in the offseason I do some light legwork Thats squats with no weight leg curls and leg extensions to keep my quads and hamstrings in shape for the upcoming season Ill also do bench press pullups and military press for my shoulders  How do you stay in shape in the offseason I do a mixture of cardio and weights A couple of summers ago I was doing the Insanity Workout which was tough and challenging Its cardio and weights I also like to do the treadmill I like to run at least three times a week Id say I probably do about  miles a week on a treadmill or elliptical  Do you exercise on game day too Yes I have a routine that I do I like to get up in the morning prior to the game bike for  minutes maybe four or five miles not too hard Then Ill grab a couple of  weights and do some weight training And then Ill go back to my room and relax until game time  What is your typical schedule during the season In a typical week Im home in Las Vegas Monday through Wednesday On Thursday morning Im usually out on the first plane I work a game Thursday sometimes Friday and then Saturday And I may get lucky here and there with a rare Sunday night game  Do you still play basketball I stopped playing basketball about five years ago because I realized that referee running and playing basketball are two different things You have to stay in shape for both of them but basketball is a little more strenuous because you have to get into a defensive stance or do a lot of jumping and catching rebounds  I heard the officiating schedule is sometimes stressful Is that true For referees the time off in between games is a lot shorter than it is for players The players might do two games a week whereas some referees with heavy schedules may do six games a week You have to make sure your body is getting the proper nutrients and proper rest so you can be mentally strong and able to do this   Do you follow a special diet The calories you put in your body are very important My wife does a great spread She keeps the meals very healthy I eat a lot of chicken Shell bake and grill chicken breasts I eat brown rice at times vegetables and pastas as well And Ill have the occasional fast food especially when Im on the road and I dont get out of a game until  oclock At that time everything is closed so I might stop at Carls Jr and get a burger or a wrap  Are there specific foods you like to eat before a game I always have a heavy breakfast in the morning And then two hours before a game Ill have a soup and a salad I like to keep it light  Is it different working a March Madness game than a regularseason game The atmosphere is much different Last year I was selected to work a March Madness game in Dayton Ohio And at one point during a time out I had to take a step back and take it all in And I thought This is a huge honor Because you look up and theres not an empty seat in the house  Are you ever bothered by taunts from the fans The fans pay money and they can boo yell or whatever they want They pay money to do that Im all for that The things they do dont affect officials In every arena we go into we know were going to be called terrible by the fans Ive yet to go to an arena where theyre cheering us on The only time you go into an arena and youre cheered is if you come out behind the home team And after that we know theyre going to boo us
