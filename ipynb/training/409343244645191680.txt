Researchers say they are achieving success in curing the genetic defect that causes some children to be born without immune defenses a rare condition made famous in the s by a Texas boy who lived most of his short life in a sterile bubble Scientists now report that  out of  young children given gene therapy for a type of severe combined immunodeficiency disease called   are alive and living amid the everyday microbial threats that would otherwise have killed them The oldest is just over  years old They live pretty normal lives investigator   tells Shots Its amazing Without treatment its a pretty uniformly fatal disease Equally important these children are so far showing no signs of the cancers that developed a decade ago in  out of  children given an earlier version of the same gene therapy Those treatmentrelated cancers temporarily brought such gene therapy experiments to a   The latest gene therapy experiment used a selfinactivating virus to deliver the corrective gene into the childrens blood stem cells This new viral vector apparently doesnt flip switches that give rise to leukemia as the old vector did Were not saying these children are completely free from any risk says Williams who was to report on the trial Saturday morning at the American Society of Hematology meeting in New Orleans But were quite happy with the results we have so far and feel confident that the vector is safer in every way we can look Williams works with the Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at Boston Childrens Hospital and DanaFarber Cancer Institute He says one of the nine children died of an overwhelming infection that he had before the genecorrected cells could fully engraft and fight off the infection One other child didnt get as much benefit from the gene therapy as hoped Hes going to get another dose of the genecorrected stem cells Researchers give each child between  million and  million genetically engineered stem cells after the gene that they lack called the IL common gamma chain receptor gene has been inserted into a mouse virus The cells come from the childrens own bone marrow Once the genecorrected cells are infused back they multiply and stimulate the production of normal immune cells The technology component of this gene therapy costs from  to  per patient with additional costs for medical care So far the National Institutes of Health has paid for it Williams says two of the eight surviving children  one in Paris the other treated in Boston and living in his native Argentina  had the new gene therapy more than three years ago when they were infants They have reached the age when some of the children in the earlier experiment developed leukemia Researchers in Paris London Boston Cincinnati and Los Angeles have been scrutinizing their young patients blood cells regularly for signs of abnormal growth or evidence that virally introduced genes inserted themselves into places in the genome known to be hot spots for triggering leukemia They havent seen any ominous signs which is why the researchers are feeling cautiously optimistic that theyve surmounted the leukemia problem Curiously separate research projects in California and Italy involving about  children with a different form of genetic immune deficiency have not seen leukemia either  even though that group has been using the original virus vector One sign of the new optimism over gene therapy is that other trials are starting up The Boston group has three others going with two more in the works They involve SCIDX and other rare diseases such as   and   But the group is dreaming big Within the next year Williams says theyre planning to test gene therapy for   and   two much more common blood disorders that together affect hundreds of thousands of people in this country Thats a clue that researchers  and regulators such as the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Healths Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee  are starting to feel comfortable enough with gene therapy that theyre entertaining the idea of applying it to diseases that are not quickly fatal without treatment All new technologies start out with a boom and then with some regularity have some unexpected side effects that have to be addressed Williams says Thats exactly whats happened in this field
