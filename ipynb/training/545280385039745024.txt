The owners and senior officers of a Massachusetts pharmacy that distributed contaminated drugs that killed  people have been arrested and two were charged with second degree murder Barry Cadden owner and head pharmacist at the New England Compounding Center NECC and other top staffers not only knew their   but they conspired to   the US Justice Department says in the indictment They also instructed staff to make up fake names and prescriptions to make it look as if the operation was a smalltime compounding pharmacy making up drugs to individual order rather than the largescale manufacturing operation that it actually was The products sent all over the country by NECC made more than  people very ill in  and killed  of them from a hardtotreat fungal infection of the spinal cord Theyd been sold as especially safe and carefully formulated steroid injections for pain What they actually were federal officials say were   and unsanitary bottles filled with mold and bacteria In total  people were charged in the indictment Cadden and supervisory pharmacist Glenn Chin were charged with murder Twelve others were charged with racketeering mail fraud conspiracy and other crimes Actions like the ones alleged in this case display not only a reckless disregard for health and safety regulations but also an extreme and appalling indifference to human life US Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement The count indictment names  employees or directors of NECC including owners officers pharmacists and pharmacy technicians Eleven of them have been arrested Justice officials said during a news conference The  outbreak shocked Americans and set off  and the Food and Drug Administration The FDAs since overhauled how it manages socalled   which the law and regulations had treated as momandpop operations but which often act more like largescale pharmaceutical manufacturers Investigations quickly showed that NECCs facility was filthy and that pharmacists working there were bypassing hygiene rules Wednesdays indictment shows that notes were posted across work spaces instructing staff to take shortcuts in sterilizing and checking the safety of products and giving clear guidance on how to concoct fake prescriptions For instance the indictment charges that supervisory pharmacist Glenn Chin told technicians that production was more important than cleaning or disinfecting Chin instructed pharmacists and pharmacy technicians working in Clean room  under his supervision to fraudulently complete cleaning logs at the end of the month purporting to show that NECC Clean Room  was properly cleaned and disinfected it reads Cadden and Chin face a maximum of up to life in prison if convicted Testing and alert systems showed mold and germs were growing and spreading but NECC did not change any of its practices Even when outside tests showed the company had shipped contaminated drugs to hospitals and pain clinics NECC did nothing the indictment alleges The physicians and patients were not notified of the potential risk of using the untested drugs it reads Sharon Carter a pharmacy technician who was made director of operations even wrote out rules for making it look as if NECC was making individual madetoorder prescriptions instead of manufacturing large batches of product the indictment says A facility cant continuously provide the same roster if names  unless they are truly treating the exact same patients over and over again All names must resemble real names  no obviously false names Mickey Mouse it quotes one written memo as saying Nonetheless names such as Big Baby Jesus and Method Man  supposedly individuals whose doctors had written madetoorder prescriptions for  appeared on shipped lots of products The  outbreak at first mystified doctors Fungal meningitis is rare and it wasnt until an alert Tennessee epidemiologist noticed a pattern of   that federal health officials were brought in It turned out that NECC which filed for bankruptcy in  had shipped its fouled products to  people in  states Victims of the contaminated products have told about   and treatment that included surgery strong drugs and weeks in bed Some are still not better Some have shared in a   Carmen Ortiz US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts said her team had met with many of the victims and family members These stories of pain and suffering are the reason we have been working so tirelessly in the pursuit of justice she told a news conference NECC officials also scrambled to protect their wealth once they knew they were  the Justice Department says Finally the indictment charges Carla Conigliaro the majority shareholder of NECC and her husband Douglas Conigliaro with transferring assets following the fungal meningitis outbreak the Justice Department said Specifically the indictment charges that after NECC declared bankruptcy and the bankruptcy court ordered the shareholders not to transfer assets Carla and Doug Conigliaro transferred approximately  million to eight different bank accounts opened after the NECC bankruptcy
