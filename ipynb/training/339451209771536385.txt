Make that a   fry and Coke This is what came out of my yearold sons mouth this weekend on the way back from a camping trip After Id ordered him a kids meal at the drivethru he interjected to change the order I let it go this time since hes lean and we dont frequently eat fast food But think of those extra calories Or not Apparently not too many boys his age are inclined to check out calorie counts or other calorie information when they eat out A new   published in the   found that about  percent of tweens and teens ages  to  report paying attention to calorie information when its available in chain or fastfood restaurants The question as it was posed to some  youths in a mail survey was this When calorie information is available at a fast foodchain restaurant how often does this information help you decide what to order It turns out girls seem much more mindful The study found that girls were about  percent more likely than boys to report using calorie information to inform their menu selections And the researchers also found that youths who were regular fastfood consumers eating it twice a week or more were about  percent less likely to report using calorie information compared with those who ate fast food once a week or less Encouragingly according to the studys author youths who are overweight were much more likely to use calorie information Obese participants in the survey were about  percent more likely to report using calorie information compared with healthyweight youths Our findings are important given the high prevalence of obesity among youth and the adverse health effects associated with obesity wrote lead author   of the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Division of Nutrition Physical Activity and Obesity in a release on the study Wethington says its encouraging that overweight youths are paying attention But awareness is just one step toward tackling the obesity problem As Professor   president of the UK Faculty of Public Health writes in a release about the study To tackle obesity effectively we need to know more about why so many young people do eat fast food so often Its still early days for calorie postings Last September McDonalds announced it would begin   And as part of Obamacare the new federal health law chain restaurants and fastfood establishments with more than  locations nationally will be required to print calorie information next to menu options But this part of the law has not yet been implemented So for the record dear son   have  calories and a large Coke has
