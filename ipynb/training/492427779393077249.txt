Women and girls are less likely to undergo female genital mutilation or FGM than  years ago Thats the encouraging news from a UNICEF report on the controversial practice presented this week at Londons first Girl Summit The rate has dropped in many of the  countries across Africa and the Middle East where FGM is practiced In Kenya for example nearly half the girls age  to  were circumcised in  in  the rate was just under  percent But theres a sobering side to the report In countries like Somalia the rate has gone down slightly but is still over  percent And because the population is growing in parts of the world where the practice takes place total numbers are on the rise Unless the rate of decline picks up another  million girls and women could be cut by  The report is exciting and worrying says   the chief of child protection at UNICEF The population growth will far surpass the gain weve been seeing if we dont step it up The report shows that more than  million girls and women have experienced some form of genital cutting or mutilation in  countries across Africa and the Middle East The practice involves removing partially or completely the female genitalia  sometimes just the clitoris other times also the labia or lips that surround the vagina In extreme cases the vaginal opening is narrowed by sewing up the outer labia In many communities the custom has long been perceived as a rite of passage into womanhood Because sexual contact is painful the practice is also seen as a way to prevent a woman from losing her virginity before marriage Some see it as ensuring fidelity during marriage as the procedure eliminates sexual pleasure The practice persists partly because its a social norm in maledominated societies Mothers have said they only have their daughters best interests in mind The decision to cut is partly based on your interest in your daughter being able to marry within your community Bissell says If she is the only who isnt cut her marriageability prospects go down dramatically In some countries like Egypt and Indonesia FGM gets added legitimacy because doctors perform the surgery Theres the idea that Oh if a doctor does it its OK says   the senior policy director of Equality Now an international human rights organization There are laws in the book that say that if you do this through a medical doctor its not a crime But its a human rights violation regardless of who does it she states In countries where FGM is prevalent simply condemning the practice isnt enough Education needs to be strengthened and attitudes toward women and girls need to be changed says Bissell Quast points to Kenya as a success story citing laws against female genital mutilation and prosecutors who actively go after people who cut girls Earlier this year parents of a yearold who died after getting cut were prosecuted And two village chiefs  one who let his daughters undergo FGM and another who carried out the procedure on several girls  are facing charges in court according to Mary Wandia FGM program manager at Equality Now It helps that more people are becoming involved in the fight to end FGM Despite the staggering numbers from the report Bissell is excited to see progress in the number of women taking a stand Young girls who are at risk are less afraid to speak up And women have drawn attention to the problem by sharing their own experiences and protecting their daughters Public figures like   a hiphop star from Senegal who was cut have spoken out as well Shes a rapper so shes got this young following Bissell says Bissell calls her a brave change maker who campaigns despite disapproval from those in her community who accuse her of casting a bad light on Senegalese culture Ten years ago it was like a handful of feminist organizations talking Bissell says But now everybodys talking and when you have public discourse things change
