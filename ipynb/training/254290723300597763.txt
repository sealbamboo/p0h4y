Whole genome sequencing has become an   for researchers But slow speeds and high costs have helped keep the technology from becoming a routine diagnostic test for doctors But thats starting to change And results from two studies published this week suggest that indepth personalized genome sequencing could be inching closer to clinical reality Sick babies in intensive care might be among the first to benefit from clinical whole genome sequencing says a recent   in   Researchers at Childrens Mercy Hospital in Kansas City Mo streamlined the sequencing and analysis of an entire genome The process once took several months They did it in a few days Time is an important factor in the NICU says   an author of the study and director of the Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine at Childrens Mercy Hospitals and Clinics If a physician has an acutely ill baby and theyre trying to figure out immediately which of those  known genetic diseases it might be and so today its just not possible for them to make a definitive diagnosis that is which gene is mutated he says Either the baby dies or the baby gets better and goes home before thats known Researchers were able to rapidly sequence the infants genomes using the latest   The results were analyzed with software that allowed doctors to enter the babys symptoms characterize mutations in the genome then screen for over  genetic diseases that affect infants    Treatment is available for many of these diseases but an early diagnosis is key Kingsmore told Shots You cant start a treatment for a specific disease until youve made a definitive diagnosis he said The goal is to get the right diagnosis as quickly as possible and then start the right treatment as quickly as possible If there are no treatments the tests can help physicians refer parents to genetic counseling services Though the results of the study could someday change infant care the technology still has limitations Each infant screening cost about  in the study so only the sickest babies can receive the pricey test said Kingsmore in a Web conference on Tuesday Another potential roadblock is location Unless each hospital invests in stateoftheart sequencing equipment shipping samples for remote testing and analysis adds diagnostic delays Rapid sequencing in the NICU is limited to diagnoses of a few hundred genetic disorders but another   published this week in the   focuses on identifying unique genetic mutations that may not even yet be associated with disease Researchers from Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center in the Netherlands sequenced the proteincoding DNA or   of  patients most of them young people affected by severe intellectual disabilities with unknown causes The researchers then compared the patient genomes with those of their unaffected parents to search for mutations that could be the cause of intellectual disability In the analysis researchers found that many of the patients they screened had unique mutations within the same set of  genes After analyzing these genes in a large database of  patients three of these genes were confirmed to have an association with intellectual disability Using this information researchers were able to identify genetic causes for disability in  of the original  patients Although these findings could potentially help identify genetic cause for disability in hundreds of patients these diagnoses dont necessarily come with an effective treatment
