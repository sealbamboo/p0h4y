Spending on locum doctors to plug the gaps in AE units in England has risen by  in three years figures show The data showed m was spent last year up from m in  A government spokeswoman said retaining AE doctors was a longstanding problem in the NHS BBC News website readers have been sharing their experiences of working in emergency medicine as locums or permanent staff I used to be an AE doctor  I left to do another speciality but I loved certain aspects of AE so much that I still regularly go back as a locum  I dont earn anything like  per shift and far from being resented my AE colleagues actually enjoy working with me as Im now a specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology and they can get an immediate opinion on patients  It is quite common for doctors who have chosen other specialties but who loved AE when they did it to come back for shifts like this It provides a good service and benefits for patients  Doing locum work is not easy money  One is not guaranteed regular work and one is only employed when it is going to be busy  The sessions may seem very lucrative when paid hourly but I would always be starting early and working well after the allotted time   We are under close scrutiny and would not be asked to return if we did not perform well  We are also not paid superannuation sick leave or study leave I have been working as an AE doctor for the last four years I do feel the frustration when locum doctors who are less experienced get paid four times what I am without taking on as much responsibility Working in AE is very stressful and at times I do feel like changing my speciality but its due to the love and passion I have for this role that I cant think of changing career  I would like to continue as a regular doctor and think that the money the NHS is spending on locum doctors could be spent on regular doctors My suggestion would be that AE doctors should be on a flexible rota with a higher salary package we have to put in a tremendous effort and coping with stress and this would attract more doctors I regularly work as an AE locum across the UK including in England  The stark reality is that after years of pay freezes leading to real terms pay cuts destruction of the NHS pension and undermining of health staff morale it is unsurprising that doctors are unwilling to work in the busiest and most depressing parts of the hospital without significant compensation  I regularly earn  an hour for working in AE but if the rate was less it just wouldnt be worth the hassle Try getting a lawyer or a banker to work a Saturday night for the same amount  This is the beginning of how the health service will look when creeping privatisation eventually means that doctors can charge market rates for their work
