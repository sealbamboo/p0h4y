ow can we possibly plan for the next few years asked a friend of mine a director in a   foundation trust during a recent conversation on the challenges facing the health sector I was stuck for an immediate answer but I sympathised with her frustration about planning when the future seems so unclear Her question stayed with me Is strategy development impossible in the current NHS or is it an essential leadership task for delivering high quality care Many will recall the story of President Kennedys visit to Nasa in  when he asked the janitor what he was doing The man replied Well Mr President Im helping put a man on the moon Im confident the vast majority of NHS staff can articulate what they do and how it relates to patients But I wonder how many could articulate the strategy of their organisation and how it will enable the delivery of high quality care Strategy can be described as a set of choices and principles to support the achievement of longterm goals It includes the allocation of resources and responsibilities drawing on evidence and setting challenging but realistic timescales for achieving those goals Robust strategies should draw upon expertise from staff patients and other partners to guide and inform them so that organisations can adapt to the changing and increasingly challenging clinical and financial environment in which they operate Thats easier to say than deliver Developing organisational strategy is a challenging task for any senior leader regardless of the sector but does the complexity of healthcare make this even harder Last year Monitor commissioned independent research to assess the quality of strategic plans and planning capabilities at foundation trusts While the review identified some clear examples of good practice it also revealed that there was significant variation in capabilities across the sector In fact only a small proportion of the sector was able to perform the full range of planning tasks to a high enough standard to produce wellarticulated plans aimed at enhancing patient outcomes and addressing any underperformance In contrast a large number of trusts struggled with some of the most important planning tasks and in a limited number of cases plans continued to overlook longstanding problems So this summer weve worked with five trusts to learn from their experiences of developing strategy in order to codesign guidance and a toolkit to help the entire sector do it better Each trust faces different challenges and has different opportunities in their local health economies or beyond However developing a robust strategy is vital for all in either overcoming those challenges or maximising opportunities It has been a privilege to learn from the leaders of these trusts and useful in illuminating the difficulties and pleasure of developing a reallife strategy But strategy isnt just about the future its also about supporting boards to manage the here and now In a research programme between  and  Prof Michael West conducted   Its findings showed that organisations with unclear and disjointed goals were characterised by tied up resources ambiguity fragmentation and competing pressures they had poor intelligence on which to base decisionsimprovements highly variable staff support a lack of respect and appreciation and a lack of integration which led to timewasting frustrating barriers and gaps in care Therefore while dealing with uncertainty is core to strategy development it should offer an opportunity for innovation and challenge the way weve always done things around here Board members have to use their skill and judgement to lead these discussions and to make clear decisions based on evidence to address the challenges facing the NHS Rather like the characters in the film The Wizard of Oz  as a senior leadership team sets out on their strategic journey they must have brains like the scarecrow heart like the tin man find courage like the lion and use all of these to best effect to return home like Dorothy In reality there is no Wizard of Oz who has all the answers and the main resources to deliver a good strategy usually exist within the local health economy So the trick is to use them Strategy development in the NHS is not impossible but it does require head heart courage and ultimately great teamwork
