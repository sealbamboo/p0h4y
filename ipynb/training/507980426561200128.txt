When the documentary filmmaker Banker White began turning his camera on his family in  his mother had undertaken a project of great personal importance She wanted to compile material for a book about her own mother a Massachusetts painter named Marian Williams Steele who died of Alzheimers disease in  She was an amazing artist Pam White says on camera showing her son the many paintings stashed in a storage locker in Dedham We thought it would be nice to keep her alive Probably a similar impulse kept Mr White shooting for three years at first helping his mother with her project but then recording her waning abilities and the familys responses At  Mrs White had been found to have earlyonset Alzheimers though she initially wanted to keep that secret and referred only to her memory problems When public televisions POV series airs this family saga The Genius of Marian on Monday viewers will see dementia take its inexorable toll on a vibrant woman an actress turned social worker and on her husband children and friends Mrs White puts her head in her hands when she can no longer concentrate on her project Her son and his producer codirector and wife Anna Fitch follow along as Mrs White becomes unable to figure out how to put on a jacket and cant tell her neurologist what year it is In one segment she resists paid help with the familiar dontwantastrangerinmyhouse objection Daddy and I do really well and I dont want anything to mess with it she says But her careworn husband Ed White  confessing to his son that I sometimes feel like Im caged  later breaks into sobs But Mrs White can also still joke and laugh and sing even as daily life grows more frustrating and difficult Theres so much fear Banker White told me in an interview Ive had people say If Im like that shoot me in the head  Through his work he hopes they can see what it actually looks like inside the house  the effects on my dad but also periods of lightness and humor A lot of adult children have produced dementia memoirs between book covers Mr White and Ms Fitch have put their memoir produced with the familys cooperation of course including Mrs Whites on film and video Their ability to weave past and present together reflects the way people with dementia live simultaneously in the now and the then That child being lifted over the waves on a beach might be Mrs White herself in an old home movie with her own mother it might be one of her children decades later or it might be one of her grandchildren Ive experienced moments of incredible sadness over the past five years but moments of incredible connection too Mr White said You grieve the loss of your mother while you are holding her hand and then that might be interrupted by some of the silliness of dementia and you just laugh He has also created a website supported by the National Endowment for the Arts called   with portraits of caregivers starting with his father now  and an educational curriculum for students In a community gallery others can post their own stories videos and photographs Pam White is  now She and her husband still her primary caregiver sold the big house and moved into a more manageable condo in Brookline Mass where she attends a wonderful adult day program three days a week Hired caregivers assist at home Mrs Whites vision and her physical functions have declined further and she seems aloof unless you engage her her son said But when you do she is communicative and she still has that smile I can understand why people burdened by caregiving might decline to spend their rare recreational hours watching other people face similar trials Maybe ancient Andy Griffith episodes on TV Land will feel more restorative But I found The Genius of Marian truthful cleareyed and not overdramatic yet very moving Its about telling your mom that you love her Mr White says off camera when Pam asks why he is making this movie Yes exactly
