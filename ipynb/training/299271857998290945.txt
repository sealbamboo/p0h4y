The characteristics of gun violence in the US are largely unknown because key federal health agencies have been   since the mids President Obama however wants to change that In presenting his   last month Obama said he would order the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to resume scientific studies of the issue We dont benefit from ignorance he said On Monday however the president acknowledged in a   to the Minneapolis Police Department that he might be in for a fight Because for a long time even looking at the evidence was considered somehow tough politics he said Indeed opponents on Capitol Hill are already making their concerns heard Gun violence is not a disease Iowa Senator Charles Grassley the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee said in a recent   And lawful gun ownership is not a disease It is a constitutionally protected individual right But gun researchers say it is long past time that the research resumes We really dont know some of the answers to the critical questions we need to know about gun violence in order to have more effective law enforcement and more effective public policy says   codirector of the   at the University of Chicago At the lab most research on things like underground gun markets and strategies to prevent gun violence has to be done with nonfederal funds Theres been a chilling effect brought about by the constraints that the president spoke about and by the political history of this debate at CDC and elsewhere Pollack says RAND Corps   a health policy analyst is wellacquainted with the political history of the debate Kellermann grew up with guns in East Tennessee Having a gun in your house was about as controversial as having a washing machine he says He says he was quite familiar with the idea of keeping a gun in the house for protection But as a young ER doc I wasnt seeing too many bad guys shot by homeowners he says I was seeing kids shot by another child while they played with a gun they had found I saw spouses who had shot one or the other in a family dispute And I saw older individuals and sometimes teenage kids who used a gun to either take their life or attempt to take their life So he and several other researchers set out to study what they saw as costbenefit analyses of the dangers of keeping guns particularly loaded guns in the home The findings were all strikingly similar On the balance the risks of a tragedy in the home  a homicide or suicide  were actually increased if a gun was kept there rather than not he says Gun advocates blasted the research Michael Hammond legislative counsel with the group   says it appeared as if the CDC was going to  basically issue politicized studies with taxpayer funding concerning the Second Amendment issues The   all but   on the CDC in  The NRA didnt respond to repeated requests for comment for this story The group first tried to defund the agencys entire injury control center though research on gun violence amounted to about   of a  million budget The following year a compromise of sorts was reached Congressional funders took the  million the CDC had been spending on gun violence research and ordered that it be used instead to study traumatic brain injury It was very clever says Rep Rosa DeLauro DConn now the ranking member of the   that oversees the Department of Health and Human Services budget How do you say no to traumatic brain injury But opponents of gun violence research also added   stipulating that none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control Obama says his order that the research resume is premised on the legal opinion that gun violence research isnt the same   Thats what researchers have always claimed too Public health research they say is based on making things safer not on taking them away Its ironic if you think about it says Kellermann The last  years weve made spectacular progress with car crashes  in reducing drownings smoke inhalation from house fires And yet weve not banned matches swimming pools or automobiles But neither the CDC nor researchers wanted to take a chance testing the limits of the research ban says DeLauro and that essentially shut the research down Lawmakers have since expanded the ban  today it covers not only research at the CDC but also   including the National Institutes of Health  and they even added antigun control language to the   HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius   is committed to reengaging gun violence research at CDC and NIH But the only real way to ensure the research restarts is for Congress to drop the existing language from the annual spending bill and restore funding A spokesman for Georgia Republican Rep Jack Kingston the new chairman of the   said the chairman is planning to hold hearings on the matter If CDC can show they can do nonbiased and nonpolitically motivated studies thats something hed be interested in the spokesman said But like everything else gunrelated in Congress nothing is guaranteed
