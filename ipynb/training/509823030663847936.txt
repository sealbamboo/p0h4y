As the image above shows, political reporters and pundits–including some of the most respected ones I know–have different takes on the importance of .  as an election issue now that implementation of the law is moving forward and some of the controversy around it has cooled. Observers are split, with some emphasizing the law’s decline as a hot political issue and others its staying power as a rallying cry for the right, and a few suggesting that the ACA may emerge as an issue Democrats want to run on.. Each of these positions may be at least partly right. Obamacare has cooled as an issue now that there isn’t an obvious controversy, such as last fall’s website debacle, to occupy the front pages. But the law, now a more conventional Republican talking point than an outsize rallying cry, is still useful to some Republican candidates as a tool to motivate their anti-Obama base. Less clear is whether many Democrats will choose to run on some of the ACA’s most popular provisions, such as its protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. This was the consensus of an .  the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Cook Political Report held in Washington about the ACA and the midterm elections; it featured people from both organizations and journalists covering tight Senate races for the Des Moines Register and the Charlotte Observer.
