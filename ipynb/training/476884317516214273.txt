The economic crisis in Europe and North America led to more than  extra suicides according to figures from UK researchers  A study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry showed suicides have risen markedly The research group said some deaths may have been avoidable as some countries showed no increase in suicide rate  Campaign groups said the findings showed how important good mental health services were The study by the University of Oxford and the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine analysed data from  EU countries the US and Canada It said suicides had been declining in Europe until  By  there was a  increase a level that was sustained until  It was the equivalent of  more suicides than would have been expected if previous trends continued the research group said  Deaths by suicide were also falling in Canada but there was a marked increase when the recession took hold in  leading to  more suicides The number of people taking their own life was already increasing in the US but the rate accelerated with the economic crisis leading to  additional deaths  The report said losing a job having a home repossessed and being in debt were the main risk factors However some countries bucked the trend Sweden Finland and Austria all avoided increases in the suicide rate during the recession  One of the researchers Dr Aaron Reeves of the University of Oxford said A critical question for policy and psychiatric practice is whether suicide rises are inevitable He told the BBC Theres a lot of good evidence showing recessions lead to rising suicides but what is surprising is this hasnt happened everywhere  Austria Sweden and Finland It shows policy potentially matters One of the features of these countries is they invest in schemes that help people return to work such as training advice and even subsidised wages There are always hard choices to make in a recession but for me one of the things government does is provide support and protection for vulnerable groups  these services help people who are bearing the brunt of an economic crisis Andy Bell of the Centre for Mental Health said The study says what we feared for some time that unemployment job insecurity and many other factors associated with the recession are associated with poor mental health and suicide It reminds us how important it is to respond to that need and take preventative action where we can and that primary care is properly resourced and able to identify people who are at risk Beth Murphy of the charity Mind said Since  weve seen an increasing number of people contact the Mind Infoline concerned about the impact of money and unemployment on their mental health  Redundancy and other life circumstances brought about by the recession can trigger depression anxiety and suicidal thoughts for anyone whether they have previously experienced a mental health problem or not  For some people these factors can become so difficult to cope with that suicide may feel like the only option
