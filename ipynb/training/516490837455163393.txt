The heavyset man with a bandage on his throat is having trouble repeating a phrase No ifs  he says to the medical students and doctors around his bed at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston Can I hear you say no ifs ands or buts says   the Harvard neurologist in charge The patient tries again No ifs buts ands or he says Ropper has heard enough I think hes probably had a little left temporal maybe angular gyrusarea stroke he tells the students and doctors once theyre assembled outside the patients room A brain scan confirms his diagnosis Later Ropper tells me that the patients inability to repeat that simple phrase told him precisely where a stroke had damaged the mans brain What we did was on clinical grounds we nailed this down to a piece of real estate about the size of a quarter he says This reliance on bedside observation and conversation is what makes neurology such a remarkable specialty Ropper says The rest of medicine has moved very strongly toward laboratory diagnosis and scans like MRI and CT he says But the brain he says is too complicated to believe that by looking just at the images you can sort out whats going on for an individual patient Ropper shows me example after example of this as I follow him on rounds The hospital allowed me to record what I saw and heard so long as I didnt use the names of any patients In one room we meet a woman in her late s who came in for back surgery but ended up with another problem I came out of surgery and I opened my eyes and everything was double she says The surgeons thought her double vision might be from a stroke But Ropper checks the muscles that control her eyes and realizes theyre being affected by something else Do you have trouble with your eyelids drooping he asks Do you have trouble with your head staying upright at the end of the day The woman answers yes to both questions Ropper suspects she has myasthenia a disease that causes muscles to weaken rapidly with use So he has her repeatedly squeeze a rolledup bloodpressure cuff The pressure gauge on the cuff shows that each squeeze is weaker than the previous one That clinches the diagnosis for him although a blood test will eventually confirm his bedside assessment Thats an example of the craft of neurology Ropper says Theres no book that would have extracted that diagnosis from that lady When someone develops a serious brain problem Ropper says it can be like falling down a rabbit hole and entering an   world  where nothing looks or works the way its supposed to A neurologists job is to find a way to understand the odd landscape of a damaged brain he says Youre querying the organ that has the problem and youre asking it to talk to you but it cant do it properly because of that damage he says Thats the   part You have to figure out with mirrors and metaphors how to get at the problem Ropper and coauthor   describe that process in a   called   An entire chapter is devoted to patients whose problems cannot be detected by any test or scan We meet one of these patients during morning rounds Shes a charming softspoken woman in her s who says her left leg is so weak she cant move it Ropper turns the exam over to   a senior resident at Brigham and Womens Its a part of Roppers mission to make sure the next generation of neurologists also knows how to reach down the rabbit hole During a long conversation the woman tells Bhattacharyya about a similar episode a few months earlier At the time doctors ordered nerve conduction studies ultrasound MRI  pretty much everything medical technology has to offer Nothing turned up a problem So Bhattacharyya tries a lowtech approach that doctors have been using for a century He has the woman lie on her back and lift her healthy leg When the woman does this she involuntarily pushes down hard with the supposedly disabled leg Neurologists know this as Hoovers sign and it confirms what Bhattacharyya suspected The problem isnt physical its psychological But its hard to treat Ropper says because the weakness is very real to the person experiencing it Youve got a normal functioning brain that somehow goes out of its way to produce blindness paralysis tremor walking difficulty and so on he says Theres no other organ that does that Your liver doesnt decide one day to wake up and say Im going to feign liver failure But the brain isnt like other organs And Ropper says thats why he gets up and goes to work each day
