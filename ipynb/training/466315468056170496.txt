If you tell your doctor youd like to stop drinking odds are hes not going to give you a pill Thats too bad a study says because there are medications that can help people with drinking problems get off the sauce And theyre not going to make you sick like   a medication used for decades to treat alcoholics that makes them wretchedly ill if they drink Instead these are drugs that address the brain chemistry that gets messed up by alcohol In an analysis of  randomized controlled trials both   and   helped people either quit drinking or cut back substantially We have medications that can help says   an associate professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill Hes the first author on the   published Tuesday in   the journal of the American Medical Association But patients seeking help with a drinking problem are prescribed the drugs less than  percent of the time Jonas told Shots One reason is that most people dont get any treatment of any sort for a serious drinking problem Another is that many doctors just dont know that there are drugs beside Antabuse even though acamprosate and naltrexone were approved by the Food and Drug Administration back in the s Its been quite a bit of a secret Jonas says It doesnt get advertised This study doesnt look at social drinkers rather its about people who are really having problems with alcohol such as wanting to cut back but not being able to About  percent of men have an   at some point in their lives as do  percent of women Still these medications are no easy fix With acamprosate for instance  in  people using it stopped drinking completely And all of the people in these studies were also getting behavioral therapy to help them deal with the complex social cues and habits surrounding drinking Its really hard to quit and it often takes many attempts to be successful Jonas says The study also found benefits in nalmefene and topiramate two medications that are also prescribed for alcohol dependence but are not specifically approved for that by the FDA A   published last month found that topiramate helped reduce drinking in people with a specific gene variant suggesting that new medications could be developed to target those neurotransmitter systems Many primary care doctors arent comfortable treating alcohol problems Jonas says and typically refer patients for behavioral treatment But behavioral treatment can be hard to find and hard to pay for This study suggests not only that a lot more people might benefit from using medication along with behavioral therapy but also that some people might get help from medication alone People are starting to ask the question could we just be using the medication could it be beneficial Jonas says We dont really know the answer to that based on the studies we have Historically addiction has been treated in behavioral health settings or through step groups says   a senior investigator at the Group Health Research Institute in Seattle who cowrote an   accompanying the study But theres a transition now Were moving addiction back into the medical system Thats not to say that people shouldnt go with a step program or purely behavioral treatment she says but that people should be offered options Shes working on a study to do just that Our hope with these medications is that as people become aware of them it will help destigmatize addiction and move it further into the medical setting for patients who want that
