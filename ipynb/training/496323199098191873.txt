Analysts who fear health spending is accelerating got plenty of evidence in Wall Streets secondquarter results to support their thesis But so did folks who hope spending is still under control Now everybodys trying to sort out the mixed message The answer matters because deficit debates and affordability concerns revolve around forecasts that health spending will speed up as the economy revives National health spending rose only  percent in  the most recent year for complete results If costs dont rise the future looks better for consumers employers and taxpayers To hear hospitals tell it  based on earning reports issued over the last two weeks  we might be heading back toward the painful  percent annual increases of the early s Thanks to expanded coverage from the Affordable Care Act that began in January We have seen higher utilization rates than maybe we originally anticipated William Rutherford chief financial officer at the hospital chain HCA Holdings   last week HCAs admissions rose after declining in the previous two quarters Revenue increased  percent and the company raised its profit forecast Tenet Healthcare another hospital chain   in six years for admissions covered by private insurance Inpatient revenue at Universal Health Services general hospitals   Most hospital stocks are up more than onetenth since earnings season began So the insurance companies who pay for all this must be getting killed right Not exactly Medical cost trends continue to be moderate Aetnas chief financial officer   Cost increases at WellPoint for the second quarter stayed close to a tame  percent  And it doesnt see that changing soon Our underlying cost trends remain very well controlled UnitedHealth Groups top financial officer   Cigna even   projecting an increase for  of  percent to  percent Whats going on Part of the apparent contradiction is that health plans focus on per capita not total costs says   who follows insurers for Leerink Partners an investment house Moderate expense increases for an insurer means moderate per member  even if thanks to the ACA insurers have many more members than they did a year ago That new membership is why hospitals are getting new patients from Obamacare and theyre getting it in spades Gupte said in an interview But somebody is paying for the expanded coverage federal taxpayers through subsidies for private insurance bought online and direct payments for expansion of the Medicaid program for lowerincome people To a smaller extent employers are also probably getting billed for hospitals revenue gains as economic improvement means more people have jobs and employersponsored coverage Part of the second quarters volume surge looks like pentup demand from the previously uninsured analysts say That may not last And not all the billions spent on Medicaid expansion and insurance subsidies are net new money to the system The ACA partly compensates for those additional dollars by cutting federal support for hospitals to care for the poor and seniors The law also includes readmission penalties and other efficiency incentives that should reduce hospitals future revenue The Labor Department estimates that hospitals   in July suggesting they are feeling financial pressure Even so health spending in the second quarter looks a lot stronger   when bad storms helped shrink the whole economy One after another in recent days insurers reported higher ratios of medical expenditures to secondquarter premiums even as they reassured investors about cost trends Thats not very persuasive evidence that costs will stay on track especially since health plans dont have a good record of predicting spikes says Citigroup analyst Carl McDonald In a note to clients he writes Its hard to correlate plan comments on slowing cost trends with the recent commentary from some providers that underlying volumes are rising for the first time in years
