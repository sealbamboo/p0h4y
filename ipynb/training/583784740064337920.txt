Tailormade cancer vaccines that target unique genetic errors in a patients tumour have been developed in the US  Safety tests on three people   showed the immune system could be trained to fight skin cancers  The American team say the early results mark a significant step towards personalised cancer vaccines The charity Cancer Research UK called the tests an exciting but very earlystage trial UV light can transform healthy skin cells into deadly melanomas by damaging the DNA  The tumours are a genetic mess containing hundreds of random mutations that are different in every patient  The mutations can change the proteins that stick out from the surface of cells and act like identifying flags  The team mainly based in St Louis and Oklahoma City analysed the genetic mutations to predict the new and unique flags that would be flown by the cancer cells A computer algorithm then analysed the new flags known as neoantigens to decide which would be the best targets for a vaccine Personalised vaccines were given to three patients with advanced tumours in  All had already been treated with another therapy     One was in remission and has stayed cancerfree another still has stable tumours and the third patients tumour shrank in the months after the vaccine before returning to its original size and remaining stable The team are at this stage testing just the safety of the vaccine and whether it provokes an immune response They say it was successful on both counts One of the researchers Dr Gerald Linette said Our team is very encouraged by the quality of the immune response directed against the melanoma neoantigens in all three patients Our results are preliminary but we think the vaccines have therapeutic potential His colleague Dr Beatriz Carreno added These findings represent a significant step toward more personalised immunotherapies The personalised vaccine approach has a number of hurdles to clear For a start proper clinical trials are needed to prove that the immune boost actually makes a difference to controlling the tumour There are also questions about cost and the time it takes  currently three months  to develop each persons vaccine  However if the approach proves successful it could be useful in other highly mutated cancers such as those found in the lung They may also have a role in breast and ovarian cancers in women with BRCA mutations such as the Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie which also tend to be very mutated  Dr Alan Worsley of Cancer Research UK said This exciting but very earlystage trial shows that it may be possible to create vaccines that are tailored to the specific genetic mistakes in a patients cancer  At the moment its not clear how effective this immunotherapy would be at killing cancer cells in the body and improving survival but this promising study sets the stage for creating vaccines that are designed to target each patients individual tumour in the future Prof Caroline Springer who works on new drugs for melanoma at the Institute for Cancer Research told the BBC News website I think its very interesting Its a very positive results and its good that its safe but its quite early days  Ipilimumab can have longlasting effects on its own The vaccine has mounted an immune response but it is difficult to tell if that amounts to an antitumour response if it is already responding to ipilimumab
