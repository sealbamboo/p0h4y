Like the other women in my cancer support group I have been trying to salvage aspects of the person I had been before the diagnosis In my case I longed for the drugless sleep I enjoyed before I began having to take  the sleeping pill AmbienÂ Ambien can cause amnesia confusion missteps and falls I wanted to wean myself from dependency to recover at least one aspect of the person I previously had been so I began cutting the fivemilligram pill in two and then prepared to stop taking it altogether Ever attentive my husband Don suggested that I use an overthecounter sleeping pill sold by at the grocery store  in the transition I wasnt surprised to find myself leaving my bed at  am to play computer Scrabble What did discombobulate me was the heavy weight of sleep when it finally arrived layers of dense batting that suffocated me even after I struggled back to muffled consciousness the next morning and then contended with a daylong hangover It turns out that each pill has  milligrams of diphenhydramine HCI the antihistamine in Benadryl I gave up and went back to cutting the Ambien in half Before diagnosis I never needed a sleeping pill But my former self is gone  because of residual surgical damage and heightened anxiety about recurrence but also because of the longlasting aches and pains after chemotherapy Gone too is my blithe confidence in my physical resiliency The burden my diminishment places on my husband most distresses me Without Don as my moral compass  how I worry that my needs exhaust him now in his s  I could not keep up the rigorous rounds of grocery shopping cooking laundry garbage disposal bill paying and hospital visits that we undertake together And most of all how could I attain the buoyancy of spirit that comes from a shared joke a tender caress a collaborative recollection For several of the younger women in my support group surgery radiation and chemotherapy brought about a dramatic disconnection from their previous selves the early onset of menopause Hot flashes mood swings inelastic skin and bone loss upset them but less than a plummeting sex drive Like me they have intimacy with their partners what they dont have and want to have are orgasms At a recent lunch meeting one member of my group triumphantly displayed a gleaming silver bullet We passed it around wondering what it could be thicker than a pencil and two inches long it was too heavy to wear as a pendant Laughing she told us it came from an adult fantasy store and clicked a tiny switch so it vibrated in our palms Amid an avalanche of talk about medications and creams another woman described a consultation she had had with a sex researcher who had given her a bag with graduated dilators and a hotpink gizmo called the Rabbit that she admitted put her off But the information helped she added Lovemaking is not what it was but it did get better This young woman was appalled that no one in the medical establishment addressed the sexuality problems she had encountered Sex toys should not be lurid subjects avoided or addressed with a wink she said Hospitals need to provide informational packets as well as reminders that the mind is the biggest sexual organ When radiation and chemotherapy end there should be posttreatment counseling As she then confided her New Years resolution  to work with the local cancer center to redress the absence of remedies  I thought about the oddity of the problem We are bombarded by hypersexualized images on the Internet and on television but puritanism reigns in the offices of radiologists oncologists and social workers My support group friends had lost not just sleep but pleasure and a significant aspect of their identities as women Realizing that at different ages we mourn different losses I reveled in my comrades gleeful efforts at recovery Just that week a colleague closer to my age had said after treatment My life is so reduced Who was I Had I ever been the person I was At least my lunch mates could remember who they had been and were seeking routes of return
