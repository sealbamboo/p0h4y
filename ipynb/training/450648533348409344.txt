The White House can’t seem to escape glitches related to the Affordable Care Act.. As of about 9 a.m. a countdown clock on the White House website’s home page was saying that people had about 15 days left to enroll health care — 14 days longer than they really have — which looked to be due to a coding glitch that had the clock off by one column. That is, the clock was showing 15 days instead of 15 hours, then hours for minutes, and minutes for seconds.
