Its been eight months since a Saudi Arabian doctor   a previously unknown virus related to SARS And for most of that time only germ geeks paid much attention But in the past few days the new virus  which some would   MERSCoV for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus  has been making up for lost time In one    patients have recently struggled with the dangerous virus and seven have died Meanwhile in northern   a man who recently returned from Dubai with the virus has infected a patient in the next hospital bed Another cluster of cases at a hospital in Jordan   last year underscores the pattern Like SARS this virus is especially apt to spread within hospitals One of the hallmarks of SARS is that about half the cases involved transmission within hospitals   Dr Eric Toner of the University of Pittsburghs Center for Health Security And many of the other cases could be traced back to people who got infected in hospitals  both patients and staffers Thankfully the newest coronavirus is not behaving like its cousin the SARS virus or not yet SARS burst on the scene in  after a single infected Chinese man infected an array of travelers staying on the same floor of a Hong Kong hotel Within weeks the virus was causing severe illness and death in more than  countries Ultimately more than  people got SARS and around  died By contrast over the past year the new coronavirus is known to have infected  people and killed  So the spread of MERS has been far less explosive than SARS At a media briefing over the weekend in Saudi Arabia   of the World Health Organization   that persontoperson transmission of the new coronavirus has remained limited to small clusters and so far there is no evidence that this virus has the capacity to sustain generalized community transmission But you might have noticed that the new viruss apparent mortality rate has been higher so far   percent for MERS versus  percent for SARS Be careful with these figures though because far less is known at this point about the true rate of MERS infections and deaths Still theres no question this new virus is highly lethal possibly because it   its victims immune responses perhaps even more so than the SARS virus That effect and the size of the recent hospital cluster of MERS cases in Saudi Arabia have grabbed the attention of public health officials And the University of Pittsburghs   points out that SARS was so easily transmitted in hospitals because most patients were maximally infectious while there In other words they were shedding the most virus several days into their respiratory illness when they were likely to be hospitalized By contrast patients infected with flu viruses shed maximal virus within the first few days when theyre out and about There are pluses and minuses to the propensity of the MERS virus to spread within hospitals On the minus side it means hospitals virtually anywhere in the world could find themselves with an infected patient  as the hospital in northern France found out But on the plus side spread of the virus can be halted by strict observance of infectioncontrol precautions by hospital staffs when treating a patient with a respiratory illness of unknown origin Thats largely how SARS was brought under control Toner worries that hospitals have largely forgotten that lesson Hospitals were very attuned to respiratory precautions in  at the end of the SARS outbreak Toner tells Shots But they have reverted at least partially to their previous practice of being pretty casual about it We see this every day Since MERS seems to be taking advantage of health care facilities as a breeding ground Toner says the message to hospitals around the world is clear Wake up
