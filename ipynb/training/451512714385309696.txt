Aerobic exercise in your s may protect the brain in middle age according to a US study Activities that maintain cardio fitness  such as running swimming and cycling  led to better thinking skills and memory  years on Scientists say the research reported in   adds to evidence the brain benefits from good heart health Cardio fitness is a measure of how well the body absorbs oxygen during exercise and transports it to the muscles Researchers at the University of Minnesota Minneapolis tested almost  healthy people with an average age of  They underwent treadmill tests of cardiovascular fitness during the first year of the study and again  years later  They were asked to run for as long as possible before they became exhausted or short of breath Cognitive tests taken  years after the start of the study measured memory and thinking skills  People who ran for longer on the treadmill performed better at tests of memory and thinking skills  years on even after adjusting for factors such as smoking diabetes and high cholesterol  People who had smaller time differences in their treadmill test  years later were more likely to perform better on the executive function test than those who had bigger differences  Many studies show the benefits to the brain of good heart health said study author Dr David Jacobs This is one more important study that should remind young adults of the brain health benefits of cardio fitness activities such as running swimming biking or cardio fitness classes Dr Jacobs said a concept was emerging of total fitness incorporating social physical and mental aspects of health Its really a total package of how your body is and the linkage of that entire package of performance  thats related to cognitive function many years later and in midlife he told BBC News Dr Simon Ridley Head of Research at   said A growing body of evidence suggests exercise may reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia and much research has shown a link between healthy habits in midlife and better health in old age  Investment in research is vital to better understand how we can protect our brains as we age
