Federal officials say a large study of premature infants was ethically flawed because doctors didnt inform the babies parents about increased risks of blindness brain damage and death The study involved more than  severely premature infants at nearly two dozen medical institutions between  and  The infants were randomly assigned to receive two different levels of oxygen to see which was better at preventing blindness without increasing the risk of neurologic damage or death In a March    a Department of Health and Human Services official told the researchers that the study was in violation of the regulatory requirements for informed consent because parents werent told in advance about the reasonably foreseeable risks In fact the consent form signed by parents did not identify any risks from subjecting the infants to either the low or high levels of oxygen used in the study writes Lisa Buchanan of the   part of HHS The   published in  by the   showed that infants who got the higher level of oxygen had more than twice the incidence of severe blindness while infants who got the lower level were slightly more likely to die Among the  babies in the lowoxygen group  died   percent more than in the highoxygen group In the highoxygen group  of  developed blindness  a rate of nearly  percent compared to  percent in the lowoxygen group The study was designed to address a longstanding problem in the care of very premature babies Its known that if they get too much oxygen that can cause blindness from a condition called   But if they dont get enough they can suffer brain damage and death About  infants a year become legally blind from this condition out of about  US infants born every year weighing less than   pounds The feds letter was addressed to Richard Marchase an executive at the University of Alabama at Birmingham a lead institution in the multicenter study Marchase says in an     that the death rate of infants in the lowoxygen group was actually lower than a similar group of infants born around the same time who werent in the study He also maintains that all the infants in the study were given enough oxygen to keep their blood levels within the standard range But the HHS letter takes issue with that contention The study was designed it said to give infants in the highoxygen group more oxygen than average infants receiving standard care and infants assigned to the lower range received less Marchase seems to acknowledge that the studys informed consent language could have been better In the future he tells the   We will to the best of our ability let the subjects or their parents know as thoroughly as possible what previous studies suggest in terms of risk We are going to be very sensitive to that going forward The flawed consent forms were approved by ethics committees at all  medical centers involved in the study They included such prestigious institutions as Stanford Yale Duke Tufts and the University of California San Diego The ethical problem came to light because a consumer group called Public Citizen   HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to apologize to the parents of the  infants who agreed to participate in the study The word unethical doesnt even begin to describe the egregious and shocking deficiencies in the informedconsent process for this study Dr Michael Carome of Public Citizens Health Research Group says in a   He says its likely that many parents would not have agreed to enroll their infants in the study if they had known about the risks Carome formerly worked for the HHS Office of Human Research Protections In addition to an apology from Sebelius Public Citizen calls on HHS to investigate how the HHS system for review and oversight of clinical trials failed so miserably
