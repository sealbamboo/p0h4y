
 Winning streaks in sports may be more than just magical thinking several new studies suggest  Whether you call them winning streaks hot hands or being in the zone most sports fans believe that players and teams tend to go on tears Case in point Nate Robinsons almost singlehanded evisceration of the Miami Heat on Monday night Yes I am a Bulls fan  But our faith in hot hands is challenged by a rich and wellregarded body of science over the past  years much of it focused on basketball that tells us our belief is mostly fallacious In one of the first and bestknown of these studies   scientists parsed records from the Philadelphia ers the Boston Celtics and the Cornell University varsity squad and concluded that players statistically were not more likely to hit a second basket after sinking a first But players and fans believed that they were so a player who had hit one shot would be likely to take the teams next and teammates would feed this hot player the ball  Other studies showed that fans supported and bet on teams that they thought were on a hot streak even though these bets rarely paid off Our belief in them revealed how strongly humans want to impose order and meaning on utterly random sequences of events  Now however some new studies that use huge previously unavailable data sets are suggesting that in some instances hands can ignite and the success of one play can indeed affect the outcome of the next  In the most wideranging of the new studies Gur Yaari a computational biologist at Yale and his colleagues gathered enormous amounts of data about an   in the NBA and    Subjecting these numbers to extensive and to the layperson inscrutable statistical analysis they tried to determine whether the success or failure of a free throw or a bowling frame depended on what had just happened in the competitors last attempt In other words if someone had just sunk a free throw or rolled a strike was the person more likely to succeed immediately afterward Or were the odds about the same as tossing a coin and seeing how it landed  In these big sets of data which were far larger than those used in for instance the  basketball study success did slightly increase the chances of subsequent success  though generally over a longer time frame than the next shot Basketball players experienced statistically significant and recognizable hot periods over an entire game or two during which they would hit more free throws than random chance would suggest But they would not necessarily hit one free throw immediately after the last 
Similarly bowlers who completed a highscoring game were more likely to roll strikes in the next game But a strike in one frame of each game was not statistically likely to lead to a strike in the next frame  Hot streaks have some relevance in volleyball as well as a  study helpfully titled   explores Researchers at the German Sport University in Cologne examined match results for  elite volleyball players and identified statistically meaningful scoring streaks among half of them The researchers also found that when a players got hot teammates and coaches responded almost immediately in ways that moved the ball to the streaking player increasing the teams likelihood of winning  But if winning streaks have some rational basis then by inference so would losing streaks which makes the latest of the new studies of basketball game play particularly noteworthy In that analysis   in the journal Psychological Science Yigal Attali who holds a doctorate in cognitive psychology scrutinized all available shooting statistics from the  NBA season  He found that a player who drained one shot was more likely than chance would suggest to take the teams next shot  and also more likely than chance would suggest to miss it Essentially he found that in real games players developed antihot hands A momentary success bred immediate subsequent failure  The reason for this phenomenon might be both psychological and practical Dr Attali wrote players seemed to take their second shots from farther out than their first ones perhaps because they felt buoyed by that last success They also were likely to be defended more vigorously after a successful shot since defenders are as influenced by a belief in hot hands as anyone else But what the findings underscore more subtly is that patterns do exist within the results The players were more likely to miss after a successful shot And this antihot hand phenomenon said Dr Yaari who is familiar with the study was itself a pattern It is not completely random and independent of past results he said   These new studies do not undermine the validity of the magisterial past research on hot hands but expand and augment it Dr Yaari and the other authors say adding even more human complexity Yes we probably imagine and desire patterns where they do not exist But it may be that we also are capable of sensing and responding to some cues within games and activities that are almost too subtle for most collections of numbers to capture  I think that our minds evolved to be sensitive to these kinds of patterns Dr Yaari said since they occur frequently in nature  And that is enough encouragement for me to believe that against all rational expectations the Bulls will carry the series against Miami Theyre hot
