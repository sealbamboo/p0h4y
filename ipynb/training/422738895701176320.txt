Nine women in Sweden have received womb transplants from living relatives in a pioneering trial  Dr Mats Brannstrom of the University of Gothenberg who has been leading the experimental fertility project hopes the technique could help other women who want to become pregnant  He says up to  women in the UK could stand to benefit  This includes women either born without a womb or who have womb problems that stop them conceiving Dr Brannstroms team recruited  women to their trial One could not proceed with the trial for medical reasons but nine went on to have a womb transplant These women were born without a uterus or had it removed because of cervical cancer  Most are in their s and are part of the first major experiment to test whether it is possible to transplant wombs into women so they can give birth to their own children Scientists in Britain and elsewhere are also planning similar operations but the efforts in Sweden are the most advanced There have been two previous attempts to transplant a womb  in Turkey and Saudi Arabia  but both failed to produce babies This is a new kind of surgery Dr Brannstrom told Associated Press in an interview from Gothenburg We have no textbook to look at He and colleagues will run the first workshop on how to perform womb transplants and they plan to publish a scientific report on their efforts soon The transplant operations did not connect the womens uteruses to their fallopian tubes so they are unable to become pregnant naturally But all who received a womb have their own ovaries and can produce eggs to be used for IVF treatment
