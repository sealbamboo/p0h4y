Rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament in the knee is a nightmare As the parent of a teenage son who is seven months out from ACL reconstruction surgery I can attest to the physical and psychological toll it can take not to mention the medical bills But a practical new study suggests that changing how sports teams warm up before practices and games could substantially lower the risk that athletes will hurt a knee at a cost of barely a dollar per player  Injuries to the ACL which connects the tibia and femur and stabilizes the knee joint are soaring with an estimated  cases a year The ligament is prone to tearing if the knee shears sideways during hard awkward landings or abrupt shifts in direction  the kind of movements that are especially common in sports like basketball football soccer volleyball and skiing  Motivated by the growing occurrence of these knee injuries many researchers have been working in recent years to develop training programs to reduce their number These programs formally known as neuromuscular training use a series of exercises to teach athletes how to land cut shift directions plant their legs and otherwise move during play so that they are less likely to injure themselves Studies have found that the programs can reduce the number of ACL tears per season by  percent or more particularly among girls who tear their ACLs at a higher rate than boys do although numerically far more boys are affected  But to date few leagues high schools or teams across the country have instituted neuromuscular training That puzzled Dr Eric Swart a resident in orthopedic surgery at PresbyterianColumbia University Medical Center Wondering what might motivate coaches and other interested parties to take up ACL injuryprevention programs Dr Swart and his colleagues settled on naked selfinterest They set out to see what the financial savings involved in undertaking  or resisting  an ACLinjury prevention program might be  So for  at the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons annual meeting in New Orleans he and his colleagues gathered recent clinical trials related to neuromuscular training and used them to create a model of what would happen in a hypothetical sports league composed of male and female athletes ages  to  if they did or did not practice neuromuscular training The researchers then began running the monetary numbers They first determined that not surprisingly the medical costs associated with a single ACL tear are staggering with the estimated price for reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation averaging  If the incidence of ACL tears is about  percent among athletes not practicing neuromuscular training as the clinical trials showed then the researchers concluded the cost of these injuries per player was quite high  In our model it worked out to something like  per player Dr Swart said Imagine if people collected that as a fee when kids signed up for club soccer or basketball  However neuromuscular training changed that calculus he continued dropping the likely incidence of the injuries to about  percent of the athletes More important for this study the cost of the training was negligible since several of the programs included in the analysis are available free on the Internet and require almost no equipment  According to the researchers calculations the cost of starting a neuromuscular training program averaged  per player per year which is so much cheaper than visiting an orthopedic surgeon said Dr Swart an orthopedic surgeon The cost was the same whether the training was directed at both genders or only at girls Those parents and coaches who find that number enticing can begin neuromuscular training with their charges quite easily Dr Swart said Neuromuscular training is just a better way to warm up he said  Most of the scientifically studied programs consist of about  to  minutes of exercises including marching jumping squatting and sidetoside shuffling that Dr Swart said help to wake up the brain and nervous system and get the entire body moving with sharper coordination The programs also emphasize landing with knees bent and in the proper alignment  Among the most thoroughly studied neuromuscular training options are the   which was developed by the Santa Monica Sports Medicine Foundation and the   created by the international governing body of soccer Both programs are free and coaches need no training to teach them to athletes  It is important though that athletes perform the exercises correctly and in the order prescribed by the programs Dr Swart said to avoid injuries during the training itself You can find stepbystep easytofollow videos of the workout routines for both the PEP program and the FIFA  program on each groups website A sample video from each program can also be viewed below Dr Swart and his colleagues also evaluated the costeffectiveness of screening young athletes to find those whose biomechanics place them at especially high risk of tearing an ACL and train only them But the costs of screening were too high to make it practical for youth leagues or high schools Instead Dr Swart said universal neuromuscular training for athletes involved in highrisk sports seemed to be costeffective and to significantly reduce the chance that you will be visiting his office this season  A sample video from the
