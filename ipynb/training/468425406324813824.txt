Ask anyone whos dealt with a crabby toddler at the end of the day Little kids need a lot of sleep The National Sleep Foundation says that  to yearolds for example    to  hours of shuteye a day Coming up short does more than put the whole family in a bad mood Studies   that both adults and kids who dont get enough sleep are more likely to carry extra pounds than those who do Researchers in Boston wanted to know whether that finding would hold for kids who regularly got lessthanideal amounts of sleep during their early years So they studied more than a thousand between the ages of  months and  years getting annual reports from parents on the amount of sleep  both at night and from daytime naps  the kids got They also collected information on height and weight And when the kids turned  researchers measured their overall and abdominal fat Thats important because belly fat   than fat elsewhere in the body The researchers found that getting lessthanrecommended amounts of sleep was associated with a higher BMI and higher amounts of overall and midsection fat For example after adjusting for factors including parental income education and TV habits a yearold who got less than  hours of sleep between the ages of  months and  years had  percent higher odds of being obese than a child who got more sleep as a small child The study is noteworthy because it tracks sleep issues over a period of several years says   a neuropsychologist at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center who has studied   and wasnt involved in this research The study cant tell whether the missed sleep actually caused the kids to put on fat Its possible that some factor the authors didnt account for was the real culprit But there are several theories that might tie curtailed sleep to obesity including the ebb and flow of hormones that control hunger Much of the research on mechanisms depends on findings in adults and additional factors may be at play in kids says   a pediatrician at MassGeneral Hospital for Children and lead author of the study For example a poor sleep routine at home also means that eating and meal patterns are probably also disrupted in those homes she says Until the link between sleep and weight is more fully understood theres no harm in trying to work with parents and young children to improve sleep says Taveras That includes a consistent bedtime removing hightech toys from the bedroom at night and   It cant hurt says Beebe Inadequate sleep has a whole host of negative consequences The results of the study were   by the journal
