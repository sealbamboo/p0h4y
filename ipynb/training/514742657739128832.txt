So far  people are believed to have died from   in Liberia alone according to the latest numbers from the World Health Organization The country has seen a  of increases in cases in just the past three weeks   Thats in large part because there is little or no outside medical help for residents who get sick there  In Monrovia the countrys crowded capital doors to hospitals and clinics are shut tight locked with thick padlocks Many health care workers in West Africa have lost their lives due to the way the virus spreads  through contact with bodily fluids from those who are infected On   urged the affected countries to give health care workers both the adequate security and safety equipment they need as well as appropriate education and training on infection control A new Ebola clinic opened in Monrovia this week but bodies lay on the ground outside its walls  Ambulances filled with Ebola patients some that have traveled seven hours to get there are not unloaded Without help to get them inside the patients fall in the dirt mere feet away from treatment Without help family members must care for these Ebola patients And without the proper safety equipment they too fall sick and Ebola continues to spread The virus forces the local dead body management teams to work  hours a day six days a week All for a paycheck of  to  a month Dressed from head to toe in white protective suits and thick goggles the burial teams try to stay safe but nothing can shield them from the unspeakable horrors theyve seen when they make their regular rounds On Friday Kiyee described what he saw when he entered a home I took the key and opened the door and went in and saw a monthold child licking on the mothers skin said Kiyee The mother was lying on her stomach She had died from Ebola The baby was searching for the mothers milk Right away I started shedding tears WHO said on Monday the overall death toll in the Ebola outbreak has risen to  in the five countries at the heart of the epidemic Sierra Leone Liberia Guinea Nigeria and Senegal  When people go out in public they are encouraged to take whatever precautions they can In Monrovia people get their temperatures taken wherever they go  at the grocery store the office and at church  A fever is one of the early symptoms of the disease At the little boys church in Kakata the pastor is both practical and philosophical about Ebola He has spent his career thinking deeply about death and what happens afterward When his congregation asked the Rev Victor King if hes afraid of death he said No but I dont want to die from Ebola At his church hes called off the part of the service where congregation members shake hands He tells them not to hug when they see each other and no one takes communion wine from the same chalice any more Many in his congregation were at first displeased when he ended that practice he said Communion is the high point of the church service and it is central to their tradition of worship But he believes the congregation like many in Liberia are starting to better understand the disease and how it spreads After services the congregation files out the door and stops at a container the pastor has placed right outside   The container looks like it should hold a sports drink Instead it contains bleach for them to wash their hands To a person the congregation stops and takes their time to wash up thoroughly Anthony Kallah a teacher is one of them   We are all afraid Kallah said This is a threatening disease
