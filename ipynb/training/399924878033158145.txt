Its not just that she watched her fathers mental faculties deteriorate over the past  years or that her aunt and grandmother also succumbed to the disease Kolesar participated in a clinical trial that revealed to her that she has one copy of the APOE genetic variant This gene has been linked to up to  of Alzheimers cases   Screening for forms of APOE isnt part of routine medical practice But Kolesar was curious about her risk so she volunteered to participate in a research study that tested participants for APOE variants Alzheimers disease has no cure or effective longterm treatment Many drug trials have failed to show lasting delays or reversals of symptoms in people who already have dementia  Thats why scientists are exploring what signatures Alzheimers disease might create in the body before symptoms ever begin Besides genes such as APOE they are looking at proteins associated with plaques and tangles in the brain  The hope is that understanding both risk factors and the timing of the development of disease pathologies will lead to successful treatments in people who havent begun to show any impairments in memory or thinking  But to set up human experiments aimed at prevention researchers need to identify a whole new category of patient Those in the preclinical stage of Alzheimers By performing brain scans and testing cerebrospinal fluid scientists can single out individuals likely to show symptoms of Alzheimers within up to  years Thats not about genetics per se its about the appearance of biomarkers before symptoms begin An important ethical question is emerging Should people without symptoms be told that they are indeed preclinical Is it useful or meaningful to know that you could be  years away from the inevitable  Medically and socially we have to get ready for this era of using biomarkers and imaging for early detection said Rudy Tanzi a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and leading Alzheimers researcher  An ongoing study at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis does not inform participants of the genetic or biomarker risk profile for Alzheimers disease The Washington University Adult Children Study aims to study these risks but researchers dont think participants individual results are appropriate to give them because even the researchers entirely arent sure what they mean This is a hot topic of discussion amongst the participants and the investigators at an annual breakfast meeting with participants said Dr David Holtzman a neurologist at the medical school Weve been doing a study the last year to try to determine the best way to proceed Should we make the biomarker results available to them or not  Currently the answer is no  All of the study volunteers begin the study cognitively normal between  and  Participants are enrolled according to two criteria Those who have at least one biological parent with an Alzheimers diagnosis before  and those who had two parents who lived to at least  without developing Alzheimers  Researchers are presenting the latest findings from this study at the Society for Neuroscience conference in San Diego this weekend  In this study participants cerebrospinal fluid is tested for decreases in betaamyloid  suggestive of plaque buildup in the brain  and tau proteins which are associated with neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal degeneration They also get a genetic test for APOE status the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimers The idea is to follow participants over many years to monitor changes in these key biomarkers and see how they vary in relation to APOE status and future cognitive symptoms  Consistent with their hypothesis lead researcher Courtney Sutphen and colleagues found that people with at least one copy of APOE are likely to develop biological signatures of Alzheimers pathologies earlier in life than those who dont have any APOE copies  Its possible that some changes in the APOEpositive group begin even before  researchers said but that would have to be tested with younger participants  That doesnt mean that APOE positivity guarantees the early formation of Alzheimerslinked biomarkers  betaamyloid and tau proteins  or that these biomarkers guarantee symptoms of Alzheimers  Thats partly why the Adult Children Study does not disclose biomarker results to the participants said Anne Fagan a research professor in the department of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine Perhaps even more importantly theres also the possibility that if you tell someone theyre APOEnegative they think theyre out of the woods she said And thats not true either Many many people who are APOEnegative get the disease So knowing ones genotype is not really clinically meaningful at this point In perhaps five or  years though if a drug exists to prevent the disease before the onset symptoms thats when the biomarker information will become clinically relevant she said Additionally knowing ones APOE genotype may provide information regarding the timing of the development of such pathologies On the other hand other researchers say telling study participants their results would yield some benefit Theyve not advocating for widespread testing of the general population but in the context of a study some researchers say knowledge can be power  Dr Reisa Sperling professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School agrees that theres not enough evidence to support widespread testing of Alzheimers biomarkers But shes leading a drug trial that tells participants upfront about whether their PET scans show accumulation of betaamyloid in the brain indicative of plaques  To me it makes sense to learn whether you have amyloid or not because you have the opportunity to come into a trial to try to do something about it she said  The trial sponsored by Eli Lilly is called the  prevention clinical trial  or A for short This will be the first trial to test a drug designed to clear amyloid from the brain in older people who do not show symptoms of Alzheimers Sperling said  The drug showed a modest signal that it was slowing cognitive decline in people with mild dementia in phase  trials Sperling said Recruitment for this next phase in people without symptoms starts in December Sperling is looking for  people ages  to  to participate in a month trial  Each A clinical trial location has to identify and train someone to discuss amyloid results with participants before and after they receive them If volunteers are positive for amyloid accumulation they can move forward with trying the drug  Ultimately whats needed for preventing Alzheimers is the equivalent of a statin which lowers cholesterol to prevent heart problems before they occur says Harvards Tanzi whos also working on a drug trial But in the absence of a proven prevention method its debatable whether anyone without symptoms should seek out biomarker testing  Im not sure that were socially ready for the power of biomarkers he said But if someone wants to know its done right and they can deal with the fact that theres no therapy but theyre willing to make lifestyle changes even though there are no guarantees it could be a good thing  Besides empowering people to sign up to take an experimental drug knowing biomarker status might also encourage people to make healthy lifestyle choices Tanzi said Exercise intellectual stimulation and a Mediterranean diet  which emphasizes fish fruits and vegetables  have all been linked to improving dementia risk  But theres no guarantee that anything will slow the progression of Alzheimers down  As people become aware of their Alzheimers biomarkers Tanzi also envisions the need for policy changes to protect the privacy of that information There could be a Biomarker Information Nondiscrimination Act similar to the   that prohibits genetic information in insurance and employment  He also sees a need for biomarker counselors to advise people of what their results mean  and how much uncertainty there is about their significance  in addition to psychological counselors who will help people working through these issues  Its not going to work if we dont have enough people to counsel scientifically and psychologically he said  More than anything Anne Kolesars APOE result confirmed what she already suspected given her family history She has also signed up for the   an online community of people who want to learn about and potentially join prevention trials  While participating in  she was asked how her outlook on the future been affected by the knowledge that shes positive for APOE She answered that if she felt herself deteriorating from Alzheimers she would seriously contemplate suicide I think that the burden is more obviously its with the living Its with those who are still capable because they have the emotional and financial and potentially the physical burden she said I just dont see any point in making a burden when theres not a lot a great deal left for me But right now mentally Kolesar says she feels clearer than at many points in time over the past  years She gave birth to her son at  and went straight from mush mind of motherhood to the mush mind of menopause Shes retired but not sitting idly  she is planning to travel to Vietnam alone in January and is learning Vietnamese  Language learning is her hedge against Alzheimers she says referencing research suggesting that keeping the mind active might delay the onset of Alzheimers  But her optimism on this point is sobered because her father did crossword puzzles too More than anything else the part I find terrifying is that period when you start forgetting things but you still know who you are she said How did that feel to him How is that going to feel to me if it happens Its a foggy area of Kolesars possible future which science cant yet say is certain
