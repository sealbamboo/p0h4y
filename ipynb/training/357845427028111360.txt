Long distance relationships never work the colloquial wisdom goes Or rather theyll work for a while Youll trade a few texts Skype a few times maybe even visit once in a while But the heartache of being apart and living separate lives will start to wear on you and soon enough things will fizzle out  Not true according to a small but growing number of social science studies Longdistance relationships are in many ways stronger than relationships between couples who live together or close by shows a new study published today in the Journal of Communication  While the public and the science community hold a pessimistic view towards long distance LD this research provides compelling support for the opposite side  long distance is not necessarily inferior to geographically close dating says Crystal Jiang an assistant professor of communication at City University of Hong Kong  Jiangs research found that people in longdistance relationships reported feeling emotionally closer to their partners than people in relationships with people who were literally  geographically  closer Longdistance couples also reported sharing more with their partners and feeling like their partners were really listening  You always hear people say longdistance relationships suck or longdistance relationships never work out Jiang says Indeed our culture particularly American culture emphasizes being together physically and frequent facetoface contact for close relationships but longdistance relationships clearly stand against all these values Its especially reassuring to hear this now as so many couples today are living apart Three million Americans live apart from their spouses for reasons other than divorce or discordance Jiang says Its a trend thats has spawned the term commuter marriages in   reflecting the new realities of tough economic times  youve got to go where the job is after all And many college students not surprisingly live apart from their partners  up to  percent are in a longdistance relationship according to one estimate in a  report  It gets harder to estimate how many nonmarried noncollege students are in longdistance relationships but according to one estimate  percent of dating relationships were longdistance according to the   Yes such a thing once existed sadly it has closed  Last January Nicole Kendrot whos now  moved back to her home town of Rochester NY and decided to give online dating a try She soon met Richard Smith who lived in Rochester and the two started dating But just two months into their relationship Kendrot was offered a web designer job in New York City  miles and a sixhour drive from Rochester with the company she was freelancing for She felt like she had to take the job and moved in May of last year Since then she and Smith have been dating long distance  It hasnt been as hard as I expected it to be says Smith The couple talk at least once every day via Google Hangout which means they get to see each others faces every day too They sometimes use the Google service to just literally hang out  they tore through the first three seasons of Arrested Development on Netflix together that way  In the new study  heterosexual dating couples independently completed online surveys every day for one week Their ages ranged from  to  but the average age was  and most were college students About  percent of the couples considered their relationship committed or serious and the average length of their relationships was  months On average the longdistance couples had been separated for about  months  Researchers asked them to track their interactions with their partners how often they communicated how long they talked and what they used to do it  phone calls video chats instant messages email texting or seeing each other facetoface The couples in longdistance relationships reported interacting with each other a little less often every day than the couples who lived close by But the separated couples reported experiencing greater intimacy  or feeling closer to their partners as intimacy is defined here  than the couples who were geographically closer  Thats definitely been the case for Smith and Kendrot Not only does it force you to keep in touch it forces you to make an effort to do that Smith says In other words if youre dating someone nearby it gets easy to take the relationship for granted and to maybe not put in as much work as you should he says But if youre in a longdistance relationship for a year its pretty certain you really like that person he continues If you dont put in a good amount of effort you just stop talking to each other Kendrot agrees Every day you make that choice to be in it says Kendrot who next week will be moving back to Rochester to be with Smith full time She was able to work things out with her job so she can work remotely Its not the hardest thing in the world but its definitely not an easy situation The study also found that people in longdistance relationships reported being more open with their partners and that their partners were in return more open with them something that sounds right to Ally Cuneo  whose husband Michael  was deployed in May  You have to have more trust in each other with distance says Cuneo who lives in Kailua Hawaii She and her husband whos a Marine have been married for nearly two years during which hes been deployed twice Were completely open and honest with each other Theres nothing we hide there are no secrets she says But the reason you see your faraway lady or gentlemanlover in such a rosy light may be precisely   he or she is far away points out Dr Gail Saltz a New York City psychiatrist and frequent TODAY contributor This new study and others before it have shown that long distance partners tend to idealize each other or see them in unrealistically positive terms   Its easier to hold on to this idealized view of the other person when youre not with them all the time Saltz says That idealization can make the reunion difficult once the honeymoon vibes have worn off Cuneo says last time her husband returned after a long deployment she had to remind herself Hes been gone for eight months hes not going to remember I like the dishwasher loaded a certain way  But its a generally positive takeaway message here for couples in longdistance relationships Its so hard to be away from each other but your relationship really can take it Jiang says In fact past research has shown that longdistance couples are no more likely to break up than geographically close couples  If being geographically apart is inevitable people should not despair Jiang says Longdistance relationships are not doomed to fail she says at least not more easily than relationships between two people who live close by I think such findings give people confidence given longdistance romance is much more common nowadays she says
