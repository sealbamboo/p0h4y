Health care workers hands are notorious for spreading germs in hospitals but a new study suggests that the stethoscopes around their necks may be just as bad Researchers in Switzerland found that the diaphragms of stethoscopes  the part that a doctor presses against your chest  were more contaminated with the superbug MRSA than the palm of the hand And if the stethoscopes arent disinfected between uses  theyre typically cleaned less than once a month if at all research shows  theyre just as likely to contaminate the next patient as unwashed hands they said We consider them as potentially significant vectors of transmission wrote experts at the University of Geneva Hospitals including Dr Didier Pittet who frequently studies hospital hand hygiene In the study published Thursday in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings Pittet and colleagues measured bacteria collected after exams Using results from three doctors and  patients they tested four spots on examiners hands  fingertips back and two places on the palm  and two sites on the stethoscopes the diaphragm and the tube As expected the fingertips were the most contaminated with both general bacteria and methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA the superbug responsible for potentially lifethreatening infections They showed a median of  aerobic colony counts and  MRSA colonyforming units both measures of contamination But the stethoscope diaphragms were in second place with  ACCs and seven MRSA CFUs The fleshy part of the palm under the little finger had only  ACCs and just two MRSA CFUs Of course just because the bacteria were present doesnt mean they actually caused infections Thats too hard to prove experts say But the study does add to evidence that health workers should regularly clean their tools said Dr Dan Diekema president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America If youre rounding from patient to patient when they put the alcohol sanitizer on their hands theyll kind of bathe the stethoscope as well or use an alcohol wipe he said On bare skin with a healthy patient it probably wouldnt be a problem said Elaine Larson a professor at the Columbia School of Nursing But on someone with a fresh incision or other skin break it could be serious It just makes common sense she said I wouldnt particularly want a stethoscope used on me when it was known to have been used on someone with MRSA
