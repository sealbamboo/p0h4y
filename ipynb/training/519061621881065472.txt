The Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine has been awarded to three scientists who discovered the brains GPS system UKbased researcher Prof John OKeefe as well as MayBritt Moser and Edvard Moser share the award They discovered how the brain knows where we are and is able to navigate from one place to another  Their findings may help explain why Alzheimers disease patients cannot recognise their surroundings  The discoveries have solved a problem that has occupied philosophers and scientists for centuries the Nobel Assembly said Prof OKeefe from University College London discovered the first part of the brains internal positioning system in  On hearing about winning the prize he said Im totally delighted and thrilled Im still in a state of shock its the highest accolade you can get His work showed that a set of nerve cells became activated whenever a rat was in one location in a room A different set of cells were active when the rat was in a different area Prof OKeefe argued these place cells  located in the hippocampus  formed a map within the brain  He will be having a quiet celebration this evening and says the prize money should be used for the common good In  husband and wife team MayBritt and Edvard discovered a different part of the brain which acts more like a nautical chart  These grid cells are akin to lines of longitude and latitude helping the brain to judge distance and navigate  They work at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim Prof MayBritt Moser said This is crazy this is such a great honour for all of us and all the people who have worked with us and supported us The Nobel committee said the combination of grid and place cells constitutes a comprehensive positioning system an inner GPS in the brain  They added This system is affected in several brain disorders including dementia and Alzheimers disease A better understanding of neural mechanisms underlying spatial memory is therefore important and the discoveries of place and grid cells have been a major leap forward to advance this endeavour Dr Colin Lever from the University of Durham worked in Prof OKeefes laboratory for ten years and has already dreamt on two occasions that his former mentor had won the award  He told the BBC He absolutely deserves the Nobel Prize he created a cognitive revolution his research was really forward thinking in suggesting animals create representations of the external world inside their brains Place cells help us map our way around the world but in humans at least they form part of the spatiotemporal scaffold in our brains that supports our autobiographical memory The world was not ready for his original report of place cells in  people didnt believe that place was what best characterised these cells so there was no great fanfare at that time  But his work on hippocampal spatial mapping created the background for discovering grid cells and with grid cells the world was prepared and we all thought wow this is big news   James Rothman Randy Schekman and Thomas Sudhof for their discovery of how     Two pioneers of stem cell research  John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka  were awarded the Nobel after     Bruce Beutler Jules Hoffmann and Ralph Steinman shared the prize after revolutionising the understanding of     Robert Edwards for   which led to the first test tube baby in July    Elizabeth Blackburn Carol Greider and Jack Szostak for finding the   Also commenting on the announcement Prof John Stein form the University of Oxford said This is great news and well deserved   I remember how great was the scoffing in the early s when John first described place cells   Now like so many ideas that were at first highly controversial people say Well thats obvious
