When Christine Rowan gave birth prematurely in August her new baby was having problems breathing So Rowan brought her daughter Zoe to the   in Washington DC for genetic testing Its funny because when we first had the testing done we didnt even really think about the fact the testing was going to lay out all of her DNA says Rowan  who lives in Northern Virginia But while Rowan and her husband were waiting for the results questions started popping into their heads If we have all this information when do we tell Zoe You know do we wait until shes a specific age and say Oh by the way we have all your DNA  Do you want to see what doctors have found  Rowan says Or do we kind of keep that to ourselves Or would it be better to just only get the information we really need and then genuinely not know so that we dont have to walk down that road We dont really have that answer at this moment Rowans questions are at the heart of an intense debate over the prospect of using a test known as   on babies Genome sequencing deciphers an individuals entire genetic code The price of doing this has been dropping quickly raising the possibility that sequencing can become more common than ever before That includes the possibility of sequencing all babies when theyre born Sequencing an individuals genome at birth would enable doctors to screen for far more genetic conditions than they do now The hope is that it would catch more rare genetic conditions early and help doctors prevent more complications and many deaths Instead of screening for currently something like  conditions it would allow you to screen for hundreds if not thousands of conditions at birth says Dr Alan Guttmacher director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development But thats just the beginning Sequencing lays out a persons entire genetic blueprint So sequencing a newborn could spot babies prone to conditions such as obesity diabetes heart attacks or cancer and provide all kinds of clues about how to help them live longer healthier lives One could imagine a day where knowing someones entire genome sequence at birth you could really begin to think about structuring their health care their dietary choices their exercise choices  early in life in a way that would have an impact on truly lifelong health Guttmacher says But this idea is also raising a lot of concerns In theory it sounds absolutely fantastic says sociologist   who studies newborn screening at UCLA The reality is that theres a lot of uncertainty about each of the data points you receive So if people start making health decisions or lifeordeath decisions based on information that is so tenuous at this point I think this could indeed be a nightmare scenario A nightmare because parents could easily become overwhelmed with confusing or ambiguous information about the health of their baby during one of the most sensitive times in their lives Theres plenty of evidence that parents already often overreact to the relatively small amount of data that theyre getting from little spots of blood collected at birth Bioethicist   of the University of Louisville says the tests can lead to socalled vulnerable child syndrome These children are viewed as medically vulnerable and medically frail Rothstein says And so while all the other kids are riding bikes and climbing trees these kids are sort of sitting in a corner So they cant even enjoy a normal childhood And what if the sequencing reveals that a child has genes that may make them prone to diseases that may not show up for decades  and that they cant do anything about anyway A lot of people just dont want to know that sort of thing such as their risk for incurable diseases like Alzheimers and Huntingtons says   a bioethicist at the National Institutes of Health Adults in large numbers choose not to know their status for those disorders Berkman says And so you could imagine a parent wanting to know whether or not their child is going to get Alzheimers and then telling the child at some point But then when the child is an adult this knowledge has changed their life in a way that they wished they could have lived without it Despite all this theres talk about sequencing even earlier in life when a fetus is still in the womb Scientists in California and Washington   this summer that they had done this for the first time Sequencing could help pregnant couples make important decisions says the University of Washingtons   one of the researchers Parents could elect for termination of the pregnancy in connection with the diagnosis of a particular disease says Shendure In other circumstances there may be opportunities for treatment of the fetus during pregnancy as well as for treatment after birth But this raises all the same worries as sequencing newborns  overwhelming parents with fuzzy but terrifying results casting a dark shadow over the future of their child And when youre talking about doing this to a fetus in the womb Berkman says all that could have even graver consequences Our worry is that parents are going to be faced with this deluge of genetic information about the potential health of their unborn child Parents may let their anxiety and confusion affect their reproductive choices in ways that they would later regret Berkman says There are also concerns that parents might try to use sequencing to pick and choose babies who would be say good athletes or get good grades Parents will take that information that computer readout maybe go home and say I want this child or I dont want this child  says   a bioethicist at Dartmouth University A parent may decide I want a child of lighter skin tone I want a girl with blond hair and blue eyes and this child doesnt have it and so on and so on Proponents of sequencing acknowledge there are legitimate worries So some like Guttmacher say its important to scrutinize the technology and air these concerns now As with any new technology we should try to use it to benefit people but when its not very clear what its exact impacts going to be we should go slowly We should study it Guttmacher says For her part Rowan and her husband decided it was OK for doctors to look through Zoes DNA for a gene associated with her sleep issues But thats it The couple didnt want doctors poking around much more than that Im just not willing to go down that road and kind of open up what I would call a can of worms I just dont want to create a sense of fear in myself or my daughter Rowan says It turned out Zoe doesnt have the sleep apnea gene or any other obvious genetic syndromes that could be affecting her breathing Shes doing better though and was able to go home a few weeks ago Im a firm believer we only have the grace for today We dont have grace to deal with what might be down the road  years from now Rowan says Ill have the grace Ill need once Im there But right now I only have enough grace for today Tomorrow has enough worries
