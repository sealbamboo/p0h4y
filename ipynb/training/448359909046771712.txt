The US Supreme Court hears arguments Tuesday in the latest challenge to the Obama health care overhaul This time the issue is whether forprofit corporations citing religious objections may refuse to provide some or potentially all contraceptive services in health plans offered to employees It is a case that touches lots of hotbutton issues In enacting the ACA Congress required large employers to provide basic preventive care for employees That turned out to include all  contraceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration Under the law religious nonprofits were exempted from this requirement but forprofit corporations were not The lead plaintiff before the court is Hobby Lobby Inc a chain of  arts and crafts stores with  employees The owners are conservative Christians who object to certain methods of birth control  IUDs and morningafter pills  because they can interfere with the creation of life once an egg is fertilized We believe that the principles that are taught scripturally is what we should operate our lives by  and so we cannot be a part of taking life explains Hobby Lobby President Steve Green Its our rights that are being infringed upon to require us to do something against our conscience adds CEO and founder David Green The government however points to a long line of Supreme Court cases that take a contrary view declaring that the court has never found a forprofit company to be a religious organization for purposes of federal law Indeed the Justice Department says in its briefs that the government would be unable to function if religious beliefs could be the basis for corporations refusing to comply with generally applied laws  be they child labor laws immunization laws laws that mandate serving racially mixed groups or income tax laws that require everyone to pay no matter how the government spends the money Furthermore the government argues that Hobby Lobby in claiming it is exempt from some requirements of the health care law is shifting the burden to its employees This is an earned benefit not a freebie And its an earned benefit to which women contribute their share of the premium said former Clinton administration Solicitor General Walter Dellinger who filed a brief siding with the government Here the  employees of the Hobby Lobby corporate enterprise arent and should not be expected to share the religious beliefs of the Greens What you really have is one family attempting to utilize their economic leverage to impose their religious beliefs on others Dellinger continued Not so says former Bush administration Solicitor General Paul Clement who will argue Tuesdays case in the Supreme Court on behalf of Hobby Lobby He observes that the Constitution and federal statutes bar only the government from intruding on the free exercise of religion The only government action here is the government action that forces the Greens to provide these contraceptive devices that they find morally objectionable he says The federal government for the first time has decided that they are going to force one person to pay for another persons not just  hip replacement but something as religiously sensitive as contraception and abortifacients Tuesdays case involves not just the Constitution but a statute and a somewhat convoluted Supreme Court history Until  the court applied a tough test to examine laws that disadvantaged peoples religious beliefs Then in  the justices changed direction In a case involving penalties for the use of peyote as part of a Native American religious ceremony the court ruled that as long as a generally applicable law  that is a law that applies generally to all citizens  is neutrally applied it is constitutional even though it may have some unhappy consequences for some believers Congess hated the decision and in  passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act Under the act if a law imposes a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion it has to meet a high threshold for justification Hobby Lobby owners contend that the ACA contraception mandate imposes a substantial burden on them because failure to comply results in big fines   million a year for Hobby Lobby if it opts out of providing insurance altogether Supporters of the mandate counter that  million may be a lot of money but it is less than the company currently spends on insurance Of course Hobby Lobby points out that it wants to provide insurance that having insurance fits in with both its religious ideas and its good business practices The government replies that when you are a commercial enterprise you may have to make choices Here either provide the insurance or pay a fine and let your employees go to the health care exchange to buy insurance that may include public subsidies The Justice Department cites as an example a Supreme Court decision involving an Amish cabinetmaker He was required to pay Social Security taxes for his employees even though he viewed such payments as against his religion and even though the Social Security law at the time had significant exemptions The company argues however that the mandate is not generally applicable since the law temporarily grandfathers out health plans that have not changed since the law was adopted We would never have said well we dont want employers to discriminate on the basis of race but as long as they continue their existing employment practices they can get away with it We would never have said that because that prohibition was viewed by the government itself as absolutely compelling says Clement Finally Hobby Lobby says the government has no overriding justification for the contraception mandate This isnt a case about access to contraception Its not like the families here are taking action to prevent their employees from getting these devices if they want to do it with their own money and on their own time Clement says Not so replies the government noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that the availability of contraception is a matter of public health necessity The government points to studies that have shown onethird of women would change their method of contraception if cost was not a factor and that the most effective methods are the most expensive IUDs are  times more effective than the pill given average use and  times more effective than condoms But IUDs are also the most expensive method costing between  and  in one lump sum The government also argues that requiring effective contraception and counseling in insurance plans is justified as a matter of gender equality For an employer to say I will cover all the basic essential health needs for men but I am picking and choosing for women and I am simply going to take out contraception or specific forms of medically approved contraception it is sex discrimination says Marsha Greenberger copresident of the National Womens Law Center It is sex discrimination she argues because such selectivity regarding an essential part of womens health care costs forces women to pay more for their care The Hobby Lobby corporation and its owners counter that the simple answer to these arguments is to have the government pay for contraception The government replies that is no answer Otherwise the government would end up paying for everything A decision is expected by summer
