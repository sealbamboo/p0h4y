The number of uninsured in America dropped by 3.8 million in early 2014, new federal figures show, in the first government analysis of how the Affordable Care Act has changed U.S. insurance-coverage rates.. The percentage of people without health insurance went from an average of 14.4% in 2013 to 13.1% over the first three months of 2014, when most of the law was rolled out, according to a survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics to be released Tuesday.
