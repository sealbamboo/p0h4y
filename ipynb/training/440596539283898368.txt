People who pay attention to hospice care so often a godsend for the dying and their families have noticed and wondered about two trends in recent years  What began as a grassroots movement to improve endoflife care is becoming a business In  only  percent of hospices were forprofit operations by last year they dominated the industry representing  percent of hospices  Weve also seen that hospice patients are increasingly likely to be disenrolled before they die Once this was a rare event the greater problem was that patients waited until the eleventh hour to enroll subjecting themselves and their families to unnecessary stress and suffering Now about  percent of hospice patients are discharged alive the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission has found Some may have moved or changed their minds about treatment but the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization said its surveys show that hospices not patients initiate a great majority of discharges In other words   as corporate bottom lines have come to matter more Are these two developments connected Weve had our suspicions  but now we have data A study published recently in JAMA Internal Medicine has found that   than nonprofits among other disparities Weve shown that differences by ownership affect patient care services provided and the larger community said the lead author Melissa Aldridge a health researcher at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and a veteran investigator of hospice care Using a representative national survey of nearly  hospice organizations conducted in  and  the team found that forprofit hospices discharged  percent of patients alive and nonprofits  percent These percentages lower than those cited by the advisory commission may have climbed since but the association is clear The study revealed other differences too What we see is that forprofits tend to enroll patients with longer lengths of stay Dr Aldridge said Theyre also more likely to serve patients in nursing homes and assisted living facilities while nonprofits are more often working in private homes These factors are related Dr Aldridge explained  and their common characteristic is increased profit Stick with me a bit while I explain Medicare reimburses hospices at a fixed daily rate regardless of how long it cares for a patient But some days cost more than others The first few days meeting with the patient and family setting up the plan of care these are highintensity days Dr Aldridge said Similarly as patients near death and hospice staffs visit more frequently costs rise The stable days in the middle are when forprofit hospices can make money if there are more such days theres higher profitability she said The profit motive also may figure in the greater number of patients in nursing homes and assisted living who are served by forprofit hospices Employees in these institutions already provide considerable routine care  bathing providing meals changing linens And hospice staffers dont have to travel as much as when they visit people in farflung houses The cost of caring for that individual may be much less expensive than for a patient at home Dr Aldridge added Medicare is watching all hospices regardless of ownership increasingly closely and may demand repayment if their average cost of caring for patients exceeds an aggregate annual cap last years was  The patterns in this Mount SinaiYale study suggest that as   forprofit hospices aggressively recruit patients keep them enrolled longer then evict them when costs begin to endanger reimbursement Its telling for instance that  percent of the forprofits in the sample exceeded the Medicare cap at least once in the previous five years Only  percent of nonprofits did And among the forprofits that exceeded the cap disenrollment was even higher   percent Hospice executives point out correctly that mortality is hard to predict with some terminal diseases  dementia for instance Its also true that with good care some patients improve for a while But previous research by the Mount SinaiYale team shows that   These are not people who are getting better Dr Aldridge said Theyre just dying too slowly Moreover dumping those cancer patients from hospice actually cost Medicare money the earlier study showed Once discharged they were far more likely to wind up in emergency rooms and intensive care units at great expense And they were more apt to die in hospitals something they presumably hoped to avoid by seeking hospice care in the first place Dr Aldridge and her colleagues looked at other differences too They found that forprofits are much less likely to serve as training sites for endoflife care The number of trained physicians nurses and aides in hospice and palliative care is nowhere near the amount we need for an aging population Dr Aldridge said Hospices acting as training sites is crucial for the future One possible bright spot Forprofit hospices do more outreach to lowincome and minority communities long a concern among hospice advocates  But for the terminally ill and their families the disenrollment issue seems troubling Some hospices now discharge  percent or more of their patients withdrawing the services theyve come to rely on Its very jarring Dr Aldridge said She suggests requiring hospices to publish their discharge rates and their reasons perhaps on a Medicare website like   Families sometimes dont recognize that multiple hospices operate in most parts of the country now and that they can choose among them If they could determine which hospices were likeliest to bounce their patients wed no longer see these substantial differences Dr Aldridge said In the meantime what dying person or his family wants to undertake comparison shopping But enrolling with a nonprofit may lower the risk of being discharged from hospice three weeks before death
