When it comes to reducing Medicare spending asking wealthier seniors to pay more is one of the few areas where Democrats have shown a willingness to even consider the subject I do believe there should be means testing And those of us with higher income in retirement should pay more said Sen Dick Durbin DIll on last Sundays   That could be part of the solution Robert Moffit of the conservative   says it will have to be part of the solution if Medicare is to withstand the onslaught of  million baby boomers If we boomers insist on what we are entitled to under the current law we are going to guarantee the shrinkage of economic opportunities for our kids and our grandchildren he said I think its a very very bad future for this country if we do not get federal entitlements under control Besides making the rich pay more would hardly be breaking new ground Medicare already charges wealthy people more and poor people less We already dont have a common standard social insurance system where everybody gets the same benefits Moffit says We already have means testing Indeed as part of a  Medicare law Congress imposed   for the programs optional Part B on wealthier beneficiaries And then in  as part of the Affordable Care Act Congress asked wealthier beneficiaries to pay more for their   Meanwhile at the other end of the income scale says Moffit lowincome Medicare beneficiaries get special breaks The very poorest get coverage through   And even those with moderate incomes are   in years when theres no or only a small increase in Social Security When premiums go up if premium increases exceed their costofliving adjustment for Social Security theyre held harmless he said They dont pay the higher premiums So Moffit thinks theres plenty of precedent and plenty of room to increase the amount or lower the income threshold for betteroff beneficiaries Given the size of the debt its probably a good idea for Congress to simply say to the rest of taxpayers Look were not going to require you to continue to subsidize the wealthiest retirees Thats probably not the best policy  he said Those people who can afford to pay more for their health care should do it But that sentiment is far from universal For one thing wealthy means something far different when it comes to Medicare than it does when it comes to income taxes Higher income is defined as people with incomes of  or more and obviously in the tax world were talking about people with  in income or higher said Patricia Neuman of the nonpartisan   Then theres the idea that Medicare premiums are the only thing most seniors pay when it comes to health care Rep   DPa who has worked on Medicare issues says thats hardly the case They get Medigap they get supplemental insurance There are copays she said referring to the idea that seniors tend to have both lower incomes and higher health care costs than most other Americans She added We want to make sure that we dont do anything that reverses that universality or the benefits and hurt beneficiaries Theres still one more complication The Affordable Care Act imposed one other new Medicare tax on the wealthy thats just about to take effect Starting in January people with incomes over  will have to pay the Medicare payroll tax   Thats one more place budget negotiators wont be able to go to mine more money from Medicare
