Two years after the calorie content of menu items first started appearing on the menus of Seattle chain restaurants just  in  customers who frequented those establishments said they used that nutritional information to guide their consumption choices a new study finds In addition roughly  in  customers acknowledged they didnt even notice the new information But before you conclude that posting the caloric value of restaurant food is a virtually worthless exercise consider this In the months just before Seattles calorieposting experiment began only  of customers eating at chain outlets said they took the calorie content of their favorite foods into account when making their orders And  reported that they even saw calorie counts on serving boards and menus Thats actually progress over    years Seattles calorieposting experiment tripled the percentage of people who saw useful new information on menusfrom  in May  to  in December  In the same period the proportion of consumers who let those calorie counts inform their ordering decisions also tripledfrom  to  The new research   Tuesday in the American Journal of Public Health is not the first to suggest that calorie postingnow the law of the landhas failed to wean a nation of fastfood diners off their triplebacon cheeseburgers or prompted a boycott of calorific coffee concoctions But it does offer the longest look available at this point in the evolution of Americans behavior when they are provided some key information about the food choices before them While calorie posting is now required by federal law at most chain restaurants and eateries across the country King County Washwhich encompasses the Seattle metropolitan areawas among the first local jurisdictions in the US to require it Only New York City came before King County inÂ adopting a regulation requiring most chain restaurants coffee shops and snack bars to post the calorie contents of its menu offerings where ordering customers could see them The King County Board of Health adopted the new regulations in March  and they were broadly implemented on Jan     The new research found troubling disparities among King County diners responses to calorie posting Compared with white affluent and better educated residents the study found that minority populations people with low incomes and those with a high school education or less were not as likely to take posted calories into account when ordering Women and respondents who were married or partnered were also more likely to take posted calories into account when making their orders Though there was no broad divide among different populations before the calorie posting initiative began respondents who had household incomes over  were more than twice as likely as those with incomes less than  vs to consider posted calories when placing an order Compared with those with a high school diploma or less college graduates were also more than twice as likely to do so  to  Those who are white were quicker to acknowledge that the new information influenced their decisions than were respondents who identified themselves as nonwhite or Latino By   said that they took into account an items posted calorie content in deciding what to order Among those identifying as nonwhite or Latino  did Those disparities said the studys lead author were not surprising But she added they did underscore that researchers and public health officials must focus more on how best to inform the choices of minority populations those with less money to spend and those with more limited knowledge about nutrition The good news is that over time the impact of menu labeling grew among consumers in all those groups said Roxana Chen a social research scientist with the SeattleKing County Office of Public Health All subgroups did experience increases in awareness and use of the posted calorie information said Chen who led the research project What we see is that all boats were raised but they werent raised equally Its not to say that people of color or lowereducation groups didnt benefit They just didnt benefit as much as did other groups who had better use of that information
