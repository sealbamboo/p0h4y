With an estimated  million baby boomers infected with hepatitis C the disease has reached   among Americans age  to  Doctors can now cure about  percent of hepatitis C cases but the drugs side effects can be severe And many Americans are still left with a disease that can cause liver failure and cancer So doctors have been desperate for better treatment options One of the drugs in the pipeline called miravirsen may be able to stop the virus with little side effects doctors from University Health Network in Toronto Canada reported Wednesday Their findings   in  are preliminary  the doctors gave the drug to just  patients for about a month Another  patients in the study were given a placebo But the study is still drawing attention because it offers proofofconcept for a whole new class of drugs called   RNAi drugs work differently than traditional antivirals and antibiotics And some scientists think they may have the potential to treat many illnesses including the big killers cancer and heart disease Traditional drugs are small chemicals that bind directly to the pathogens machinery In contrast RNAi drugs are little fragments of RNA or DNA that act like sponges inside the cell They mop up other RNA molecules that a virus or cancer cell needs to survive The pharmaceutical industry has been working for decades to get RNAi drugs to work says   of Harvard Medical School who wasnt involved in the current study At first there was wild enthusiasm  and billions of dollars she tells Shots Hundreds of companies became involved because these drugs could be a whole new class of therapeutics for all kinds of diseases But enthusiasm and money waned over time as companies realized it wasnt going to be easy to get these drugs to work Pharmaceutical giants like Roche and Novartis pulled the plug on milliondollar programs back in  the journal     But a few companies stayed the course And recently there have been hints of success In January the Food and Drug Administration   the first RNAi drug Kynamro brand name mipomersen sodium to help people with an extreme type of high cholesterol Now the current study on miravirsen offers hope for hepatitis C Its the first example of really strong clinical evidence that the RNAi therapies are going to work in people Lieberman says Its too soon to say how effective miravirsen is compared to current hepatitis C treatments says   who led the study The goal of the current trial was to figure out how much miravirsen is needed to stop the virus temporarily  not its overall effectiveness That will require a bigger study Four of the nine patients who got the highest dose of miravirsen temporarily cleared the virus after five injections That compares very well to current treatments Janssen says But unlike many medications available now the RNAi drug works on all types of hepatitis C even those that are tough to treat And the shortterm side effects are minimal  a rash and pain at the injection site Still Janssen and his team dont know what the longterm effects could be and exactly how to combine miravirsen with other medications And he says there are other hepatitis C drugs in the pipeline that are closer to getting approval So I think our study is a big step forward for hepatitis C but a bigger step forward for medicine in general he says It opens big avenues for using this concept RNAi drugs in humans
