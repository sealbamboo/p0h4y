People who need organ transplants may die needlessly following concerns raised by the death of two patients given infected kidneys a leading transplant surgeon has warned Prof Anthony Warrens said patients might play safe when deciding whether to accept an organ An inquest heard Robert Stuart and Darren Hughes died after operations at Cardiffs University Hospital of Wales The kidneys they received had been rejected as unfit by other hospitals Mr Stuart  of Cardiff and Mr Hughes  of Bridgend died after being given kidneys infected with meningitiscausing parasitic worms Doctors before accepting the organs Cardiff Coroners Court heard last week But no post mortem examination had been carried out on the unnamed donor before his organs were offered for transplant Prof Warrens president of the British Transplantation Society said the death of patients on waiting lists could rise if people start turning down organs where there is an unknown cause of death or increased risk This is a worry If people dont accept an organ or worry about donating the organs of a relative because of this then more will die needlessly  it is as simple as that he said If they dont get it in perspective they may worry or end up turning down an organ He said the deaths of Mr Stuart and Mr Hughes  who died within three weeks of their transplants  was an incredibly rare situation  The vast majority of people who have taken an organ like this wouldnt have run a risk whatsoever he added The chances of dying without a transplant are much higher than dying because of a transplant  Three people die every day in the UK for want of an organ An inquest in Cardiff last week heard Mr Hughes and Mr Stuart died last December from meningoencephalitis a form of meningitis caused by an incredibly rare parasitic worm in the donated kidneys which had unknowingly caused the death of their donor The Halicephalobus worm which lives in soil and more commonly infect horses lays eggs in the kidneys and travels to the brain where an infestation cuts of blood supply and causes haemorrhaging There have only been five reported cases in the world of people diagnosed with the infection and all have been fatal The infections of Mr Hughes and Mr Stuart are the first recorded humantohuman transmission in medical history
