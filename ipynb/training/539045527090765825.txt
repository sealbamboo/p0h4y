When the Affordable Care Act rolled out last year Californians enrolled in both Covered California and expanded Medicaid   But there are still millions in the state without health insurance Undocumented people dont qualify for Obamacare benefits And many others still find coverage too expensive  or face other obstacles in enrolling One of those people is Leaburn Alexander At  am hes finishing his shift as the night janitor at a hotel near the San Francisco International Airport He clocks out just in time to catch the hotels shuttle back to the airport where he will catch a bus Right now Im on the beginning of my commute he says After an eighthour shift my commute is like   hours I accompany Alexander on his commute to East Palo Alto about  miles south It actually takes us three hours on the hotel shuttle and then three more buses He does this commute five days a week because he doesnt have a car The train would be faster but it costs three times as much and Alexander says he has no wiggle room in his budget He says he makes just under  an hour and after taxes child support and other expenses he brings home just enough to cover rent And all the other bills He has a second job to cover those His wife has been looking for work for over a year and his oldest daughter is in college Theres no room in the budget for health insurance When I first got this job he says of his night janitor position they informed me about different employee packages benefits and all that But Alexander says he cant afford the employee portion of the health insurance premium Many people who are working lower wage jobs may qualify for MediCal Californias version of Medicaid if their incomes are low enough But because Alexander had been turned down for MediCal in the past he presumed he still wouldnt qualify even under Obamacare While hed like to be insured Alexander  says he feels pretty healthy I mean theres times where Id be tired from fatigue at my age and I know Ive got a little arthritis but I still feel pretty good he says But what might be going on inside of me is a different story Alexanders trying to quit smoking and his blood pressure is high He got free pills from a clinic and plans to return when he runs out The only time in his adult life when he had health care was when he was incarcerated He had substance abuse issues and was involved in a bank robbery He says he had tried recovery programs but didnt succeed until he became a bornagain Christian That was divine intervention It really happened he says Ive been clean and sober since July  And so hes grateful for what hes got He just doesnt know how hed get insurance right now Uninsured Californians fall into a few categories says   with the UC Berkeley Labor Center One is called the family glitch Basically spouses and children who can get coverage through a family members employer but its too expensive she says Sometimes the employee part of the premium is affordable but the family coverage is much higher But because the employer made an offer of insurance to family members when they go to Covered California theyre told theyre ineligible for subsidies Lucia says Its part of federal policy A second uninsured group consists of people who are eligible for subsidies through the ACA marketplace  but who still find the premiums unaffordable Finally Lucia says there may be nearly  million Californians who are eligible for Medicaid but dont know it or have had difficulties enrolling That may describe Leaburn Alexander But while finding time to meet with someone to help him sign up sounds like a minor hassle to most people for Alexander its a big barrier Scheduling time to do that you know an appointment Its kind of rough kind of hard right now Alexander says Just as Alexander has no wiggle room in his budget he has precious little extra time in his schedule After he wraps up his overnight janitor job he heads to a second job washing dishes at a Stanford dining hall He has one full morning off each week but that time is taken up with other needs of daily life Come Wednesday he says about his morning off thats when my pastor comes and gets us and takes us grocery shopping Alexander remains optimistic that his situation will improve Im hopeful that through prayer that God will bless me with a betterpaying job he says
