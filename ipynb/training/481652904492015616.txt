Intense exercise changes the body and muscles at a molecular level in ways that milder physical activity doesnt match according to an enlightening new study Though the study was conducted in mice the findings add to growing scientific evidence that to realize the greatest benefits from workouts we probably need to push ourselves For some time scientists and exercise experts have debated the merits of intensity in exercise Everyone agrees of course that any exercise is more healthful than none But beyond that baseline is strenuous exercise somehow better from a physiological standpoint than a relative stroll  There have been hints that it may be   for instance have found that those whose usual pace is brisk tend to live longer than those who move at a more leisurely rate even if their overall energy expenditure is similar   But how intense exercise might uniquely affect the body especially below the surface at the cellular level had remained unclear Thats where scientists at the Scripps Research Institute in Florida stepped in  Already these scientists had been studying the biochemistry of sympathetic nervous system reactions in mice The sympathetic nervous system is that portion of the autonomic or involuntary nervous system that ignites the fight or flight response in animals including people when they are faced with peril or stress In such a situation the sympathetic nervous system prompts the release of   biochemicals such as adrenaline and norepinephrine that set the heart racing increase alertness and prime the muscles for getaway or battle    At Scripps the scientists had been focusing on catecholamines and their relationship with a protein found in both mice and people that is genetically activated during stress called CRTC This protein they discovered affects the bodys use of blood sugar and fatty acids during moments of stress and seems to have an impact on health issues such as insulin resistance The researchers also began to wonder about the role of CRTC during exercise Scientists long have known that the sympathetic nervous system plays a part in exercise particularly if the activity is intense Strenuous exercise the thinking went acts as a kind of stress prompting the fight or flight response and the release of catecholamines which goose the cardiovascular system into high gear And while these catecholamines were important in helping you to instantly fight or flee it was generally thought they did not play an important role in the bodys longerterm response to exercise including changes in muscle size and endurance Intense exercise in that case would have no special or unique effects on the body beyond those that can be attained by easy exercise  But the Scripps researchers were unconvinced It just didnt make sense that the catecholamines served so little purpose in the bodys overall response to exercise said Michael Conkright an assistant professor at Scripps who with his colleague Dr Nelson Bruno and other collaborators conducted the new research So for a   he and his collaborators decided to look deeper inside the bodies of exercising mice and in particular into what was going on with their CRTC proteins  To do so they first bred mice that were genetically  programmed to produce far more of the CRTC protein than other mice When these mice began a program of frequent strenuous treadmill running their endurance soared by  percent after two weeks compared to an increase of only  percent in normal mice following the same exercise routine The genetically modified animals also developed tighter larger muscles than the other animals and their bodies became far more efficient at releasing fat from muscles for use as fuel  These differences all were the result of a sequence of events set off by catecholamines the scientists found in closely examining mouse cells When the CRTC protein received and read certain signals from the catecholamines it would turn around and send a chemical message to genes in muscle cells that would set in motion processes resulting in larger stronger muscles  In other words the catecholamines were involved in improving fitness after all  What this finding means Dr Conkright said is that there is some truth to that idea of no pain no gain Catecholamines are released only during exercise that the body perceives as stressful he said so without some physical strain there are no catecholamines no messages from them to the CRTC protein and no signals from CRTC to the muscles You will still see muscular adaptations he added if your exercise is light and induces no catecholamine release but those changes may not be as pronounced or complete as they otherwise could have been  The study also underscores the importance of periodically reassessing the intensity of your workouts Dr Conkright said if you wish to continually improve your fitness Once a routine is familiar your sympathetic nervous system grows blas he said holds back adrenaline and doesnt alert the CRTC proteins and  few additional adaptations occur   The good news is that intensity is a completely relative concept Dr Conkright said If you are out of shape an intense workout could be a brisk walk around the block For a marathon runner it would involve more sweat But the point is to get out of your bodys comfort zone Dr Conkright because it does look like there are unique consequences when you do
