A study shedding light on the way key hormones affect the brain could pave the way for new fertility treatments researchers say The Imperial College London team studied five women with hypothalamic amenorrhea  a condition common in athletes which makes periods stop Stimulating the brain to make more of the hormone kisspeptin could boost fertility they said While the study is small they said it proved an interesting concept The scientists looked at kisspeptin and another reproductive hormone which is depleted in women with HA disrupting the menstruation cycle and potentially leading to infertility About one in  women in Britain and one in  professional female athletes have HA Alongside athletes it is common in women under severe stress or who have anorexia In those women the hypothalamus  a part of the brain which regulates the menstrual cycle  stops producing hormones correctly  The exact reason why is unknown  The team studied two hormones made by the hypothalamus  kisspeptin and luteinising hormone LH Kisspeptin sparks the release of LH in the brain scientists said LH regulates womens reproductive cycles It is one of the hormones which helps prepare the womb for a fertilised egg If the amount of LH along with other hormones in the body drops women can stop producing eggs having periods As HA is associated with low levels of LH the study said it can cause infertility  But HA is not as common a cause of infertility as polycystic ovaries for example said researchers  Scientists gave five women with HA a drip containing different concentrations of kisspeptin during six eighthour sessions They looked at women aged between  and  in the study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology  Metabolism Women were given changing concentrations of kisspeptin and their LH levels  alongside how often LH was released  were measured by taking blood samples every  minutes Comparisons were run with a previous control test where the patients were given a placebo and measured in the same way Researchers said increasing levels of kisspeptin brought about a rise in the levels of LH and meant LH was released into the bloodstream more often  They said kisspeptin could act on nerves to amplify the LH pulses Lead researcher Dr Channa Jayasena said it was a small concept study and would need to be supported by larger studies to see the effect on fertility We have shown that in the short term IV intravenous infusions of kisspeptin at certain doses can restore the pulses of LH that are essential for female fertility he said The longterm aim is to determine whether kisspeptin could be used to treat certain forms of female infertility If this is viable it could provide an attractive and possibly less costly alternative to IVF Dr Jane Stewart at the Newcastle Fertility Centre for Life said the study marked an interesting and novel approach to a relatively uncommon problem It clearly needs further evaluation both in the effect demonstrated by this study and subsequently on the goal of ovulation induction and live birth in these women Dr Stewart added It is heartening to see researchers are applying new knowledge to consider new treatments
