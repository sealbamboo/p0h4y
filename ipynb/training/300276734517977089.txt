 New research about ovarian cancer aims to find better ways to screen for and treat the disease that some doctors are calling a public health crisis   is an understudied area says Nita J Maihle MD PhD professor in the Department of Obstetrics Gynecology  Reproductive Sciences at Yale It has a low incidence but high mortality rate for women Maihle says the typical age range for women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer is late fifties to early sixties According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  US women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in  the most recent data available and  women died from the disease that year There arent any imaging or blood tests to screen for ovarian cancer so women usually have to wait until they experience symptoms before its diagnosed By that time the cancer has usually progressed and spread making it very difficult to treat We dont have the equivalent to a   for ovarian cancer says Maihle Researchers at the Yale School of Medicine including Maihle   in which they connect two concepts that could help scientists develop novel targeted ovarian cancer therapies to better get at the root of tumor growth The field of cancer therapies has been revolutionized by personalized medicine where we can identify specific markers on tumor cells and go in with silver bullets to much more efficiently kill the tumor cells without killing all the healthy rapidly dividing cells says Maihle We dont currently have good biologically targeted therapies for ovarian cancers like we do for other cancers like breast cancer The Yale study published online in Cell Cycle  backed up the cancer stem cell idea that at the heart of every tumor a small subset of the original tumor cells fuel its growth The second concept defines a critical role for the tumor cells microenvironment  the cells and biochemical cues in the area around the tumor that allow cancer cells to grow and spread Weve linked the stem cell factor and the microenvironment and shown how critical both are in allowing the tumor cells to survive and grow says Maihle The new thinking is that weve been treating the bulk tumor population leaving behind a rich environment for the tumor stem cell population to grow  can be very general and easy to misdiagnose or completely overlook Symptoms include feeling bloated constipated or having diarrhea or a general feeling of malaise that cant be associated with any specific region of the body Sometimes women may feel abdominal pain but not always according to Maihle The combination of the generalized nature of ovarian cancer symptoms and the lack of screening accounts for why the majority of women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer are found to have it in late stages Maihle says the tumor   and microenvironment are concepts that have been dormant for a while but are reemerging with new data Putting together two key emerging concepts in cancer biology research should make new targets for the development of new therapies more obvious and effective she says We havent been targeting stem cells in the treatment of ovarian cancer and its becoming obvious its critical to do that But even if better targeted therapies are developed its only half of the equation If doctors are able to identify the disease and diagnose it in women in stages  or stage  it has a much higher cure rate It will take a combination of approaches including improvements in early detection as well as the development of improved biologically targeted therapies to truly impact this disease as a public health problem Maihle says
