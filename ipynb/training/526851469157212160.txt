Again and again in the US antisoda crusaders looking to fight obesity have been stymied wherever theyve tried to impose new laws on soda sales In New York exMayor Michael Bloombergs plan to limit soda size   by the states highest court Proposed taxes in the Northern California cities of El Monte and Richmond were voted down And the Washington DC City Council failed to pass an excise tax on soda Yet the successful enactment earlier this year of a nationwide tax on   has been a shot across the bow of CocaCola Pepsi and other big sodamakers with CocaCola announcing a drop in profits in part because of a decline in sales in its Latin American business Now the soda industry is going to war in a pair of election battles in San Francisco and Berkeley two of the most liberal cities in the US The measures which voters will decide on Nov  would impose   on sugary drinks in Berkeley and a   in San Francisco Citing the drinks impact on the nations obesity crisis diabetes and other health problems proponents of the tax say money raised from the taxes would be directed in San Francisco toward childhood nutrition and recreation and in Berkeley into the citys general fund On a recent evening soda tax supporter Pam Gray set off among the steep sidewalks in her north Berkeley neighborhood to persuade voters here to support the measure After knocking on doors she found a neighbor Katy Wilson being pulled on the end of a leash by a friendly dog Wilson agrees kids eat too much sugar and she is alarmed by the growing obesity rates but she told Gray she has already made up her mind She is going to vote no I dont think the measure gets to the root cause which is our attitudes toward eating drinking and taking care of ourselves Its just like a penalty said Wilson The two neighbors debated the merits for some time and Gray tried to make the case that Berkeley  where  out of  kids will develop diabetes according to city officials  has to start somewhere The very initial steps around taxing tobacco started with some very small legislative steps Gray said This is really Berkeleys attempt at beginning that process The comparison to the declining tobacco industry isnt far off   a stock analyst at Cowen and Co who covers the soda and tobacco industries and jokingly calls herself The Sin Analyst says the declines in soda volumes are eerily similar to those seen for cigarettes If you look at the shape of the cigarette industry volumes they were growing into the early s and they began to decline from there Azer says What weve seen in soda is that volumes have been declining for about  years now so I would argue that soda is about  years behind cigarettes The early health concerns that led to a drop in cigarette purchases were soon followed by perpack taxes and local and state smoking bans and those measures have led to fewer teenagers and young adults taking up the habit Soda drinkers too tend to start young and if they havent established themselves as highvolume consumers early in life Azer says the likelihood of them stepping up their consumption over time is relatively low Along Berkeleys main streets and in the underground subways here advertisements blasting the proposed soda tax are everywhere The   the soda industrys lobbying group has spent some  million fighting the measure in Berkeley and  million in San Francisco according to campaign filings Roger Salazar a spokesman for the No campaigns says these kinds of taxes have failed to pass in  cities and states across the country and San Francisco and Berkeley will be no different While they try to paint it as a launching pad its more a last gasp Salazar says cities have more important priorities than deciding what their residents should be drinking and he says taxes dont get at the root of the obesity epidemic Taxing beverages is not going to change behavior or teach people about healthy lifestyles But soda taxes are particularly worrisome to beverage companies say economists because soda drinkers are less tolerant of price increases than say cigarette smokers And as a result soda consumers do change their behavior  an economist at Duke University   more than  million supermarket purchases in the US and found that Americans spend about  percent of their food budget on sugarsweetened beverages including soda But when supermarkets raised those drink prices consumers including lowincome consumers made more nutritious purchases Sugar intake dropped by almost  percent and calories by  percent Harding says Soda companies have come up with one response to the pressure to cut empty calories make the cans smaller and charge more For CocaColas socalled minicans Azer says the revenue per ounce is more than  percent higher than a regular can of Coke
