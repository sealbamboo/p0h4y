 Ernest Hemingway Shakespeare Abraham Lincoln Brad Pitt Dumbledore and the swashbuckling Most Interesting Man in the World according to Dos Equis at least What do all these men have in common Fame Smarts Sure But the truly defining characteristic these icons all share is of course their beards  manly distinguished beards Indeed few markers of appearance seem to imply a rugged masculinity more than abundant facial hair  or so   might think But could it be that while bearded men believe their   look strong and handsome women think they look well kind of awful That is the finding of a justpublished study by psychologists from Canada and New Zealand who asked more than  women to rate which they found more attractive a group of photos of men sporting beards or the same guys sans facial hair The women who hailed from Samoa and New Zealand consistently rated the cleanshaven look more appealing than the hirsute one These findings are somewhat surprising given that no less an authority than Charles Darwin posited that mens beards were an   in their pursuit of female mates But women today just might be proving the great biologist who it must be said sported a famously heavy beard himself dead wrong The two psychologists who conducted the study Paul Vasey of the University of Lethbridge in Alberta Canada and Barnaby Dixson of Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand recruited  fully bearded men from New Zealand and Samoa The researchers photographed them twice once with a normal expression and once making an angry face The men then shaved and photos were retaken again with each making a normal face and an angry one Not only did the women rate the cleanshaven versions of the men more attractive they thought the bearded versions looked angrier as well But if you sport a beard and in the spirit of full disclosure I must admit I currently dothough mostly due to laziness about   the news from Vasey and Dixsons study isnt all bad The researchers also asked men to view the photos and while the guys agreed with the ladies that the bearded men looked angrier they were also inclined to ascribe them higher social status as the psychologists note in their study abstract in the journal   So it seems   must make a hard choice either shave and appear more attractive to women or remain bearded and be taken more seriously
