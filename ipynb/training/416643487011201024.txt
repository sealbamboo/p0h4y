I always stuff an orange or a tangerine into the toe of my sons Christmas stocking He is more interested in the chocolate in his stocking and I usually end up eating his orange but Ill never forego this European tradition that dates from a time when citrus was a rare treat We in the United States take our oranges and grapefruit for granted year round but citrus really does have a season  winter  and it is welcome at this time of year when we need all the vitamin C we can get  My idea of a perfect Christmas gift is a big box of ruby red grapefruit I have had the great fortune to live in two major citrus producing areas in my life South Texas and now Los Angeles I buy Valencia oranges by the bag and juice them until the end of their season when navels come in around now I always have a big bowl of clementines on my annual New Years Day buffet table and they always disappear Around this time of year I start thinking about going beyond juice and unadorned fresh citrus This year I have been adding oranges to salads making vinaigrettes with grapefruit juice and experimenting with new desserts The Culinary Institute of America is on the same wavelength their latest Prochef newsletter carried the headline The Professional Chef Discovers Specialty Citrus  
  A colorful salad with sweet and sharp flavors  A salad modeled on a traditional North African one that is great for buffets  An old fashioned fruit ambrosia with a gingery kick  This vinaigrette works with a variety of greens like chard beet greens or broccoli
