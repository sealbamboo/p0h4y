A new fund to pay for innovative cancer drugs surgery and radiotherapy would be set up if Labour comes to power It would replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England  a key part of David Camerons  election campaign  when it runs out in  Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said he wanted the best health service in the world for cancer The Conservatives said it was an unfunded promise giving false hope to patients A Conservative source said that as long as David Cameron remained PM the cancer drug fund would continue to be funded Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Englands track record on treating cancer had improved under the current government  Helping more people survive cancer is a key priority for this Government  and its hugely welcome that were on track to meet our goal to save an extra  lives he said Many cancer treatments are not costeffective enough for the NHS to make them routinely available  They include the breast cancer therapy Kadcyla which extends life by an average of six months and costs  a course Prime Minister David Cameron set up a mayear pot of money in  now extended to m to give patients access to expensive drugs irrespective of cost  However the longterm future of the Cancer Drugs Fund is in doubt as the funding runs out in  In a speech at the Britain Against Cancer conference Mr Burnham will announce that a Cancer Treatments Fund would take its place under a Labour government  It would be worth mayear and improve access to all forms of innovative cancer therapies Mr Burnham is expected to tell the conference that the Cancer Drugs Fund took resources away from other lifesaving therapies My goal is to make the NHS the best health service in the world for the treatment of cancer We will only achieve that if we give patients access to the most effective forms of treatment particularly advanced radiotherapy he will say The problem with cancer policy under the current government is that it prioritises one form of cancer treatment over others and places one group of patients ahead of another  This is indefensible when we know surgery and radiotherapy are responsible for nine in ten cases where cancer is cured  It is not right that  people every year who could benefit from radiotherapy are missing out Labours proposal could mean increased access to advanced forms of radiotherapy such as intensity modulated radiotherapy and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy  Both are available to some NHS patients but not all Mr Burnham will also announce that a Labour government would publish a new cancer strategy within six months of being elected Previous Labour promises on health include a bn funding pledge to pay for  more doctors nurses and midwives and cutting waiting times for cancer tests and the results to under a week  A Conservative spokesman said This represents a huge uturn for the Labour party who only a few weeks ago said they didnt support the Cancer Drugs Fund in England and are still denying it to NHS patients in Wales  While their newfound support for the fund is welcome the public deserve better than unfunded promises that give false hope to cancer patients Sarah Woolnough Cancer Research UKs executive director of policy said Were delighted to see a commitment to investing in radiotherapy and surgery as well as focusing on some of the issues facing both teenage and older cancer patients  We know that one of the main reasons our cancer outcomes lag behind other countries is because patients are not getting access to the best treatments She added We also need to see a continued commitment to diagnosing more cancers early Surgery and radiotherapy are more likely to be effective when the disease is diagnosed in the earliest stages  Early diagnosis and access to treatment must be key priorities for a future government if its serious about improving the UKs cancer survival rates
