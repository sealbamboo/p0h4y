Closing live poultry markets in China dramatically curtailed the spread of a novel strain of bird flu this year according to an analysis  The report   showed shutting the markets cut the number of new cases of HN bird flu by   It said the future of the markets a millenniaold culture in China needed to be reassessed Experts said the markets can become a reservoir of viruses  There have been  cases of HN bird flu and  deaths according to the World Health Organization However most were in the months immediately after the virus was found to be moving from infecting animals to people Live poultry markets rapidly became linked with the outbreak Nearly  markets were then shut across Shanghai Hangzhou Huzhou and Nanjing It allowed scientists to analyse the role of the markets in the spread of the virus Dr Benjamin Cowling one of the researchers at the University of Hong Kong said Our findings confirm that live poultry market closure is a highly effective intervention to prevent human disease and protect public health Without this robust evidence policymakers would struggle to justify further closures of live poultry markets because of the millenniaold culture of trading live birds and the potential huge economic loss on the poultry industry in China The Lancet report said the markets should be rapidly closed in areas where the bird flu emerged and that discussions on the role of the markets should be renewed Guillaume Fournie and Dirk Pfeiffer of the Royal Veterinary College in the UK said If birds spend a sufficient amount of time in live poultry markets to become infected and transmit the virus to other susceptible birds sustained virus circulation in the live poultry markets can occur Live poultry markets can then become a permanent source of infection for poultry flocks and for people who are in loose contact with infected poultry Two cases of HN bird flu have been reported in October  Dr Cowling said These are the first laboratoryconfirmed cases of HN this autumn five months after the outbreak earlier in   This is of great concern because it reveals that the HN virus has continued to circulate and now has the potential to reemerge in a new outbreak of human disease this winter
