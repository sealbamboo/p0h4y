The risk of dying from a gunshot wound is twice as high for African Americans as it is for white Americans according to a new study based on  years worth of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Between  and  the rate of firearmrelated fatalities in the US was  per  people for whites and  per  people for blacks When factoring in the  deaths per  people of other races the countrys overall gunrelated death rate was  per  Americans researchers   Thursday in the journal BMJ Open That racial discrepancy represents an improvement from the s the researchers noted In  gun fatalities were three times more common among blacks compared to whites Over the  years of the study at least  Americans were killed by guns The   almost certainly understates the true toll of gun violence the researchers wrote These deaths include murders suicides and accidental shootings The number of deaths varied slightly per year but the changes were small enough that they could have been due to chance according to the research team from Columbia University and the Jacobi Medical Center in New York The story was the same for  states where the rate of firearmrelated deaths was basically stable over the  years But the death rate rose in two states  Massachusetts and Florida  and fell in seven others as well as in the District of Columbia California was singled out in the study for having the most marked reduction in the rate of gun deaths The researchers said this could be the result of tough antigun laws including eight aimed at preventing gun trafficking They noted that the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence   California top among all states for its laws on background checks waiting periods restrictions on who may own a gun and consumer and child safety California also benefited from a reduction in homicides of all sorts with the overall homicide rate falling  between  and  But the story on gun laws isnt so simple Massachusetts also earned high marks from the Brady Center for its gun laws and firearm ownership there plummeted after a  gun control law passed the researchers wrote Yet both violent crimes in general and homicides in particular became more common in subsequent years The researchers speculated that guns may have flowed into the Bay State from neighboring New Hampshire and Maine where gun control laws are less stringent Meanwhile in Florida only two laws on the books address illegal gun trafficking and authorities have little discretion to reject requests for concealed weapons licenses according to the study So perhaps it should come as little surprise that gun deaths rose in the Sunshine State during the study period But that increase was seen despite the fact that the overall violent crime rate fell by onethird between  and  according to   from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Thats a particularly concerning public health problem the study authors wrote Indeed the endemic firearm violence in this country represents a substantial longterm cumulative health burden the researchers wrote If present trends continue Americans can expect to lose  lives to guns between  and  they calculated
