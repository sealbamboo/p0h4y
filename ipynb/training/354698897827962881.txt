One of my patients died last month a man I was particularly fond of I had known him for almost  years I had come to know his wife in person the children in his frequently exasperated anecdotes and his grandchildren in blurry cellphone photos His wife left a message with the unexpected news on a Monday morning It took me almost two weeks to get back to her How typical right The doctor shrugs and moves on The doctor forgets the symbolic value of closure The doctor doesnt bother to show up at the funeral The doctor ignores the obligations that endure after the patient passes But hold your judgments I called Lennys wife back promptly repeatedly leaving increasingly puzzled messages and never getting a response I suppose you could call it all a medical error But it wasnt mine Medicine has become a team sport  thats old news Everyone knows that the team now includes residents physician assistants   therapists all taking over portions of the role that once belonged to the doctor alone These colleagues slice and dice the doctors timehonored obligations into fragments that can be difficult to reassemble Residents routinely use my license number to write prescriptions if the resident makes a big mistake who is liable Nurses inject medications per my orders if I miscalculate a dose and disaster ensues who pays These days thats not the end of it not by a long shot Behind the medical team stands an increasingly large backfield giant in numbers humble in training They answer the phones arrange consultations organize the billing deal with the unrelenting demands of dozens of insurers Say that a secretary a pleasant overworked person sitting with her colleagues in an airless back office each fielding dozens of calls a day  say she forgets to confirm a phone number scrawled into the medical record long ago Who is responsible You wont find the answer in the ethics textbooks Experts continue to talk about the physicanpatient relationship that storied historic and fiduciary entity as if it were still composed of mutual trust and obligations between two people They havent noticed that those two people have turned into a crowd Lenny was impossible the best and the worst kind of patient He never complained mostly because he minimized half his problems and overlooked the rest He vastly preferred to ignore his health and discuss his latest computer acquisitions We spent a lot of office time on Apple vs Microsoft Whose fault was that In the long run it hardly matters He died at  in an emergency room from overwhelming staphylococcal   a treatable bacterial infection undoubtedly worsened by his chronic   and his chronic denial  and by the impressive personal magnetism that endured to the end Evidently he refused to let anyone call an ambulance till far too late Many things can go wrong in health care These days more and more of them have nothing to do with actual health care People leave a competent doctor for a marginal one because the first has a receptionist with a nasty disposition and the second has one who smiles People change medications from good to not so good because their insurer pays for one set and not the other People get their doctor on the phone right away because a secretary has the nerve to transfer the call to the staff lounge People never hear from their doctor because a secretary forgets to confirm a phone number After  days with no word from Lennys wife I was beside myself I couldnt leave any more messages I couldnt fathom why she wasnt calling me back I figured she was angry with me So of course I got a little angry about that Does everything have to be my fault Then I remembered that I knew where she got her own medical care at an office bound to have more contact information Sure enough I had been calling the wrong number the whole time off by one digit Two conversations end this story The first one between me and our secretary was brief There wasnt much to say I am not her supervisor Mistakes happen She didnt know Lenny she seldom gets out from the back room to see our world  hers as much as mine  in all its dimensions Then Lennys wife and I talked for a long time The edge in her voice eventually softened We agreed that he had been impossible and would be grievously missed I told her I would have been at the funeral if I had only known and that I would never forget I had missed it So who paid I guess we all did
