Picket lines will be mounted outside hospitals on Monday as hundreds of thousands of health workers including midwives nurses radiographers cleaners and psychiatric staff stage a fresh strike in a bitter row with the government over pay Members of  unions will walk out for four hours from am in England and am in Northern Ireland in protest at the coalitions controversial decision not to accept a recommended  wage rise for all   employees Unison leader Dave Prentis said the strike the second in a month should sound alarm bells ringing in Westminster because of the anger of such dedicated workers Unions have struck deals with the administrations in Scotland and Wales increasing their anger at the health secretary   who they accuse of refusing to discuss the longrunning row The minister has erected a Berlin wall of intransigence the unions said Prentis said The fact almost all health unions are taking part in the industrial action should ring alarm bells in Whitehall The anger is spreading and so is the public support for health workers cause The strength of feeling is far from fading and the dispute far from going away All the government has done so far is threaten workers with job cuts  If the secretary of state seriously thinks staff are the NHSs best asset then he needs to treat them fairly We are only asking for decent pay for the hardworking people the government say they care so much about There will be plenty of opportunities for Jeremy Hunt to go in trusts around the country to meet with staff who will be working to rule taking away the goodwill the NHS relies on so much  NHS workers in Scotland and Wales will all be getting a  pay rise and the Living Wage So why is the secretary of state so determined to penalise workers in England  The government and NHS employers need to engage in meaningful talks about how to resolve this dispute We are prepared to keep up the pressure through the winter and up until the general election By the end of the next financial year health workers will have had their pay capped for six years said the TUC General secretary Frances OGrady will join Prentis on a picket line at the London Ambulance Service headquarters in Waterloo as a show of support for health workers taking part in the pay protest She said Health workers care passionately about their patients and the quality of service they provide and so are always reluctant to take action But the governments refusal to accept the recommendations of NHS independent pay review body  even though it only called for an affordable belowinflation pay rise  leaves health workers feeling that they have no other option Its not too late for the government to change course and award health workers the pay rise the public knows they deserve Cathy Warwick chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives said I was overwhelmed by the response of our members to the previous industrial action and I urge them to respond equally next week  I am also very heartened to see that public support for a  award for NHS staff has remained high since that industrial action so we know the public are behind us This is not about our members demanding huge bankersized bonuses or asking for the similarly large bonuses and pay increases given to many senior managers in the NHS It is about our members having to fight just to get the very modest  pay award recommended by the NHS Pay Review Body It is also an award which still lags way behind the rising cost of living and will see our members earning the same in  as they did in  As before in every area our local representatives have worked with hospitals to ensure safe services will be available to women in need of urgent care such as those in labour Our dispute is not with the women for whom midwives care it is with employers telling midwives they are not worth a  pay rise GMB national officer Rehana Azam said We regret having to inconvenience NHS users again but the intransigence of the government and employers leaves us no choice We are open to talks but the health secretary still refuses to meet the unions This is not the way to go about dispute resolution Weve managed to get a settlement in Wales in part because the Welsh government was prepared to enter into dialogue Jeremy Hunt needs to get round the table and make more money available for a settlement This dispute arose when the government overruled the independent NHS pay review body which had recommended an acrosstheboard pay rise   workers have already endured several years of pay freezes and caps They are understandably angry and frustrated at the cavalier way they have been treated The planned action will undoubtedly cause widespread disruption to NHS services However we have sent formal notification of this action to all affected NHS employers so that they can work out essential cover requirements to ensure patient safety More than  workers will join the strike including  in Unison which will be followed by a work to rule for the rest of the week A Department of Health spokesman said NHS staff are our greatest asset and we want to make the current pay system fairer We have taken tough decisions to increase the NHS budget but we cant afford a consolidated pay rise in addition to increments without risking  frontline jobs
