The number of AE visits in England soared by more than  in  figures show The College of Emergency Medicine said that was the equivalent of filling an extra nine emergency departments The Health Select Committee has been taking evidence after the worst waiting times in AE for a decade and many hospitals declaring major incidents Doctors said it was absurd to blame patients who were advised to go to AE by services including NHS   The committee heard the reasons for the surge in demand were many varied and complex but staff were doing a heroic job  Figures for England showed  of patients had been seen within four hours during the OctobertoDecember quarter The target is  Then last week data for the start of the new year showed the proportion had dropped to a new weekly low of  The figures include walkin centres and minor injury units Once you strip them out just one in seven major AE units are hitting the target Data from NHS England shows there were over m visits to AE in   an increase of  on  Dr Clifford Mann the president of the College of Emergency Medicine told the committee Now the interesting thing about that is many people would describe that as only a  increase in attendances Thats certainly true but the other way of describing it is to say thats equivalent to eight or nine extra emergency departments and of course we havent built or staffed eight or nine extra emergency departments in the last  months Other parts of the UK are also missing the fourhour target with waits in Northern Ireland and Wales even worse than in England  The fourhour target measures the point from when the patient arrives to when they are treated and discharged admitted to hospital or transferred to another part of the NHS Prof Chris Ham from The Kings Fund health think tank said there was no simple explanation for the extra pressures on AE  He said The causes are many varied and complex We think the most important causes are outside hospital  He cited underinvestment in GP services and a lack of community services to support people being discharged from hospital Dr Mann said it was not the fault of patients who were often told to go to AE including through the helpline service NHS  He said I dont think you should blame people for attending an emergency department when weve told them to go there its absurd The pressures being felt in AE are also affecting other parts of the hospital system The Government has made much of the m of extra funding made available to the NHS in England to cope with winter pressures But has it all reached the frontline  Doubt was cast on that by Dr Cliff Mann of the College of Emergency Medicine He told MPs that investment of the money was geographically patchy   Chris Ham of the Kings Fund ventured that some of the money might be papering over the cracks of trusts struggling with deficits  Dale Bywater of the Trust Development Authority argued that the money had been pledged early and was being closely tracked through the system  Just how the extra cash for the NHS has been used will continue to be an issue as the debate over the intense pressures on AE continues Delays are also being seen when ambulances hand over patients and inside the hospital when patients need to be found beds and when they are ready to be discharged The problems have even led to a number of hospitals declaring major incidents which means they take steps such as calling in extra staff and cancelling routine operations such as knee and hip operations The committee heard that pressures on AE would have a knockon effect on the rest of the health service as priorities shifted to target the fourhour wait  Prof Ham warned other targets were likely to slip later in the year  Prof Keith Willett the director of acute care for NHS England said We have to do a transformation of the whole system with a particular focus on outofhospital services being the way to both reduce demand and also alleviate the issues of congestion within the hospital It isnt going to be a quick fix We have said it will be three to five years to get all of these things in place
