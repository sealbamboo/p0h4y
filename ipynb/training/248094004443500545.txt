If you find yourself with the unenviable task of checking Mom or Dad into a    one day or if youre signing yourself in chances are youll find a document tucked inside the stack of admissions papers that says you agree to arbitrate disputes should they arise rather than take the case to court Dont sign it say consumer advocates If something bad happens youll likely be on the hook for a share of the arbitrators fee and   you may wind up with a smaller award than you would if you took your case to court Even if you do sign the agreement  and many people do not realizing what it means  you can generally back out of it within  days thanks to an optout provision that most agreements contain That gives the family time to weigh the agreement and later go back and withdraw their agreement says   a spokesman for the American Health Care Association which represents  longterm care facilities So why would nursing homes give consumers the opportunity to back out of the arbitration agreement that they encouraged them to sign Its smart strategy say consumer advocates If a family signs an arbitration agreement and theres a dispute the familys lawyer will likely go to court to try to get the arbitration agreement thrown out perhaps arguing that the agreement was unfair or unjust But if there was an optout provision courts are more likely to enforce the arbitration agreement says   a senior attorney at Public Justice a public interest law firm One of the ways that courts decide whether to strike an agreement is that if its not a take it or leave it contract even if its something that is very unfair then theyll enforce it says Bland But the appearance of consumer choice belies the reality says Bland Almost no one notices reads or recognizes the significance of optout clauses he says They sign the agreements and then theyre bound by them People   their constitutional rights to a jury trial and a day of court and they didnt have a meaningful choice he says
