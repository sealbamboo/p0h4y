Welcome to Cigna said the letter dated May  on behalf of my new employer the Kaiser Family Foundation The letter also said the insurer was placing me on a oneyear waiting period for any preexisting conditions Seriously Wasnt the health law supposed to end that We have reviewed the evidence of prior creditable coverage provided by you andor your prior carrier and have determined that you have  days of creditable coverage the letter said So it was really odd that I received that notification the same day as another letter  also dated May  and also from Cigna  on behalf of my nowformer employer NPR It was a Certificate of Group Health Plan Coverage noting that I had been covered continuously for at least the past  months  in other words creditable coverage that prevents insurance companies from imposing limits on preexisting conditions Its more like  years but whos counting This letter will serve as your certification of prior coverage with CIGNA HealthCare the second letter said If you have just changed coverage to another CIGNA HealthCare product you may disregard this certificate Now as a health reporter I knew the first letter was a mistake I    s Jeremy Hobson about what I found as I sorted it out First the    says that if youve had continuous coverage meaning coverage without a break of more than  days your new insurer may not impose a preexisting condition waiting period Obviously I hadnt had a break of more than  days I hadnt had a break of even one day I did that quite purposefully But the mixup raised a broader question What about the requirement of the Affordable Care Act that prohibited pretty much   as of Jan   Under the law the only plans that may continue to exclude coverage for preexisting conditions after that date are individual plans that are   or havent changed substantially since the law was passed in  It turns out that the Jan  date wasnt quite as set in stone as many have thought Its more of a rolling plan year effective date said a spokesman for the Department of Labor meaning as plans renew in  preexisting condition exclusions will get dropped Indeed a spokeswoman for Cigna confirmed that for any particular group health plan the elimination of preexisting condition exclusions becomes effective on the first day of the plan year that begins on and after January   By the end of  the spokeswoman said the requirement to eliminate preexisting condition exclusions will have become effective for all plans And yes the plan year for my new employer the Kaiser Family Foundation had begun before Jan  But what happens to a person who   have a break in coverage and gets a oneyear exclusion in May but whose employers plan renews in September Does that person get stuck waiting the full year until the next May for the exclusion to end Nope says the Labor Department spokesman When the plan drops the preexisting condition exclusion it goes away completely including for those who it may be affecting at the time But that wont include me A very polite Cigna customer service agent told me that I got the contradictory letters because two company computer systems cant talk to each other So my mixup has been fixed Meanwhile if youre changing insurance and you see something that doesnt look right check with your HR department or the insurance company
