From cheerful red handbags to festive green belts colored accessories are often mandatory for the styleconscious during the holiday season But what many fashionistas dont know is that many of these products may be tainted with high levels of lead  and the brighter and shinier they are the greater the risk  Accessories in red green yellow and orange are more likely to be contaminated than those in darker or more muted colors new tests show Use of lead salts to create these brilliant hues  a practice that dates to the Middle Ages  is    Why worry Some experts fear the abundant lead in the colorful outer layer of these products may leave tiny invisible particles on the hands of consumers which may end up in food and drink Further people handle wallets and other accessories multiple times a day accruing repeated exposures    Lead is    we tend to store it very well said Dr Bruce Lanphear professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver and an expert on lead contamination Even at very low levels it has been linked to nervous system damage cardiovascular problems kidney failure and    There is no good level for lead exposure said David Rosner codirector of the Center for the History and Ethics of Public Health at Columbia University and author of the  book   For the past three years the   in Oakland Calif has been checking accessories sold at retail stores and online for lead contamination Retailers   in a settlement following a  lawsuit filed by the center regarding toxic metals in accessories  That settlement sets a safety limit of  parts per million of lead in leather goods and  ppm in vinyl products which are prone to cracking If a product contains lead above those levels the retailer may pay a penalty of up to  the money goes into a fund that pays for further testing Generally the news has been good the centers investigators have documented a steady reduction in lead contamination over all The center found no violations of the lead standards this year at retailers like Target HM Guess and J Crew  Still the center did find consistent lead contamination in purses belts and shoes sold to budgetconscious teenagers and young women at other retailers Some including Wet Seal Charlotte Russe and Forever  sold fashion accessories that contained more than  ppm of lead or higher according to Caroline Cox the centers research director A pair of orange sandals tested by the center topped  ppm for example while a pair of red pumps registered above  ppm Yellow belts approached  ppm  Over the last  months the center found that slightly more than half of  items from Wet Seal tested above the safety standard nearly onefourth of the items purchased at Charlotte Russe and Forever  also failed to meet lead limits  Its frustrating that this continues to be a problem Ms Cox said  Especially when the fact that other companies can reduce contamination means were really just talking about quality control A spokeswoman for Wet Seal declined to respond to questions about the test results on the record Repeated calls and emails to Charlotte Russe were not answered  In a prepared statement Kristen Strickler public relations and social media marketing manager at Forever  noted that the  goods cited by the CEH make up just a small fraction of the accessories sold by the retailer Upon identifying any nonconforming goods Forever  voluntarily recalls these items immediately and takes appropriate punitive actions with the vendor including termination which has resulted in much fewer instances she said Brent Cleaveland executive director of the   said Nobody wants to contaminate customers and nobody wants to sell poisoned products  The lead limits set by the center are unfairly low and penalize companies seeking to provide lowcost accessories he said  Most of these products are made in China he added and intensive product testing would place a heavy burden on the businesses without necessarily protecting consumer health The industry as a whole has been both concerned and responsible Mr Cleaveland said pointing out that the association has worked to establish protective measures for products like childrens jewelry  The most important question is whether accessories pose a measurable risk he said and on that point he remains unconvinced Its a gross exaggeration to suggest that the lead you get on your fingers from handling a wallet is a health problem Ms Cox acknowledged that its uncertain how much exposure an individual might receive from handling accessories  But she said tests in which tissues are swiped across even brandnew products show that trace amounts of lead are transferred with each touch Because people tend to touch purses and wallets repeatedly these exposures could add up It just makes sense to reduce levels as much as possible she said   The center is focusing on products that are marketed to younger women because lead tends to accumulate in bones and can be released during pregnancy she said with the potential to harm both mother and fetus   Theres an additional benefit to lowering lead levels in these products she added  Such actions also help to protect factory workers who undoubtedly receive much higher lead exposure exposures than consumers  Advocates and manufacturers do agree that educated consumers are increasingly likely to choose even demand untainted accessoriesIf you buy products that are not contaminated theres undoubtedly an extra cost Dr Lanphear said  But there are much larger benefits
