Many of us get confused by claims of how much the risk of a heart attack for example might be reduced by taking medicine for it And doctors can get confused too Just ask   She runs the Health Decisions Sciences Center at Bostons Massachusetts General Hospital A few years ago she surveyed primary care physicians and asked how confident they were in their ability to talk about numbers and probabilities with patients What we found surprised us a little bit Sepucha says Only about  percent of the physicians said they were very comfortable using numbers and explaining probabilities to patients Doctors including   typically prefer words Simmons is an internist and part of a group practice that provides primary care at Mass General As doctors we tend to often use words like very small risk very unlikely very rare very likely high risk  she says But those words can be unclear to a patient People may hear small risk and what they hear is very different from what Ive got in my mind she says Or whats a very small risk to me its a very big deal to you if its happened to a family member Simmons and her colleagues are working on ways to involve their patients in shared decisionmaking The initiative at Mass General gives patients online written and visual information to help them One of the goals is to make risk understandable  bridging the gap between percent probabilities and words Simmons tried it with her patient Joe Bianco  when talking over his risk for heart disease a few weeks ago Rather than just using a number to tell him his risk for a heart attack she made it visual with   developed by the Mayo Clinic The calculator displays  green dots arranged in a by grid Each has a little smile on it and symbolizes a person Once a patients information is entered some of the green dots turn yellow and some smiles may turn upside down into frowns indicating in the next  years how many people are expected to have a heart attack When Biancos profile is submitted  dots turn yellow and  remain green  meaning  percent of men like him will have a heart attack within  years It looks like my chances are slim he says Bianco had decided earlier not to take a cholesterollowering statin medicine to lower his risk of a heart attack The dozen frowning yellow dots dont change his mind Next Simmons enters another factor into the online calculator What if all  men fitting Biancos profile take a statin drug every day for the next ten years The number of yellow dots on the screen  the percent who will have a heart attack  changes for the better That number goes down to seven  so five people are saved from a heart attack by taking a medication Simmons says Some people look at that and say Well thats almost cutting the risk in half Other people say Well thats still  people who didnt benefit either way And only five who had a benefit For Bianco seeing the graphic validated his previous decision not to take medicine And for Simmons as a doctor its made that conversation easier But the graphics and words alone dont work for everyone At Mass Generals orthopedics department Jim Westberg of Nashua NH has come to see surgeon   who is in charge of hips and knees Westberg is very active at  He hikes swims skis and rock climbs when hes not at work selling D printers He wants a hip replacement and in the course of examining him his doctor cites some numbers Your risk of infection is probably under  percent probably half a percent Freiberg tells him That the risk is less than  percent doesnt deter Westberg Before his appointment he had received a shared decisionmaking packet that included a booklet and a DVD all about hip replacement He also did some other research and  just as importantly  talked to people he knew who had had the surgery and were thrilled with the outcome For him Westerberg says the numbers and percent probabilities are still valuable I think theyre fairly important because I actually have an engineering degree Westerberg says I have a technical background so maybe Im a little biased but numbers do mean something to me The risk we talked about half of  percent really doesnt concern me that much The Food and Drug Administration also likes numbers and   to give numerical values for risk  and to avoid using vague terms such as rare infrequent and frequent But the European Medicines Agency a part of the European Union    very common common uncommon rare and very rare  with numerical definitions for each of those five levels of frequency So what percent of cases qualified for the top level very common side effect You might think over  percent but according to those EU definitions a side effect is very common if occurs in more than  percent of cases And if a drug label says that a particular side effect was very rare That means it occurs in fewer than one in every  cases All Things Considered
