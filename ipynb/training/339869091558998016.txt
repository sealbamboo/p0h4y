Treating every single patient who enters an intensive care unit with special disinfectant soaps and ointments drastically reduces the spread of the drugresistant bacteria MRSA and cuts the rate of bloodstream infections in hospitals a new study shows  By adopting a universal strategy of disinfecting the most vulnerable patients hospitals could make substantially more progress against serious infections that are contracted in health care settings the researchers say Most hospitals currently use a more limited approach which involves screening intensive care patients and then isolating those known to harbor MRSA or methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus  The study found that the universal strategy lowered bloodstream infections among intensive care patients by nearly  percent The research published on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine involved about  patients in  hospitals around the country making it the largest study of the subject to date  I believe that this approach should be used in many if not most hospitals as a very effective way to get us closer and closer to zero hospitalassociated infections said Dr Susan S Huang the lead author of the study and an associate professor at the University of California Irvine School of Medicine I think with this amount of reduction it should push us toward action In a statement Dr Thomas R Frieden director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which helped finance the study said the agency was working to determine how the findings should inform CDC infection prevention recommendations Nationwide nearly two million people contract infections in hospitals every year and roughly  die from them MRSA an increasingly common infection has become a particular focus for health care officials because it is so virulent and difficult to treat   Many hospitals screen for the bacteria in their most vulnerable patients those in intensive care units by taking swabs of their nasal cavities where MRSA is most likely to congregate At least eight states mandate such screenings Patients who are found to harbor MRSA in their nostrils or anywhere on their bodies are usually placed in isolation to prevent it from spreading to others But the patients harboring the bacteria still have a high likelihood of developing a severe infection  For years some experts have argued that rather than isolating those exposed to the bug a better use of resources would be to treat all intensive care patients proactively with measures that could lower their likelihood of infection In the new study researchers compared the effectiveness of such an approach by randomizing patients in  intensive care units to one of three groups In the first group patients contaminated with MRSA were given routine care In the second group patients underwent some additional steps for five days they were treated with an antibiotic nasal ointment and bathed with an antiseptic soap known as chlorhexidine  In the last group there was no screening for MRSA but all patients in the intensive care unit received the nasal ointment and the antiseptic wash for the duration of their stay This last strategy says forget the screening and save your money they are all at high risk Dr Huang said It is certainly the easiest strategy to implement You treat all of the patients and protect them from all pathogens The study found that compared with treating only those patients harboring MRSA the universal strategy of disinfecting everyone in the ICU reduced the number of all bloodstream infections by  percent It also reduced positive tests for MRSA by  percent  Dr Huang said that one of the benefits of the study was that it highlighted an approach that can be implemented in essentially any hospital in the country  This is a completely pragmatic trial done in community hospitals not these rare academic tertiary hospitals she said Your neighborhood hospital could do this and your neighborhood hospital could expect to have this type of gain
