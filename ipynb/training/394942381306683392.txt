Monday was yet another troubled day for the Affordable Care Act Sunday night the outside vendor that operates two key parts of the website that lets people browse and sign up for health insurance experienced a failure The failure took place at a vendor called   and presumably affected other clients as well as   the federal website that people use to sign up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act By  am federal officials say the data hub at HealthCaregov that certifies things like citizenship and eligibility for tax credits was back up and running And by midafternoon Monday the rest of the website was back as well they say Its unknown how many people tried and failed to get on the site Sunday But not all the news was bad Monday brought good news for the  million people on   with officials   that premiums and deductibles wont increase in  Thats the third straight year those patient costs have been less than projected or stayed the same And Medicare officials also said seniors have saved more than  billion since the Affordable Care Act closed the prescription drug doughnut hole gap in coverage Its a bit ironic because public opinion polls consistently show that seniors are the least enthusiastic about the Affordable Care Act Fixing the other problems with HealthCaregov will be a longerterm project But last week the new guy in charge   said the site should be running smoothly by the end of November something Health and Human Services officials reiterated Monday And it does seem that while things are not fixed yet the websites performance is getting incrementally better by the day But were also hearing about people getting notices that their old health insurance is being   and that could be the next big political issue Those people are in the individual market who buy their own insurance Thats about  million people out of more than  million Americans Some of them are going to have to buy new policies and some are going to have to pay more because the policies they have now dont meet the current minimum requirements of the Affordable Care Act But at the same time there are people in the individual market who will no longer be paying extra because theyre women or older or have preexisting medical conditions The fact is one of the biggest things the Affordable Care Act does is remake the market for individually purchased policies Thats going to cause some dislocation for people in that market now Its going to create winners and losers And its the losers who complain the loudest
