Cancer of the gullet could be diagnosed with a cheap and simple spongeonastring test latest trial results show  Swallowed and then retrieved from the mouth by pulling on the string the Cytosponge capsule expands in the body to collect cells on its way out  In tests on more than  UK patients it was found to be well tolerated safe and accurate at diagnosing Barretts oesophagus One in  people with this condition later develops cancer of the food pipe  In Barretts acid comes back up the food pipe from the stomach which can cause symptoms such as indigestion and heartburn as well as changes in the normal cells that line the gullet Conventionally doctors have diagnosed and monitored these patients for signs of cancer using biopsy  taking a small sample of cells  during a procedure called endoscopy where a long flexible tube with a camera is inserted down the throat But researchers from the Medical Research Council Cancer Unit at the University of Cambridge say the Cytosponge could replace this test Unlike endoscopy Cytosponge can easily be used in GP surgeries and doesnt require any sedation say Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald and colleagues As well as being less invasive Cytosponge is also cheaper costing  compared with the  cost of a traditional endoscopy  The trial invited more than  patients with Barretts to swallow the Cytosponge and to undergo an endoscopy Almost  more people with symptoms like reflux and persistent heartburn did the same tests  Many patients in the trial said they preferred it to endoscopy More than nine in  patients were able to successfully swallow the capsule Larger studies are now planned Dr Julie Sharp of Cancer Research UK the charity that funded the trial said These results are very encouraging and it will be good news if such a simple and cheap test can replace endoscopy for Barretts oesophagus   Death rates are unacceptably high in oesophageal cancer so early diagnosis is vital Jacqui Graves of Macmillan Cancer Support said a less invasive test that hastened diagnosis would be welcome but she said it would be some time before any such test would be available across the UK on the NHS The trial findings will be presented at the National Cancer Research Institutes annual conference in Liverpool this week
