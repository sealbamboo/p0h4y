At an altitude of nearly  miles the Tibetan plateau is an extreme place to live Its cold its hard to grow food and theres about  percent less oxygen in the air than there is at sea level Somehow though native Tibetans are adapted to it Their bodies  and their blood in particular  work differently than those of people used to lower altitudes The Tibetans advantage might be thanks to an ancient inheritance When someone used to living at low altitude travels to the oxygendeprived Tibetan plateau his or her body responds by producing more red blood cells to help   through the body Sounds like a good thing right Not quite You dont want your blood to become too thick says Rasmus Nielsen   at University of California Berkeley Too many red blood cells can lead to thick blood that is harder for the heart to pump People who arent adapted to high altitudes have an increased   When pregnant women move up to high altitudes they tend to   with high blood pressure suffer a higher rate of infant mortality and are more likely to give birth to small babies Native Tibetans dont have those problems Their blood doesnt contain extra red blood cells yet it still manages to keep them alive and well Its a mystery how they manage to function so well at high altitude without the extra help but its clear that they are able to avoid the health pitfalls that other people can encounter at high altitude According to Nielsen and a bunch of geneticists   the journal   the Tibetans appear to have benefited from a genetic gift from the Denisovans an   known primarily from a little girls tooth and pinkie bone Tibetans have a gene EPAS thats   help regulate how the body responds to low oxygen levels Its also been called the super athlete gene because we know that certain humans that have a special version of this gene have a better performance with certain types of athletics says Nielsen At first Nielsen and his colleagues werent sure how Tibetans had gotten the gene But now they have an idea We think we have very good evidence that it came from Denisovans he says The DNA patterns seen around that gene match those of the Denisovans a sister group to the Neanderthals He says Tibetans were able to adapt because they got the genes from another human species that was already adapted to the environment Its a lot more efficient than waiting around for evolution to do the job Heres how the very speculative story might have gone Modern humans evolve in Africa about  years ago and then start spreading across the globe encountering new environments and also other archaic human species like Neanderthals and Denisovans They mingle and mate trading genetic material Some inherit the EPAS gene Eventually some move up to high altitudes The ones with the EPAS gene thrive more at high altitude than those without it Over generations and generations the gene becomes more common in the population We probably have extinct human ancestors to thank and curse for a lot Denisovans and Neanderthals might have   modern human   and skin pigmentation but also to   like lupus and Crohns I think that its very clear from the work of the last few years that ancient archaic humans interbred with modern humans as modern humans expanded out of Africa  years ago says David Reich   at Harvard Medical School As with many studies of ancient genetics Reich cautions against jumping to conclusions What these authors show is that this genetic material is of archaic human origin and thats important says Reich But whether its of Denisovan or of Neanderthal or of some other archaic source thats not clear What is clear is that the genes of modern humans have elements of human species past We exchanged genes with a lot of other lineages that existed  years ago or  years ago says Nielsen We are in some sense mongrels made of DNA from many many different lineages of hominins In other words were mutts
