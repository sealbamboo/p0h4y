Most people would be wary of crossing a large snorting bull in a field but every year scores of people are injured or even killed by other animals in the English countryside  Many are creatures that may not instantly spring to mind  and have caused injury or terrified people who were otherwise enjoying a rural idyll  But which animals are dangerous and why do they attack Cows account for at least as many deaths as bulls  and can be very unpredictable particularly when young calves are close by Sarah Leonard a nurse from Sheffield survived being trampled   while with her dog in North Scarle Lincolnshire in November She suffered two broken arms a broken collar bone and several broken ribs and spent five weeks in hospital two of which were in intensive care Ms Leonard said I was on a four mile circular walk when I saw the cows coming towards me and I shouted and waved my arms  then I cant remember any more She described it as a terrifying experience and her ordeal was not helped when during a  call she was accused of being a hoaxer Lincolnshire farmer John Stone who has worked with cattle for  years said people did not realise how dangerous they could be The biggest danger is when there are cows with their calves he said You are talking about a cow which can weigh anything from kg to kg and quite frankly she will stop at nothing to protect her young Boars have roamed wild in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire since  when they were reintroduced after an absence of  years The animals which can weigh up to lbs kg were native to England but were hunted to extinction in the wild in the th Century Damage to gardens danger to dog walkers and riders and boarrelated road accidents have made them unpopular with some Last year the   reported dog walkers in the forest were scared to take their animals out after a rise in the number of wild boar attacks One account said a boar chased a dog before turning on the dogs owner  who scrambled up a tree to get away The Forestry Commission said it had received reports of dogs being attacked and horses being spooked by boar in the forest  Wild boar really arent dangerous if they are not put in a situation where they feel threatened says Scott Passmore cofounder of the UK Wild Boar Association  They are very timid but like any animal if they are fed they can become tame and thats when you run into problems He said boar would have lived in the wild alongside wolves in Britain so when they see a dog their reaction can be to stand and fight Adders are Britains only venomous snakes and use their venom to immobilise prey such as lizards and small mammals The NHS said about  cases of adder bites were reported in the UK every year  Since records began in  only  people have been reported as having died from adder bites and the last was way back in  Most bites occur between February and October with the number peaking during the summer However a number of dog deaths have been attributed to adder bites including a possible case in  In    including an English springer spaniel whose face swelled to twice its size Jim Foster from the Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust said there were usually three reasons why an adder might bite a human Either a person picks up  or attempts to pick up  the snake or the person accidentally steps on the snake or puts their hand very close while trying to do something else he said In all cases the adder is attempting to defend itself rather than attacking which is a common misconception Similarly adder bites on dogs tend to happen when dogs come across the snake and attempt to investigate it More than  deer are hit by cars each year according to the AA but the danger is not completely one way There have also been a number of cases of people being attacked by the animals In  a woman suffered facial injuries when a deer ran loose along Chelmsford High Street And in June several people were chased by deer trying to protect their fawns at Richmond Park in southwest London Dog walker Jack Birrell said he had seen quite a few peoplerunning for their lives during birthing season One man told him he was chased for  minutes and another couple said they had been chased by  hinds Several incidents of   southwest London have been reported in recent years One walkers bid to avoid a particularly aggressive animal in  ended with him climbing a tree Wild deer are normally timid animals and will move off quickly into cover when they have been disturbed by people says Dave Goffin of The British Deer Society However during the rutting season which for the three larger species of deer is in the autumn males with heightened testosterone levels can be more aggressive particular toward other intruding male deer People are warned to be cautious of approaching too close to deer during this period as they may be mistaken for rivals within a males rutting area The UKs most venomous spider is thought to have arrived in England in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the late th Century with the first reported sighting in Torquay in  The spider which is about the size of a p piece belongs to the same family as the black widow although its bite is nowhere near as toxic The severity of symptoms depends on the amount of venom injected but can include severe swelling chest pains and tingling of fingers  Alison Blackburn from Strood in Kent was bitten by one in January while sleeping and she needed hospital treatment to drain the venom from her left foot In another incident Steve Harris was bitten in his sleep in Devon and had to undergo an emergency operation He said They had to cut away the area around the bite to get at the poison I was in agony I have never had pain like that before in my life However Sara Goodacre from the University of Nottinghams Spider Lab said there seemed to be a disproportionate worry about the creatures She said some media reports of bites were not consistent with the effect a neurotoxin  present in a false widows venom  would have False widow spiders should not be a problem as they are not aggressive she added  The UK has about  species of spider and of these only about a dozen are capable of biting humans Perhaps one of the most underestimated creatures frequenting the countryside is the tick Experts have warned that ticks  bloodsucking diseasecarrying arachnids  appear to be on the rise Lyme disease an infection that can cause arthritis and even death if untreated can be transmitted to humans through its bite One victim Joanne Drayson was infected after walking in woods near her home in Guildford Surrey In  she remembers finding a tick on her foot which caused a rash At the same time she had flulike symptoms that lasted several weeks When Mrs Drayson was bitten again two years later she developed symptoms similar to arthritis but doctors still did not suspect that the ticks had infected her with Lyme disease Her health deteriorated to such an extent that she was unable to lift her legs or arms The pain in her hips meant she was unable to climb stairs in her own home  It was  before she was given a clinical diagnosis after her GP prescribed antibiotics for a chest infection and they dramatically improved her symptoms She said I had removed ticks from my dogs for over  years but didnt really know much about them There are probably thousands of people who could end up like me Official estimates put the number of new UK cases each year at around  but Lyme disease charities say the figure could be as high as  annually because so many people do not have their condition diagnosed However Richard Wall professor of Zoology at Bristol University said While its important to be aware of the risks  only a very small proportion of ticks carry Lyme disease  He added that ticks were most prevalent in areas with large numbers of their preferred host red deer
