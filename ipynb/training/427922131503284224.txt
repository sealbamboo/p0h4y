The scale and I have reached dtente That is I leave it alone and it affords me the same courtesy I rarely step on it and were both better off   I have earned the right of refusal As someone who weighed herself almost daily between the ages of  and  who spent six years at fat camps and traveled around the Middle East with a   I know I know  Ive done my time I wont even weigh myself at the doctors office Nothing good can come from the knowledge that Im three pounds lighter or two pounds heavier  People are obsessed with it  they go crazy over a tenth of a pound said Jim White a registered dietitian nutritionist and a spokesman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Ive had clients who are losing major inches and body fat and looking and feeling great but if the scale doesnt budge they get defeated The number defines them  I had pretty much been blessedly scalefree until a few months ago when I signed up for a monthlong twiceweekly fitness class Shedding pounds was not my goal I just wanted a good hard workout The instructor insisted on taking our before and after measurements including our weight and body fat percentages  I balked but after the teacher promised I wont tell you what it is I held my breath and shuffled onto the scale as if to the guillotine I was curious of course but I squeezed my eyes shut and didnt peek And that was the end of that  until a week later when I opened a group email from her and found a list of the entire classs names along with our weights and measurements A ball of rubber bands wove its way from my stomach and lodged in my throat   I thought  It seemed a major violation So many of us can recite the intimate details of our friends sex lives their pharmacological habits their rents But question their weights and their mouths clamp shut Not even the NSA knows that  How often do we ask someone what they weigh Unless you really know them well you dont said Allan Geliebter a senior researcher at The New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center at St LukesRoosevelt Hospital Center The last thing you tell someone is that they gained a lot of weight  After stewing about it I realized that I didnt really care if  strangers knew my weight I just didnt want to know  especially since it was about five pounds higher than I would have liked It haunted me  The teacher apologized But she said the weight was just a number The real thing you should worry about is body fat  Indeed most experts agree that body fat percentage is a better indicator of health than overall weight with obesity often defined as greater than  percent body fat in men and  percent in women Belly or visceral fat can be more harmful than the subcutaneous fat found directly under the skin and stored in the thighs and derriere  neither of which a traditional scale gauges Weight in itself is an imperfect measurement of health said Dr Philip Schauer director of the Cleveland Clinic Bariatric and Metabolic Institute Someone who is  pounds overweight and has mainly a pear shape can be pretty healthy You can be an apple shape and  pounds overweight and have diabetes    A quicker and more accurate assessment he said is measuring waist circumference  more than  inches for women or more than  inches for men is problematic  or using calipers to determine the amount of fat under the skin Those measurements tend to be more reliable than body mass index or BMI which   or take body shape into consideration  So if the scale is such a flawed measure why is it still so widely used  It can be an effective tool said Jennifer Linde an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities in Minneapolis It gives you feedback every day and you can coach people to look at the number as a neutral thing It doesnt have to be a value judgment Presuming its possible to look at it as a neutral thing some studies have shown that the more frequently you weigh yourself the better off you are at least in terms of weight control A sixmonth study of overweight and obese adults who were looking to lose weight   confirmed that sentiment During the study which included a mobile scale for daily weighing a webbased weight loss graph and weekly feedback from researchers participants who weighed themselves daily lost  pounds on average Those in the other group who weighed themselves weekly lost nothing  David A Levitsky a professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University who has conducted   since  believes that daily selfweighing is necessary to help prevent weight gain I dont see any way that we are going to tax fats or tax soda or have people exercise more in order to control their weight he said Theres enough data to show that doesnt work But if you step on that scale first thing in the morning thats protective of those subtle cues in our environment that make us eat a little more than we expend The best news at least for us scale avoiders is that most medical professionals agree that selfmonitoring  whether it is counting calories writing down how much one eats or weighing oneself regularly  is the greatest predictor of success Our task is to choose the thing that makes us the least crazy and stick with it  And that is why in the end I skipped getting weighed at my last exercise class There was no reason to I felt stronger my clothes fit better and that was enough for me  Abby Ellin is the author of
