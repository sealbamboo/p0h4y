This week we asked our readers for questions they have about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa For answers to some of the queries we turned to    vice president of the international board of   known by its French initialism MSF for Medecins Sans Frontieres Basic facts about the disease can also be found in our   If you have a question not answered here ask it in the comments below  We will consider additional questions in the week ahead Ebola was identified in  Episodically people come in contact with an animal that has the virus in it People theorize it could be bats Bats could have infected a monkey or some other bush meat we know that people do eat bush meat for nutrition and for that reason people come in contact with infected animals and Ebola is passed to humans Its passed from human to human through contact with blood and body fluids Viruses change and they can change over time But there are no reports or evidence Ebola has ever been transmitted any other way than through direct contact of bodily fluids Renal kidney liver or lung function can take quite some time to recover If a patient  goes into shock  it can affect the heart muscle and the heart  may not ever recover A shocklike state can decrease blood flow to the brain decrease oxygen cause some irreversible changes Each case is different Health care workers are at risk because of their proximity to sick people They have excellent  gear But despite the very best precautions we know individuals have been affected Among our staff at MSF facilities this has not happened We take extraordinary steps We buddy up two people and  they  really look out for each other There are methodical protocols for care of our patients I cant speak to what happened to health care workers who were infected I can imagine that all the supplies tools and resources for protection may not have been available at every clinic And its not always clear right at the start that a patient may have this illness versus something else T he initial manifestation of Ebola is not so different from other illnesses that cause high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms Survival rate is a range It depends on a lot of factors about the individual comorbidities other medical conditions when they came to the facility for care how advanced the virus was The  death rate can range up to  to  percent or as low as  percent in this particular outbreak The Zaire strain responsible for the current outbreak is going to have a higher case fatality rate than most other strains of Ebola The answer  to survival  considering all those other factors  is supportive care But there is not some particular intervention that we know of right now thats going to slow Ebola or reverse it We just need to support the bodys functions Hopefully over time the body can develop antibodies and mechanisms to reverse what the virus does But  Ebola  is a very bad actor  Even in the best locations its going to be very tough  for individuals to survive  To treat individuals in a resourcepoor center is even more challenging In our organization numbers are lower in terms of case fatality because of our experience early identification and comprehensive management But weve had a lot of deaths as well despite our very best efforts Our real interest is whats going on in West Africa I think the best answer is we have an excellent public health care system in the US a great capacity to quickly identify and isolate individuals to prevent transmission We dont see this as something that would happen here in the US I think I can say I dont think that an American epidemic is a likelihood I hope your readers are really going to keep the focus on whats happening in West Africa Cleaning agents that kill the virus are used We wash the room down spray it down take care of any bodily fluids and refuse Anything used in care of the patient has to be properly disposed of or incinerated Its a comprehensive methodical approach Its rigorous Theres no room for mistakes Two things One would be to convey the correct information about the disease And that the risks outside of Africa are not great The other thing if people feel so moved is to support organizations working hard to treat patients with this disease We at MSF are part of a response but we are at our maximum We have over  people working on this Weve been saying for quite some time there needs to be a comprehensive response WHO now recognizes this and is developing plans for each country affected Ebola is a deep public health concern thats happening now Its shocking its scary and its progressing Its a disease that typically is not on this scale And its a disease that we dont have a lot of ability to respond to I can understand why people are so fearful even if the numbers of those infected or dead are not as high as for malaria or tuberculosis But I dont think Ebola should take away from the focus we have on other illnesses We continue to work on diseases like malaria and respiratory illness I dont think its one over the other
