Garlic is delicious But if you consume enough of it its stench can repel not only vampires but any person within a foot radius Whats behind garlic breath that makes it so offensive In a video the folks at the American Chemical Society and the chemistry blog   lay out the chemicals responsible for the odor Chopping or crushing garlic releases the compound allicin which then breaks down into four other smelly compounds The most mischievous of them is allyl methyl sulfide which can linger in your body for a long time It not only causes your breath to go rank but as it seeps into your bloodstream it also gets into your sweat and pee It can be incredibly difficult to get rid of the stench once youve ingested this chemical Humans and animals are exquisitely sensitive to the most tiny amounts of sulfur compounds says   a professor of chemistry at the State University of New York in Albany and the author of  Once you metabolize these compounds the smell goes away Block tells The Salt But that can take a while  up to two days though it varies in each person Some people can break it down quickly but Im not one of those he says Im a garlic lover and my wife  who has an excellent sense of smell  says even  hours after eating a garlic meal she can smell it on my skin Some   suggests that the fat in milk may help us break down the allyl methyl sulfide more quickly The ACS video also suggests parsley But these sorts of remedies may be iffy Block says instead he recommends masking garlic with other strong smells Citrus can help says   a horticulturist at Texas AM University but thats based on anecdotal evidence Garlic  especially when its eaten raw  is good for you Patil says Maybe eat it at night he says That way you can also lead a social life But if youre gorging on garlic because you think itll quash your cold or reduce your risk of getting cancer dont get your hopes up too much Some preliminary   show that garlics antimicrobial properties may benefit our health Patil says And epidemiological studies that look at countries where people consume a lot of garlic   that it may reduce the risk of developing cancer But he says We need to do more analysis We need to really understand the role of these compounds in garlic  both good and bad And since garlic is so pungent most of us probably dont eat enough to actually reap any major health benefits Block says It does stop the spread of disease in at least one way though Block says As I once heard a comedian say by eating garlic youll have such bad breath that no one wants to come near you
