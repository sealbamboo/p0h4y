Here are sample playlists put together from my own admittedly limited library each one arced for a particular purpose Then I asked a few folks who can   pick out a tune to share their sample lists Its siesta time I feel myself lapsing into food coma eyelids drooping and motivation flagging Flo Ridas sunny dance beats shake me awake and LMFAOsdriving base gets me going Calvin Harris evens out the energy level and Cypress Hills vibrant melodies with Marc Anthonys soaring vocals send my spirits flying Good Feeling by Flo Rida Party Rock Anthem by LMFAO Feel So Close by Calvin Harris Armada Latina by Cypress Hill featuring Marc Anthony and Pitbull It takes me a step or two to transition from a ball of stress into lounge mode Electric Feel by MGMT may be highenergy for some but its otherworldly lyrics and sound transport me far from my troubles Buffalo Springfields pensive lyrics bring the energy down and Nikka Costas laidback funk tells me to take it easy Then I float away on Zero s dreamy cloud of electronica Electric Feel by MGMT For What Its Worth by Buffalo Springfield Like a Feather by Nikka Costa In the Waiting Line by Zero  When I want to push my limits the Heavys vengeful driving funk can send me sprinting Gwen Stefani eggs me on when I start to flag David Guettas dance beats set a steady pace  but ultimately I rely on Daft Punks relentless house beats to take me into the home stretch How You Like Me Now by the Heavy What You Waiting For by Gwen Stefani Memories by David Guetta featuring Kid Cudi Touch It by Daft Punk I wake up really early in the morning
