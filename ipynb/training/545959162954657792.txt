Christmas is coming Around the world people who celebrate the end of the year holidays are taking time off and heading home to see friends and relatives They include aid workers fighting Ebola in Sierra Leone Liberia and Guinea And they include residents of the three countries hardest hit by the   It worries Dr Dan Kelly And officials in Sierra Leone were concerned enough to limit public gatherings for the holidays The way Sierra Leoneans celebrate the holiday is traveling back to their home villages said Kelly a founder of the nonprofit Wellbody Alliance whos been working in Sierra Leone since the epidemic began Right now Ebola is raging out of control in Sierra Leones capital of Freetown Its barely under control in outlying  and   The epidemic started as people traveled across the regions porous borders and this will be the first Christmas and New Year holiday since the epidemic started You have a couple of million people in Freetown and Id say plus percent of those people in Freetown are interested in traveling back to remote villages for the holidays Kelly told NBC News And theyll spend a week there added Kelly whos worked in Sierra Leone on and off since  It could spread Ebola all around the country and just create hundreds of hotspots for sure Sierra Leones president Ernest Bai Koroma says travel between all parts of the country has been restricted as part of Operation Western Area Surge an effort to get a handle on the epidemic He says public gatherings will be strictly controlled in the runup to Christmas Kelly is skeptical about how well that might work They cant control it completely he said And the holiday spirit might work in other ways to disrupt efforts to control the virus I think there will be tension between international community trying to go go go and the local Sierra Leoneans just trying to spend time with their families and just do what they do every Christmas Its natural Kelly said There is going to be less surveillance activity Things are going to slow down in a way that may let Ebola speed up Dr Darin Portnoy vice president of the international board of Medecins Sans Frontieres MSF or Doctors Without Borders agrees its a worry I think there is every reason to be concerned about what will happen with people getting together and moving around over the holidays Portnoy told NBC News The whole reason that the disease has been able to move around in part is because of common borders roads that connect countries relationships between families  especially in areas where these borders come together added Portnoy who is also an attending physician at Montefiore Hospital in New York The current epidemic of Ebola started as an outbreak in Guinea and was carried to Sierra Leone and later to Liberia by people whose relationships predate the current borders Ebola had never been seen in West Africa before but viral hemorrhagic fevers are not uncommon at all  theres Lassa and dengue and malaria causes similar symptoms also  so people had no idea that this one was different Ebola has infected close to  people and killed  of them Officials hope to have it under control by the middle of next year but say itll take a concerted effort to do so Sierra Leone is mostly Muslim but at least a quarter of the population is Christian and the ChristmasNew Year holiday is popular Liberias majority Christian and while Guinea is mostly Muslim the former French colony celebrates Christmas as a national holiday All it takes to set off a new series of cases is one person who is infected with the Ebola virus but not yet sick travelling to another place falling ill there and passing the virus on to others said Kathryn Jacobsen a professor of global health epidemiology at George Mason University It happened just last month in Sierra Leones eastern province of Kono which had only seen the occasional Ebola case Then it flared up at the end of November overwhelming hospital workers We had a surge We had an Ebola surge said Kelly who called in help from the CDC World Health Organization and British military to help get it under control But Dr Peter Kilmarx country director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Zimbabwe is less concerned I know theyve been talking about banning holiday gatherings he said But he added the epidemic may have gone past the point where travel would affect it Theres cases everywhere anyway he said
