Editors note This story was originally published on September   but is newly relevant after Donald Trumps remark yesterday that if abortion is made illegal women who have the procedure should be punished He subsequently retracted the comment But the idea of punishing women whove had an illegal abortion isnt so farfetched in some parts of the world The storys coauthor Jason Beaubien writes In El Salvador and several other Latin American countries abortion is illegal including in cases of rape But it doesnt appear to stop women and girls from seeking the procedure In San Salvador there is still a bustling trade in misoprostol a drug that will terminate an early term pregnancy Vendors in the market sell herb concoctions that claim to do the same Informal networks link women with gynecologists who will perform abortions on the sly Salvadorans who can afford it fly to Miami for the procedure Groups that favor abortion rights say the criminalization of abortion pushes it into the shadows and makes a simple medical procedure far more dangerous for women Doctors complain that it forces them to report women suspected of having terminated their pregnancies to the police This story I produced with John Poole looks at one other side of this story What happens if someone is falsely convicted of having an abortion  Christina Quintanillas nightmare with El Salvadors abortion law began on Oct   Quintanilla was  at the time and seven months pregnant with her second child She was living in her mothers apartment and that night she couldnt get comfortable Her belly was bulging her back was aching and her stomach was upset I felt  I dont how to describe it  a pain a terrible pain she says through a translator And then I felt like I couldnt breathe like I was drowning Quintanilla says she went into labor but soon passed out The next thing she remembered was her mom picking her up from a pool of blood on the bathroom floor Both she and her mother Carmen say the baby was stillborn No one came after Carmen called  so a neighbor sent Quintanilla to the public hospital When she woke up it wasnt doctors who greeted her but criminal investigators They had come to arrest her on charges of murdering her child I was shocked by what he had said she recalls I didnt have any words I couldnt say anything Latin America has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world with some exceptions for rape cases or if the mothers health is in danger But abortion is completely banned in El Salvador The law recognizes a fetus as a human being from the moment of conception In a   last year of a pregnant woman with lupus the Salvadoran Supreme Court refused to allow her an abortion despite her doctors saying carrying the baby to term could endanger her life  A woman accused of terminating a pregnancy in El Salvador can face up to  years in prison The law also requires doctors nurses and other medical professionals to report suspected abortions In Quintanillas case an anonymous hospital worker had called the police and accused Quintanilla of having an abortion As a result she was dragged into a court case that lasted almost  months She and her family members say theyd been eagerly awaiting the birth of her second child Theyd even had a baby shower for her Quintanilla says emphatically that she did not kill her baby The hospital had found no evidence that she had intentionally aborted the pregnancy But the district attorney pushed forward anyway arguing that Quintanilla had terminated the pregnancy because she couldnt support another child During the trial Quintanilla says her public defender was awful and couldnt even remember her name In the end she was sentenced to  years in prison She served four years before a young lawyer stumbled across her case and managed to get her sentence overturned He argued successfully that no one ever established the cause of her babys death Quintanilla is now back in her home in the eastern city of San Miguel She lives with her yearold son Daniel and her daughter Alexandra who was born after she was released from prison Threeyearold Alexandra is a whirlwind of energy and they simply call her la reina or the queen Quintanilla says her life postprison is peaceful I look after my children and my family I help out my relatives she says I end up with a little extra money and thats the good life I now have
