When we   Tammy Boudreaux a freelance social worker in Houston last December she was still weighing her health insurance options She told us she was overwhelmed and confused by the choices she was finding on HealthCaregov And the high deductibles of the Obamacare plans didnt seem like such a great deal But when we checked back in with Boudreaux this month we learned that a chance encounter with a bottle of hot sauce ultimately changed her mind Last fall Boudreaux  was uninsured  and wielding a knife She was cutting the wax seal off a bottle of hot sauce when it slipped and stabbed deep into her index finger Boudreaux went to the emergency room right away and paid out of pocket to get it stitched up Still at that point Boudreaux didnt see any urgency shes relatively healthy and figured a plan with a high deductible would be a financial burden The holidays came and went and she remained undecided about whether to buy insurance Meanwhile her finger wasnt getting better I couldnt grab a shovel when I wanted to garden she told us in a recent followup interview I couldnt grab small items and the keyboard  I could not use my finger on the keyboard Not only that but the finger hurt A minor accident had become a major problem I cant get by she realized Its my finger  its a pretty serious injury And Im relatively young I dont want to live the rest of my life with this impediment if I dont have to But getting more treatment could be expensive So Boudreaux chose a plan with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas that cost  per month The plan started Feb  and within a week she was getting surgery to repair her finger After the procedure came weeks of rehabilitation at Houston Methodist where she still sees hand therapist Peggy Boineau Were going to look at strength today Boineau told Boudreau at a recent visit slowly talking her through the steps Turn your hand this way Straighten that joint The two women laughed as Boudreaux had trouble flicking tiny beads into a plastic bucket an exercise to loosen the finger joint Boudreau pays a  copay for each therapy session Beyond that she has to meet a  annual   before the insurance begins to cover her medical care But Boudreaux now says its worth it and she believes that if other uninsured Texans had just pushed through the difficulties of signing up theyd be as pleased as she is now Im really impressed that Obama started this she says I think hes going to be viewed similar to President Lyndon Johnson with his focus on social issues which is good Louis Adams a spokesman for Blue Cross Blue Shield points out that twothirds of Texans who enrolled on the federal website chose one of his companys plans Were pleased to know that Tammy and so many others looking for health insurance that best suits their individual needs chose us and are giving us the opportunity to be with them when they need that coverage he says In Texas only about a quarter of people   for a new health plan actually did so Open enrollment for  begins
