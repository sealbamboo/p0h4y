Doctors should start telling sexually active teenage boys who arent circumcised that if they have the surgery they can reduce their risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections from their female partners federal health officials propose  Similar counseling is urged for adult heterosexual men who remain uncircumcised and for expectant parents who will be making a decision about newborn circumcision if they have a boy according to the new recommendations proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Most American boys are circumcised as newborns but the percentage of parents having their infants circumcised in hospitals has fallen in recent years even as evidence from African studies suggests that it may be protective  Circumcision has also come under fire in part because babies cannot give their consent to the operation with some critics saying the practice constitutes genital mutilation The draft of the recommendations which will undergo peer review and be subject to public comments for  days before being finalized note that teenage boys should be counseled along with their parents and have a say in the decisionmaking process an element that may neutralize some opposition  Our role is to provide accurate information so people can make informed decisions said Dr Jonathan Mermin director of the National Center for HIVAIDS at the CDC The first thing its important to know is that male circumcision has been associated with a  to  percent reduction of HIV transmission as well as a reduction in sexually transmitted infections such as herpes bacterial vaginosis and the human papilloma virus HPV which causes penile and cervical cancer Dr Mermin said He emphasized however that circumcision did not entirely eliminate the risk of infections and circumcised men must continue to take other precautions such as using condoms and limiting sexual partners  Whether teenage American boys or men will be persuaded to go under the knife is another question The CDCs own background report summarizing the scientific evidence cited a consumer study that found that only  percent of  heterosexual uncircumcised adult men said that they were likely or very likely to undergo circumcision even if told it would reduce their risk of HIV More than  percent said they were unlikely or very unlikely to undergo circumcision Its hard to imagine very many adolescents deciding to have a circumcision done said Dr Douglas S Diekema a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics task force on circumcision which in  changed its neutral stance on infant male circumcision to say that the health benefits outweighed the risks That report stopped short of recommending routine circumcision for baby boys While older adults may be more likely to opt for circumcision  especially if they are engaged in a lot of risky sexual behavior Dr Diekema said Its a difficult thing to get the adolescent brain to make that kind of calculation The conversation itself may also be extremely awkward for health care providers and their young patients he said The CDC report notes that circumcision also has risks that increase with age An analysis found that fewer than  percent of newborns suffer complications from a circumcision compared with  percent of children age  to  years and  percent of those  and older including adults The most common complications included bleeding inflammation the need for corrective procedures and wounds although there was no specific data about the rate of complications for teenagers While circumcision may protect men from infection by HIVpositive women it does not protect women from infection by men and there is no definitive data that it protects men who have sex with men from infection  Critics who oppose circumcision pointed out that the randomized clinical trials on which the CDC is basing its recommendations were done in subSaharan Africa where heterosexual transmission of HIV is far more common than in the United States Only about one in  new HIV infections in the United States are transmitted heterosexually according to the CDC report  Georganne Chapin founding director of Intact America a national group that opposes circumcision argued that the United States had historically had much higher rates of circumcision than European countries but we still had comparable or even higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases than in European countries where there is virtually no circumcision
