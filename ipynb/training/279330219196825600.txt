Want to be more creative Drop that iPad and head to the great outdoors Thats the word from   a cognitive neuroscientist who studies multitasking at the University of Utah He knew that every time he went into the southern Utah desert far from cellular service he started to think more clearly But he wanted to know if others had the same experience To find out he first sent students out into nature with computers to test their attention spans It was an abysmal failure Strayer says The students didnt want to be anywhere near the computers Worse still he says the light of the computer screen attracts moths and ants and things People were having to fight insects So much for that experiment Next he discussed the problem with a group of other cognitive neuroscientists including   who studies creativity at the University of Kansas Before embarking on a backpacking trip in a Utah canyon the group took a simple pencilandpaper creativity quiz the socalled   which asks people to identify word associations that arent immediately obvious Four days into the trip they took the test again I had no real expectations Strayer told Shots But we got a  percent improvement Thats a striking effect Striking but hardly scientific The scores could have improved because the researchers had already taken the test once So Strayer connected with   and outdoor leadership program and asked if he could use their students as test subjects Outward Bound is notoriously strict about bringing artifacts of modern life into the wilderness Not only are students not allowed to bring iPods or laptops they cant even bring a book Half of the  hikers took the test before going backpacking in the wilderness and the other half took the RAT test on the fourth day of their trip The groups went into the wild in Alaska Colorado Maine and Washington The people who took the test four days into the wilderness did  percent better than those who were still immersed in modern life The study is   in the online journal   Whats behind the difference Strayer thinks there are probably a few things involved One is exposure to nature over a number of days which has been shown in other studies to improve thinking Strenuous exercise probably helped too though all the Outward Bound participants were young and fit Another factor may well be abandoning electronic devices He studies multitasking and driver distraction and says constant texting and checking in on Facebook are not making us think more clearly Strayer now wants to find out what happens in the brains of those people whose creativity seems inspired by nature Hes going to bring portable   equipment into the wild to measure brain activity and other gear to measure changes in their blood All important work of course But this may be one case where theres no need to wait for definitive proof Strayer says he finds some of his clearest thinking happens on his daily walk to work
