Sleep Parents crave it but children and especially teenagers need it When educators and policymakers debate the relationship between sleep schedules and school performance and   given the constraints of buses sports and everything else that seem so much more important  what they should do about it they miss an intimate biological fact Sleep is learning of a very specific kind Scientists now argue that a primary purpose of sleep is learning consolidation separating the signal from the noise and flagging what is most valuable   School schedules change slowly if at all and the burden of helping teenagers get the sleep they need is squarely on parents Can we help our children learn to exploit sleep as a learning tool while getting enough of it  Absolutely There is research suggesting that different kinds of sleep can aid different kinds of learning and by teaching sleep study skills we can let our teenagers enjoy the sense that theyre gaming the system  Sleep isnt merely rest or downtime the brain comes out to play when head meets pillow A full nights sleep includes a large dose of several distinct brain states including REM sleep  when the brain flares with activity and dreams  and the netherworld of deep sleep when it whispers to itself in a language that is barely audible Each of these states developed to handle one kind of job so getting sleep isnt just something you should do or need Its far more Its your best friend when you want to get really good at something youve been working on   So you want to remember your Spanish vocabulary or How I Met Your Mother trivia or Red Sox batting averages Easy Hit the hay at your regular time dont stay up late checking Instagram Studies have found that the first half of the night contains the richest dose of socalled deep sleep  the knockedoutcold variety  and this is when the brain consolidates facts and figures and new words This is retention territory and without it if we stay up too late were foggier the next day on those basic facts I explained this to my daughter Flora who was up until  am or later on many school nights  starting in high school She ignored it or seemed to Learning Arabic is what turned her around I think She wants to be good at it and having to learn not only a new vocabulary but also a completely different writing system is in the beginning all retention I started going to bed earlier before the day of Arabic tests partly for that reason Flora said when reached by text But also of course I didnt want to be tired Just as the first half of a nights sleep is rich with deep slumber the second half is brimming with socalled Stage  sleep the kind that consolidates motor memory the stuff that aspiring musicians and athletes need This is not an excuse to sleep through Period  Rather its a reason not to roll out of bed too early and miss the bodys chance to refine all those skills learned while kicking a soccer ball off the garage or practicing dance moves  For an older teenage student these two learning stages of sleep offer something more a means of being tactical about sleep before an important test or performance If its a French test then turn off the lights at your normal time and get up early to study If its a music recital do the opposite stay up a little later preparing and sleep in to your normal time in the morning If youre going to burn the candle its good to know which end to burn it on  Math tests strain both memory retention and understanding comprehension This is where REM sleep the dreaming kind comes in Studies find that REM is exceptionally good for deciphering hidden patterns comprehension and seeing a solution to a hard problem If the test is mostly a memory challenge multiplication tables formulas then go to sleep at the usual time and get up early for prep But if its hard problems then its REM you want Stay up a little later and get the full dose of dreamrich sleep which helps the brain see hidden patterns  By all means Napping is sleep too and its a miniature version of a full nights slumber An hourlong nap typically contains deep sleep REM and some Stage  One caution napping can interfere with some childrens sleep schedule and its important to make sure day sleep doesnt scramble the full serving at night But the central point is that a sensation of exhaustion during a period of work is the brains way of saying OK Ive studied or practiced now its time to digest this material and finish the job  If a child can nap without losing a handle on his or her natural sleep rhythm then let it happen  The upshot is that for any young student who wants to do better  in school in sports in music or even in the social whirl yes thats learning too  knowing the science of sleep will help them respect slumber for what it is learning consolidation Of the best and most natural kind
