Prescription painkillers are among the most widely used drugs in America In the decade since   reporter Barry Meier began investigating their use and abuse he says he has seen the number of people dying from overdoses quadruple  an increase Meier calls staggering The current statistic is that about  people a year die of overdoses involving prescription narcotics  Its a huge problem The number of people dying from these drugs is second only to the number of people that die in car accidents he tells  s Terry Gross Meiers new ebook   is published by The New York Times Co and explores opiate painkillers and the consequences of longterm use He focuses in particular on OxyContin  how it came to be prescribed for chronic pain what the consequences have been and how it became a street drug Meier explains how in its initial form OxyContin was designed as a timereleased version of oxycodone  meant to ease pain for many hours at a time without interruption It became a street drug when people looking to get high found a way to get around the timerelease design of the pill All you needed to do was to crush it chew it grind it down Meier says and basically the entire narcotic pain reducing load that was contained within the drug was released immediately which is why it was such a powerful high and such an addictive drug when it was abused that way Meiers previous book  was published in  He explains that for patients part of the danger when it comes to the longterm medical use of painkillers like OxyContin comes from the bodys ability to develop a tolerance for it Unlike many other types of medications where you can be prescribed a dosage and stay on that dosage for a long time Meier says your body adapts to these drugs Essentially you require more of the narcotic to get the same  effect And what happens is a steady escalation in dosage and it can keep going and going and going and going to the point where after a year or two of treatment you are on extremely high levels of these drugs That doesnt mean however that Meier is unilaterally opposed to these narcotics There is no question that these drugs are extremely beneficial he tells Gross They are valuable vital drugs There should be no hesitation in their use after conditions like surgery or accidents or cancer treatment or endoflife use  The question becomes How effective are these drugs in longterm treatment of chronic pain The company that produces OxyContin  Purdue Pharma  launched  an innovative and huge campaign to introduce drugs that had previously been used for cancer treatment into use for the relief of general pain That involved training hundreds of doctors to go out and speak to their medical colleagues about the benefits of these drugs and most importantly the FDA allowed Purdue to make an unusual claim  that because OxyContin was a timerelease drug it would be less prone to causing addiction and less attractive to people who abuse drugs This became part of a steady drumbeat that was sounded by not only the company but by leading pain experts  that in fact with this drug we had what was really a unique new weapon to deal with an ageold problem The first person who sounded the alarm about this was a doctor in Boston Her name is Jane Ballantyne and she was the head of pain treatment at Massachusetts General In  she had accepted that these drugs were beneficial She was a soldier in this war on pain and as she kind of walked around Mass General she started seeing things that caught her attention For example chronic pain patients who were given these drugs started improving They would improve for a while and suddenly their improvement would stop Their pain would return They would lose function or the improvement in function they had achieved would be lost and she began to wonder why this was going on That led her to start studying animal tests involving these drugs and basically began to lead her to question whether these drugs were really beneficial for patients in the long term I had a doctor who I greatly respect who said We thought the great problem with these drugs is addiction What we didnt realize was that the people who take them would opt out of life And you see it across the spectrum One of the more startling things is in the area of workplace injuries things like back strains are very common problems But what folks have discovered is the more patients  workers  who are treated with these drugs for back strain the longer and longer and longer they stay away from work In fact weve kind of created a legion of chronically unemployed people who are dependent on these drugs If you look at the atlas of how drugs are prescribed in different parts of the country there usually is a pretty straight correlation between the use of narcotic painkillers and areas where you have physical labor jobs like mining farming logging  places where people get a lot of back problems and muscle injuries and things of that nature In many of these areas you have doctors who are generalists theyre not specialists So most folks are going to a general practitioner  a family doctor  and when they were told that OxyContin was a less abusable drug than drugs that had preceded it they said Great This sounds like a good thing for my patients So they started prescribing it very heavily You basically had these pain clinics with doctors that supposedly specialized in treating pain These in fact were doctors who had no experience in treating pain These are essentially clinics where you could walk in and the doctor would say How do you feel Im in pain I think OxyContin would work for me And the doctor would write your prescription You would pay cash for the appointment and the cycle would start And these  proliferated throughout the US
