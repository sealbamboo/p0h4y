Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam on Monday announced a plan to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act in a deal aimed at extending insurance coverage to hundreds of thousands of poor residents.. The news comes after months of wrestling between Mr. Haslam and the Obama administration. If finalized, it would make Tennessee the 28th state to expand Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for the poor, to residents with incomes near the federal poverty level.
