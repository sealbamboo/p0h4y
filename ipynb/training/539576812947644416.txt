My yearold father died recently after a sudden heart attack I ought to have been prepared for the five days my mother brother and I spent with him in the cardiac intensive care unit because I teach medical ethics at a university and I am a member of a hospital ethics committee and have discussed many difficult endoflife cases But much of what happened  and what didnt happen  came as a surprise to me  My father got excellent care his medical needs were attended to around the clock and he received every available intervention What I wished we had had though was a conversation with his physicians about endoflife possibilities right from the beginning  When my dad collapsed at a restaurant the manager rushed over and performed CPR but my dad stopped breathing several times during the resuscitation The EMTs shocked his heart six times in the four blocks between the restaurant and the hospital During his five days in intensive care he never achieved consciousness  Doctors induced therapeutic hypothermia a kind of deep freeze to reduce the risk of brain injury by decreasing the brains oxygen demand and then warmed him gradually over the next day or so His eyes opened but never focused he never looked at us or spoke again but it was as if he was imploring Why am I still here I just told you yesterday what I wanted if I was ever in this situation  And indeed he had Just the day before his heart attack our family had a prescient conversation about endoflife decisions We all heard my dad say very plainly that he did not want any heroic measures to be kept alive and that he would not want to live with any physical or mental incapacities Not even a wheelchair my brother asked No my dad replied Nothing  And so when I arrived at the hospital the day after the heart attack and saw my dad hooked up to a ventilator to keep him breathing a blood pump to keep his blood pressure up an EEG machine to assess brain function and an assortment of maybe a dozen IV medications and fluids dripping into his body I recoiled not so much at the horror of the sight but from the sad realization that he probably should have been left to die at the restaurant My father would have been even more horrified than I was at his predicament But theres always hope Right And because of that sliver of hopefulness we kept him on those machines for five days through the freezing and the thawing the neurological assessments the administration of one drug and then another to control this and that  What I hadnt considered before my fathers heart attack was the precise meaning of not wanting to live hooked up to machines When people say that its unclear whether they mean that they dont want to live for the rest of their days in this condition or that they dont want to live for even a few weeks like that The question of how long is one we would all do well to consider If my fathers body improved enough to stay alive without the machines but he never regained consciousness then he would be doomed to what he most wanted to avoid Honoring my dads wishes meant taking him off the ventilator while we still had that option  The timing was key but no one explained this or advised us how to determine when the time would be right We now shudder that because of hope we were slow to see this choice and might so easily have missed it  On the fourth day my fathers cardiologist told us that despite some improvements toward stability the big picture was terrible Though no one can predict the future we grasped that a full recovery was unlikely and so we decided to let my dad die  With the feeding tube removed the ventilator detached and the multicolored EEG leads no longer emerging from his scalp my mother could comb my fathers hair and he looked relaxed as the morphine and Ativan dripped slowly into his veins He slept through the night and died peacefully the next morning Though hospital staff proved mostly supportive we were jarred by the careless comment of one resident who entered the room and pronounced I dont think you gave him enough of a chance To hear this moralizing judgment after the fact seemed unhelpful and even cruel For many families such words would have been devastating  The biggest lesson I have learned is that every family should not only discuss endoflife wishes but should act on them by filling out an advance directive If my father had completed one his end might have played out differently By the time we told the medical staff that he didnt want to be hooked up to machines he already was and we acquiesced in letting things take their course with the hope that he might improve  I can appreciate doctors reluctance to talk to families immediately about a patients ultimate demise No one wants to dash hopes for recovery But confronting the end from the beginning might alleviate some of the inevitable feelings of guilt that arise when people make the decision to end life support Injecting a healthy pessimism  or realism  gives loved ones an opportunity to broaden the scope of their hope to stretch hope in a way that accommodates a better death
