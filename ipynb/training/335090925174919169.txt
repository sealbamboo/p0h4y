Perhaps youve noticed a toddlers sagging swim diaper and wondered if its really keeping the poop out of your neighborhood pool The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has the answer for you no Last summer researchers at the federal public health agency collected  filter samples from public swimming pools in the Atlanta area More than half of those samples  percent were contaminated with   That the CDC reported today signifies that swimmers introduced fecal matter into pool water Toddlers who arent toilet trained are just one source of the problem according to the study which was   in the latest   People who dont shower with soap before swimming bring   on their backsides the CDC reports And people who swim while sick with diarrhea are much more likely to introduce     and other yucky germs into the water That takes some of the shine off the opening of summer pool season doesnt it Fortunately a properly chlorinated pool can kill  quickly So if your local pool is doing a good job maintaining chlorine and pH levels that takes care of that problem The testing method used in this study couldnt tell if the   was alive or had already been killed And no outbreaks of poolrelated disease were reported last summer in Atlanta Wondering why the lifeguards kick you out of the pool for  minutes after a fecal incident Thats the amount of time the CDC   to make sure that   by far the most common fecal pathogen has been killed Other bugs are a lot harder to kill unfortunately It can take  minutes to kill   which causes diarrhea in a pool chlorinated with  part per million of free chlorine But it can take more than a day to kill   even with  times as much chlorine The CDC wants you to   by showering before you get in the pool Children should be taken to the bathroom every hour and diapers should be checked and changed at least that often Most important stay out of the pool when suffering from diarrhea Oh and the CDC knows you pee in the pool too The nitrogen in urine depletes free chlorine in pool water making it harder to kill germs Nitrogen also converts the chlorine into a form that irritates the eyes and lungs So stop doing that But this subject isnt a complete bummer Its given us here at Shots an excuse to revisit the classic   from the  movie Caddyshack Enjoy
