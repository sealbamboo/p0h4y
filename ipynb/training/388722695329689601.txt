Obamacare "is not about politics. It's about dignity." , Out2Enroll worked with the administration to make sure the Obamacare law is completely LGBT inclusive.  , In years past, insurance companies were not required to allow coverage of domestic partners.

But to get covered by January 1 -- the deadline for everyone in the country to have insurance -- you must pay for a policy by December 15.

There are so many opportunities here." , Unemployed since June, Jeff Jones is covered by , ,, but it, comes with a steep price tag of a couple hundred dollars a month., "I'm starting to realize just how good my policy was through work," Jones said.  "I used to only pay $26 a month, now next to my mortgage this is the biggest bill I have." , Jones says he will continue shopping around for the policy that will work best for him.  He said the system crashed a couple of times when he was looking at it, but the navigators he called were nice.  They, too, struggled to help, since their computers also kept crashing.  Jones says he is undeterred., "I'm pretty optimistic it will work," Jones said. "And I will feel better knowing that I'm covered."
