At age  many young children are just beginning to explore their artistic style The kid I used to babysit in high school preferred selfportraits undoubtedly inspired by the later works of Joan Miro My cousin a prolific young artist worked almost exclusively on still lifes of wheelers These early works may be good for more than decorating your refrigerator and cubicle researchers say There appears to be an association though a modest one between how a child draws at  and her thinking skills at  according to a   published in the journal   The findings dont mean parents should worry if their little ones arent producing masterpieces early on But the study suggests that intellectual and artistic skills may be related to each other in a way that reveals something about the influence of our genes Researchers from Kings College London enlisted  pairs of yearold identical and fraternal twins in England to draw pictures of a child The researchers scored each drawing on a scale of  to  based on how many body parts were included All of the kids also took verbal and nonverbal intelligence tests at  and  Kids with higher drawing scores tended to do better on the intelligence tests though the two were only moderately linked And that was expected says   a cognitive geneticist who led the study while at the Kings College Institute of Psychiatry The drawing test researchers used was first   in the s to measure childrens cognition And studies have shown the test to be   but not always   In a surprise to the researchers the drawings and the test results from identical twins who share all their genes were more similar to one another than those from fraternal twins who share only half their genes We had thought any siblings who were raised in the same home would be quite similar Arden tells Shots The findings add to the growing body of evidence that suggests genes can play a role in both artistic and cognitive ability she says This doesnt mean that a childs genetic predisposition necessarily hurts his or her chances of succeeding in artistic and intellectual endeavors Arden says As   have shown countless factors affect a persons abilities  and genes are only one of them How would Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko have done on the drawing test when they were kids Arden says she and her colleagues are trying to figure out whether judging the childrens art in some other way maybe based on creativity instead of accuracy would reveal something different about their intelligence But we shouldnt assume that these abstract masters couldnt draw realistically Arden says Picasso was a prodigy   everything from birds to busts with amazing accuracy at a young age In fact the artist famously said he easily learned to draw like Raphael when he was young but it took him a lifetime to learn to draw like a child The most amazing thing about the drawings collected for this study is that they represent such a range of both ability and style Arden says I had a fantastic time looking through them
