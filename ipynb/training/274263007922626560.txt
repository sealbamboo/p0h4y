Before Secretary of State Hilary Rodham Clinton passes the reins to her successor shes got a few loose ends to tie up One of them is mapping out the USs continuing efforts to combat AIDS around the world So today she unveiled a   for what she called an AIDSfree generation Now Clinton isnt talking about ending the HIV pandemic altogether Rather she hopes to prevent most new infections from occurring in the first place and to stop HIVpositive people from developing AIDS As we continue to drive down the number of new infections and drive up the number of people on treatment we will get ahead of the pandemic and an AIDSfree generation will be in sight she told an audience of AIDS advocates and government officials at the state department Just last week UNAIDS   that over the past decade the rate of new HIV infections has dropped by more than half in  low and middle income countries most of them in subSaharan Africa And the US has helped to get  million people on antiretroviral treatment over the past four years Yet despite this encouraging news some public health leaders are skeptical that an AIDSfree generation is a realistic goal right now We are still a very long way from that   an HIV specialist at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa tells Shots Its still at this point aspirational and its good to have aspirations The goal of stopping new infections became theoretically possible just a year ago when a study showed that antiretroviral treatments dramatically reduce a persons risk of transmitting the virus to others But the jury is still out on whether the drugs will have the same effect in the real world outside of a study Rees says We certainly know that when you lower peoples viral loads through treatment the chance of their infecting another person is massively reduced she says referring to the amount of HIV in the blood But we dont know if that sort of scenario will occur at the same rate as if we did testandtreat in the general population Clintons AIDS blueprint hinges heavily on a treatment as prevention strategy Indeed the Presidents Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief or   is spending millions of dollars to see if it will in South Africa Tanzania and Botswana health economist   of the Center for Global Development tells Shots He says it will take several years to get the results And thats one reason he says that its premature to have as an objective achieving an AIDSfree generation The tipping point for AIDS Over says will be when the number of new infections is lower than the number of people dying from HIV Once that happens the total number of HIV positive people would begin to decline Thats not the case now he says In fact the gap is widening as we speak Over also worries that there arent enough resources right now to treat enough people to achieve a decline in infection rates by treatment alone Indeed Clintons blueprint also involves other types of HIV prevention strategies including male circumcision condom distribution and stopping transmission from mother to child These approaches in combination with treatment drops the number of new infections quite precipitously the US Global AIDS Coordinator   tells Shots So much so that we have dropped the percentage of new infections over the last  to  years from  to  percent in most of subSaharan Africa So what will all this cost the US Secretary Clinton didnt say  nor does her blueprint Goosby says those numbers exist but he couldnt get out ahead of the White House which writes the budget
