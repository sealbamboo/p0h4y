Parents of children with mental health problems in England will get more say on their care says the NHS after a survey suggested major problems A survey of  parents by charity Young Minds found two thirds believed they did not get enough support It also found a quarter had to wait more than a year for treatment for their child   The survey was carried out on behalf of NHS England which said it was a wakeup call for the system It said it now intended to work with Young Minds to improve parental involvement in the development of psychiatric services   Dr Martin McShane of NHS England added We know from experience that if we work with parents well get better services   Young Minds chief executive Sarah Brennan said Our survey of parents who have used childrens mental health services starkly demonstrates that they far too often have to battle to get the support their children need   Our research also shows how parents often feel alienated from their childs treatment and are frustrated at the lack of resources available to support young people with mental health problems The survey was selfselecting meaning it was open to any parent of a child with psychiatric problems who wanted to take part  rather than a random statistical sample of such parents
