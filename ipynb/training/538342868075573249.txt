 get up about six most mornings a bit earlier if Im travelling down to London I always have breakfast before I leave the house or I dont function very well Ive got four sons so in term time theres a lot of running up and down stairs to make sure they are up before I leave for work  theyre old enough to sort themselves out but not great at waking up Mondays and Fridays Im in surgery and we open at am Im a partner in a busy practice with  patients in central Blackpool  a very deprived area  so we see a lot of psychosocial problems along with the medical ones On a Monday Im usually duty doctor which means that I along with a nurse practitioner deal with all the patients who contact the surgery On an average Monday that can be more than  patients so its nonstop and lunch is a sandwich at my desk often while on the phone to patients Its a big challenge balancing peoples need to be seen quickly with having enough time to sort their problems out properly The rest of the week I spend on my other roles as a commissioner  Im the cochair of NHS Clinical Commissioners NHSCC the independent membership body for clinical commissioning groups CCGs and Im the chief clinical officer for   Blackpool CCG Ive been a GP for  years now always part time For many years I just worked as a parttime GP as I had four young children at home As they got older I took on more work and thats when I got involved in commissioning About eight years ago I became medical director of the local primary care trust and Ive been leading the CCG since its inception In Blackpool we have some enormous challenges trying to improve the health of the population which is poor  male life expectancy is the worst in the country  and delivering highquality health services and balancing the finances At the moment our priorities include tackling respiratory disease improving identification of and support for patients with dementia and improving mental health services Were also introducing some new ways of delivering care outside of hospital so that we can care better for people especially frail elderly people with complex medical problems in their own homes Im passionate about the benefits of commissioning being led by clinicians so jumped at the chance to become involved with NHSCC which influences the system at a national level As an organisation we represent the issues that matter to our membership and for me that can mean attending meetings with national decisionmakers and key stakeholders fielding media enquiries and speaking at conferences on behalf of our members Balancing the local and national work is important and I try to make sure I keep in close contact with our member practices in Blackpool I love my jobs but finding the time to fit everything in is a constant juggle  meetings are frequently in London so I spend a lot of time on trains but Im getting better at organising things and make sure I fit a lot into the days when I am in London  Im also never without my iPad so I can work on the train Although work often encroaches on my evenings as I sit and deal with emails in the kitchen I try to keep weekends work free My sons now aged    and  mean life is never very quiet and weekend mornings for many years have been spent on the side of a rugby hockey or cricket pitch Weekend evenings are for relaxing maybe out with friends or at home Im not much of a TV watcher but I love to read especially with a glass of wine Im asleep as soon as my head touches the pillow
