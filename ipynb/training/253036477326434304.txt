Beau Gundersons fascinated by what he might learn from his DNA Im curious about what makes me tick essentially says Gunderson  who writes code for a Silicon Valley startup So Gunderson has signed up for every genetic test hes been able to afford And he cant wait for the price of getting his entire genetic code  his genome  to drop to about  as many are predicting is imminent Yeah if the price does drop  to a thousand bucks for example  I might pay that Thats a good personal price point for me Gunderson said Socalled whole genome sequencing is already available for between about  and  The early adopters that are getting this done now are those who have this incredible curiosity about their genetic makeup about their potential genetic destiny said Jay Flatley who heads   of San Diego Illumina even recently started offering an   that people can use to learn more about whole genome sequencing and their own genomes In September the company   a new service that could deliver a genome in two weeks So far sequencing is being used primarily only to diagnose mysterious medical conditions and help treat cancer patients and by scientists biotech executives and other people who can afford the outofpocket cost But the price is plummeting and many are predicting the  genome is coming soon And when that happens sequencing could become much more common I think its going to be just kind of crazy not to have your genetics known says Brian Naughton of   another genetic testing company It would be kind of like not knowing if you are allergic to a drug or not knowing your family history of a disease But all it takes to get your genome sequenced is a blood sample and in weeks you get the results This summer Gunderson jumped at a special deal from Me For  he could be one of the first  customers to get a big chunk of his genetic code sequenced Its the part called the exome which contains all the known genes Most of the information would be basically gobbledygook to most people  even most doctors But Gunderson has learned he didnt inherit an Alzheimers gene And he found out a cool reason why  maybe  he made the track team He has genes found in a lot of Olympic sprinters Gunderson still has lots of questions He wonders if he is carrying any genes that could make him sick And he has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder So he wonders Could his genes give him any clues about that It might be interesting if theres research that says  something about the efficacy of   versus another drug thats prescribed for ADHD he says Hes also curious about other stuff such as why he has trouble sleeping and why hes so particular about food While all this might sound appealing the prospect of lots of people like Gunderson plunging into their genomes makes many people very nervous The first big question Is this cheap new sequencing even accurate Mistakes could have horrible implications Take a breast cancer gene mutation You might be told you have a mutation when you dont And its not completely unknown for women who find out they have a mutation in one of these genes to go have a mastectomy so they wont get cancer says Liz Mansfield of the   And even when its right it could open up a Pandoras box You know its a seductive thought to think well you know we might as well know about stuff said   of the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and the American College of Medical Genetics But for most people sequencing will be just a big waste of time and money he said We dont just get MRIs on everybody who comes to the doctors office Not only would that be ridiculously expensive and uninformative says Evans it could also lead to all kinds of false positives that would be highly problematic for those people    And sequencing could easily end up stumbling across some terrifying things There are also people walking around out there who carry mutations that create an extraordinarily high probability that they will develop a horrendous untreatable unpreventable disease by age   years old he says That isnt necessarily information that everybody wants Its not just that this might scare people  it could cause really serious concrete problems in their lives Getting sequenced could subject people to genetic discrimination for things like life and disability insurance There are even more futuristic concerns Individuals who leave samples of their DNA lying around  as we all do every day on straws and napkins and glasses and linen  could have those samples taken and sequenced by third parties said   a bioethicist at the University of Louisville Its not totally crazy to think someone someday could use a persons genetic blueprint to manufacture their DNA and then plant it at a crime scene for example Proponents dismiss most of these fears They argue that the potential benefits of sequencing both to individuals and society far outweigh such theoretical risks For the community of medical care practitioners to decide that its inappropriate to burden people with this knowledge its excessively paternalistic says   of the Baylor College of Medicine Others argue that people just have a right to have their genome A lot of people just feel like its their information They own it says Mes Naughton They want to know Gunderson agrees Hes not worried about privacy or discrimination He even posted all his results so far online and plans to do the same with his full genome A big reason in my mind is like in some tiny way moving science forward by allowing people access to data that they didnt previously have he said As Gunderson waits for the price to drop geneticists are rushing to figure out how make sure sequencing does more good than harm
