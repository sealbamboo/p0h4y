When people talk about extending the human lifespan to  it bothers Roz Chast That upsets me for a lot of reasons she tells NPRs Melissa Block I feel like these are people who dont really know anybody over  The reality of old age she says is that people are not in good shape and everything is falling apart Chast should know The longtime   cartoonist is an only child and became the sole caretaker for her parents George and Elizabeth Chast when they reached old age In her new illustrated memoir     Chast mixes the humor with the heartache Its about the last years of her parents lives and her relationship with them as their child and conflicted caretaker They never had whats known these days as The Talk  an acknowledgement that their deaths were inevitable As a result Chast says everyone was in denial and actively avoided the subject even as it was staring them squarely in the face Chasts parents  who were both born in   lived independently in Brooklyn up until their early s Things started to go downhill in  when her mother fell off a step stool at age  She was in bed for a few days and it was clear that what was going on was more than the fall off the ladder Chast recalls That was the beginning of their sort of slide into the next part of old age  you know the last chapters With her mother in the hospital after the fall it quickly became clear that her fathers dementia was worse than Chast had realized As long as he was in their familiar apartment with my mother sort of steering the ship things were holding their own she says But when he came to live with her family in Connecticut I realized he was more far gone than Id known Even in a time of family crisis Chast found moments of humor She recounts one shopping trip with her father when she held up a red sweater for his consideration I cant wear   he told her Why not she asked Its RED he answered   Her parents briefly moved back to their Brooklyn apartment but it was clear they could not continue living independently Chast arranged for them to move to an assisted living residence near her home which they called The Place Her father was in steep decline In July  depressed disoriented and suffering from painful bedsores he told his wife he was ready to pack it in He was tired of the work of staying alive Chast writes George Chast died in hospice care in October  I dont know if theres anything to be really learned from this Chast says After the death of her husband Elizabeth Chast at  went into physical and mental decline as well I feel like my brains are melting she told her daughter She occasionally told surreal stories which Chast illustrates in the book I was just talking to somebody yesterday who said the worst thing for a parent is to have a child whos a writer Chast says Here are a couple of the stories her mother told her The last pages of Chasts book include  sketches she made of her mother as she died Chast admits she was not uncomfortable as she sketched her mother in death Maybe that says something really horrible about me that Im not aware of she says But I think drawing is what I do and it was a way of being with her and of paying attention  I think it would have been far worse to sit with her and check my email or something I wanted to look at her Chast says she hasnt had The Talk yet with her own daughter Im still avoiding she says Though I did tell my daughter whos an artist and writer  feel free to use this as material when you have to deal with me This is material and I want you to use it But beyond that they havent talked about endoflife issues We should but were avoiding it Chast says Because cant we talk about something more pleasant
