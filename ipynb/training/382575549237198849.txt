Enrollment in the Affordable Care Act health exchanges is set to begin Oct  But many eligible Americans still have questions reached out to listeners via Facebook and Twitter in an attempt to help answer their questions about the law Host Michel Martin spoke with Mary Agnes Carey a senior correspondent at Kaiser Health News  a news service not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente Listener Caitlin Stevenson When the Affordable Care Act goes into effect if Im already covered by an employers health plan am I still eligible to shop for more affordable care The plan that my job offers costs more than  a month for my husband and me  thats more than a car payment Will we  healthy adults  and  be able to find a plan that costs less than this Carey answers Anyone can shop on the exchange The question here is whether or not they can qualify for a subsidy of purchased coverage  In order to qualify for a subsidy two things have to happen No  The  health insurance offered by her husbands employer has to cost more than  percent of their household income or the plan if it covers at least  percent of the covered medical expenses What I mean is that if it pays for  percent of the medical expenses they could not get into the exchange So it either costs more than  percent of the income or it doesnt pay for  percent of the covered services If one of those things happen they might be able to qualify for a subsidy Graduate student Lorrie Guess I obviously dont know yet if Im going to have a job that offers me coverage and I dont want to pay a fine if I dont buy the coverage in case I get a job that offers me health insurance On the other hand I dont want to buy coverage only to get a job that ends up covering me and then find out that Im paying for no reason Carey answers Well heres a couple of ideas No  is there any way to extend her student health insurance for a period of time after graduation as she decides where shes going to go and what job she has and whether or not she has coverage Thats one thing Secondly while the enrollment period for the first year of the Affordable Care Act ends at the end of March there are things called qualifying life events  you lose your insurance at work you get married you have a child I think graduating from college would be one of these  And she could get coverage on her parents health insurance plan for a period of time As we know the Affordable Care Act allows that up to age  Carey says As part of the Affordable Care Act  there will be more coverage of mental health services  And also there has to be parity between what a plan offers on health services and what they offer on mental health services But this is an area where I would urge caution for people to look at and see how parity is defined how its implemented in a particular policy Because this has been a concern  the mental health parity law passed a few years ago and while some of the regulations have come through with it others have not But its definitely an area worth watching for people that are enrolling in the exchange coverage
