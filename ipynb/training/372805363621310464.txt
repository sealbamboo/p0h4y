The organoids   have components resembling those of a brain of a  or weekold embryo said lead study author Madeline Lancaster a researcher at the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology at the Austrian Academy of Science in Vienna at a press briefing Tuesday  She and colleagues have created hundreds of these organoids At this early stage of human development several key regions of the brain are already distinctive features including the dorsal cortex the ventral forebrain the choroid plexus  which generates cerebrospinal fluid  and regions that resemble the midbrain and hindbrain Lancaster and colleagues say theyve identified some of those same regions in these new mini brains However these regions did not naturally fall into place in the stem cell models the same way they would have in a normal brain  These different regions are not organized in the same kind of fashion that you would see in the developing embryo Lancaster said The organoids also lack certain features that human embryonic brains at  weeks do have most importantly the cerebellum which is involved in motor movement Also the hippocampus a seahorseshaped structure crucial for memory was rarely detected in these brainlike structures  Researchers used human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells IPS cells for this research Both embryonic stem cells and IPS cells have the ability to turn into any part of the body  But embryonic stem cells are very controversial because in the process of retrieving them for research the  or dayold embryo they are taken from is destroyed IPS cells dont come with the same controversy because scientists take a cell  typically a skin cell  then coax it using a chemical bath to revert to a state that resembles a developing embryo There did not appear to be an obvious difference between organoids derived from embryonic stem cells and those produced from IPS cells said Knoblich also of the Austrian Academy of Science Study authors found variability in the organoids they generated occasionally some of the brain regions they were studying failed to appear Lancaster attempted to direct the development of these regions in some of the organoids by applying growth factors substances that promote the proliferation of cells  Surprisingly when she tried to grow the mini brains with more dorsal cortex tissue the resulting structures had less of this tissue than the organoids that had developed on their own We actually think that the crosstalk between these different regions  the communication between these different brain regions within the organoids  is really important for each individual regions development she said The researchers used this model to look at a neurodevelopmental disease called microcephaly a disorder in which the size of the brain is reduced The brain region they were most interested in exploring the dorsal cortex is the region most highly impacted by this disease Researchers grew some of these organoids using cells from a patient who had a genetic form of microcephaly and compared them with the mini brains derived from healthy participants cells  In the organoids made from the microcephaly patients cells it appeared that more stem cells had been turned into neurons  a process called differentiation  than in the mini brains derived from healthy patients cells This suggests that in people with this condition neurons prematurely differentiate which could be the mechanism behind this form of the disease said Oliver Brustle at the Life  Brain Centre at University of Bonn in an accompanying article in Nature This research builds on other studies that have attempted to model brain tissue from stem cells A  study showed that mouse embryonic stem cells could be coaxed into producing waves of neurons A different research group showed in  that primitive eye structures and stratified retinas could form from embryonic stem cells taken from both mice and humans Study authors said they have no intention of growing a fullsized human brain  It is very clear that our system is not optimized for generating an entire brain and that is also in no way our goal Knoblich said As for growing a brain structure from stem cells thats capable of conscious thought Knoblich said this would likely not be possible or desirable Although the organoids are an important step forward the researchers are nowhere near being able to model circuits found in the functional central nervous system Moreover Knoblich said sensory input is required for such functional circuits to form A classical experiment showed that the optic cortex will not organize properly if it does not have input from an eye he said Knoblich is also pessimistic about the idea of growing brain structures from stem cells with the intention of replacing faulty ones in human patients The brain is so complex and its regions so intimately integrated that it would be difficult to repair any specific part through substitution A more promising possibility he said would be to put the stem cells directly into the patient and let them organize themselves But the future of this line of research is still unknown Brustle who was not involved in this research called the study remarkable and noted that it clearly puts neural aggregation cultures on the map of research tools for both developmental biology and biomedicine Thats a lot from a little tissue
