A year ago Montana opened the nations first clinic for free primary healthcare services to its state government employees The Helena Mont clinic was pitched as a way to improve overall employee health but the idea has faced its fair share of political opposition A year later the state says the clinic is already saving money Pamela Weitz a yearold state library technician was skeptical about the place at first I thought it was just the goofiest idea but you know its really good she says In the last year shes been there for checkups blood tests and flu shots She doesnt have to go she still has her normal health insurance provided by the state But at the clinic she has no copays no deductibles Its free Thats the case for the Helena areas  state workers and their dependents With an appointment patients wait just a couple minutes to see a doctor Visitation is more than  percent higher than initial estimates For goodness sakes of course the employees and the retirees like it its free says Republican State Sen Dave Lewis He wonders what that free price tag is actually costing the state government as well as the wider Helena community If theyre taking money out of the hospitals pocket the hospitals raising the price on other things to offset that Lewis says He and others faulted thenGov Brian Schweitzer for moving ahead with the clinic last year without approval of the state legislature although it was not needed Now Lewis is a retired state employee himself He says personally he does like going there too Theyre wonderful people they do a great job but as a legislator I wonder how in the heck we can pay for it very long Lewis says The state contracts with a private company to run the facility and pays for everything  wages of the staff total costs of all the visits Those are all new expenses and they all come from the budget for state employee healthcare Even so division manager Russ Hill says its actually costing the state  less for healthcare than before the clinic opened Because theres no markup our cost per visit is lower than in a private feeforservice environment Hill says Physicians are paid by the hour not by the number of procedures they prescribe like many in the private sector The state is able to buy supplies at lower prices Bottom line a patients visit to the employee health clinic costs the state about half what it would cost if that patient went to a private doctor And because its free to patients hundreds of people have come in who had not seen a doctor for at least two years Hill says the facility is catching a lot including  people who have diabetes  people with high cholesterol  people with high blood pressure and  patients diagnosed as obese Treating these conditions early could avoid heart attacks amputations or other expensive hospital visits down the line saving the state more money Clinic operations director and physicians assistant Jimmie Barnwell says this model feels more rewarding to him Having those barriers of time and money taken out of the way are a big part of what gets people to come into the clinic But then when they come into the clinic they get a lot of face time with the nurses and the doctors Barnwell says That personal attention has proved valuable for library technician Pamela Weitz A mammogram late last year found a lump That doctor called me like three or four times and I had like three letters from the clinic reminding me You cant let this go youve got to follow up on it  she says Two more mammograms and an ultrasound later doctors think its just a calcium deposit but they want her to keep watching it and come in for another mammogram in October Weitz says theyve had that same persistence with her other health issues like her high blood pressure She feels the clinic really cares about her Yeah theyve been very good very good she says Montana recently opened a second state employee health clinic in Billings the states largest city Others are in the works
