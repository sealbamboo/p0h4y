  New analysis of decadesold data surfaces unfavorable effects of the presumably   linoleic acid  the most prevalent polyunsaturated omega fatty acid  reopening a door to discussion of conventional advice about the best fats for heart health Researchers from the National Institutes of Health NIH the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill UNC and the University of Illinois at Chicago evaluated unpublished data from the Sydney Diet Heart Study a randomized controlled trial conducted from  to  that included  men aged  to  who had recent coronary events  a heart attack for example One group replaced saturated animal fats in their diets with omega linoleic acid from   and safflower oil margarine In the new analysis of the studys results the researchers found replacing dietary saturated fat with omega linoleic acid actually resulted in higher rates of death from all causes including from coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease I think its a very important study and a well done study says Alice H Lichtenstein DSc director of the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory at Tufts University in Boston and a spokesperson for the American Heart Association who was not involved in the analysis I think there are a lot of differences between now and then so it makes it difficult to put it into context One difference now Dr Lichtenstein explains is that we consume much less saturated fat overall and dietary guidelines dont recommend consumption of only one type of oil that is high only in omega   like the safflower oil used in the study Were more concerned about the transfatty acid content of the diet and focused more on LDL and HDL as opposed to total cholesterol This particular study used safflower oil which only contains omega  and we thought this provided a unique opportunity to look at the effects of omega  says study author Christopher E Ramsden MD with NIH and UNC This one study was really unique because it let us look at linoleic acid an omega specifically Most dietary omega fatty acids come from vegetable oils says Joan Salge Blake MS RD a clinical associate professor at Boston University including corn oil safflower oil soybean oil and   According to Lichtenstein soybean oil high in both omega and omega fatty acids is where most people get their omega The most recent   from the American Heart Association released in  supports getting at least  to  percent of daily total calories from omega fatty acids as part of a hearthealthy diet To reduce omega polyunsaturated fatty acids in your diet the statement authors wrote would be more likely to increase than to decrease risk for coronary heart disease Im not really trying to give diet advice Dr Ramsden says of his findings His goal is to get the information out there The findings are published in the   as part of a theme recovering and analyzing different data in order to have a fuller view of the evidence he says I think people who make diet advice will take it into consideration and use all the evidence available and come to the conclusion about what to recommend While saturated fat raises bad LDL cholesterol healthy fats the monounsaturated and polyunsaturated kinds can reduce total cholesterol while raising good HDL cholesterol on the blood Additionally research shows omega fatty acid a polyunsaturated fat can reduce inflammation a marker for heart disease Some evidence however suggests omega fatty acids   inflammation Past nutrition research emphasizes the importance of consuming a balance of omega and omega in diet Both are essential fats meaning the body doesnt make them and instead gets them from food Some experts argue that people who eat Western diets take in too much omega  found abundantly in seed and nut oils and not enough   like salmon A typical American diet contains anywhere from  to  times more omega fatty acids than omega fatty acids according to the University of Maryland Medical Center
