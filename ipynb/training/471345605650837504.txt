Millions of older people have trouble walking a quarter of a mile which puts them at high risk of losing their mobility being hospitalized or dying But its hard to get people who are already sedentary to become more active and stay that way In an attempt to solve that problem researchers got people in their s and s to walk and do simple exercises in social groups The people who did that were less likely to become disabled than those who attended classes on successful aging according to a   published Monday in   the journal of the American Medical Association The people in the study had to be able to walk onequarter of a mile in  minutes using no aid beyond a cane But  million Americans have trouble walking that far according to   director of the Institute on Aging at the University of Florida who led the study And  million cant walk a quartermile at all If people can or cant walk it makes a huge influence in their daily lives Pahor told Shots The goal here was not just to do an exercise study he adds but really to modify their lifestyle The people in this study who lived in eight different states said they were active less than  minutes a week at the beginning of the experiment and were considered at high risk of becoming disabled based on their lack of leg strength Those in the physical activity group met twice a week to walk and do simple legstrengthening exercises with ankle weights and were asked to walk and do exercises at home too The goal was to work up to  minutes a week of activity Both the activity group and the people who took a class participated for  years on average At the end  percent of the  people in the physical activity group had been temporarily disabled at some point compared to  percent of the  people in the education group And  percent ended up permanently disabled compared to  percent of the sedentary group A  percent difference doesnt sound like much but Pahor says it matters given how important it is to stay mobile and independent This is a very simple intervention it doesnt require any equipment any machinery People could easily do this at home but the social group was key to keeping them moving Pahor says I think the biggest problem were facing is that the simple knowledge of benefits doesnt change peoples lifestyle He hopes that health insurers will start providing these sorts of groups for older clients Though the more active group fared better on mobility they also were more likely to end up in the hospital Its not clear why that was but Pahor says it may be because they had more contact with the group leaders and thus were more likely to tell someone if they had a health problem Though this study was a large multicenter trial its hardly the last word on the topic Pahor says he and his colleagues plan to follow their participants for another five years to see how they fare
