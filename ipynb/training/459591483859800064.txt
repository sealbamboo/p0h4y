Despite a  in the two weeks before the April  deadline to enroll for health insurance under the federal health law many more Californians still havent signed up and theyre unlikely to Many people are uninterested confused or skeptical Scott Belsha from Long Beach Calif falls in the skeptical category Ive been consumed with living my life and Im fortunate to be healthy he says He works as a musician and carpenter and hes never had health insurance His parents who own a small business always paid cash for medical care most of which they were able to get from a doctor friend I havent ever been to the hospital or broken a bone he says But Im  and I should probably start thinking about it Steven Petersen  of Los Angeles says he looked into his options but couldnt afford  a month the lowest premium he could find Hed prefer a cheap   plan I just take care of myself every day and eat well and try to stay healthy he says The Affordable Care Acts individual mandate requires nearly every American to have insurance or pay a   of either  or up to  percent of income whichever is greater But Larry Levitt senior vice president at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation says he wasnt expecting every uninsured person to sign up during this first year The expectations are that enrollment will ramp up over a period of years he says The Congressional Budget Office estimates that even years from now the number of uninsured will be large about  million nationwide Some of those people will be living in states that have opted not to expand Medicaid to adults without dependent children Others will be immigrants who dont qualify for coverage under the law But the biggest category are people who simply will choose not to enroll Levitt says Beth Engel in Ventura County Calif is a yearold mother of a nearly yearold daughter and describes herself as an early supporter of the Affordable Care Act I was very hopeful she says I thought Wow I can have a job that I love that doesnt necessarily have insurance but I get insurance affordably  Engel works part time as a hotel clerk and qualifies for tax subsidies that reduce premiums for her and her toddler to about  a month But she chose not to buy insurance for herself this year I found that the premiums were still very high and I just couldnt afford them she says Even though now shes armed with the knowledge that she can take the subsidy upfront in the form of a reduced insurance premium she says shes reluctant to do that without thoroughly understanding the plans offered through the staterun marketplace  Maybe Im reading these incorrectly she says but it just didnt make sense and I thought Im not going to put money I dont really have to spend into a program that I dont really understand Engel did get her daughter health coverage through Medicaid People in California and other states that expanded can enroll yearround As for her own medical needs Shell go without health insurance and pay the penalty which for her is less than the cost of insurance She says shell reconsider her options when enrollment opens again in November
