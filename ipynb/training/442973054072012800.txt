We woke early on our first day in Lebanon driving east from Beirut into the Bekaa Valley to the refugee camp where we would meet the children of Syria The small city of tents is made of plastic and concrete and kept as neat as possible but on a rainy day like today nothing can stop the mud from coursing through the concrete channels of the camp and sticking to every shoe and pant leg Mud isnt the worst of it Another huge problem is waste disposal Without a formal way to deal with trash it ends up thrown into pits  potentially attracting flies or other vermin This is a way of life for these Syrian refugees and their children There are over  million Syrian children affected by the conflict in their home country and nearly  of those children now live as refugees in Lebanon This particular camp Fadya  houses  people in  tents When we arrived we were shown around the camp by workers who staff the clinic and help manage the camp As soon as we stepped into the medical clinic Khadija a yearold girl with streaks of blond in her braid was led into clinic Her problem Her blood sugar was reportedly off the charts at  A normal blood sugar reading two hours after eating is less than  mgdl Once the medical staff addressed her problem she shyly confided that she knew what she wanted to be when she grew up a doctor Beyond dealing with medical complaints like this one the medical clinic is also responsible for providing care to pregnant women and distributing vaccines We were able to see this program in action as several children were given their third dose of polio vaccine The vaccine is given as drops and fed right into the childs mouth To keep track of these doses the childrens thumbs are smeared with black ink after they get their vaccines as a way to mark who has already received the latest dose And so far the program appears to be working According to Tarek the worker from UNICEF who dispensed the vaccines there have been no cases of polio so far in the camp Why is there such concern Polio a disease that has been mostly eradicated in most of the world returned in Syria in October of  Overall vaccination coverage rates across Syria have fallen from  percent in  to just  percent in   and the number today is likely to be even lower First in line for his dose of polio vaccine was yearold Yusef Small for his age but with a quick smile Yusef pulled up his sleeve to reveal horrific burn scars Leaving the camp we were flanked with children young and old eager for a chance to show off their English phrases Good afterNOON they chorused again and again pushing a shoving each other goodnaturedly But despite their smiles many of these children had chilling stories to tell Of family members killed in the conflict of being pulled out of school of leaving the only home they have ever known to live in a city of tents The conflict has had devastating consequences for the health and well being of Syrias children both at home and those forced to live as refugees We will chronicle these remarkable children and bring you their stories for the next three days
