More than  million Americans are currently living with Alzheimers disease and the National Institute on Aging estimates that that number is going to triple by   in part due to aging baby boomers The cost of coping with the disease  currently estimated at  billion  is projected to rise to half a trillion dollars by  That amount will likely tax our overburdened health care system the economy and the families of those affected Amy Goyer realized her yearold father Roberts health was deteriorating one night while watching a movie with him He asked me the name of the movie like  times within a halfhour and I thought This is not normal for him  Goyer tells NPRs Jacki Lyden It wasnt normal it was Alzheimers As her fathers condition worsened Goyer made the decision to return home to Phoenix to take care of him As time progressed he was having trouble managing the finances the paperwork was overwhelming she says He would get incredibly stressed out  and little things about his memory kept getting worse and worse Goyer is no stranger to caregiving shes worked at AARP for  years giving advice as a home and family expert When she first began taking care of her dad she decided to start a   which then turned into a   In the series Goyer offers advice to caregivers like herself who are struggling to take care of their loved ones Its very challenging and there are times I get very exhausted she says And I just feel like the biggest enemy of caregivers is sleep deprivation because you just do not have the energy to deal with the emotional aspects of it and  just doing doing doing Because her mother is at home too recovering from a stroke Goyer often has to help both parents get up in the morning and go to the bathroom do all of their personal grooming and put on their pajamas at night She also must make sure they have all their medications throughout the day Goyer does have some help but caring for someone with Alzheimers can be staggering She says one of the most difficult aspects of the disease is whats been described as the long goodbye Over time its like hes being robbed of who he is she says And my dad is probably the most optimistic person youd ever know and he still has that which is wonderful for us But there are times when he gets very cranky because he doesnt know whats going on Given her family history of Alzheimers  her grandmother had it as well  Goyer says she fears getting the disease herself I think about it all the time but its hard when Im focusing on caring for my parents to think about that for myself she says All I can do is anything that will prevent the onset of the disease But I sure would like to have a lot more tools in my toolkit to fight it Alzheimers is a disease that can last a really long time and cost a lot of money  so much money in fact that the US government is paying attention with new legislation In  Obama signed the National Alzheimers Project Act into law Currently about  million per year goes to Alzheimers research and the new law includes an additional  million toward treatment research medicine and diagnostic tools Dr Dorene Rentz a neuropsychologist and codirector of Harvard Medical Schools Center for Alzheimers Research and Treatment has been studying Alzheimers patients for three decades In  the breakthrough was the discovery of something called amyloid plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimers Not all people with the plaque go on to develop the disease however Unfortunately weve come to discover that many older individuals who are still normal have these changes of amyloid plaque Rentz tells Lyden She says doctors believe an abundance of whats called fibular amyloid may trigger Alzheimers but thats not always the case Some people can walk around with a head full of fibular amyloid she says and live normal lives In patients already diagnosed with Alzheimers even if amyloid plaque is removed the neurons may be too damaged for memory loss to be reversed If diagnosed earlier there might be some hope Rentz and a colleague at Harvard are launching a nationwide clinical trial this fall to see what happens in the brains of people who have amyloid plaque but not Alzheimers The object of the study is to see if doctors can remove the amyloid and prevent them from getting symptoms of Alzheimers In  years there will be  million people in the US alone living with Alzheimers Over her year career working with the disease Rentz says people she had diagnosed with Alzheimers were devastated because there wasnt much that could be done Things have changed however as technology and awareness has improved People are more educated and many people are coming earlier to get tested because they are experiencing memory loss she says Even when a patients clinical profile indicates early signs of a neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimers Rentz says she gives them hope because there are things that can be done Because theyre not yet fully devastated in this disease we can actually give them some FDAapproved medications that are good in keeping people stable for a while she says Rentz says she also encourages a healthy diet and intellectual stimulation whats called optimal aging She says this helps people with early signs of Alzheimers  who often tend to withdraw  to stay engaged and active Goyer wont let her parents withdraw Shes providing a happy nurturing environment getting her parents as engaged as possible and having fun Im not just trying to keep my parents alive Im trying to have a good life with them and live my life at the same time she says Theres still a lot of fun and a lot of surprises and just a lot of love My parents are just very sweet individuals and Im very lucky in that way There might not be a cure for Alzheimers but that doesnt mean there isnt hope
