If youre looking for the definitive study that might persuade meat lovers to become vegetarians this may not be it New   published in   finds that vegetarian diets are linked to a slightly lower risk of early death  about  percent lower over a period of about six years of followup But the link to longevity was more significant in men compared with women The study is based on a onetime survey of more than  Seventhday Adventists a religion that emphasizes healthful diets and abstaining from alcohol caffeine and tobacco as part of a godly lifestyle Not all adherents are vegetarians but the church considers a meatless diet to be the ideal The participants filled out a questionnaire so that researchers could determine whether they were meat eaters semivegetarian fisheating vegetarians lactoovo vegetarian which the study defined as consuming meat or fish rarely and eating eggsdairy sometimes or vegans The researchers found that men who were eating vegetarian diets were less likely to die from heart disease and other heart conditions In women there were no significant reductions in death from cardiovascular disease Now many of us are   these days owing to environmental health and animal welfare concerns And as a Portuguese toddler reminded us in a   the sheer ickfactor of realizing that meat comes from a dead animal can play a role too But if a persons motivation is only linked to health benefits you might ask whether this study nails down a causeandeffect relationship between skipping meat and living longer The answer Absolutely not As is typical of nutrition studies this research points to an association And its important to point out as the authors note that the participants following vegetarian diets also tended to be more highly educated to drink less alcohol to smoke less and exercise more compared with the participants who regularly consumed meat Another limitation is that peoples dietary patterns tend to change over time And since this study relied on a single measurement asking participants just once about their dietary patterns the study doesnt capture any changes over time An accompanying  published by the journal concludes that while the researchers used stateoftheart approaches to try to tease apart the effects of diet from all the other lifestyle factors that may play a role in longevity its tough to do this Prior attempts to examine the relationship between mortality and vegetarian diets have led to mixed results A large European  found no longevity benefit for British people following vegetarian diets But a prior   of Seventhday Adventists in California did point to increased longevity As for the new study it provides additional evidence that vegetarian diets are associated with improved health outcomes including allcause mortality writes   who authored the commentary that appeared in the journal alongside the research But Baron  a selfdescribed ovolacto vegetarian  also makes the case that meat and other animal products are just one component of a persons overall pattern of eating Other factors he notes  such as how much sugar salt and refined grains we consume  are also an important part of evaluating the healthfulness of our diets  of the American Cancer Society told us in an email that these findings fit with previous research that points to the health benefits of a diet low in red and processed meats However she notes its possible that the people who dont eat meat have other healthconscious behaviors that contribute to the findings
