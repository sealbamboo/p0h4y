When Kim Zaza became the volunteer coordinator for a non profit called Gift of Life Michigan only  percent of Michigans population was on the organ donor registry Her job was to increase that number Zasa is energetic and really likes people So she was naturally optimistic about her ability to sell the idea of donating organs to the people of Michigan just by talking to them We just went out and signed up for every art fair church event every little podunk little thing we could possibly think of just to try to get our information out there she says And yet despite her army of  volunteers the number of people in Michigan signing up to become donors didnt grow much When she would go to the national Donate Life conference with all the other state organizations that manage donor registries Zasa would sit in the back of the room It was kinda embarrassing for us to sit in some of those meetings Wed be like oh look were in the bottom of barrel again she says Zasa noticed that the states that were successful had outsourced a lot of the work that she herself was doing They had enlisted the help of an enormous workforce the DMV So in  Kim and her colleagues convinced the state of Michigan to allow DMV clerks to ask every person if they wanted to become an organ donor That verbal ask made an immediate difference in donor registration numbers It was almost like well that cant be right I dont know how we could have had that many she says In  Michigan had  thousand new organ donors In  the first full year the DMV clerks were asking there were  thousand new organ donors in Michigan Most signed up because a DMV clerk asked them to More than three million people are now on Michigans organ donor registry It took  years to register  million of those people The DMV clerks did the rest in just the last few years It turns out getting people to become organ donors is a lot like getting people to exercise more Put the gym in the building and they are more likely to come Similarly with organs its about burying the question of mortality and body parts in a bureaucratic routine In other words make it easy to say yes At last years national Donate Life conference instead of sitting in the back of the room Kim Zasa was asked to present It was like wow people actually showed up she says And then people call me afterwards and say how did you do that It felt like oh were on the map Kim no longer spends lots of time driving to festivals or sending hundreds of organ recipients to the distant churches and community centers In fact she spends most of her time traveling to the states  DMV offices with chocolates for the DMV clerks These are her soldiers now She wants them to be pampered
