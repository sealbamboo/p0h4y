Talk therapy sessions can help reduce the risk of suicide among highrisk groups suggests a US study Researchers from John Hopkins University tracked more than  Danish people who had attempted suicide and later received psychosocial counselling They found suicides went down by  after five years compared to people who had no therapy sessions The findings are published in Lancet Psychiatry The participants in the study volunteered to have six to  talking therapy sessions at suicide prevention clinics in Denmark Their outcomes were compared with around  people who had attempted suicide but had not gone for treatment afterwards Participants were then followed up for up to  years The aim of this therapy is to give people time and space to talk about their troubles and explore difficult feelings with a trained professional During the first year those who received therapy were  less likely to attempt suicide again They were also  less likely to die of any cause After five years this same group saw  fewer suicides Ten years later the positive effects of the therapy were still evident Dr Elizabeth Stuart study coauthor and associate professor in the Bloomberg Schools department of mental health said the longterm followup was ideal for gathering information on which suicide prevention treatments worked Our findings provide a solid basis for recommending that this type of therapy be considered for populations at risk for suicide she said Her colleague Annette Erlangsen also from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health said We know that people who have attempted suicide are a highrisk population and that we need to help them However we did not know what would be effective in terms of treatment Now we have evidence that psychosocial treatment  which provides support not medication  is able to prevent suicide in a group at high risk of dying by suicide They said it was likely that providing a safe confidential place to talk was the key to the success of the therapy sessions But the researchers say they plan to gather more data on which specific types of therapy work best
