Every year thousands of Medicare patients who spend time in the hospital for observation but are not officially admitted find they are    A Medicare beneficiary must spend three consecutive midnights in the hospital  not counting the day of discharge  as an admitted patient in order to qualify for subsequent nursinghome coverage If a patient is under observation but not admitted she will also lose coverage for any medications the hospital provides for preexisting health problems Medicare drug plans are not required to reimburse patients for these drug costs The overclassification of observation status is an increasingly pervasive problem the number of seniors entering the hospital for observation   to  million in    The chance of being admitted   the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services has found Admitted and observation patients often have similar symptoms and receive similar care  Six of the top  reasons for observation  chest pain digestive disorders fainting nutritional disorders irregular heartbeat and circulatory problems  are also among the  most frequent reasons for a short hospital admission  Medicare officials have urged hospital patients to find out if theyve been officially admitted But suppose the answer is no Then what do you do     Medicare doesnt require hospitals to tell patients if they are merely being observed which is supposed to last no more than  hours to help the doctor decide if someone is sick enough to be admitted Starting on Jan  however New York State   within  hours of putting them on observation status  Penalties range as much as  per violation  To increase the likelihood of being formally admitted get yourself in the door before midnight advised Dr Ann Sheehy division head of hospital medicine at the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison Wisc  A new Medicare regulation  the socalled pumpkin rule    they anticipate staying for longer than two midnights but to list those expected to stay for less time as observation patients  Although the rule applies now Medicare officials wont enforce it until April  having already pushed the deadline back The American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association have   and have urged that enforcement be delayed again until October It doesnt make any sense said Dr Sheehy who studied   over an month period and published the results in JAMA Internal Medicine Some patients will be admitted because they came in at the right time of day not because they have more complicated medical problems  The twomidnight rule doesnt change Medicares threemidnight rule the one limiting posthospital nursing home coverage Officials at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services declined comment for this story because of pending litigation seeking to eliminate observation status If you or a family member land in the hospital as an observation patient and think you should be admitted its better to act sooner than later  I would talk to anyone who would listen to me said Terry Berthelot a senior attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy which offers a   Make as much noise as you can because its much easier to change your status while youre still in the hospital than to go through Medicares appeals process later  Ms Berthelot suggests asking your regular physician to speak with the doctor treating you in the hospital about why you need to be admitted based on your medical condition and risk factors  Its got to be a medical argument said Ms Berthelot You cant say Mom will need rehab after this or We cant take her home because no one can stay with her  If that doesnt work sometimes a strongly worded letter or call from a lawyer describing the patients medical needs can be effective In some cases help from a professional can make a difference Shari Polur an elderlaw attorney in Louisville Ky recently hired a geriatric care manager to persuade a local hospital to admit her client  Since admission status can change from one day to the next the manager who is also a registered nurse called the hospital every morning to make sure the patient was still officially admitted until she could be transferred to a nursing home  If the situation isnt resolved while youre in the hospital and you require followup care at a nursing home youll have to pay the bill of often thousands of dollars up front At that point Ms Berthelot suggests you should file what amounts to a special doubledbarreled appeal with Medicare   Its not for the faint of heart the process is long and arduous and it requires beneficiaries to first receive and pay for the care  often an expensive proposition  before seeking reimbursement And the legal arguments can be tangled The   typically addresses disputes over whether certain treatments or services rendered should have been covered Observation patients have actually received hospital coverage and services a doctor says is medically necessary  so they dont really have anything to appeal said Marc Hartstein director of Medicares hospital and ambulatory policy group at a recent briefing in Washington  My limited understanding of this is that the patient cannot appeal a decision not to order or not to do something he said But observation patients may claim that they received treatment usually provided to admitted patients only in a hospital Therefore the hospital incorrectly billed Medicare for an outpatient service instead of for inpatient services  The patient should have been admitted and therefore qualifies for nursing home coverage   Its absolutely confusing as heck said Michael Sgobbo an elder law attorney in Charleston SC who recently won an appeal on behalf of a yearold woman who will be reclassified as an admitted patient  That means Medicare will pay her nursing home bill of nearly   Lawyers at the Center for Medicare Advocacy recommend fighting observation care on two fronts  First follow the appeal instructions in the Medicare summary notice a quarterly statement of services Circle the charges on the statement from the hospital and explain that these items were inappropriately billed under Medicares Part B as outpatient services  They should have been billed under Medicares Part A for hospital services because the patient received treatment that could only have been provided in a hospital Mail the statement within  days from the date on the statement to the address provided for appeals Second after challenging the hospitals observation designation file a separate appeal to seek reimbursement for the nursing home charges said Ms Berthelot To begin ask the nursing home to bill Medicare  You should receive a Medicare summary notice indicating that it did not pay the nursing home charges because the patient didnt have the required threeday hospital stay  Circle those charges and explain that the beneficiary was hospitalized for three days and received an inpatient level of care  Then send it within  days to the address provided for appeals Be prepared to dig in If either appeal is denied you must appeal again to the next level following the instructions in the denial letters  Both appeals can take at least a year and are fraught with difficulty said Ms Berthelot The reality is that most people cant get through and those who do get lucky   Some observation patients appeal and never get decisions warned Diane Paulson senior attorney at Greater Boston Legal Services  Some of her clients cases were dismissed because they were not admitted to the hospital  the very point they were challenging   You cant appeal if you dont have a denial she said When that happens the case falls into a black hole But the chances of winning improve as you continue to appeal as Nancy and George Renshaw of Bozrah Conn discovered After spending nearly four years going through the process a Medicare judge decided last February that Mr Renshaws father should have been admitted to the hospital instead of classified as an observation patient Medicare finally paid his nursing home bill and in November the Renshaws received a refund of    I was shocked said Ms Renshaw I never expected to see a penny of it
