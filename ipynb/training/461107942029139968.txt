British student Henry Miller  died in Colombia after apparently consuming the traditional hallucinogenic drink ayahuasca or yage Emma Thelwell who took the drug herself explains why it has become a rite of passage for some backpackers   I had never swallowed a pill at a party Yet there I was in the depths of a Colombian bamboo forest knocking back a liquid containing a psychoactive drug  under the supervision of a shaman who didnt speak a word of English During my month in Colombia I didnt join the thousands of backpackers indulging in the countrys most famous product  cocaine But I was sold on ayahuasca I was intrigued by the fact that for centuries South Americas indigenous societies have used this teacher plant in regular rituals Ayahuasca also known as yage is a blend of two plants  the ayahuasca vine    and a shrub called chacruna   which contains the hallucinogenic drug dimethyltryptamine DMT DMT  and therefore ayahuasca  is illegal in the UK the US and many other countries Ayahuasca could have serious implications for somebody who has a history of mental health problems warns the   website The drug could be responsible for triggering such a problem in those who are predisposed but unaware of it But in South America ayahuasca is an integral part of some tribal societies In  Perus government recognised ayahuascas status stating that it was one of the basic pillars of the identity of the Amazon peoples Perus government claimed that consumption of the teacher or wisdom plant constitutes the gateway to the spiritual world and its secrets which is why traditional Amazon medicine has been structured around the ayahuasca ritual Ayahuasca tourism is already well established in South America while its use by Westerners interested in shamanism has raised the profile of the traditional medicine globally according to the   a charity dedicated to the safe use of traditional plants and whose flagship project concerns ayahuasca The ayahuasca trail in Peru and Colombia is welltravelled with tens of thousands of foreigners taking ayahuasca there every year says Joshua Wickerham chief adviser to the council  Tourism overall in Colombia has seen a meteoric rise alongside the governments efforts to demobilise leftwing rebels after decades of conflict The number of international tourists to Colombia increased from  in  to  in  according to the World Tourism Organisation  Dr Daniela Peluso senior lecturer in social anthropology at the University of Kent says the rise in global tourism has also helped spread the ceremonial practice  Whereas only a few decades ago the ayahuasca experience required that a lone traveller make his or her way to the forests of South America now notions of local and global spaces converge as shamans and tourists travel throughout the world to perform and participate in a diversity of ayahuasca ceremonies she says Not forgetting of course that importing the substance to many countries would be a serious criminal offence Though scientific evidence of the clinical benefits of ayahuasca is limited advocates say it has become increasingly popular as a tool to treat posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD depression and addictions Most people seek ayahuasca with good intentions  they are not thrillseeking but are curious serious  or have specific issues such as depression says botanist Prof Dennis McKenna from the University of Minnesota Thrill seekers are selfeliminating after a couple of sessions of vomiting adds McKenna who is a board member at the Heffter Research Institute which investigates psychedelic substances It is not pleasant or fun It puts your body through the wringer  emotionally and physically Certainly when I ventured out to the midnight ceremony at a shamans farm with four other gringos I wasnt looking for a party In fact from what I had heard not much really happened to you  I was just curious about a local ritual What I found was a Colombian community group who met each week to drink the teacher plant with their local shaman as part of a learning and healing process  Though we were a group it was a singular experience After drinking the vile bitter mixture we found our own space around the farm  we lay on mattresses or watched the fire to the sound of Andean musicians  Some people vomited at times some cried some slept Mostly people were quiet with the only sounds coming from the musicians and the occasional chant from the shaman I spent a number of hours in a conscious but dreamlike state I wasnt sick but I did feel physically uncomfortable and disorientated for a time  I was expecting to see at most perhaps an explosion of colours but I was surprised to experience powerful meaningful visions of childhood memories After a few hours the effects wore off and I was left with a peaceful happy feeling  It is a ritualistic learning process that is becoming increasingly popular across the globe with people exploring their personal development through the introspective nature of the hallucinogenic experience according to the    Career coach Jeremy Behrmann took ayahuasca in Colombia over several weeks in  as part of the research for his book Breakaway which helps people design gap years and sabbaticals I took ayahuasca with a fourthgeneration shaman to explore its ability to provide visions that could give my readers further clarity on their vocational calling says Behrmann  Many travellers I met took it because theyd been told it had effects similar to other drugs like LSD which are often used recreationally In my experience people should only seek the medicine and the welltrained shamans who hold the ceremonies with the intention of engaging in a serious spiritual upheaval My experience was hugely enlightening but ultimately very challenging  Indeed not all shamans are well trained McKenna warns  The city of Iquitos in the Peruvian rainforest for example may be the epicentre of retreat centres but its also the wild west of ayahuasca he says Here tourists can buy cups of ayahuasca on the street  with no way of knowing who concocted it Though overdoses are rare some less scrupulous locals are mixing up lousy brews which contain toe a member of the nightshade plant family This can leave people in a more vulnerable and confused state and is done often for nefarious reasons  to rob or sexually abuse people warns McKenna After starting the ceremony participants are largely immobilised for four to six hours so it is important to have trust and be in a safe place says Wickerham Ayahuasca is only legal in Peru as part of a spiritual ceremony it is not supposed to be taken unsupervised Though there is little government oversight the Colombians are organising a guild of shamans to ensure good practice A responsible shaman should check to see what medication people are on before they take ayahuasca says Wickerham and they will know about potential bad reactions it may have with other medicines  most specifically antidepressants Ultimately my experience was positive but there is a risk  and people must take care choosing who they drink ayahuasca with
