Supertasters are the Olympic athletes of gastronomy able to detect subtle differences in flavors that other people never register That talent may make for more than a discriminating palate though It may also warn them about attacking germs and help them defend themselves against sinus infection This notion isnt as bizarre as it may seem Bitter tastes have long been considered a danger signal in foods warning about potential toxins in potatoes and other vegetables If the   dont eat it Supertasters exquisite sensitivity to bitterness and other flavors is caused by genetic variations that give them ampedup taste receptors About  percent of people are supertasters while another  percent are nontasters barely able to detect bitterness The rest of us fall somewhere in between NPRs Richard Knox says that supertasters may   as a way to mask intensely bitter tastes But it turns out that receptors for bitterness arent just on our tongues Theyre also in our gut lungs and nasal passages The gut receptors have been linked to cholesterol metabolism and the lung receptors help control mucus production And the nose Those nose receptors surely must add to a gourmets experience with the sharp tang of a ripe Gorgonzola But   a head and neck surgeon at the Philadelphia VA hospital who spends his days operating on people with sinus infections thinks the receptors are part of the immune system Maybe these bitter taste receptors are there as an early detection system he told The Salt And maybe if you have the wrong genetics they wont kick in Cohen got curious about taste receptors in the nose while worrying about why a small number of his sinus patients never got better after surgery Were they susceptible to infection in some way that most of the patients who recovered completely were not So he and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania where hes an assistant professor of otolaryngology and at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia tested tissue samples from the noses of his patients In the laboratory they exposed the samples to a chemical produced by   a bacterium thats a common cause of sinus infections They found that the taste receptors from the patients who were supertasters responded strongly to the bitter taste of the chemical which bacteria produce to communicate with each other People who lacked the genes to taste bitterness didnt respond at all When the supertasters receptors were exposed to the bacterial chemical they did two things that Cohen thinks show theyre helping fend off the bacteria They activated cilia tiny hairs that sweep germs out of the nose and increased production of nitric oxide which kills bacteria If you are a supertaster you have an inherently strong defense in your nose to these organisms Cohen says The scientists tested just one type of bitterness receptor against one bacterium But the nose holds dozens of different bitter taste receptors and they are hoping that the other receptors are there to detect and fight other pathogens Are there others that protect against   MRSA he says Now theres a big caveat This all happened in a lab not in real life so theres no guarantee that this is how it works in human noses But Cohen is hoping that if it holds true a simple taste test could be used to screen patients with sinus infections Even better would be if the system could somehow be amped so that nonsupertasters could get the germfighting benefits too Thats what were hoping Cohens work was   online in the current   So supertasters are you healthier than everyone else in the office Happily free of sinus infections
