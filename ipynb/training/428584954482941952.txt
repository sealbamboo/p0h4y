Nobody really knows exactly how many Americans are walking around with pacemakers and defibrillators But with surgeons implanting at least   each year there probably are a couple of million out there now said Dr Paul S Mueller a Mayo Clinic general internist and bioethicist The devices prolong lives but all those people will face decisions down the road Dr Mueller said Do I keep it going Do I turn it off Physicians have similar questions including what kinds of patients confront these choices and who usually winds up making these decisions We know a bit more now that Dr Mueller and his colleagues have reviewed the medical records of  Mayo Clinic patients who over four years requested that their devices be deactivated  the largest group of such patients examined to date What the data show is that these patients are    These patients typically are very ill Theyre approaching death said Dr Mueller Twothirds were men their median age was  In the years since they received their devices many had developed other problems in addition to heart disease including cancer and respiratory and neurological diseases Yet the majority hadnt recorded their desire to deactivate their cardiac devices More than half  a comparatively high proportion  had done what health care providers perennially urge and had prepared advance directives but only one of those documents made any mention of cardiac technology That finding alarmed Dr Daniel Matlock a palliative care specialist at the University of Colorado who cowrote   accompanying the Mayo study both published in JAMA Internal Medicine The consequence is a huge number of surrogates had to make these decisions Dr Matlock said in an interview pointing out that about half of the requests for deactivation in the study came from surrogates Nobody wants that Peoples big concern at the end of life is not to burden their families Some decisions may come more easily than others The majority   percent  of these patients or their surrogates wanted to turn off implantable cardioverterdefibrillators or ICDs which deliver a shock when they detect a dangerously irregular heartbeat That is a painful and often frightening sensation people have compared it to getting hit in the chest with a baseball bat Most of us say wed like to die quietly and calmly maybe in our sleep Dr Mueller said The defibrillator does exactly the opposite So turning off an ICD when a patient has a poor or terminal prognosis  and wants to avoid multiple shocks in his last weeks or months  has become relatively noncontroversial It doesnt require surgery just a scanner that painlessly reprograms a device It was not always so A few years ago Katy Butler wrote movingly in The New York Times magazine of her familys   But some Mayo patients or their surrogates wanted to turn off the pacemaker function that is intended to raise a tooslow heartbeat or bradycardia Some implanted devices now function as both pacemakers and ICDs depending on how they are programmed Pacemakers dont hurt which may help explain why switching them off still meets some resistance Yet longer life is not always a patients goal The Heart Rhythm Society and several other medical groups have issued a consensus statement saying that honoring a patient or surrogate request to turn off a cardiac device is both legal and ethical Yet in  when Dr Mueller and his colleagues   frequently the people who do the actual deprogramming about  percent said they regarded turning off a pacemaker as euthanasia In fact two Mayo patients who requested deactivation of their pacemakers were refused by doctors who have the right to decline and died before another physician could take over or before a requested ethics consultation could take place Three other patients did have ethics consultations which can delay deactivation because of family conflict patient vacillation or a surrogate who didnt appear to be following a patients wishes Once the devices were deactivated death usually followed within a day or days and almost always within a month Alas patients  who often dont know that their devices can be turned off  probably have to take the lead here talking to their families and their physicians all of them about whether and when it should be done then including those specific instructions in advance directives or POLST forms They need to add this to the yesorno endoflife checklist Feeding tube Ventilator Cardiac device deactivation Dr Matlock argues that any doctor who knows how to implant a cardiac device  any doctor period  can also learn to have a conversation about what a patient wants to do about it as the years pass and to renew that dialogue it should also include   which requires additional surgery at followup visits He and coauthor Dr John Mandrola a cardiologist in Louisville Ky composed a simple script that says in part I dont want to be morbid but I just want to remind you that you have control here We can turn the device off at any time It is your device and your life But the current reality Dr Matlock says is that a lot of doctors would have trouble with this conversation Its much easier to say Your device looks fine See you in a year
