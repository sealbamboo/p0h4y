Three agricultural companies sued Friday to overturn a new law in Hawaii that would restrict the planting and spraying of genetically modified crops, the latest dispute in an escalating battle nationally over GMO seeds.. Units of DuPont Co., Syngenta AG and Dow Chemical Co. aim to block a law, set to take effect in August on the island of Kauai, that would restrict most crop growing and pesticide spraying near schools and nursing homes, and require disclosure of chemical use and GMO crop cultivation.
