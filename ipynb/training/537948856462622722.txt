arlier this year the CentreForum mental health commission  calling for government to prioritise the promotion of mental wellbeing in order to help reduce the burden of mental health problems They suggested that this should be achieved through both universal services and more targeted interventions One of the places where a new approach is being tried is Margate so with a colleague I recently travelled there to find out how a team are helping to improve the wellbeing of the local community In Margate changing demographics mean residents face high rates of unemployment benefit dependency and few work prospects This places a lot of demand on public services AE departments at local hospitals have high admission rates with the majority of  ambulance responses caused by assault and overdoses There are significant health inequalities with men dying  years younger than the average for the general population The Margate task force is a   based in Thanet district council aiming to make services more integrated and organise joint resources in a more efficient way in order to meet local demand At present the task force focuses its attention on two wards that represent  of the population of Thanet yet account for  of public service spending The task force includes  agencies such as councils police housing and rescue services Together these agencies allocate resources to tackle health inequalities reduce the number of vulnerable people who are at risk provide greater access to education work and skills and improve the physical environment of Margate This is not achieved through a pooled budget instead each agency allocates people either on a fulltime or parttime basis This task force differs from other colocated teams also operating at street level It runs street weeks where staff conduct a survey to collect information about residents their concerns and agencies involved This provides a community profile and the information gathered is shared inside the task force across agency boundaries During the street weeks the task force is able to act on residents shortterm goals and can refer to other agencies for more complex longterm goals This is not a reactive process its a proactive case finding approach This work has helped to identify a number of people with mental health problems who are not receiving any support But the task force is not just about doing things to people crucially it is about working alongside people and building the capability of the community Residentled partnerships act as a focal point and encourage residents to take responsibility for their own environment There is also a neighbourhood responsibility panel which includes all agencies on the task force as well as people from the local community At meetings individuals are asked how they can be better supported This is a great opportunity for people with difficulties to engage with a wide range of agencies and has had  takeup Housing authorities play a critical role in the taskforce The housing intervention project focuses on updating existing properties and a selective licensing scheme allows the team to regulate the private rental sector This means they can provide good quality and sustainable housing which helps residents mental health and wellbeing None of this would be possible without data Each agency is able to tap into relevant data sources so they can identify the needs of the local population When used collaboratively this information identifies area hot spots which frequently require the attention of public services so resources can be target accordingly In two years the task force has been responsible for a reduction in multiple referrals to different services for the same person preventing duplication and waste It has strengthened the relationship between residents and agencies through case findings and a joint problem solving approach reduced the impact of crime and victimisation in the area improved housing and brought about regeneration of the area This work is ongoing with plans to increase the skill mix within the task force to include additional mental health professionals and links to childrens services Iris Johnston the leader of Thanet district council said Since the colocation of the task force at Thanet district council we have seen a massive improvement in joinedup working I am especially pleased with the huge difference this cooperative working has made to the wellbeing of our community and the transformation of local services
