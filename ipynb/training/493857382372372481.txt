Once again, there is controversy over an expensive drug for premature babies. At issue are new American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines that recommend scaling back usage of a drug called Synagis, which costs several thousand dollars and is sold by AstraZeneca, because evidence shows the medicine benefits few children other than very young preemies.. This is the fifth time the physician’s group has recommended less usage, and the drug maker is responding with an ad campaign charging the guidelines threaten about 140,000 infants that are “our most vulnerable babies.” The newspaper ads say: “Why put these babies at risk?” and include a photo of a premature infant connected to tubing.
