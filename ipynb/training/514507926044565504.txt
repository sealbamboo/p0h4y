For decades OBGYNs have offered prenatal tests to expectant moms to uncover potential issues including Down syndrome before they give birth However some   such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling carry health risks including miscarriage For some women the risks can be greater than the potential benefits from information they would gain Evidence now suggests that women who are wellinformed about the pros and cons are more likely to decline testing even when the tests are free indicating that the average mothertobe might not have all the facts In a   published in   the Journal of the American Medical Association researchers worked with  women at medical centers around San Francisco Half of them received standard care including a focus on testing for women over age  The others were offered a computerized guide to prenatal testing and presented with the choice of having prenatal tests free of charge The guide complete with bilingual narrator talked through the information about the tests including screenings such as blood tests and ultrasounds that dont carry a physical risk The guide also covered diagnostic tests like amniocentesis that do The guide was personalized for each woman using her birthday and expected delivery day to say which tests were still available for that stage of pregnancy and what the risk of Down syndrome was the risk increases with maternal age The guide also highlighted a choice that women frequently overlooked opting out We already knew that a lot of women do not understand that the screening tests are optional says   professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine and lead author of the study We told them it was totally reasonable to have no testing at all she tells Shots Its not a medical question  its really a values question The guide pushed women to think about their values asking whether they wanted to be tested whether they would want screenings before the more invasive testing and which tests in particular they were interested in All of the women in the study were quizzed on their knowledge of prenatal tests The researchers found that only  percent of women who used the guide underwent invasive testing while  percent of the normally treated group did The group that got a personalized guide was also more likely to avoid testing altogether knew more about the risks of invasive testing and had a better handle on their likelihood of carrying a fetus with Down syndrome Reproductive geneticist   at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia says having women think about their values and beliefs is important before diving in She tells Shots theres variability across the country among women who choose prenatal screenings Those differences she says are probably not so surprising when you think about peoples political and religious beliefs Kuppermann says prenatal testing can be a wonderful thing particularly with advances in safer blood tests that can give definitive answers However she says the millions of women having babies each year in the US need to understand what theyre signing up for The women should make the decision she says not their doctors Im not trying to get women to test and Im not trying to get women to not test says Kuppermann My goal is to have all women get the information they need
