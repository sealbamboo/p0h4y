With the continuous uptick in the number of cases and deaths in the current Ebola outbreak the few agencies that are on ground are stretched thin That includes   also known as MSF Its one of the main health care providers in West Africa where there are more than   of Ebola and  deaths Even with roughly  volunteers spread among the three Ebolastricken countries the agency says that still isnt enough In an interview on   MSFs international president Dr   tells NPRs Audie Cornish that they opened a new Ebola care center in Monrovia Liberia this weekend It was equipped with  beds and all the beds got filled in one day Were thinking about expanding she says But the reality is we dont have a definitive picture of how many cases there are in the city right now Liu says that caring for patients is only one of the three pillars for controlling the Ebola outbreak The other two are tracing possible Ebola cases and educating the community Right now the only thing were facing is fear she says Fear is normal when you dont understand what is going on To eliminate that fear the agency not only needs more funding but also more volunteers to talk to the community We need people who are going to go and  talk to the elders talk to the religious leaders and tell them about Ebola she says To mobilize the population and make them understand what is going on She adds that MSF is also looking for volunteers to find out how many cases are in each village Right now we dont have a full picture of the magnitude of the epidemic she says Enlisting help from the international community hasnt been easy NGOs that I used to see in some other crises like after the Haiti earthquake or even in Central African Republic or South Sudan are not present right now in Western Africa Thats why Lius on a tour speaking to UN leaders and NGOs about how they can help There is some reluctance I guess she says Everybody has to overcome their own fear before coming to the field She says that MSF has been ringing the alarm since the beginning of the epidemic but its been slow wakeup call for the other NGOs Thats likely because past Ebola oubreaks were contained in a matter of weeks But what is happening now is that we have cases in a highly dense populated area like Monorovia with  million she says Without the involvement of other organizations she says we will not be able to contain the Ebola epidemic And its not only Ebola victims who suffer With hospitals and care centers crowded its also been difficult for people seeking other types of care like for malaria or for maternity issues  what Liu calls an emergency within the emergency We were faced with the really hard reality of welcoming six women who were pregnant and who lost their children because they were walking around the city trying to find a place to deliver their babies she recalls By the time they got to our centers the babies were not alive anymore
