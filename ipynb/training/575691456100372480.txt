Did you get your flu shot If so you probably figured it would protect you against exposure to the three strains of influenza virus were deemed most likely to circulate this winter But a new study in the journal Science reveals that the shot primed your immune system to defeat a much broader range of flu viruses  and it suggests a simple tweak to make it work even better Every year  to  of adults and  to  of kids around the world become   according to the World Health Organization For most people that means a week or two of fever cough runny nose headache and pain in the muscles and joints But in  million to  million cases the flu can cause more severe illness including  to  deaths Thats why virologists put so much effort into developing the   It contains samples of weakened or deactivated viruses enough to make the immune system swing into action and create antibodies That way if you encounter a real flu virus your body will be prepared to fight it But influenza is a wily virus There are three main types  A B and C  and hundreds of subtypes And these strains are constantly changing  Experts at public health agencies such as the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention track the ones circulating in people and make their best guess about the three or four versions that are most likely to cause infection and put those strains in the flu shot or flu mist The better the match the more protection and vice versa During years when the flu vaccine is not well matched to circulating viruses its possible that no benefit from flu vaccination may be observed the   But the   in Science challenges that view An international research team found that the flu shot prompts the body to make antibodies against all of the flu viruses a person has encountered over his or her lifetime not just the ones in the vaccine In fact the immune response tends to be highest against strains encountered earlier in life they wrote The researchers came up with a name for this phenomenon a backboost Their first sign of its existence came from studying the blood samples of  people in Vietnam who were born between  and  and tracked for another study All of them had given blood samples each year between  and  None had gotten flu shots but they had been exposed to the flu and sometimes got sick The researchers used the blood samples to create D computer models that they called antibody landscapes These maps depicted the relationships among various flu strains along with the strength of the antibody response to each one What these landscapes showed was that the strongest immune response was usually to flu viruses that were circulating when people were about  years old Generally speaking the older the virus the bigger the response Antibody levels against newly circulating viruses tended to be lower than those against strains circulating earlier in an individuals lifetime the researchers wrote They called out the example of a study participant who was born in  and got the flu in  That infection caused the persons immune system to make antibodies to versions of the  Hong Kong flu strain which had circulated in the subjects youth but not in recent decades To check whether flu shots prompt this type of backboost the researchers piggybacked on two other studies In both cases volunteers gave blood samples got a flu shot and then gave another blood sample four weeks later In one of the studies the vaccine protected against socalled Wuhan  strains that had already been circulating for a few years In the other study the shot was built around a new flu strain that most people hadnt encountered However the researchers discovered that this forwardlooking vaccine prompted a slightly larger antibody response to Wuhan  viruses than did  the vaccine that targeted them directly The researchers couldnt explain the biology behind this backboost though they described some of their theories in the study However they were pretty clear on the upshot of their finding When designing a flu shot youre better off including new strains instead of old ones Either way you get protection against older flu strains And if you guess right youll get protection for new ones as well
