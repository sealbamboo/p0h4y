An outbreak of measles among unimmunized members of a Texas megachurch is fueling new health worries about pockets of vaccinewary parents  just as more than  million public school kids head back to class across the nation  More possible measles cases are being reviewed in Tarrant County Texas where at least  people have been sickened this month at the Eagle Mountain International Church whose ministers have been critical of vaccination Local officials say several more cases of infections with fever and rash have been reported but not confirmed  Its concerning Its something we jump on said Russell Jones a Texas state epidemiologist whos been tracking the situation It could get into the schools Public health officials say that the northeast Texas outbreak is just the latest in a small but growing number of places  think     and most recently    where vaccine resistance has sickened children and put the wider community at risk for potentially deadly infectious diseases The rate of change has sort of accelerated said Dr Saad Omer an infectious disease epidemiologist at Emory University in Atlanta who studies clusters of vaccine exemptions in public schools  Tarrant County was not on my radar he added  Hes more familiar with places such as Marin County Calif where rates of new kindergarteners excused from mandatory shots nearly doubled from  percent in  to  percent at the start of last year county figures show There at the small New Village School in Sausalito  percent of entering kindergarteners said no to vaccinations  Likeminded people end up creating pockets of nonvaccinated or undervaccinated communities explained Dr Ari Brown an Austin Texas pediatrician and spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics They kind of seek each other out because they have similar philosophies But vaccine critics say that distrust of the drugs  and of the public health community that pushes them  is behind rising rates of vaccine rejection across the country   These are pharmaceutical products that carry a risk of death or injury that can vary according to the individuals said Barbara Loe Fisher cofounder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center in Vienna Va  Critics object to vaccines because of fears about safety worries about the effects of injecting young children with dozens of doses of vaccines by age  and worries about possible links with other diseases including autism a theory that has been repeatedly debunked  Public health officials however say theres no question that the risk of vaccination is far outweighed by the benefit of immunization Risks of vaccine side effects or failure are possible but rare and theyre much lower than the risks associated with disease said Omer  In the decade before the measles vaccine was introduced in  between  million and  million people in the US were infected each year  were hospitalized and  to  died Another  developed chronic disabilities CDC says  Domestic cases of the disease were considered eradicated in  but outbreaks continue because of imported infections brought back by travelers from areas where measles remains common  The Texas megachurch outbreak was sparked by a nonvaccinated visitor who was infected in Indonesia and then returned to expose unvaccinated church members staffers  and children in a day care center In the wider community more than  percent of kids are immunized and less than  percent are exempt county officials say But the congregation of unvaccinated people allowed the disease to catch hold  When you hang out with other people who dont vaccinate youre hanging out in the wrong herd said Brown a reference to herd immunity the necessary level of protection that keeps a disease from spreading within a community Church leaders including Kenneth Copeland and his daughter Terri Pearsons senior pastor at Eagle Mountain have advocated faithhealing and questioned vaccines in the past After the outbreak began in midAugust Pearsons has urged church members to get vaccinated and held immunization clinics  When more than  percent of a certain community opts out of vaccinations it leaves others at risk particularly those too vulnerable for immunization or those for whom a vaccine doesnt work or wears off   For some diseases such as mumps herd immunity can drop to as low as about  percent and still offer wider protection But other diseases such as the highly contagious measles or pertussis known as whooping cough require collective immunity of up to  percent to keep everyone safe according to the CDC  To be clear the vast majority of US parents do vaccinate their kids latest federal health statistics show Nationwide only about  percent of the more than  million kindergarteners who entered public school last fall were exempted from laws that require that they get shots to protect against what once were the deadliest diseases of childhood measles mumps rubella polio Homeschooled children arent included in the count But exemption rates also vary widely among states from  percent in Alabama to  percent in Alaska and Colorado and  percent in Oregon which leads the nation CDC figures show  Rates are highest in the  states that allow for exemptions based not only on medical and religious grounds but also on personal beliefs And within those states they can vary even more In Oregon at least four counties have doubledigit exemption rates ranging from  percent in Curry County to  percent in Wallowa County  In states where it has been easy to obtain exemptions  with a simple signature for instance  rates of exemption have risen sharply according to a  study by Omer and colleagues Between  and  the nonmedical exemption rate in  easy states rose to  percent an average annual increase of  percent he found  Some states are trying to change that trend making it more difficult to obtain exemptions In Washington state where kindergarten exemption rates peaked at  percent in  public health officials changed the school paperwork two years ago separating the vaccine record from the exemption form said Dr Ed Marcuse a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the University of Washington  At the same time we did that we changed the law In order to be exempt you had to be counseled about vaccinepreventable diseases he said The childs physician has to sign a form proving that the counseling took place The point was not to simply put in hassles Marcuse said pointing out that some states require notarization of exemption forms We wanted very much to be certain that parents made as thoughtful and wellinformed a decision as possible The effort appears to be paying off Kindergarten exemption rates fell from  percent in  to  percent in  after the initiative state records show Now Oregon and California have passed similar laws bolstering requirements for exemption  The goal Marcuse said is to enact policies that balance the inherent conflict in the vaccine debate between private choice and public good  Its not so simple as Lets wipe out these pockets of resistance said Marcuse Lets help people make decisions that are both in their personal interest and in the interest of the community
