Shari and Judi Zucker became vegetarians as teenagers shared high school records in the mile and twomile and became authors together at  Weve been walking our talk  running our talk  since we were  says Judi Their first book How to Survive Snack Attacks Naturally was featured in the Los Angeles Times on Jan   Even then it was clear why their father publicist Irwin Zucker named them the Double Energy Twins  which conveniently has become httpwwwdoubleenergytwinscom Their latest book their fifth The Ultimate AllergyFree Snack Cookbook speaks to the millions of Americans who have food allergies with more than  plantbased sugarfree recipes Between them the twins have five children  one set of twins  and just one child with food allergies Shari and Judi say they have been close since they were wombmates and they often talk over each other as they did when they shared some thoughts about kids and healthful eating People are becoming more aware of GMOs genetically modified organisms and thats changed the way people are thinking In the s and s food was pure we feel And then once GMO products became common the makeup of the food wasnt natural anymore And the food allergies have developed Judi says Weve also seen such a change in the variety of plantbased foods that are available Shari says When they became vegetarians we were almost like junkatarians We didnt know that much At the time you used dairy products or eggs and it was considered healthy But we have found there is definitely more awareness in the quality and the variety of products available This problem is not going away If someone has celiac disease they have that for the rest of their lives and they have to be really careful about gluten Shari says Those kinds of food allergies will never go away But they have found that many children can sometimes outgrow allergies  We are interested in the cause as much as the cure We get that kind of question all the time Shari says We try to make all of our recipes easy and tasty because we dont want to spend all the time in the kitchen either Were all busy moms  The cool thing is when you make many of these recipes they can be stored in the refrigerator for seven days or in the freezer for months We are a society of convenience Parents are the ones who influence their kids on eating Thats right off the bat If a parent is not eating healthfully and snacking healthfully you cant expect if from the kids Judi says Kids have always been known to be picky eaters and theyre brutally honest too if they dont like something Shari says The key is it depends on the family dynamic If the kid is always eating processed foods thats going to be the initial thing We use real maple syrup and a child visiting us wanted to know if we had the artificial kind the kind that has  maple syrup because thats what her taste buds were accustomed to But taste buds can be adapted Were pretty strict here If you are hungry enough you will eat it Shari says When they were young and Id take them to the beach I would cut up red and yellow pepper and that would be their snack Making the pizza was the hardest Taking the wheat out made it difficult to get the right consistency If theyre looking for the exact taste of something that has wheat and dairy theyre not going to get it But it still may be tasty We make everyones favorite oatmeal raisin cookies and we love them Shari says Taking the soy out was the hardest Judi says When it comes to snacks there are so many readymade processed foods with soy in it That was something we learned we could modify The little veggie dogs and all these things We wanted them organic and  of soy is GMO and we just dont believe in that When people say Oh I have to take this out of my diet They feel despair Judi says But despair breeds creativity
