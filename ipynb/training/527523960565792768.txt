Scientists have grown miniature stomachs in a lab dish using stem cells and are already using them to study stomach cancer They hope they can grow patches to fix ulcers find new drugs to treat and even prevent stomach cancer and perhaps even grow replacement stomachs some day They discovered that the bacteria that cause stomach cancer begin doing their dirty work almost immediately attaching to the stomach lining and causing tumors to start growing in response   causes many if not most cases of stomach cancer which affects more than  Americans a year and kills half of them Stomach cancer is a major killer globally affecting close to a million people a year and killing more than  percent of them And the team grew their ministomachs using two different types of stem cells  human embryonic stem cells grown from very early human embryos but also induced pluripotent stem cells or iPS cells which are made by tricking bits of skin or other tissue into acting like a stem cell In our hands they worked exactly the same James Wells of Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center who led the research Both were able to generate in a petri dish human stomach tissue Stem cells are the bodys master cells  and iPS cells are both pluripotent  meaning they can give rise to any tissue in the body Theyve been used to grow       and have been  to treat eye disease Growing anything close to a real stomach or even a patch for an ulcer is a long way off The gastric organoids  Wellss team made the name up  are just about the size of a BB bullet Its not easy getting stem cells to do what you want them to do Wells and his team including graduate student Kyle McCracken had to use various growth factors and chemicals each introduced at precisely the right time to coax the cells into becoming threedimensional blobs of stomach tissue The stomach is a complex organ with layers of muscle cells cells that make up the stomach lining and glands that secrete proteins and acid to digest food But the process worked and the ministomachs look just like stomach tissue the team reports in this weeks issue of the journal Nature We were able to show  that when we inject the bacteria or a little solution of Helicobacter into our little footballshaped ministomachs the bacteria immediately know what to do and they behaved as if they were in the stomach Wells told NBC News They bound to the lining and they triggered the early stages of stomach disease The cells in response to the infection started to replicate themselves Helicobacter infects about twothirds of the worlds population but doesnt cause disease in everyone We want to understand why bacteria trigger stomach disease in some people but not others Wells said Scientists often use animals to study human disease but this isnt optimal with the stomach Stomach biology and structure differs greatly from one species to the next depending on what food it eats Humans have unique stomachs and unique diseases also And   also has its own stem cell facility One of the many values of embryonic stem cells or iPS cells is that its possible to make batches from an individual patient or from a group of people with the same disease and study just how their specific tissue goes wrong and how various treatments might work for them Another possible line of research Wellss team wants to study stomach tissue to help understand why gastric bypass surgery helps people not only lose weight but works very quickly to start to reverse the symptoms of diabetes
