  The inflated sense of selfimportance common to narcissism can be toxic to relationships but a new study suggests the personality trait may also harm   Researchers from the Universities of Michigan and Virginia determined that men who scored high on two destructive narcissistic traits  entitlement and exploitativeness  had markedly higher levels than others of cortisol a stress hormone that can lead to high blood pressure and heart problems While men and women are equally narcissistic study authors said the cortisol stress response was not noted in female participants We generally see narcissism as a personality trait thats bad for others but not narcissists Its bad for people in relationships with them said study coauthor Sara Konrath an assistant research professor at the University of Michigans Institute for Social Research This study was a way of getting under their skin to see if there are physical consequences The study is published Jan  in the journal   Konrath and her colleagues administered a item questionnaire to  college students that measured five components of   which is also characterized by selfabsorption overestimations of their uniqueness  attractiveness or intelligence for instance  and a sense of grandiosity They also measured cortisol levels twice in the students saliva to assess baseline levels of the hormone which signals activity in the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis HPA the bodys key stress response system Three of narcissisms five personality components are considered useful or healthy leadershipauthority superiorityarrogance and selfabsorptionselfadmiration Konrath also noted that narcissists tend to be creative people with low levels of depression but their fragile views of themselves can lead them to react defensively and resort to aggression when their sense of superiority is threatened The authors found elevated levels of cortisol only in the men with unhealthy narcissism and they speculated that in these men the HPA axis is chronically activated While study data didnt explain why only men seem to suffer from a higher stress response to narcissism Konrath speculated that societal definitions of masculinity that overlap with the trait  such as arrogance or dominance  may leave men particularly vulnerable physiologically Theyre at especially high risk because someone who admits theyre stressed out is going to get help but theyre not likely to she said There may be a cost to this jerkiness Its a little sad theyre a group that wouldnt get help if they needed it While the study invites people to look at this issue in a more comprehensive way it did not prove a causeandeffect relationship between narcissism and the bodys stress response said Dr Mark Russ director of psychiatric services at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks NY People with narcissism may be typeA very driven perfectionistic and seek highstress situations and the cortisol levels may be measuring that Russ said There may be an overlap Konrath said future research will focus on the reason women dont respond physiologically to narcissism as men apparently do Narcissism levels have increased in both genders in recent years she said perhaps as a byproduct of the socalled selfesteem movement which emphasizes praise for children over criticism It could be a change in the educational environment she said I think its nice were trying to be thoughtful and careful of peoples feelings but we may err on the side of not being constructive
