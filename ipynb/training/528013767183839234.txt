There has been a lot of talk recently about marijuana legalization  increasing tax revenue for states getting nonviolent offenders out of the prison system protecting personal liberty possible health benefits for those with severe illnesses These are good and important conversations to have and smart people from across the ideological spectrum are sharing their perspectives But one key dimension of the issue has been left out of the discussion until now the marketing machine that will spring up to support these nowlegal businesses and the detrimental effect this will have on our kids Curious how this might work Look no further than Big Tobacco In  the year after   the major cigarette companies spent a record  billion on marketing In  that number reached  billion according to the Campaign for TobaccoFree Kids To put it into context the auto industry spent less than half of that on advertising in  and car ads are everywhere At the same time despite advertising bans these notoriously sneaky tobacco companies continue to find creative ways to target kids Data from the  National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that the most heavily marketed brands of cigarettes were also the most popular among people under  This is not a coincidence and gets to the very core of Big Tobaccos approach Hook them young and they have a customer for life Why do we think the legal marijuana industry will behave differently from Big Tobacco When the goal is addiction all bets are off In Colorado where there are new rules governing how legal marijuana is advertised in traditional media there are still many opportunities to market online and at concerts festivals and other venues where kids will be present Joe Camel might be retired but hes been replaced by other gimmicks to get kids hooked  like   and flavored cigarettes The marijuana industry is following suit by manufacturing THC candies cookies lollipops and other edibles that look harmless but arent Making marijuana mainstream will also make it more available more acceptable and more dangerous to our kids Addiction is big business and with legal marijuana its only getting bigger Not surprisingly Big Tobacco is also getting on the marijuana bandwagon Manufacturers Altria and Brown  Williamson have registered domain names that include the words marijuana and cannabis Imagine how much they will spend peddling their new brand of addiction to our kids We cannot sit by while these companies open a new front in their battle against our childrens health Why is this an issue There is a mistaken assumption that marijuana is harmless It is not   It affects parts of the brain responsible for memory learning attention and reaction time Developing brains are especially susceptible to all of the negative effects of marijuana and other drug use In fact poison control centers in Colorado and Washington state have seen an increase in the number of calls regarding marijuana poisoning This isnt a surprise  with legal marijuana comes a host of unintended consequences Ive spent the past several years after leaving Congress advocating for a health care system that treats the brain like it does any other organ in the body Effective mental health care especially when it comes to children is critically important Knowing what we now know about the effects of marijuana on the brain can we really afford to ignore its consequences in the name of legalization Our No  priority needs to be protecting our kids from this emerging public health crisis The rights of pot smokers and the marijuana industry end where our childrens health begins Im not alone in my concerns about this trend toward legalization   has said that   and reaffirmed his opposition to it during his campaign for reelection   For that I applaud his leadership and courage Alaska Oregon and the District of Columbia have legalization ballot measures up for a vote this fall I hope common sense will prevail and they choose a better path than making addiction the law of the land At the end of the day legalizing and marketing marijuana is making drug use acceptable and mainstream Just as Big Tobacco lied to Americans for decades about the deadly consequences of smoking we cant let big marijuana follow in its footsteps target our kids and profit from addiction
