UNIFICATION TOWN, Liberiaâ€”Feimata Dunoh once operated an orphanage outside Monrovia for children uprooted by years of civil war. Ebola has put her back in business.. Since August, nearly 40 children recently orphaned by the virus have turned up at her dusty compound of low-slung brick buildings. They play around a fire used for cooking while Ms. Dunoh works her cellphone in search of neighbors and relatives willing to take in another mouth to feed.
