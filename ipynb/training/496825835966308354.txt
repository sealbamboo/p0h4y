Stroke care needs to be centralised in large specialist units in a radical shakeup of hospitals experts say A study led by University College London found the overhaul of services in London which focused care at eight centres was saving  lives a year In comparison less farreaching changes in Greater Manchester had less impact Englands national stroke director Prof Tony Rudd said the research showed centralisation of care should now be spread to all urban areas How emergency care is organised is a pressing issue in the health service Last year NHS England   to do the most complex care This has already started for stroke with London and Greater Manchester undergoing reorganisations in recent years Since  anyone suffering a stroke in London is taken to one of eight hour specialist units rather than their nearest unit across the capitals network of  hospitals Patients are assessed immediately and given brain scans and clotbusting treatment if needed  The units were selected to ensure that no Londoner is more than halfanhours ambulance journey away Most of the rest still carry out rehabilitation although five do not provide any stroke care In Greater Manchester only stroke patients seen within four hours of developing symptoms are taken directly to one of three specialist stroke centres with other patients taken to one of  district centres  Only one of the specialist centres is open  hours a day and no hospitals stopped providing stroke services entirely as a result of centralisation The researchers  commissioned by the governmentfunded National Institute for Health Research  looked at stroke survival in both these areas before and after reconfiguration This was then compared with performance across the rest of England They found the survival rate increased by  in London  the equivalent of  lives a year  but not in Greater Manchester However the length of time patients spent in hospital reduced in both cases  by  in Manchester and  in London Study coauthor Prof Naomi Fulop said It may seem counterintuitive for an ambulance to drive a critical patient straight past the nearest hospital but it saves lives She said the work clearly showed the benefits of centralisation and other areas should consider adopting a similar approach Prof Rudd said he agreed This paper makes a strong case to centralise acute stroke care in large centres We need to spread this model to all urban areas Dr Shamim Quadir of the Stroke Association added It has long been recognised that rapid specialist medical treatment for stroke patients saves lives and reduces costs for the NHS  Centralising stroke care in hospitals throughout other large UK cities has the potential to save thousands of lives
