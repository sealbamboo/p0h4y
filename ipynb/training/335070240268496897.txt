People smell yummy to mosquitoes So yummy in fact that our scent is a big way the pesky insects track us down But just how much mosquitoes like   may not be entirely up to the bugs Mosquitoes are more attracted to human odors when theyre infected with the malaria parasite scientists   Wednesday in the journal   Entomologists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine gave malariatransmitting mosquitoes two places to land a clean nylon stocking and one worn for  hours on the foot of young Dutch woman who happens to be an author on the study All the mosquitoes gravitated more toward the dirty sock than the fresh one But the bugs infected with malaria landed on the smelly nylon more frequently And while they were there the parasitepossessed bugs were more likely to try and bite the stocking than the malariafree insects Its almost like mind control The parasite changes the behavior of the insects for its own benefit The more biting the bugs do the more they spread the protists This kind of parasitic mind control isnt limited to mosquitoes and malaria One type of fungus is notorious for   carpenter ants into socalled zombies After the   infects the ants the insects march to a precise location on a leaf that is optimal for dispersing the funguss spores Eventually the ant dies at this location and the  sprouts from the dead corpse Malaria appears to be more subtle with its subterfuge It just amplifies the mosquitoes preference for human blood Scientists have known for a decades that the malaria vector   is highly attracted to people In fact these ladies  its only the females that bite us  actually prefer to feast on humans than many other animals They even have a strong aversion to cow odor So whats in our bouquet that makes us so alluring to mosquitoes Human skin emits over  different odor molecules The  mosquitoes   odor receptors in their antennae specifically built to detect a handful of these scents One these compounds known as mushroom alcohol because its made by mushrooms gives our skin a moldy or meaty smell Another compound   has a buttery scent Its the same molecule found in Chardonnay and added to microwave popcorn to simulate butter
