The recent results of two highly-anticipated human studies of an experimental cystic fibrosis drug developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals showed that patients had a statistically significant improvement in lung function, but many doctors characterized the improvement only as “modest.”. A pair of new research papers published in Science Translational Medicine today may help explain why. The Vertex drug combines two types of compounds into one. In two .  studies carried out in human cells, the two compounds counteracted each other, which the researchers say likely diminished the beneficial effect on lung function in the human studies.
