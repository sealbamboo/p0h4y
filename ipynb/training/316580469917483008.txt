Last week scientists   they had sequenced the full genome of the most widely used human cell line in biology the HeLa cells and published the results on the web But the descendents of the woman from whom the cells originated were never consulted before the genetic information was made public and thus never gave their consent to its release  Renee Montagne spoke to Rebecca Skloot author of the bestselling book  which chronicles the cells and the family tied to them Skloot also wrote an   in Sundays   about the need for international standards to protect the privacy of genetic data Henrietta Lacks was a poor black tobacco farmer in southern Virginia In  she was diagnosed with cervical cancer Her doctor without telling her took a little piece of her tumor to study it Lacks died soon afterward but her cells kept   in the doctors Johns Hopkins lab As scientists recognized their surprising ability to grow indefinitely the cells become hugely important to medical research For the past  years the HeLa cells have been used in experiments on topics as diverse as cloning the effects of radiation and the polio vaccine Lacks family didnt find out about the immortal cells until the s It has been a long legacy within the family of research without consent and theyve experienced quite a few privacy violations along the way says Skloot Some of the HeLa genome   for years The European researchers who sequenced the full genome initially claimed last week that no private medical information about Lacks or her descendents could come from the data they published online But right away other researchers began to refute that They noted that although the cells have mutated they still contain Henriettas genes To prove that point some scientists took that genome and turned it into a detailed report on Henrietta and what her genes actually said to illustrate Yes you can find very specific information about her  says Skloot For example anyone looking at the genome could learn about Lacks risk factors for some diseases like Alzheimers and also could learn about some nondisease traits like the color of her hair or eyes Its perfectly legal to publish someone elses genome online but it does raise significant questions about privacy Though Henrietta Lacks is no longer alive releasing reports about her genetic information also invariably releases some information about the DNA of her descendents We have more questions about privacy than answers at this point says Skloot One of the questions that comes up is Can you hide the parts of this genome that are Henrietta The answer seems to be no Its even relatively easy to identify people whose DNA has been posted anonymously as researchers   in the journal   in January And right now there are no regulations to protect families like the Lackses Our regulations arent covering the privacy questions that come up for people says Skloot Skloot has been in touch with the Lacks family She says they were shocked Initially they wanted the genome taken down from the Internet until they could review and understand what it meant and might reveal about them As Skloot reported in the   the European researchers have apologized and quietly removed the data from the web But the family also wanted to know how the information in the genome could help society They dont want to stop science says Skloot They dont want people to stop doing research on HeLa So they said Take it offline And then we want to sit down and learn about this stuff so that we can decide whether we want to give consent
