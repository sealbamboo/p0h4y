You know youre famous when your haircut becomes   haircut Dorothy Hamill wasnt prepared for fame She just loved to skate As a shy child she fell in love with being outside on a pond breathing fresh air and feeling like she was in her own world Her mom took care of all the details that advanced Dorothys career to the point where she captured Olympic figure skating gold in Innsbruck Austria in  And shes still skating appearing in the latest run of Stars on Ice which is being presented today in Anaheim at the Honda Center And she has been added to Dancing With the Stars for Season  of the ABC reality competition show It was on a pond in Connecticut There was something so exhilarating about it It was a magical kind of freedom After the first time I wanted to learn to skate backwards and thats what hooked me I begged and begged my mother about learning to skate backwards and my mom signed me up for group lessons at age  After eight weeks of group lessons I got gold stars and that allowed me to have a scholarship for one free private lesson that was  minutes long and I thought that was amazing Thats what led to more private lessons I never discovered that When I was  one of the other skating moms suggested to my mother that she sign me up for a competition in the middle of Central Park in New York called the Wollman Open I didnt really understand what is was all about but I had fun and won a silver medal I didnt know about competition or the Olympics until Peggy Fleming won in  My mother looked after all of the competition stuff I just skated I didnt really love competition but that was the only way to get better Youd see more talent My mom took charge of helping me improve and being competitive There was no plan It just kind of snowballed I never thought Id compete at the world level I was just very passionate about it I was having a great time and I never felt that it interfered with my childhood I was shy so this was my outlet I never felt like I was sacrificing In my teen years leading up to the Olympics I loved having the excuse to skip out on parties because of skating Partying wasnt my thing anyway Mostly I hung out with other skaters We were all buddies so its not like I missed out on socializing I was really enjoying myself It was just so different than what you think it will be like All of sudden there are interviews and press conferences and being wined and dined and endorsements and I was so illequipped to deal with any of that It was a whole different world Ultimately my life has been so enriched by it What I remember is that it never really sinks in You dont change but a lot of what happens around you starts to change I didnt know anything to say at these press conferences other than being able to tell people how to do a double axel When one gets that diagnosis its devastating I had a lumpectomy and they took some lymph nodes Then they had to go back in and take some more lymph nodes I was in the middle of a tour and trying to perform The radiation treatment just zapped any energy for at least a year and a half Im also on a drug called tamoxifen For a couple of years I didnt feel like doing anything but now that Im feeling better Im trying to be more active and eat healthy I had to get back in shape for Stars on Ice When I got the invitation I realized I had a long way to go and it was only two months out It wasnt enough to get back to full strength Its coming back now because of the tour Im definitely feeling stronger now
