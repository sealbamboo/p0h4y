In the winter months temperatures and humidity levels plummet to as low as  which is as dry as the Sahara Desert  People also spend significantly more time indoors which contributes to the spread of the flu but recent scientific literature suggests that the low humidity levels may be contributing to the virus survival   A review of nearly  peerreviewed   conducted over the last decades shows that homes kept at  relative humidity are likely to have fewer flu viruses lingering in the air and on surfaces like sink faucets door handles and countertops  Available at most hardware stores and online retailers hygrometers provide a digital readout of the relative humidity in your home and are compact and lowcost Homes can be kept at the optimal  relative humidity level through the use of a portable humidifier  In this humidity range the flu virus survival in the air can be decreased by up to  Theres an added benefit too  the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends using a cool mist humidifier throughout the winter months to help relieve congestion and coughs  Many people may ask how can light kill bacteria But if you purchase the germicidal type of UV lights they are capable of inactivating microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses Theres a variety of lightweight disinfection devices that use ultraviolet light on the market You simply spread the light over the surface you wish to clean for the directed amount of time and the virus and bacteria will decrease substantially  This type of tool may be handy for keyboards a computer mouse and other handheld devices but keep in mind the flu virus also lives in the air so disinfecting large areas is not as feasible  You can also look for gadgets like humidifiers with a UV light chamber that will kill the flu virus mold and other bacteria potentially living in the water  This germfree technology is an added safeguard for homeowners that may not always remember to change their water or filters  Regular surface cleaning with a disinfectant labeled as kills bacteria and viruses will help remove particles that have landed on your floors faucets and countertops but it is important to consider the air you breathe in your home  During the winter months most people keep windows sealed and the heat on full blast causing stagnant recycled air that can harbor airborne allergens and bacteria   Consider using a portable air purifier in the rooms you spend most of your time Most air purifiers circulate air several times per hour cleaning the air Look for a model with a HEPA filter which is what most allergists and doctors recommend   Air purifiers can remove the smallest microbes in the air reducing harmful airborne germs that not only include cold and flu viruses but also dust pollen mold spores pet dander and smoke particles Those can aggravate allergies as well This idea is likely one youve heard before but it is still one of the most effective and easy flu prevention methods When disinfecting think beyond the countertop and focus on the objects used most throughout the home such as the family tablet TV remote or doorknobs   Cleaning works by using soap and water to physically remove germs from surfaces Its important to note that youre not killing germs with this process though  youre mainly removing them and lowering their numbers  Use a registered disinfectant that states the EPA has approved the product for effectiveness against influenza A virus  And finally always follow label directions on cleaning products and disinfectants The flu virus can live on surfaces for several hours  and even longer on more porous surfaces like towels washcloths blankets and linens While linens dont need to be washed separately its important that theyre not shared without being cleaned thoroughly  Wash bedding towels and clothes with household detergent in hot water and tumble dry on a hot setting Dont forget to wash your hands with soap and water immediately after handling them
