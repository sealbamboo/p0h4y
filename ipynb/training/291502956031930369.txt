As the earliest flu outbreak in years continues to claim victims businesses are taking a hit too Theyre faced with an unsolvable problem If they tell too many sick employees to stay home the work doesnt get done But when people sick with flu and other bugs show up theyre spreading illness through the workplace Its a dilemma the staff at Zeno Radio a media technology company in Midtown Manhattan has seen unfold this winter Around here Chaim Gross is known as Patient Zero Gross was the first one in his office to get sick about three months ago But he kept coming to work Then as I started feeling better David started getting sick and he was stuck at home for like three days throwing up and everything Gross says And then half of the  workers here started dropping like flies Then Keith went home sick Um Jack was actually out before Gross continues Charles missed a few days And now thanks to the domino effect that Gross says he might have set in motion Deanna Mitchell from sales and marketing also got the flu But she showed up to work too I really wanted to come in because today was important meetings Mitchell explains Every worker at Zeno Radio receives six sick days a year but it doesnt matter Gross says he has only taken one day off in the past eight months even after becoming the walking plague Why Because he says his small company needs him and he loves hanging out with his colleagues This puts employers in a bit of a bind says Tevi Troy a former deputy secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services whos now a senior fellow at Hudson Institute because on the one hand they need to get work done and theyll fall behind if the work is not done But if you encourage people to come into the office or people feel pressured to go into the office they might spread the flu and make the situation worse Heres the advice businesses are getting Reduce your meetings maybe even set up foot buffer zones around sick workers or just tell your flustricken employees to work from home But for some businesses working from home just isnt an option Take for example SmartSitting a nanny and babysitting agency based in Brooklyn Lauren Kay runs the business and says almost  percent of her sitters have called in sick in the past three weeks Generally its a baby and the sitter goes and gets the flu from the baby and then the sitter then has to cancel a number of future appointments because theyre sick Kay says Its really like all of New York City has sort of been tied together by a network of sitters and everyones just trying to stay healthy Kays agency has been stuck finding replacements at the last minute Its up to parents to decide whether to pay sick days to the regular nannies who missed work Kay says many of the parents her business works with do pay those days  but she says generally a lot of sitters dont feel empowered to ask for those days Its hard to inconvenience a family and say Hey I cant come in for work tomorrow and also can you pay me  Kay says The workers who do get paid when theyre out sick are the lucky ones About  percent of workers today actually dont get sick days and thats why so many work while under the weather says John Challenger CEO of Challenger Gray  Christmas an outplacement firm The economy is still on shaky ground explains Challenger and many workers continue to be worried about losing their jobs and so theyre reluctant to call in sick or even use their vacation days The combination of those sick employees infecting others at work and the sick workers staying home for days means businesses pay a high price during these sneezy months The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the flu costs employers about  billion every year  in health care expenses and lost productivity But some employers are fortunate  like Morris Berger the boss at Zeno Radio He says productivity actually didnt slow down much this winter No I think its getting better actually So maybe we dont need all these employees Berger says laughing What happened to save the company was one small blessing amid its epidemic The flu toppled only one person at a time
