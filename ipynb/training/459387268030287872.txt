Air travel can be a challenging and at times lifethreatening situation for the millions of people with allergies or sensitivities to pet dander strong scents and certain foods Some airlines have responded by replacing peanuts with pretzels including a few gluten and lactosefree dishes on inflight menus and offering to create buffer zones of seats around concerned passengers Now   which offers longhaul flights to Switzerland from seven US cities is promoting its certification as the worlds first allergyfriendly airline from the Berlinbased   ECARF which awards its allergyfriendly seal to cosmetics food vacuum cleaners and other products has a special list of criteria its advisory board uses to evaluate hotels and airlines For example ECARF requires that hotels keep allergycausing green plants out of guest rooms and that airlines have hypoallergenic soaps in the lavatories and no snack bags containing peanuts on board All certifications are valid for a period of two years and need to be recertified afterwards said Torsten Zuberbier ECARFs director In addition members of the foundation or authorized persons make unannounced checks during the period While Swiss has met ECARFs twopage criteria for airlines we are not an allergyfree airline but allergyfriendly said Sarah KlattWalsh director of inflight products and services for Swiss International Air Lines The distinction is important The airline has removed fresh flowers from the cabins and starting May  all Swiss flights will offer lactose and glutenfree food and beverage alternatives a choice of pillows stuffed with synthetic materials as an alternative to downfilled versions and unscented soaps in the lavatories And while the airline does not serve peanuts it cannot claim to be peanutfree because some food items might be prepared using peanut oil However pets are not a problem on board as we have a special air filter that pulls particles and animal hair downwards and out of the cabin said KlattWalsh Its certainly a step in the right direction but I feel it doesnt go far enough said Amy Wicker of   Theres still a lot of ambiguity especially for people with severe food allergies but clearly every step they take to help mitigate those things will help people in the long run Swiss believes the allergyfriendly certification will help the airline stand out in a crowded field It strengthens our market positioning which focuses on Swiss quality hospitality and care said KlattWalsh In the United States an estimated  million people suffer from allergies But its unlikely the   which also certifies asthma and allergyfriendly products will be giving its seal of approval to domestic airlines anytime soon To certify an airplane as allergyfriendly said spokesman Mike Tringale the organization would have to look at every item in the plane and take into account its allergyfriendliness including the seats an airlines peanut policy their policy about serving shellfish and their policies for pets in the cabin Im not saying airplanes and airlines have a problem said Tringale But as a patient advocate when you call something allergyfriendly you better be darn sure youve taken these things into consideration and have a standard comprehensive enough to really pay off the promise of being allergyfriendly to the consumer
