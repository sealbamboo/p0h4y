The human voice appears to trigger pleasure circuits in the brains of typical kids but not children with autism a Stanford University team reports The finding could explain why many children with autism seem indifferent to spoken words The Stanford team used functional MRI to compare the brains of  children who had autism spectrum disorders and  typical kids In typical kids there was a strong connection between areas that respond to the human voice and areas that release the feelgood chemical dopamine says   of the Stanford University School of Medicine But the strength of this coupling is reduced in children with autism he says Connections between voice areas and areas involved in emotionrelated learning also were weaker Menon says And he says the weaker the connections the more trouble a child had communicating The   were reported in the   Children with autism may not have the same motivation as other kids to listen to voices and to figure out what the words mean Menon says Researchers have noted autistic childrens indifference to human voices since the psychiatrist Leo Kanner described the disorder in the s But they have struggled to identify an underlying cause The new studys suggestion that motivation is the problem could explain why speech often comes late to children with autism even though the brain circuit involved in processing spoken words seems to function normally says   who studies communication in children with autism at The Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia She was not involved in the study It really looks like its not that the circuit is broken but rather that its not spontaneously made use of because the brain provides no reward she says The results also support a theory that children with autism lack a wide range of social skills because they simply arent as motivated as other kids to acquire them Chevallier says And she says if motivation is the problem then many autism therapies are right to offer food or other tangible rewards to children when they do things like listen carefully When youre reinforcing the childs behavior with MMs or a piece of cookie she says youre providing an extrinsic reason for the child to do something they didnt want to do in the first place So youre working on motivation The new study offers a stark reminder of just how different the world can be for people with autism says   of the University of Pittsburgh The world is filled with all kinds of sounds that a typical brain can filter out so we can pay attention to spoken words But in autism thats not happening she says
