By midmorning the smell of hot peanut oil dissipated and inside the tightly sealed laboratory known as Building F a pink hamburger sizzled in a pan over a raging gas flame Overhead fans whirred whisking caustic smoke up through a metallic esophagus of ductwork Woody Delp  a longhaired engineer in glasses  the Willie Nelson of HVAC  supervised the green bean and hamburger experiments He sat at a computer inside a kitchen simulator rows upon rows of numeric data appearing on his screen ticking off the constituents of the plume sucked up the flue A seared hamburger patty as he sees it is just a reliable source for indoor pollution I can claim Alice Waters influenced the recipe he said Its all fresh and local But Dr Delp and his colleagues arent really interested in testing recipes They are scientists at the Energy Departments Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the mornings experiment concerned another kitchen conundrum a fight against physics how to   Simply put cooking is an act of controlled combustion  you set oil fat and   on fire As a health hazard incinerating hamburgers and green beans may pale in comparison with lighting wood or coal fires indoors the leading environmental cause of death and disability around the world Yet frying grilling or toasting foods with gas and electric appliances creates particulate matter nitrogen dioxide   and carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds Acrolein which most cooks recognize as the smell of burnt fats or oils was used in grenades in World War I because it causes irritation to the lungs and eyes Emissions of nitrogen dioxide in homes with gas stoves exceed the Environmental Protection Agencys definition of clean air in an estimated  percent to  percent of those homes according to one model a quarter of them have air quality worse than the worst recorded smog nitrogen dioxide event in London Cooking represents one of the single largest contributors generating particulate matter formally known as PM at concentrations four times greater than major haze events in Beijing Because were used to the smell we dont think of it as an issue said    an air quality engineer at the Berkeley Lab When you live in a small building you cook a lot and dont use your range hood which may not be very effective anyway then youre probably going to have a problem with pollutants from cooking Recently Dr Logue estimated the longterm health effects expected from hundreds of chemicals found in average homes Her  study published in Environmental Health Perspectives used a common epidemiological metric known as disabilityadjusted lifeyear to show that the populationwide health impact of indoor pollutants is   and greater than that of traditional concerns like secondhand smoke or radon Its well over violence she said Its not a small risk Federal policy and financing tends to focus on research outdoors  air quality drinking water wastewater hazardous waste sites and soil contamination We havent had that regulatory driver for the indoor environment and yet the indoor environment is probably the most important environment in terms of human health said   an engineer and professor at the University of Texas at Austin If you look at just the dose of toxic chemicals we take into our bodies during our lifetime that are of environmental origin its dominated by the air that we breathe and the surfaces that we touch indoors Dr Corsi said The Berkeley Labs research is driven in part by renewed efforts to tighten building envelopes and save on energy costs Airtight buildings keep outdoors out but they also trap contaminants Efforts to mask odors  incense candles and air fresheners  exacerbate the hazard After all indoor combustion creates more pollutants that linger in tightly sealed spaces and formaldehyde for example is formed when ozone reacts with gases especially scenting agents plugin air fresheners and cleaners Since people arent likely to stop cooking the lab aims to come up with sciencebased ventilation standards People dont need to radically change their lifestyles Dr Logue said We need to change the building codes so that everyone gets a venting range hood Current ventilation standards  the V in HVAC  represent a best engineering judgment Theres never been much science involved in determining how well range hoods and other ventilation systems should work in terms of human health Existing metrics for performance most notably the Energy Star rating measure energy use not the impact of the appliance on human health And while its difficult to rid a home of the semivolatile organic compounds that leak out of say   over a long period of time volatile compounds from fire and water vapor can be removed with an effective kitchen fan A lot of homes dont have that said   the labs director Secondly a lot of the ones that do people dont use them and thirdly even if they have it and even if they use it a lot of them dont work very well When they tested seven different commercially available range hood designs Dr Singer and Dr Delp found that the airflow and the amount of burner exhaust and cooking contaminants whisked away  the socalled capture efficiency  varied   Dr Singer refers to recirculating hoods only somewhat jokingly as forehead greasers Inside the kitchen simulator fresh air whooshed through the room  an exchange rate of about  times per hour nearly  times the amount circulating in an average home But the experiments hadnt generated much appetite One lab assistant Omsri Bharat passed on the burgers because she is a vegetarian and the other Marcella Barrios a science teacher admitted to having packed a lunch Dr Singer is optimistic that new scientific standards might even change habits inside actual homes We want people to cook he said The health of America will probably get better We just want to make sure all those pollutants vapors and moisture from cooking get vented outside
