About five years ago emergency room doctor Julie Brown met an yearold girl who complained about a weeklong stomach ache The girl was tightlipped about what might be causing the pain and she ended up visiting the Seattle Childrens Hospital where Brown works twice And then a third time When I examined her she was sitting up and chatting with me   tells   She looked so well Then the young girls doctors ordered an Xray and found something odd She had a stack of magnets and batteries in her stomach Brown says She went right to the operating room where they did an endoscopy They only found a couple of them The doctors realized they would have to open her up and look for the rest What they found was a minefield of tiny round rareearth magnets she had swallowed A battery and a magnet were stuck together in her stomach which caused an ulcer A little further down the line in her gastrointestinal tract was another ulcer The yearold ended up losing about  centimeters of her intestines that had become seriously damaged We actually do pretty well with less intestine generally speaking Brown says But anyone who has had surgery involving opening the bowel has an increased lifelong risk of bowel obstruction due to   So it is definitely something we wish we could avoid The case pushed Brown already interested in studying foreign objects in the body to   who have an appetite for magnets In a recent   published in the   Brown and colleagues documented an increase in magnetrelated ailments that eventually bring young people into the emergency room Using national emergency room data from  to  Brown and other researchers found a fivefold increase in young people up to age  who swallowed magnets and wound up in the hospital Over that period there were about  injuries to kids from magnets Most of the time the magnets went through the mouth but nearly a quarter of the injuries were caused when kids stuck magnets up their noses The thing that motivated this research was what happened when the   tried to get all of these makers of spherical magnet sets to take their products off the market Brown says Last summer NPR   the CPSC issued its first stopsale order in  years The products included those of   the sinceliquidated maker of strong toy magnets called Buckyballs The national data are usually sparse on details about the nature of the magnet Brown says But there are a lot of magnets available in the community now than there were previously A lot more About  million sets of Buckyballs magnets were sold in the US from  on which is also when Brown saw an increase in Seattle cases involving magnet ingestion My local study showed a similar pattern of increase that the national study showed and all the increases were in the years between  and  Brown says Her   study collected more detailed information about each magnetrelated injury including type of magnet By  about twothirds of ingestions were caused by spherical balls from magnet sets that look a lot like Buckyballs Thats up from  percent in  We did find the increase could be explained by Buckyballstype magnets she says Most of the incidents involve young children but there was also a rise among older ones including teens But why the uptick in magnets being swallowed by teens Shouldnt they know better It turns out theyre not gobbling magnets like younger kids Instead she says theyre mostly using them to   like say a nose or tongue stud And while these older kids are out looking cool sometimes those little round magnets come loose Next thing you know theyre in the stomach or lower Definitely not cool
