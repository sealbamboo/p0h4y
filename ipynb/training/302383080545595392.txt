Carbohydrates are an essential part of a healthy diet yet its important to know that not all of them are created equal So how do you tell the difference between good carbs and bad carbs The answer is both simple  and complex Heres everything you need to know about carbohydrates and making smart choices when it comes to incorporating them into your diet  often referred to as just carbs are your bodys primary energy source and are a crucial part of any   The three main types of carbohydrates are sugars starches and fiber Theyre called simple or complex based on their chemical makeup and what your body does with them But since many foods contain one or more types of carbohydrates it can still be tricky to understand whats healthy for you and whats not Simple carbohydrates are composed of easytodigest basic sugars which can be an important source of energy Some of these sugars are naturally occurring such as those in fruits and in milk while refined or processed sugars are often added to candies baked goods and soda On nutrition labels added sugars can go by several different names including brown sugar corn sweetener corn syrup fructose glucose maltose malt syrup trehalose sucrose and honey among others The FDA has mandated that by July  all nutrition labels must clearly identify the amount of added sugars per serving in the product directly beneath the total sugar count Complex carbohydrates found in whole grains legumes and starchy vegetables contain longer chains of sugar molecules which usually take more time for the body to break down and use This in turn provides you with a more consistent amount of energy says   nutritionist and owner of Nutrition Works in Louisville Kentucky Simple carbohydrates arent necessarily all bad carbs  it depends on the food youre getting them from For instance fruits and vegetables are excellent sources of essential vitamins and minerals necessary for good health and they naturally contain simple carbohydrates composed of basic sugars But fruits and vegetables are drastically different from other foods in the simple carbohydrate category like cookies and cakes with added refined sugars The fiber in fruits and vegetables changes the way the body processes their sugars and slows down their digestion making them a bit more like complex carbohydrates Simple carbohydrates to limit in your diet include those found in Meyerowitz says that you can enjoy simple carbohydrates on occasion you just dont want them to be your primary sources of carbs Complex carbohydrates are considered good because of the longer series of sugars that they are made of which the body takes longer to break down That means you will get lower amounts of sugars released at a more consistent rate  instead of peaks and valleys  to keep you going throughout the day Foods with   also typically have more vitamins fiber and minerals than foods containing more simple carbohydrates as long as youre choosing whole grains over processed ones For example whole grains such as wholewheat flour quinoa brown rice barley corn and oats among others provide more nutrients than processed grains such as white rice and breads pasta and baked goods made with white flour Nutrientdense complex carbs that  part of a healthy balanced diet include Its important to scan ingredient labels for foods like breads and pastas looking for whole grains and fewer sources of added sugar Read the box so you know what exactly youre getting If the first ingredient is wholewheat flour or wholeoat flour its likely going to be a complex carbohydrate Meyerowitz says When trying to figure out if a source of carbohydrates is good or bad remember this The higher in sugar it is and the lower inÂ   vitamins and minerals the worse the food is for you Describing carbs as either simple or complex is one way to classify them but nutritionists and dietitians now use another concept to guide people in making decisions about the carbs they choose to eat The   of a food basically tells you how quickly and how high your blood sugar will rise after eating the carbohydrate contained in that food as compared with eating pure sugar Foods with a high GI are easily digested and cause a quick rise in blood sugar Foods with a lower GI get digested more slowly Knowing the GI for a specific food can help you understand how the carbs in that food will affect your blood sugar but its important to point out that it doesnt necessarily make a food unhealthy or healthy Fruits like watermelon and cantaloupe both have a high GI even though both are healthy foods You can look up a foods GI using the   To take this approach one step further you want to look at the   of a food The glycemic load factors into account both glycemic index and how much carbohydrate is in the food To determine glycemic load you multiply a foods glycemic index number by the amount of carbohydrate the food contains per serving and divide by  A low GL is  or less medium is  to  and  or greater is considered high For example a plain bagel has a GI of  and GL of  while wholewheat bread has a GI of  and GL of  GL can also be used to compare the effect of carbohydrates on blood sugar in entire meals or snacks whereas the GI for a food is only indicative of one food at a time Even if a food contains carbs that have a high glycemic index number if the amount of carbohydrate is low then it wont have as much of an impact A good example is watermelon which has a GI of  but a GL of only  It tastes sweet but its mostly water The bottom line Carbs are not bad for you Carbohydrates  both simple  complex ones  are part of a healthy diet Just be sensible about the carbs you choose Skip lownutrient desserts consider the levels of sugar and fiber and focus on healthy whole grains fruits and veggies to get the energy your body needs every day
