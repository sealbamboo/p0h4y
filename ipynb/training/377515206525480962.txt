The woman with the swollen red leg was selling us one bill of goods after another She said she had stopped injecting drugs years before the fresh needle marks on her feet suggested otherwise She said she had duly taken all the antibiotic pills another hospital had given her although most people dont finish those prescriptions But we didnt raise an eyebrow at the least likely claim of all Instead we wrote it down carefully in our notes and it became a part of her hospital record highlighted in red on the computer and set off with an exclamation point permanently molding her medical life and also in a way our own This was her lifethreatening allergy to penicillin About one in  Americans reports a serious allergy to the antibiotic penicillin or any of several closely related drugs Yet in about  percent of cases   Some people are using the word allergy imprecisely Antibiotics can have all kinds of dreadful side effects from diarrhea to nerve damage but most of these are not formally considered allergies Some people confuse antibiotics an older woman once described to me in spinechilling detail the swollen lips and wheezing that had kept her away from penicillin since before World War II But penicillin wasnt around then and she probably had a sulfa allergy instead A few people  or more likely their doctors  mix up the disease and the treatment Syphilis and Lyme disease can sometimes dramatically worsen in the hours following effective treatment but that isnt a drug allergy either Some people may have only a mild allergy Ampicillin in particular can cause a rash that is annoying but not dangerous Meanwhile people with the throatswelling heartstopping immediate reaction to penicillin called anaphylaxis often outgrow it   will remain allergic after five years In other words the chances were good that we could have treated that angry infected leg with a penicillin drug without running into problems It was by far our best and cheapest option But we routinely sidestep this particular gamble The odds may be strongly in our favor more than for most of the risks we routinely take but it is hard to say who is more terrified by the prospect of overriding a patients allergy history the patient or the hospitals lawyers So a couple of times a week we briefly consider our options right and wrong The right option is not to proceed like a bunch of cowboys gleefully administering the penicillin ourselves The right option is to address the matter with the available scientific tools A system of skin tests can predict with precision whether a person can safely get penicillin and its many relatives At this point in our discussion if it gets this far we always look at each other with some confusion Are the chemicals needed for a skin test available these days The major one was off the market for quite a few years but now is back again Who does the testing anyway It needs an experienced hand Is that person still working here Somebody should definitely find out the answers for sure we say But at the moment we are in a big hurry We need to get this woman on treatment so she can get better and vacate that expensive hospital bed for somebody else Our patient is not one of the rare individuals who absolutely needs penicillin Plenty of other antibiotics will help her These days only certain patients with syphilis have no good treatment alternatives For them we deploy not only skin tests which take about an hour in the right hands but even the painstaking daylong desensitization procedures that can briefly defuse the immune reaction to the drug For every other patient we head cheerfully down the wrong path It takes us less than seven seconds to choose among various other antibiotics They are more expensive than a penicillin drug would be and also more powerful They will kill off a lot of innocent intestinal organisms that our patient would probably be better off keeping They will let drugresistant variants thrive and escape into the world But our patients leg will get better and that is our visible focus The resistant microbial population in her gut our hospital our other patients our community and our very own selves no man is an island when it comes to microbes are invisible She is only one patient in one hospital but the sum total of all those decisions in all the patients like her in all the hospitals in the country is chilling Or rather it would be chilling if we had the time to sit down and think about it
