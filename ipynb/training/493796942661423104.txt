Though the vaccine against human papilloma virus is highly effective in preventing certain forms of cancer the number of preteens getting the vaccine is still dismally low doctors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Thursday One of the top five reasons parents listed is that it hadnt been recommended to them by a doctor or nurse the CDCs   told reporters at a press briefing Parents who arent planning to vaccinate lacked knowledge and didnt hear a physician recommendation said Schuchat who directs the CDCs National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases We dont think its an issue of politics This is something that parents seem to be open to Federal health officials have for several years been recommending that all preteen boys and girls be vaccinated around age  or   before the initiation of sexual activity Thats when the vaccine has been shown to be most protective against HPV infections that can lead to cervical cancer genital warts and oral and anal cancers But data from the national survey released Thursday and published in this weeks   suggest that only  percent of young women ages   and only  percent of young men that age  have received one or more vaccine doses Every year more  people in the US get cancer caused by HPV Schuchat said Protection against the virus did go up a little bit in  the survey showed compared with  when  percent of young women and  percent of young men had received the vaccine Still more needs to be done Schuchat said Doctors and nurses are missing many good opportunities to vaccinate for HPV she said For example they are already successfully immunizing preteens at a high rate against tetanus diphtheria and pertussis   and   Roughly  percent of  to yearolds have been immunized against meningitis and about  percent have received the Tdap vaccine The problem is not that doctors are reluctant to give the vaccine Schuchat said its more often a problem of miscommunication Surveys show many are actually forgetting to mention it to patients Physicians need to know that the vaccines they give can prevent very serious cancers in the US she said At every appointment for adolescents doctors should tell parents  Today there are three recommended vaccines  Schuchat advised Had shots against HPV been administered when other routine vaccines were given to preteens in the last several years she says about  percent of todays yearold girls would be protected  which collected information on more than  teens in the  survey has been collecting vaccination information since  through use of randomdigitdialing of both landlines and cellphones After a teens parent or guardian provided permission to contact the teens health provider the survey team mailed the parents a questionnaire Results from the survey were then verified via a check of medical records
