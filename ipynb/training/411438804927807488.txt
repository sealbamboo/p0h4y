The shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Conn one year ago sparked a national conversation about the countrys troubled   system Politicians convened task forces and promised additional funding and new laws But today despite those promises patients and advocates say treatment for mental health is still in shambles Rheanna Kathleen Morris  was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder at the end of her sophomore year of high school and has spent the past two years in and out of psychiatric units and residential treatment facilities near her home in the suburbs of Richmond Va Her mother Peggy SinclairMorris is a former special education teacher with a network of contacts But even for this family with the knowhow to work the system helping Rheanna get treatment has been a constant challenge Its scary Its very fragmented says SinclairMorris Theres not a onestop shop You have to call people You have to network You have to find someone who might have had an experience similar to yours  From the familys perspective not much has changed in the year since the shooting at Sandy Hook recent events in Virginia seem to support that conclusion Just last month state   yearold son stabbed his father several times before killing himself Austin Deeds had struggled with serious mental health problems he was   in a psychiatric facility the day before his death The rate of violent crimes among the mentally ill   but Rheanna Morris says the story hit home anyway I almost cried actually she says I was reading about it in a newspaper and I thought What if that had been me I know I would never hurt my family Rheanna says but if it had been me you wouldnt hear about it all over the news you know Nothing would have happened The last time Rheanna was hospitalized she waited in the emergency room for eight hours before a bed was found in a psychiatric ward Both Rheanna and her mother worry that next time they might not be as lucky After the Sandy Hook shootings Virginia officials talked about the states mental health system and ended up boosting funding by about  percent A similar conversation took place in state legislatures across the country In    increased funding for mental health But   director of state policy and advocacy at the National Alliance on Mental Illness says that was a drop in the bucket after four years of steep cuts during a recession that brought the system to the brink of collapse After these sorts of shootings theres a lot of talk and a lot of policymakers saying we need to do something about the mental health system Diehl says But then when push comes to shove and the budget debates occur mental health seems to lose out Most of the additional funding in  came through state bills that were already being considered before the Newtown shootings Diehl adds The events there just gave legislators the push they needed to pass the bills Still she says thats a lot more than was done by federal legislators I give the states a Bplus says Diehl I give the feds a Cminus maybe a D Theres been lots of talk no action Despite all the dialogue and consternation Congress didnt pass mental health legislation following Sandy Hook Instead it tied possible changes to a gun control bill that never passed the Senate Several other bills are still in the works On the other hand Diehl says the Obama administration did quite well by recently publishing the long overdue set of   The administration has also been pushing states to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act which would infuse new money into the system So far Virginia has declined the expansion But overall Diehl says the national response to Sandy Hook was disappointing That hasnt come as a shock to Virginians says Mira Signer who runs the   of the National Alliance on Mental Illness In  the state was the site of the deadliest mass shooting in US history on the campus of Virginia Tech The attack left  people dead at the hands of a man with a serious mental illness During the legislative session immediately following the shooting elected officials in Virginia added  million in new mental health funding But then the recession hit and they cut about  million from mental health So we were kind of back to square one says Signer Then this week following the Creigh Deeds tragedy Republican Gov Robert McDonnell   back in the system Signer says this sort of roller coaster in the way mental health services are funded is typical But its no way to run a system she says because in the end little changes I can look at reports and studies that were done    or  years ago and Im looking at the recommendations and theyre still true today Signer says You just have to slap another date on it  because they all say the same thing Cutting mental health funding she adds is foolish because mental health expenses then just show up in other ways It shows up in the criminal justice system Signer says It shows up in homelessness It shows up in high emergency room usage Its an illusion to cut it
