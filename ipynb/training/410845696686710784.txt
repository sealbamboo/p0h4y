Drinking raw milk is a risky idea especially for children suggests a new report published Wednesday About one in six people who tried raw milk in Minnesota over a year period got sick according to the study published in the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions journal Emerging Infectious Diseases And many of them got seriously sick Thirteen percent of the people who became ill needed to be hospitalized for an average of three days Most of those who got sick after drinking raw milk were children and an monthold infant sickened with a toxic E coli O infection died  The new report led by Minnesota Department of Health epidemiologist Trisha Robinson is a snapshot of the illness outbreaks linked to unpasteurized milk in that state one of the  US states in which raw milk is allowed to be sold in some capacity Robinson writes that raw milk is frequently identified as the source of foodborne illness outbreaks and while these cases are often reported in the media they likely represent a small piece of the actual number of illnesses associated with raw milk  Outbreaks associated with raw milk occur frequently and receive a lot of media attention but our study shows that sporadic cases of illnesses associated with raw milk consumption far outnumber cases associated with recognized outbreaks Robinson said in an email We hope that our findings will help inform potential raw milk consumers when thinking about drinking raw milk or giving it to their children In  the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote an   advising against giving children unpasteurized milk  Over the decade they tracked the researchers found about  people got sick with serious intestinal infections caused by bacteria including E coli O and other toxic strains salmonella   and   About half of those who got sick got their raw milk from their own or a relatives dairy farm and there more cases of illnesses during the summer Its not clear how many Americans nationwide regularly consume raw milk but one survey of  states in the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network found that  percent of respondents reported drinking raw milk in the last seven days   estimate of annual illnesses linked to unpasteurized milk is about the same as Robinsons  around  a year But advocates say raw milk is worth the risk because they say it can help relieve allergy and asthma symptoms and other health problems says Sally Fallon Morrell founder of A Campaign for Real Milk which is pushing for legal sales of raw milk on all  states Plus raw milk advocates say it tastes better than conventional milk  creamier mostly Morrell hopes legalizing raw milk  which her organization defines as unprocessed unpasteurized fullfat milk from pasturefed cows will lead to stricter safety standards  But Robinson and many other public health experts think raw milk fans tend to minimize the health risks of not pasteurizing milk  Some raw milk advocates fail to acknowledge the elevated health risk associated with raw milk consumption and minimize the significance of reported outbreaks Robinson said In doing so these advocates convey a false sense of the safety of raw milk to those who are considering consuming this product and this sense of safety discourages a balanced assessment of the potential risks and benefits involved Mary McGonigleMartin whose son was hospitalized with an E coli infection for two months after consuming raw milk in  believes that some might not realize how serious and lifethreatening foodborne illnesses can be   In my laymans mind salmonella poisoning would be a little diarrhea and vomiting says McGonigleMartin who lives in California where sales of raw milk are legal Not that I would want to inflict that she says But she thought worst case scenario Her boy  at the time would have a few unpleasant days of vomiting and diarrhea and bounce back relatively quickly Best case Chris might finally have some relief from his constant congestion something his mother had a hunch was being caused by the pasteurization in milk  Chris had been drinking raw milk regularly for about two and a half weeks when he got ill eventually he was diagnosed with an E coli infection that led to hemolytic uremic syndrome or HUS a disease that destroys red blood cells and can lead to kidney failure He needed a ventilator for nine days had acute pancreatitis for two months and needed seven blood transfusions during his twomonth hospital stay she said While there the family met another little girl who was hospitalized with the same symptoms as Chris and drank the same brand of raw milk which is how McGonigleMartin made the connection Now her family has cut out dairy entirely and she encourages those who might be considering raw milk to do their homework first You need to know all the different bacteria that can find their way into raw milk and the illnesses each of those bacteria can result in says McGonigleMartin who works in education in Murieta Calif Then youre making an informed decision about raw milk If you dont know what kind of pathogenic bacteria can find its way into raw milk then youre not making an informed decision
