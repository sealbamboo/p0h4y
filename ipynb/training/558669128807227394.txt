A yearold giant virus has been revived from the frozen Siberian tundra sparking concern that increased mining and oil drilling in   could disturb dormant microbial life that could one day prove harmful to man The latest find described online Monday in the   appears to belong to a new family of megaviruses that infect only amoeba But its revival in a laboratory stands as a proof of principle that we could eventually resurrect active infectious viruses from different periods said the studys lead author microbiologist JeanMichel Claverie of AixMarseille University in France We know that those nondangerous viruses are alive there which probably is telling us that the dangerous kind that may infect humans and animals  that we think were eradicated from the surface of Earth  are actually still present and eventually viable in the ground Claverie said With climate change making northern reaches more accessible the chance of disturbing dormant human pathogens increases the researchers concluded Average surface temperatures in the area that contained the virus have increased more steeply than in more temperate latitudes the researchers noted People will go there they will settle there and they will start mining and drilling Claverie said Human activities are going to perturb layers that have been dormant for  million years and may contain viruses Claveries coauthor Chantal Abergel nonetheless cautioned that their finding is limited to one innocuous virus infecting an amoebaWe cannot definitely say that there are some human pathogens in there she said They will reexamine the drill core samples Abergel said to find out if there is anything there that is dangerous to humans and animals Claveries laboratory was behind the discovery in Chile more than a decade ago of the first giant DNA virus dubbed   They next identified a far larger virus of an entirely different family in  dubbing it   in homage to the mythical Pandoras box that first unleashed evil on the world This time they used an amoeba commonly found in soil and water as bait to draw out a virus from a Siberian permafrost core that had been dated to  years ago The finding described Monday looked like another Pandora except it was  larger The genome of the newly described virus however contained only about a quarter of the number of paired DNA building blocks as Pandora and the prevailing type of these base pairs was similar to the kind that dominate the Mimivirus genome Researchers kept with the ominous mythological theme and dubbed their find Pithovirus from the Greek   the type of amphora or jar that Pandora opened it was not a box after all Pithovirus still has an unusually large genome   base pairs which the researchers predict would include genes that code  proteins The genome of Pandora virus contains more than  million base pairs and about  coding genes For comparison the tiny HIV retrovirus has  base pairs and nine coding genes the virus that causes mononucleosis has about  base pairs and about  genes The prospect of finding additional viruses that prove to be viable in a host remains uncertain Microbiologist Brent C Christner of Louisiana State University who has done similar work on frozen microbes but was not involved in the study cautioned that DNA is easily damaged and that viruses cannot replicate or mutate without a host They have no source of energy he said They have to hijack the mechanisms of the host cell Nonetheless the study further challenges the notion that viruses can be fully eradicated Christner said The genome described in the study he noted encodes  proteins involved in transcription DNA repair and replication The researchers plan to reexamine large viruses that have been mistaken for bacteria in the past  one such specimen found in  had infected an amoeba living in a yearold womans contact lens solution They also plan to look more deeply into the Siberian ice cores We have a sample that dates to  million years old Abergel said Those samples could harbor ancient forms of relatively modern human pathogens including smallpox which was rampant in Siberia Fragments of a smallpox virus for example have been identified in Siberian mummies dating from the late th century I would not be surprised that those viruses are still in the ground Claverie said
