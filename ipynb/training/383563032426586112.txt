Music is an extremely powerful medium said Dr Olajide Williams founder of the program  Great poets have described music as being the bridge between heaven and Earth but I see music as the bridge between health education and the streets For nearly a decade Hip Hop Public Health has taken public health messages   which lets face it can sound boring if youre a kid or an adult for that matter  and transformed them using clever rap lyrics and infectious beats When Williams  whose day job is chief of staff in the Department of Neurology at NYPresbyterianColumbia Medical Center  had the idea of fusing hiphop and public health his next thought was that he needed serious help Im really hopeless he said laughing  Im a neurologist Im not a rapper Williams needed a partner someone with hiphop credibility which he knew was essential to get through to inner city children After a relentless pursuit Williams scored a major coup when legendary rapper Doug E Fresh also known as the Human Beat Box agreed to work with him   Their first project in  was presented at  schools in Harlem teaching children how to recognize a stroke  The main instrument of the interventions was a video populated by colorful animated characters doing a dance called The Stroke The songs catchy refrain is If he dont sound right then hes doing the stroke Sway when he walks then hes doing the stroke Slur when he talks then hes doing the stroke It then urges the children to call  if they recognize those symptoms After several months the pilot program seemed to be working according to Williams   Not only were kids excited  yes excited  to learn about stroke they tended to share the messages they learned with family members at home In addition there are several stories of children saving family members in the grips of a brain attack  One child recognized that his grandmother was having a stroke and called  saving her life Thats the power of children the potential role that children can play within the public health chain of survival Williams said  That story has always stayed with me and thats one of the things that really keeps me going With the stroke program Williams realized he had tripped over a powerful communication model that could work for a whole host of diseases and conditions So he deepened his bench adding rappers like Easy AD a former member of the Cold Crush Brothers Chuck D of Public Enemy and DMC of Run DMC to his roster The crew then dug into one the of the most pressing health problems facing minority communities obesity The challenges are formidable   Recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data indicate that obesity rates are falling overall but the rates among Hispanic and AfricanAmerican children are still troublingly high  Those children also tend to live in areas saturated with fast food chains with little access to healthy foods  Hip Hop HEALS or Healthy Eating and Living in Schools the program Williams and his rapper colleagues developed tries to chip away at those issues  Everyone remembers their favorite song growing up said Easy AD director of programming for Hip Hop Public Health  Even if youre    years old you always remember the words the melody how it made you feel when you listened to it Thats what were doing with our program he added  We take health messages and attach them to good feelings good memories and that makes children incorporate those messages into their lives In one video titled Watch Your Calories a cartoon character voiced by rapper Artie Green admonishes two children who are about to eat fatty fast food meals to stop right there for a second  Before you supersize that No  now check it See theres a whole lot of stuff in that meal you dont need A menu appears showing the sugars carbohydrates and fats contained in their meals  An embedded message in the video is menu board literacy providing children whose main option may be fast food with the information they need  to make healthier choices Williams admits that teaching children the importance of cooking meals at home and purchasing healthy groceries would also be effective but he says that teaching caloric literacy can also provide a substantive impact   For example he says cutting  calories a day using better menu board literacy could translate to a few thousand calories over a few weeks   These small changes are meaningful and on a population level these small changes could have very significant impact he said Another video developed for the obesity program teaches children how to achieve their anaerobic threshold a measure of optimal performance while exercising The video titled Hip Hop FEET uses a set of musical beats as a measuring stick for how effectively a child is exercising   If they breathe before the beats count is up they are overexerting themselves  If they dont breathe enough that means theyre not trying hard enough  And if they breathe once at the conclusion of the beats theyve hit their anaerobic threshold It is a complex concept simplified for young people  Its using hiphop in a positive way to have real impact Doug E Fresh said  We use beats that make you really wanna move  Youre not just gonna sit there you wanna get up and do something As it turns out the programs for healthier eating and exercise are doing much more than simply making children move   Peerreviewed studies conducted by Williams and colleagues found that immediately after caloric literacy interventions children changed their food purchases  We found that caloric purchases declined by about  Williams said  So they were buying more healthy items as a result of the intervention The lingering question for this intervention  and for the Hip Hop Public Health program more generally  is how to sustain this change   After reaching tens of thousands of children in New York Hip Hop Public Health got a shoutout  and a request to collaborate  from the Partnership for a Healthier America whose ambassador is first lady Michelle Obama What evolved from that partnership is an album releasing Monday called  The album moves the songs beyond hiphop into other genres some of the artists contributing to the album include Ashanti Travis Barker and Matisyahu and will be distributed along with a curriculum to schools nationwide   Williams is convinced the model that began in New York with a neurologist and a few rappers could make a powerful impact in schools across the country This really teaches us how impressionable kids are and how we have an opportunity to shape their behaviors at a young age he said
