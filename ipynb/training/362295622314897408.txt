Its a scenario that may happen more as science reveals cancers secrets the biggest one being that what we now call cancer maybe shouldnt be called cancer at all  The word cancer often invokes the specter of an inexorably lethal process a working group for the National Cancer Institute   However cancers are heterogeneous and can follow multiple paths not all of which progress to metastases and death Basically cancer is scary but some kinds may be more boogeymaninthecloset scary than serial killer scary  To understand fully you have to look at the history of cancer diagnosis Brawley says In the s a group of German pathologists did some of the first biopsies on people who had clearly died of cancer They took samples of their tumors and decided what breast cancer looks like what lung cancer looks like etc  Today Brawley says there is a patient who has a lesion thats approximately  millimeters in diameter  smaller than a pea Theres a doctor taking a biopsy of that lesion and a pathologist whos analyzing the sample using stcentury technology The problem Brawley says is that theyre still comparing the samples to the cancer definition that was created more than  years ago  Hes going This looks just like what those Germans said is breast cancer  Brawley said of the pathologist But its  millimeters in size What killed the woman  years ago had spread all throughout her body  We all harbor abnormalities says   Dartmouth professor of medicine and author of the book   And new technology is increasingly able to find these abnormalities When we do our inclination is to act even when the remedy turns out to be far more harmful than the disease would have been had it run its course  There is a growing consensus backed by mounting scientific evidence that Americans tend to be overtested overdiagnosed and overtreated across a variety of conditions   that unnecessary interventions account for  to  of US health care spending  Part of the problem is our medical culture Welch says The physician may be engaging in what is known as defensive medicine which entails ordering tests to guard against malpractice suits should something go awry There may also be perverse economic incentives at play  that is in a feeforservice system doctors are compensated for the quantity of tests and procedures they order  But a   of physicians with the US Department of Veterans Affairs found that salaried physicians who received no income from an increased volume of services and who had limited liability concerns ordered as many heart stress tests deemed unnecessary as doctors in more traditional settings   The researchers theorized that the doctors had an exaggerated perception of benefit of the tests In an   on the study Dr Deborah Grady observed that while the study sample was small neverthless it suggests that the culture of overdoing is ingrained   Simply put physicians are trained to think that the way you take care of people is to find stuff and to take care of that stuff Welch says  Patients arent exactly helping the issue either Energized by public awareness cancer campaigns many patients have been empowered to find cancer early through screening and to intervene as soon as possible Welch observes  To raise awareness and to get people to participate in screening we have to whip up fear we must introduce a bit of disease into the population he said In a way we have to make them feel as if the world may be a more dangerous place and that they ought to be worried about their future  Brawleys patient the one he refused to treat eventually found another doctor who would treat his prostate cancer Patients will doctorshop until they get what they want Brawley said  Its an issue many people have difficulty wrapping their heads around Some patients who are diagnosed with cancer do not need to be treated because that cancer is never going to bother them The problem is that we dont know who those people are  There is a lot of work and research in this area in trying to better characterize which tumors will matter Welch said The National Cancer Institute working group made several recommendations for the medical community in addressing   and overtreatment One was a change in the terminology doctors use to talk about cancer especially when the cells theyve found may not be dangerous  Use of the term cancer should be reserved for describing lesions with a reasonable likelihood of lethal progression if left untreated they wrote  They also noted that the public should be made aware that overdiagnosis is common in cancer screening Doctors know that approximately  of localized lung cancer tumors and  to  of localized breast cancer tumors that are found through screening would never cause harm Brawley says That tumor would just stay there never grow never spread The rate is even higher for prostate cancer at    But isnt screening used to catch some aggressive cancers in people that we would otherwise see too late to treat Some overdiagnosis is acceptable Brawley says We cure and treat some people who dont need to be treated And in return we save some lives But screening has its own dangers Whenever you test a population you will have some false positives For example if a woman is told that her mammogram is abnormal that diagnosis might be straightened out days or weeks later and she might find out that she does not have cancer The diagnosis will create anxiety and lead to additional unnecessary testing  Good health is more than absence of physical abnormality its also a state of mind experts say In my experience its not the diagnosis of cancer which really kills people said   a former oncologist vice provost for global initiatives and chairman of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania Its the uncertainty   The National Cancer Institute group recommended reducing the frequency of some screening examinations focusing that screening on highrisk groups eg   and raising the requirements that would lead to a biopsy or other follow up care   Weve been taught that cancer is a terrible thing and the way to deal with it always is to find it early and cut it out Brawley said Were starting to realize that that is not true in all cases
