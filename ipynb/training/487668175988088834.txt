The incident was  The CDC report says the potential exposure happened between June  and June  A lab that had been preparing the anthrax samples for use in two other labs on the CDCs Atlanta campus may not have adequately inactivated the samples That means the other labs were working with samples thought to be harmless therefore workers didnt wear protective equipment they would otherwise have been using when handling such infectious material Procedures in two of the three labs may have exposed workers to the anthrax the CDC said Hallway and lab areas have since been decontaminated The leader of one of the labs was reassigned shortly after the incident was revealed CDC spokesman Tom Skinner would not confirm the name of the person who was reassigned  There are three types of anthrax infection cutaneous through the skin inhalation through the lungs and gastrointestinal through digestion According to the report the exposure happened because the lab that was handling the dangerous material initially didnt use an approved sterilization technique It didnt have a written plan reviewed by senior staff to make sure all safety protocols were followed and there was a limited knowledge of peerreviewed literature about the process that would make it less dangerous The lab also did not have a standard operating procedure that would make sure the transfer of the material would be safe Bottom line the scientists failed to follow a scientifically derived and reviewed protocol that would have assured the anthrax was deactivated according to CDC Director   It should have happened and it didnt During the investigation multiple other problems were found according to Frieden Investigators found another troubling case that involved a dangerous transfer of material This happened six weeks ago But whats most distressing according to Frieden is that he had found out about it less than  hours ago  In this case a culture of nonpathogenic avian influenza meaning a type of the flu that is not that dangerous was unintentionally crosscontaminated with a potentially deadly kind of flu  the highly pathogenic HN This strain has killed millions of birds and infected over  people over the last decade In the case of this contamination the CDC says none of the lab workers were exposed to the dangerous virus It was however shipped to a lab run by the United States Department of Agriculture  The CDC has closed the labs that were involved in the incidents The lab where the flu contamination occurred wont reopen until the lab puts better safety procedures in place Frieden says  The lab involved in the anthrax incident will remain closed for such dangerous microbes until Frieden personally approves its reopening under conditions that prevent any such mishap from happening again Frieden said The CDC has also stopped moving any biological material out of its two highestlevel labs while their procedures are being reevaluated  As a result of these problems the CDC has created a highlevel group of leaders who will work on lab safety issues It has also started putting together an external advisory group to take a closer look at lab safety And the CDC is carefully reviewing all the other procedures for labs working with dangerous pathogens and it has put together a rapidresponse command structure to hopefully help the labs avoid future incidents I will say that Im just astonished that this could have happened here Frieden said He stands by his labs which are considered some of the best in the world and he stands by his scientists But he added that he is upset angry and has lost sleep over the incidents and he is working around the clock to make sure it never happens again
