A common vitamin supplement appears to dramatically reduce a womans risk of having a child with autism  of more than  women in Norway found that those who started taking folic acid before getting pregnant were about  percent less likely to have a child who developed the disorder researchers reported in the   Thats a huge effect says   one of the studys authors and a professor of epidemiology at Columbia Universitys Mailman School of Public Health Folic acid is the synthetic version of a B vitamin called folate Its found naturally in foods such as spinach blackeyed peas and rice Public health officials recommend that women who may become pregnant take at least  micrograms of folic acid every day to reduce the chance of having a child with spina bifida The link between folic acid and autism risk is especially striking because the supplement is so cheap and easy to get Lipkin says The notion that a very simple nontoxic food supplement could reduce your risk is profound he says There are caveats though To get the full benefit mothers had to start taking folic acid supplements four weeks before conceiving and keep taking them during the first eight weeks of pregnancy Risk reduction was also limited to severe autism not milder forms such as Aspergers Despite public health campaigns urging women in the US to take folic acid many are still not taking the supplements when they become pregnant That may be because spina bifida and related birth defects are quite rare But when you start talking about autism a disorder that has an incidence of  percent or higher that really does bring it to home Lipkin says That is a substantial risk In the US some foods are fortified with folic acid Yet women often do not get enough folate through diet alone Lipkin says even if they eat a lot of healthful foods I have nothing at all against green vegetables and beans he says But you only absorb about half of the dietary folate that you take in The study of Norwegian mothers is the biggest one so far to link folic acid to a reduced risk of autism though smaller studies have reached a similar conclusion This study is reassuring that folic acid supplementation not only is safe but actually decreases the rate of autism says   a professor of pediatrics at the Golisano Childrens Hospital at the University of Rochester The study also offers a reminder that   are often linked to events that take place soon after conception Those very first weeks to months of brain development that can provide longlasting differences in neurologic function she says Previous studies have found that factors including   and diabetes can also influence a mothers risk of having a child with autism Hyman says Women who may become pregnant should eat a balanced diet exercise decrease stress and take supplements containing folic acid so they can have the healthiest baby possible she says
