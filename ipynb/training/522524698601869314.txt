But now that the show has finished filming its final season yearold JWoww whose real name is Jenni Farley is moving on to a cleaner lifestyle to prepare for the next chapter of her life which includes getting married I started taekwondo at  or  years old and did a bunch of kickboxing later too Eventually I became a black belt and coached as well I did some basketball and softball growing up but most of my activity was martial arts I entered a few competitions broke some boards and bricks and won a few silver medals but what I remember most as a kid was competing against this one girl who was more advanced and much bigger than me She really did a number on me and I hated that but my girlfriend got her back later that day That was the only competition I lost I won all the other fights It is definitely about looking good but also feeling good about yourself You get your endorphins up the blood is flowing and you feel energized There is a lot of focus on building up muscles though Tanning is also part of the summer lifestyle down at the shore and there are those vitamins you get from the sun It started back when I went to college when I was  and gained the freshman  or  Then I started running a few miles a day and burned some off For Season  of Jersey Shore all the partying led to lots of latenight snacking Because of the alcohol Id be eating pizza Philly cheese steaks and cheese balls Oh God I love cheese balls There were also days of being too hung over to go to the gym After the first two seasons I hit a wall I couldnt fit into my pants anymore and I decided to clean up my diet a little and become more healthconscious I started doing  minutes of cardio each day usually on a treadmill or a treadclimber plus doing weight machines and free weights Im making better food choices with lots of vegetables and protein and not doing all that latenight snacking My fianc is a bodybuilder who has a crazy routine at the gym so its hard for us to work out together Normally I do cardio and I just watch him I like watching him work out I would say he has helped influence me We bounce off each other and make each other go When he doesnt want to go I convince him to just do it anyway and vice versa
