He says anyone can do it his way without surgery or a special diet program I always tell people its the three ps persistence passion and perseverance Gibson said   The turning point came when the yearold watched his wife tear up during The Biggest Loser She told me she loved me but she worried that I wasnt going to be around long because of my weight Gibson said I had to do something Gibson had been heavy all his life  Growing up none of the adults in his family ever talked to him about healthy eating They didnt have to he says   My mom used to joke my dad would get kicked out of buffets he had such a great appetite and such a great metabolism He never had to work to be small Gibson said My mom was never bigger than a size  His mom tried to set a good example with daily exercise She was the person who got up and did her Jane Fonda video every morning Gibson said But he was an only child and everyone in his family showed their love with food  His grandmother especially doted on him She would take me to McDonalds nearly every day Gibson said I did love a big cheeseburger and fries and I never met a sweet I didnt like He wasnt much into sports or exercising either I never learned to swim at camp because Id get ear aches Gibson said I remember playing kickball in second grade and broke my pinky finger And from there on out when theyd ask me to play Id say Nope Im good As he steadily gained weight Gibson said he was lucky that the kids didnt bully him about it Ive always had a great sense of humor and can deflect the attention from my being obese Gibson said  That sense of humor also got him in trouble  While attending an allboys Catholic school in Ohio known for its orderly discipline he served a lot of time in detention   But being the class clown also paid off with fast friendships   Im lucky people have always been nice or at least they try to be Gibson said People would often give me a backhanded compliment like youre handsome for a fat kid He met his wife Sheree at a fraternity function in  They were in graduate school at the time They married two years later Soon after he watched her tear up over The Biggest Loser he cut himself trying to force a zipper closed on a pair of pants that were too tight Thats when he finally decided he had enough  He had to lose weight and he wanted to do it in a way that would stick   Rather than cut out all bad food he gradually reduced the amount he was eating I loved fried chicken so I decided I would eat six pieces instead of eight Gibson said Then Id reduce it further to four pieces and then eventually dropped fried chicken all together I ate meat more like it was a protein condiment  Now I dont eat any meat at all Im a dedicated vegan Gibson said he is hyper vigilant about what he eats now Hell start the day with a protein shake before he heads off to the gym in the morning  After he works out he eats oatmeal with apple slices Lunch is vegetarian chili with a salad and more vegetables such as Brussels sprouts broccoli or corn on the cob Dinner is often popcorn with an occasional smoothie for dessert  By now this kind of eating is a habit  so much so that when I went to visit a friend in Iowa I packed my popcorn and chili and ate it on my layover in Chicago Gibson said He breaks from routine every once in awhile though  In May I turned  and decided to splurge Gibson said We went to a vegan bakery and got a slice of the hummingbird cake which we split I hadnt had cake since  Gibson also exercises daily Spinning is my favorite I like to do two minute spin classes backtoback Gibson said He also runs at least  miles in the evening and does crunches and pushups before bed Gibson stays focused with the help of a coach Ryan Blanck CEO of offtrackonpurposecom Blanck lives in North Carolina so all their sessions are virtual Gibson finds their sessions particularly effective He gives me positive encouragement and tough love I remember one time he said Your motivation isnt where it once was Thats all I needed to hear When I went to the gym that day I told my wife drop me off further away  I need the walk This healthy living has paid off  In addition to the weight loss Gibson no longer needs high blood pressure medicine He says hes got energy for days  He also loves to motivate others and talks about his weight loss at church and helps friends This weight loss has transformed my life Gibson said Its totally possible You just have to hold yourself accountable
