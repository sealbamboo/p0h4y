Smoking has its risks but in California higher prices for health insurance probably wont be among them The federal health law allows states to charge smokers up to  percent more for a health plan but a bill moving forward in the California Legislature would prevent that from happening The Affordable Care Act is supposed to remove discrimination in the pricing of health insurance for things like gender and medical condition Critics say a tobacco surcharge creates a new category of discrimination against smokers Furthermore a surcharge for smokers would mean they wouldnt get the benefit of the subsidy thats supposed to make buying insurance through the marketplaces in  more affordable says Karen Pollitz of the Kaiser Family Foundation For a lowincome person a  subsidy makes affordable a policy otherwise costing  A tobacco surcharge would push it back up to  she says If the state opted for the maximum surcharge health insurance would become unaffordable for those with the lowest incomes according to   president of the Institute for Health Policy Solutions in Washington And he points out its that group thats most likely to smoke For somebody who is totally hooked after many years and older  and those kinds of people are more expensive and often do need more medical care they have two bad choices go without health insurance and be impoverished that way or get health insurance and be impoverished The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says tobacco use   the nation about  billion in medical care and lost productivity each year And thats exactly why Micah Weinberg a health policy analyst with the   in the San Francisco region thinks higher rates for smokers make sense If were ultimately interested in bringing down the price of health care for everybody including lowincome folks then we need to make sure we get a handle on unhealthy behaviors such as smoking he says Weinberg says higher insurance premiums for tobacco users  as long as theyre not too high  provide the type of financial penalties that studies say cause people to quit smoking By contrast he says banning higher rates because smoking disproportionately affects the poor reflects paternalistic policymaking that does nothing to fix the problem I think we have to be very careful what types of favors were doing for people Because if the end result of this policy is greater numbers of smokers then thats not actually helping the populations that were trying to help he says But California Democratic Assemblyman   disagrees Hes a Sacramento pediatrician who wrote the legislation Pan believes rate increases of any amount on smokers premiums may dissuade some from buying health insurance altogether We want smokers to actually have health care coverage he says And through having health care coverage they will have access to smoking cessation treatment as well as of course health care for not only smokingrelated but even their nonsmokingrelated illness And for many in California at least that seems to make sense Pans proposed law has so far encountered no formal opposition from antismoking groups cigarette companies insurance companies or the American Lung Association Its essential to provide tobacco users with affordable health insurance  rather than to make them pay more for it  because its so hard to quit smoking officials at the ALAs California branch said in a written statement If the measure passes California would join Massachusetts Vermont Rhode Island and the District of Columbia in making sure smokers arent charged more under the federal law
