By some estimates we Americans throw away about   from the cabbage thats wilting in our refrigerators to the fruit thats falling off the orange tree in our neighbors backyard In Californias Central Valley one woman has started a grassroots effort to feed hungry people by rescuing some of that produce At first glance Sarah Ramirezs decision to leave a bright future as an epidemiologist with a doctorate from Stanford University to become a fruit picker might seem downright crazy To understand her motivations you first need to know a little about the economics of Californias Central Valley where Ramirez grew up the daughter of farmworkers Many farms in the Central Valley supply fruits and vegetables for major supermarket chains across the country Farmer Peter Mesias says those stores demand perfect produce to meet consumers expectations I visited   this summer He walked me through a squash field dense with prickly leaves picked a zucchini and showed it to me Right off the bat you can see theres a nick theres a little bit of a crook he said That couldnt be packed in a box So that means supermarkets wont buy it They prefer smaller tender squash This year Mesias ended up with acres of excess squash and he hoped the local food bank would come take some of the imperfect fruit before he plowed it under Food bank director Sandy Beals says its not uncommon for food banks to hear from farmers like Mesias And if we can pick it we can have it I mean how tempting is that Beals says But Beals says she cant easily send her staff to pick excess crops The liability is too high Somebody falls off a ladder and gets hurt One incident like that could very easily put us belly up she says And thats too bad The   that Beals helps run in Tulare County Calif serves  out of every  county residents many of them farmworkers She says shes desperate for donations  she sometimes has to beg for an extension on the food banks electricity bill so that she can keep the freezers running And thats where Sarah Ramirez comes in Ramirez has made it her mission to rescue produce from commercial fields and peoples backyards And as an individual she can sign a liability waiver saying she wont sue if she gets hurt picking crops Ramirez grew up in Pixley Calif a rural town that John Steinbeck described in   She went on to earn a PhD at Stanford and become Tulare Countys epidemiologist where she noticed some troubling trends high rates of diabetes and obesity paired with widespread food insecurity Ramirez says she noticed that a lot fruit in the region went unharvested And yet at the same time we have hunger and food insecurity she says And it seems like we should be able to put a need with a surplus Lets put the pieces together Ramirez recently moved back to Pixley to start a grassroots effort called   a shoestring operation she and her husband fund themselves and operate out of their home in a trailer park If I think about the overwhelming nature of the problem its so much easier not to do anything And theres a lot of people who say the problem is so big nothing we can ever do will fix it Ramirez says Well if we all took that position nothing would ever get done Ramirez says she wanted to take action So she decided to give up the prestige of a highpowered career to return to her roots to the kind of work that her parents who labored in the fields tried to make sure shed never have to do One of our team members says I should be wearing a Tshirt that says I have a PhD and I pick fruit  Ramirez says Food bank director Sandy Beals says Ramirezs work is making a big difference There is extreme unemployment very high poverty and not a lot of hope that things will get better Beals says And Ramirezs goal is to give people hope And hope is the most important thing people can have This year Ramirez and her tiny band of volunteers have gleaned  pounds of produce from farms and backyards And Be Healthy Tulare is doing more than just picking fruit On weekends Ramirez ties a colorful bandana on her head and gets out her sharp knives to hold food labs  nutrition classes to teach people how to incorporate more produce into their diets They whip up delicacies like peachcucumber gazpacho in the community kitchen of the Pixley trailer park Theyve also started a community garden to grow their own produce and its equipped with an outdoor propane stove Thats where Maria Arevalo is sauteing some eggplant she just harvested She worked in the fields for some  years before recently retiring Vegetables used to look kind of tempting to me she explains in Spanish standing over an outdoor propane stove but I didnt know how to cook them My mother never cooked them People here cant afford them Theyre a luxury But now Arevalo is eating fruit and vegetables grown in the organic garden And its paying off She says her blood pressure is now under control And her community is getting healthier too
