Doctors are still widely prescribing codeine for kids with coughs colds and injuries despite robust evidence that the ancient narcotic doesnt work for many children  and may be fatal to some Experts say that parents and health care professionals need to rethink their reliance on the popular opiate  and even consider retiring the drug linked to at least  deaths and three overdoses in recent years in kids from toddlers to age  There are good reasons why we should encourage all pediatric clinicians to give up their codeineprescribing habit said Dr Alan D Woolf a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School who wrote an editorial accompanying startling new research about codeine in the latest issue of the journal Pediatrics In the decade from  to  US emergency room prescriptions for codeine ranged from nearly  to nearly  a year researchers found Ultimately we found an incredible number of prescriptions still occurring said Dr Sunitha V Kaiser an assistant clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of California San Francisco who led the analysis Of the  million emergency room visits during that time the proportion that wound up with codeine prescriptions fell from  percent to  percent While the decline was encouraging the fact that the figure stayed so high is startling Kaiser said Doctors have long known that codeine is unreliable and dangerous because its effectiveness is dependent on genes that govern metabolism Codeine is a socalled prodrug that must be converted by the liver into morphine to work About a third of people including children have genes that make them poor metabolizers which means the drug doesnt relieve symptoms like cough and pain More concerning are the  percent of people who are ultrarapid metabolizers which means their bodies convert more than five to  times more of the drug than normal possibly leading to fatal overdoses That adds up to  children in the US each year who could be exposed to a drug that doesnt work and another  a year who could risk overdose or death Kaiser found The American Academy of Pediatrics began warning about codeine in  and again in  In  and  the federal Food and Drug Administration issued a blackbox alert warning against using codeine in kids after surgery to correct sleep apnea because three children died and one suffered lifethreatening respiratory arrest Since   kids have died and three have overdosed on codeine the FDA said In addition the World Health Organization has ditched the drug from its recommended painkillers for kids and health agencies in Europe and Canada restricted codeine use to people older than  Its not clear why doctors continue to prescribe codeine for children said Dr Joseph Tobias chair of the AAPs committee on Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine Part of it may be pure habit among doctors who were taught that codeine was a mild and effective opiate in kids If you look at how we were training people  years ago it was codeine codeine codeine Tobias said Now however theres no shortage of studies that show that even in normal metabolizers the drug doesnt effectively stop coughs or ease pain and that there are good substitutes available For coughs and colds the AAP recommends honey Kaiser said For injuries ibuprofen is better and safer Better education and training is key said Woolf who acknowledged that habits are hard to break and some doctors will howl with dismay at taking codeine away But Boston Childrens Hospital no longer includes any codeine medications in its formulary Woolf said adding that others should follow suit Until doctors get updated parents should be wary of codeine too the experts said If a doctor prescribes the drug ask if theres another alternative Kaiser said If a child who was given codeine is hard to awaken or is breathing slowly or snoring or gurgling get immediate help Tobias added People think that codeines safer than morphine and its really not he said
