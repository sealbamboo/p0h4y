Have you noticed perhaps that some of your storebought salad dressings or spaghetti sauces taste a little less salty lately Probably not The companies that make those products are doing their best to keep you from noticing Yet many of them are in fact carrying out a giant saltreduction experiment either because they want to improve their customers health or because theyre worried that if they dont the government might impose regulations that would compel more onerous   Todd Abraham senior vice president for research and nutrition at   says the company is committed to reducing the amount of salt in its crackers and cookies Mondelez recently spun off from Kraft Foods makes some of the countrys bestknown crackers and cookies including Ritz crackers Triscuits and Oreos Sodium reduction is important to us because its important to our consumers he says Yet sodium reduction does not appear to be the most important thing to those consumers It seems less important for instance than familiar taste Take Ritz crackers Abraham has a couple of boxes of them on the table right beside him One is the original standard version the other is labeled Hint of Salt a lowsodium choice The Hint of Salt crackers have only a third as much salt as the originals Thats the good news The bad news is they   nearly as well In fact a label that says low salt actually seems to turn consumers away What weve found with consumers  if you say something is low salt theyll immediately think it doesnt taste as good as the fullsalt version says Abraham So Mondelez is trying a different strategy Over the past five to seven years the company has been cutting salt from some of its topselling products but quietly without telling anyone For instance that box of original Ritz crackers Its reduced by probably  to  percent from where it was when we first introduced it to the market Abraham says Many other big food companies are taking similar measures Its a complicated job because salt is everywhere and its not just there for taste Salt keeps some foods safe because it kills bacteria It helps bread turn brown while baking and gives lunch meat   But the biggest obstacle to cutting out salt remains the fear that consumers wont like the change in taste and will switch to other products So companies are turning to a bag of magic tricks that make the salt sensors on our tongues think food is just as salty even when theres less salt in it Like any magician Abraham is a little cagey about the details We have some learnings and some knowledge that I cant talk much about How you apply salt at what particle size where on the cracker surface he says For instance you can get by with less salt if you put it on the   of a cracker instead of buried in the dough Tiny salt crystals or even   deliver more taste per gram of sodium than big crystals Also its possible to replace some salt with potassium chloride the one substance that tastes a little bit similar Potassium is actually good for you Abraham says so its a good alternative but if you put too much potassium in the product its going to start to taste very bitter Another trick Sometimes if you add more herbs and spices consumers cant taste that theres less salt  the North America director of nutrition and health for Unilever  which makes Ragu pasta sauce WishBone salad dressings and lots of soups  says companies may be able to take advantage of something else that scientists have learned Basically our sensitivity to salt seems to adapt when we eat less of it for a couple of months the same way our eyes adjust when we step into a dimly lit room You should be able to gradually reduce salt levels in the product over the course of time in small steps and when you gradually do that consumers gradually get used to the taste of those products with less salt he says But Balentine recalls one case in which his company tried to cut too much too quickly The product was a   that it sells in Europe I think it was a  percent reduction in salt that wed gotten to We thought it was going to be OK but then over the course of six months you saw sales drop significantly he says Sales of this product had been going up before the recipe was changed So we said Oops we have to stop now or maybe go up a little bit to a place where consumers say its acceptable  Balentine thinks that Unilever probably has gone as far as it can for now Were going to have to wait a little bit for the consumer to adapt and get used to the new products he says Eventually though Unilever wants to   reducing salt in its products to a level at which a consumer eating a normal diet would meet salt     grams per day  set by the World Health Organization Balentine doesnt think it will be possible to meet that goal just through consumers adapting to the taste of less salt He thinks the food industry will need some new tools such as novel food additives that will boost the impact on our tongues salt sensors of each salt molecule Those new tools which remain in the dreams of food scientists would deliver more salt taste with less sodium
