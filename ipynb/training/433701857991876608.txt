Tom Brokaws revelation that he has been   for months brings new attention to his diagnosis multiple myeloma While   they have discovered very effective treatments for the cancer that affects blood cells in the bone marrow A decade ago I would have been happy if half my patients responded to treatment  and for just a few years said Dr Edward Stadtmauer chief of hematologic malignancies at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania Now we expect treatments to have a  percent response rate Patients can go decades with the disease doing fine but still having it Multiple myeloma is the second most common cancer of the bone marrow after lymphoma striking about  Americans each year Stadtmauer said For perspective about  women get breast cancer annually No one knows yet why some people develop the disease Its probably a combination of heredity environment and luck Stadtmauer said What is known is that the disease strikes mostly seniors with an average age of  at diagnosis Patients often show up in the doctors office with unexplained bone pain fatigue or immune problems that can be traced to the malfunction of a certain type of white blood cell found in the bone marrow known as plasma cells Normally these cells make the antibodies that fight infections But sometimes plasma cells can go haywire and rapidly proliferate crowding out red blood cells and other types of white blood cells Patients become anemic and the immune system becomes depressed leaving people more vulnerable to bacteria and viruses Making matters worse the abnormal plasma cells send out the wrong signals to various parts of the body including the bones The result Stadtmauer said is holes in the bone The bones become crumbly and fractures can result Thats why most people seek attention They felt pain in their bones Medications can keep people in remission Just like high blood pressure and diabetes people can live it for a long period of time Stadtmauer said
