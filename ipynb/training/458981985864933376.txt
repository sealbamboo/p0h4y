The sushi was delicious as far as Luther Smith remembers It was only later after he developed hepatitis A spread by an infected food handler that the Harlem NY man was left with far more than a bad taste in his mouth I was shivering I was achy I felt like something was wrong but I didnt know what recalls Smith  one of four people who contracted the dangerous liver disease last year at the nowdefunct New Hawaii Sea restaurant in the Bronx Then my wife looked at me and said The whites of your eyes are becoming yellow Smith like most American diners didnt know that the hepatitis A virus is highly contagious and spread when people use the toilet and then fail to properly wash their hands And he didnt know that in most places across the US theres no requirement that kitchen workers receive the vaccination that can prevent infection in the first place I couldnt believe it said Smith whose wife and motherinlaw also contracted the virus If you work in a kitchen and you have exposure to food and youre handling raw food it makes sense that you know youre going to get your people vaccinated The question of whether hepatitis A inoculations should be mandatory for food workers  or whether the cost to business isnt worth the wider benefit  is gaining renewed attention from federal regulators health officials and ordinary consumers amid a spate of new restaurant warnings Just this month nearly  people who went out for Italian food at  in Nyack NY and a  in Charlotte NC wound up getting immunoglobulin shots to prevent hepatitis A after food handlers tested positive There was another scare in  in February when patrons of Hudsons Seafood House on the Docks warned patrons theyd been exposed by an employee In that case nearly  people got shots health officials said In the New Hawaii Sea outbreak more than  people received jabs health officials said As many as  people a year are sickened by hepatitis A according to  estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and about  people die Thats only a fraction of the  million people in the US who are sickened by food poisoning each year but hepatitis A is the only foodborne bug for which an effective vaccine actually exists The hepatitis A virus causes acute liver infection that can trigger lingering illness and even liver failure or death though thats rare Its spread when a person ingests fecal material from an infected person and causes symptoms that include fever chills nausea darkcolored urine and jaundice a yellowing of the skin or eyes For years CDC officials have said that food handlers didnt need hepatitis A vaccinations because outbreaks are rare and food workers arent at increased risk of infection because of their jobs They pointed to plummeting rates of hepatitis A infections since the introduction in  of a safe and effective vaccine But that could change said Dr Trudy Murphy a medical epidemiologist in the agencys viral hepatitis division Hepatitis A used to be more common among children in the US and not adults because they were exposed as kids In  experts began recommending universal hepatitis A vaccines for kids starting at age  changing the pool of potential infections There was a very rapid transition in the US over the last half decade Murphy said We have this gap of adults who are not protected in their s s s and s In other words the people most vulnerable to hepatitis A are those most likely to work  and eat  in restaurants In  CDC data showed that about  percent of adults in the US who got hepatitis A were food handlers indicating that thousands of food handlers have hepatitis A each year officials wrote On average about  restaurants a year reported exposures But those may have increased Murphy said I think we need to collect some additional information to see whether that would be something we need to look at she said Its about time said Bill Marler a Seattle food safety lawyer who has lobbied for mandatory vaccination for food handlers since a hepatitis A outbreak tied to two Subway sandwich shops sickened  people in  It was a horrible outbreak We represented a bunch of people including a little boy who lost his liver at  years old and required a transplant he said But restaurant industry officials  and some health officials  note that such outbreaks and consequences though regrettable are rare Hepatitis A is a serious disease and we take it very seriously said Catherine Adams Hutt a food safety expert and consultant to the National Restaurant Association Were not chasing a pandemic were not chasing an epidemic What is the appropriate reaction For most businesses today the reaction is reactive Mandating vaccination for food handlers would be difficult said Adams Hutt has worked for leading firms including McDonalds Corp the Campbell Soup Company and HJ Heinz Two doses of vaccine are required months apart for full immunity There are personal privacy issues to consider and theres the cost which could amount to  to  per worker she said In addition there are strict regulations that already govern food safety operations and reporting of infectious disease The controls are in place she said We need to make sure that they are religiously in practice That makes sense even to William Pilkington the public health officer in Cabarrus County NC where residents were last week warned about the infected Papa Johns He figures taxpayers in two counties will foot a bill totaling more than  for the recent round of about  shots to protect against hepatitis A but Pilkington said it would be even more expensive to vaccinate in the long run Ive been the public health director here for  years and weve had two of these he said There are places in the US however where health officials have decided that the cost of vaccination is worth the benefit The city of St Louis requires food handlers to be vaccinated So does St Louis County Mo where three large hepatitis A outbreaks tied to food handlers in the midtolate s strained local resources County officials passed an ordinance requiring all restaurant workers to be vaccinated Since then the number of cases dropped from  a year to virtually none said Dr Dolores Gunn the county health director We still have our traditional E coli foodborne illness like everybody else but not hep A she said The cost savings go beyond the price of the shots she said There is a huge economic cost hospital cost reputation cost lost employee time she said Its not just a cost savings in terms of medical or life or healthiness but an economic cost savings in your community That makes sense to Luther Smith a government lobbyist who took weeks to fully recover His two children needed hepatitis A shots the family had to notify the kids school and day care and his wife and motherinlaw still fell seriously ill all in the middle of the holiday season Whatever the cost to businesses it cant compare to the fallout from even a single infection he said Cmon New Hawaii Sea was a very large restaurant I cant believe that whatever theyre going to pay via their insurance and their reputation I cant imagine that thats cheaper
