Not long ago we heard about a catchy   for a cookbook Fartfree food for everybody In theory these recipes would be helpful for some people  and those in their vicinity But being a bit gassy may actually be a small price to pay for a lot of benefits to our health We know that air often comes after eating nutrientpacked vegetables such as cabbage kale and broccoli And researchers have found that fiberrich foods like beans and lentils boost the levels of beneficial gut bacteria after only a few days as we   in December So all this got us wondering Could passing gas in some instances be a sign that our gut microbes are busy keeping us healthy Absolutely says   a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn Eating foods that cause gas is the only way for the microbes in the gut to get nutrients he says If we didnt feed them carbohydrates it would be harder for them to live in our gut And we need to keep these colondwelling critters content Kashyap says When they gobble up food  and create gas  they also make molecules that boost the immune system protect the lining of the intestine and prevent infections A healthy individual can have up to  flatulences per day and be perfectly normal he adds Gas gets into the digestive tract primarily through   Swallowing air which we all do when we eat and chew gum and your microbiome Thats the collection of organisms in the GI tract that scientists and doctors are currently all fired up about Check our colleague Rob Steins recent   on it That microbiome includes hundreds of different bacteria But there are also organisms from another kingdom shacking up with them the   All these microbes are gasmaking fools They eat up unused food in your large intestine like fiber and other carbohydrates we dont digest and churn out a bunch of gases as waste But thats not all they make They also produce a slew of molecules called short chain fatty acids that may promote the growth of other beneficial bacteria and archaea And the more fiber you feed these friendly inhabitants the more types of species appear studies have found This bump in microbial diversity has been linked to a   Undigested carbohydrates allow the whole ecosystem to thrive and flourish Kashyap says Most gas made by the microbiome is odorless Its simply carbon dioxide hydrogen or methane But sometimes a little sulfur slips in there Thats when it gets smelly Kashyap says But heres the hitch Many of the smelly sulfur compounds in vegetables have healthful properties Take for instance the broccoli mustard and cabbage family These   vegetables are packed with a sulfur compound called sulforaphane that is strongly associated with a reduced risk of cancer Another possible benefit of a little smelly gas It may reduce the total volume of air in the gut Kashyap says Why Because bacteria and archaea make the sulfur gas from other gases in the gut like hydrogen Bacteria that make sulfide gas are really important Kashyap says They can cause smelliness but they can reduce the total amount of gas flow Of course having too much of anything can be bad If gas and bloating start interfering with your quality of life Kashayps recommends seeing a doctor But dont immediately blame your diet Kashyap says In many cases people who complain about too much gas actually dont generate more than others he says Instead they perceive the passing more intensely Or they pass it   Yes a more fiberrich diet will produce more gas Kashyap adds But completely eliminating fiber from the diet should not be the first option You dont want to starve your microbes So go ahead Enjoy those lentils Chow down on the cabbage Then if you stink a little think of it as a thank you gesture from your microbiome
