I work one day a week as a hepatitis nurse specialist I didnt start my nursing career until I was  because there wasnt a training college in the Bahamas where I lived I have spent  years at Mount Vernon hospital but reduced my hours to look after my husband who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease I still felt I had something to offer after he passed away and put the word out to colleagues Someone mentioned hepatitis and I thought why not I am on the road every Wednesday by am after a bowl of porridge It is a lovely drive down through the Chilterns listening to Heart radio and I still enjoy my job five and a half years later The autonomy of the job is great My consultant sends me patients diagnosed with hepatitis C and my job is to cure them Were a good team and being a senior nurse practitioner gives me the confidence to make my own decisions We discuss various cases after Ive picked up my post and collected patients prescriptions and medical files Hillingdon is a typical London borough and we estimate around  people go about their daily lives without realising they are carrying the virus   usually comes to light when a general blood test reveals an anomaly Treatment can last up to  weeks depending on which of the six strains a patient has It is a long tough treatment that includes selfadministered injections daily tablets and a number of uncomfortable sideeffects These include a weakened immune system mood swings sleeplessness and a low iron supply which leaves patients feeling tired and lethargic Hepatitis C is a blood borne virus you can pick up from unsterilised medical equipment unscreened blood transfusions in developing countries and shared items such as razors Intravenous drug users are infected via shared needles cooking spoons and filters It can survive in minute traces of blood for weeks unlike HIV which dies almost immediately outside its host I usually give my mobile number to patients and tell them to ring if they have a problem much to the horror of my colleagues Im semiretired now so dont mind if people call Some ring because of the sideeffects of the medication others because they need reassurance or a friendly voice There are some groundbreaking medicines coming on to the market in the next year or two but they dont come cheap A single course of treatment can be tens of thousands of pounds but whats that compared to a liver transplant and the associated costs I usually finish seeing patients at around pm and then have a stack of paperwork to work through including writing out prescriptions for the following week Sometimes I dont leave work until pm I want to keep working until I am  which must make me a strong candidate for being last into the nursing profession and last out My daughters are both registered nurses and I love being a grandparent although I could do without the ageing bit My guilty pleasure is the American show Judge Judy where a reallife judge sorts out peoples domestic disputes Shes great She sees things as they are cuts to the chase and offers a practical solution Maybe we should invite her to join the
