The old man lashed out the first night he spent in the nursing home His behavior was so alarming that staff transferred him to a nearby hospital for evaluation  There the gentleman  was put in restraints and sedated He stopped walking talking He didnt seem to recognize anybody recalled Dr Michael Rothberg vice chair for research in the Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic   Dr Rothberg stopped to collect himself as he spoke about this dementia patient his fatherinlaw  After another difficult hospitalization this time for pneumonia the family decided they didnt want this vulnerable distressed relative transferred from the nursing home again if he took ill   They asked that a do not hospitalize order be communicated to staff and placed in his medical record Several months later the patient stopped eating and drinking and passed away Now Dr Rothberg and colleagues in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts have written a new paper on   It is a small study of  health care proxies for patients with advanced dementia  largely their adult children and some nieces and nephews 
 The key findings  Often proxies are confused about how do not hospitalize orders work Several proxies believed mistakenly that a such an order was equivalent to a request to withhold medical intervention altogether   Proxies who understood what happens to people with advanced dementia  after being transferred from a nursing home to a hospital more than half die within the next  months  were more likely to adopt this kind of directive Dr Rothberg found   And a physicians willingness to recommend it makes a difference People told us Yes someone mentioned this but we werent sure what it all meant said Dr Sarah Goff an associate professor at Tufts University School of Medicine and a coauthor of the article  Under federal law patients must be told of their right to complete advance directives  including a do not hospitalize order  upon admission to a nursing home Generally do not hospitalize orders are considered an option for frail seniors with serious illnesses including advanced dementia who often encounter multiple setbacks in a hospital while receiving uncertain benefits explained Dr Alex Smith a geriatrician at the University of California San Francisco Setbacks can include delirium loss of mobility poor nutrition disrupted sleep and pain  There are two types of do not hospitalize directives  The first is an absolute prohibition against sending someone to the hospital under any circumstances  Some older patients or their families say I just dont want to go through that again  Ive been there done that and its just not worth it any longer Dr Goff said It is important that physicians write these directives in such a way that they have the force of a medical order  Dr Smith noted  The second is a general recommendation to avoid the hospital  with stipulations You may say that in general the patient wants to avoid the hospital but each specific situation needs to be evaluated with the patient if they have capacity or if not with their health care proxy Dr Smith said    Alternately the patient may specify certain situations in which a hospitalization may be allowed and exclude all others If an older woman with advanced dementia falls and breaks a bone for example her do not hospitalize directive may say that she wants to have bone fractures treated in the hospital Or if an elderly man with bladder cancer has a urinary catheter that becomes blocked that patients directive may say he wants to return to the hospital to get a new catheter inserted Families often think a do not hospitalize means do not treat but that is not accurate   What it means is Well do the best we can for you here in the nursing home and if nature takes its course then thats all right said Dr John Culberson an assistant professor of medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who has studied these directives How often do older patients with latestage dementia or their surrogates embrace this alternative  In  Dr Susan Mitchell of Harvard Medical School examined a national database of more than  nursing home residents of this kind and found that    In a separate  report Dr Mitchell determined that most hospital admissions of nursing home patients with latestage dementia    Suspected infections mostly respiratory are the No  reason for admissions and evidence indicates that these can be treated as effectively in nursing home as in acute care settings Given that comfort care is the professed goal for  percent of patients with latestage dementia there are very rare circumstances in which a hospitalization would promote that goal Dr Mitchell said  Unfortunately most caregivers dont realize this and learn it only through hard experience
