Good morning, everyone, and how are you today? Clouds are, unfortunately, hovering over the Pharmalot campus, but our spirits remain sunny. After all, the clouds will pass, you know? So we are celebrating this eventuality with another steaming hot cup of stimulation – we are back to Southern Pecan, for those keeping track – and invite you to join us. As always, there is much to do. So let’s dive into the growing to-do list now and get started. Have a smashing day and drop us a note if you hear something interesting…. Meanwhile, the Ebola drug given to two Americans and a Spanish priest has been sent to treat infected doctors in two West African countries, and Mapp Biopharmaceuticals says its supply of the medicine is now gone; ValueAct Capital, which is a top shareholder in Valeant Pharmaceuticals, supports an independent business plan for the drug maker and does not believe there is a need to buy Allergan; and Illinois regulators indefinitely suspended the medical license of a psychiatrist who prescribed more of the most powerful and riskiest antipsychotic than any other doctor in the country.
