Parents who think their children dont pay attention can take heart Theyre doing their best to emulate your bad TVwatching habits Parents have been told repeatedly that setting rules and banning TVs in childrens bedrooms will help limit TV time But those muchresearched and ofttouted methods dont seem to matter at all according to a survey The only thing that really mattered was parental screen time The more parents watched the more their children watched If the parents watch TV in their free time the kids are being socialized to watch TV in their free time says Amy Bleakley a senior research scientist at the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania who led the study That was true whether the parents   or not It was also true whether or not children had TVs in their rooms And it was true whether or not the family watched TV together or hunkered down alone in their bedrooms Every hour of parental TVwatching led to another  minutes of TV watching by offspring The American Academy of Pediatrics says that childrens screen time for all media should be   so that children have time for playing sports and yes human interaction Having TVs in kids bedrooms probably does contribute to excess TV watching Bleakley says Im not saying you dont have to worry about that she tells Shots You have to get the TV out of the bedroom But maybe youll get better changes if you look at your own behavior Rules limiting TV time did have some effect but only among  to yearolds Maybe theyre in that sweet spot where theyre old enough to understand rules but still young enough to pay attention to Mom and Dad The  parents who were polled said they watched TV four hours a day on average They reported that their children were watching about three hours a day But in households with teenagers those kids were also polled and they said they were averaging four hours a day about one hour a day more than what Mom and Dad reported The   was published in the journal   The researchers took account of families that leave the TV on all day in the background so you dont have that as an out Earlier studies have shown that   for very young children with infants and toddlers exposed to almost six hours a day The pediatricians say children under age  should watch no TV at all The researchers also asked about use of computers video games and other home media Stay tuned on whether our children are imitating our annoying smartphone habits
