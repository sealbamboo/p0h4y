Its been a tough winter in AE departments across the UK More patients have come through the door many of them elderly and very ill But problems in discharging them home mean pressure has built up across the system resulting in long delays for some patients in AE So what solutions have hospitals found to help ease the demands on AE  One idea has been to treat more people at home freeing up hospital beds Denise Vernon suffers from a long term lung condition and is undergoing a course of powerful antibiotics Normally that would mean a twoweek stay in hospital but now   twice a day  Denise is visited at her home in Manchester She says For me it is a winwin because you get very dedicated treatment for two hours in the day But I have all the benefits of being able to relax and be at home For Denise a university lecturer it means she can still carry on doing some work which would be impossible if she was in hospital This particular project  delivering intravenous drugs at home  is run by the Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust So far nurses have treated around  patients over  months They believe they have saved a staggering  bed days But what happens when patients arrive at AE but could just as easily be seen by a GP  North Manchester General has one of the busiest units in the country treating around  patients a year But it is estimated that at least  of patients could have been treated elsewhere perhaps by a pharmacist or a GP So since August of last year family doctors like Dr Ged Garbutt have been working along side emergency specialists at North Manchester to filter out less urgent cases He says it works well because of it connects primary and secondary care All of the GPs working here actually work in the local practice Essentially it is our patients who we are treating here in secondary care so we understand them we understand their needs At Newcastles Royal Victoria Infirmary RVI improved coordination of care is helping older patients such as yearold Christine Laidlaw She has already been in hospital for a couple of days after developing a chest infection and she is now ready to go home Christine says You are desperate to get in to hospital because you are ill But then you are desperate to get out when you feel a bit better and they start to help you with physio and all different things Some hospitals have struggled to discharge patients particularly older people because of problems coordinating community care  Delayed discharges  also known as the less flattering bed blocking  feed back into AEs causing delays for patients waiting to be admitted  But helping patients to go home when they are ready is not just about freeing up beds and easing pressure on busy AE departments  Older people stand a much better chance of making a good recovery if they are back in their own home So at the RVI a team of medical staff and social workers is coordinating community care to make sure there are no delays in discharging older patients from hospital Dr Steve Parry is an consultant geriatrician   a specialist in the care of older patients  and clinical director at the RVI  He says We proactively roam the hospital trying to find older people who are medically pretty good readyish for discharge or in the early stages of planning We make sure that they safely get to a discharge long before several weeks in hospital have taken place The Newcastle team are helped by the fact the hospital also runs community care services but not every hospital trust is in the same position These solutions save money are better for patients and help hardpressed AEs  The challenge will be to spread them across a health service that is still struggling with winter pressures
