Try this on for size The Affordable Care Act is good for young adults because itll save them money on health care leaving them more to spend on liquor and birth control Thats one way to interpret the message from a provocative new ad campaign in Colorado Not everyone is thrilled with it During a federal   Colorado Republican Rep   showed Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius   Gardner asked Do you agree with this kind of advertising for Obamacare Sebelius responded that she couldnt see it Its a college student doing a keg stand Gardner replied Thats a pretty big picture of a keg Alcohol features prominently in several ads in the campaign that upset Gardner They all   to learn more about the federal health care law But theyre not from the White House or any agency Sebelius controls Two nonprofit groups in Denver put them together   and the one Adam Fox works for   Fox  says the group had only about  to spend and wanted to grab some eyeballs on social media We wanted to make sure that we at least got a few seconds of their recognition he says Mission accomplished Within a few days of posting the ads on Facebook and Twitter they made the leap from social media to the news media Weve seen a huge response positive and negative Fox says Some people arent big fans of the ads but some are and weve seen just a huge amount of website traffic and a lot of social media shares of the images themselves The ads dangle alcohol and sex in front of young people to bait them into   to the decidedly unsexy topic of health insurance Theres the keg stand ad one with a woman in yoga clothes   and another showing young ladies drinking   This is after all Colorado Perhaps   though is the ad featuring a young woman with a man on her arm and a package of birth control pills in her hand with the copy OMG hes hot Lets hope hes as easy to get as this birth control My health insurance covers the pill which means all I have to worry about is getting him between the covers I got insurance Fox says women were involved in coming up with the ads but he knows theyre not for everybody Conservatives and liberals both have called some of the ads sexist Fox disagrees Women are strong independent human beings capable of making their own decisions he says And birth control is just an important aspect of basic health care Laura Welp is a yearold parttime student in Denver She says shes got her own reasons to want to learn more about Obamacare and that an ad with a hot guy in it isnt really a motivator It doesnt appeal to me she says The interest for me in Obamacare is that I think I can get cheaper insurance and I think its going to get more people insurance she says But Rachel Cain whos also  likes them I was describing my reaction to them to somebody else on Facebook who thought that they were terrible she says I think theyre hilarious and right to the point Theyre perfect for the audience Ive done a keg stand And Ive also done ski shots If the health law is going to work people like Welp and Cain will have to sign up for coverage Lots of   enrolling in new coverage would balance out the people who will have higher health costs Fox who launched the ads aimed at young people says theyre disproportionately uninsured now and that they need to know more about affordable options the law offers them Hes unapologetic if some are offended Weve started a huge conversation about a lot of the different reasons to have health insurance he says Fox says to expect ads aimed at young families soon
