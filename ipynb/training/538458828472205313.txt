This popular route north of Burbank more of a hike than a walk is a steady climb into the Verdugo Mountains punctuated by shortcuts up steep inclines Theres very little shade here so climb early in the day or on a cool day and take plenty of water Also bring sturdy shoes with good soles  and strong legs  Begin from a parking lot on La Tuna Canyon Road just south of its exit off the  Freeway Walk up a slight incline on an old paved road South La Tuna Canyon Road  After about a third of a mile turn right and walk toward a sign reading Hostetter This is officially Hostetter Fire Road  In less than half a mile on the fire road theres a shortcut a trail to the left thats a very difficult  mile climb up a slippery rocky slope If you decide to take it take it slow Otherwise bear right and stay on the main dirt road  The climb is gentler this way as the fire road hugs the hillside and does switchbacks along ravines filled with sycamore and oak Tuna means prickly pear cactus fruit in Spanish but there is not actually a lot of cactus here  After about  miles by a metal water tank youll find the top of the shortcut trail There are people who take the steep way down This is not recommended Instead take in some scenery The great San Gabriel Mountains rise before you with Mt Lukens straight ahead and Mt Wilson over to the right In the foreground are the communities of Tujunga La Crescenta and Montrose with Glendale and La Caada over to the right  The Hostetter Fire Road continues for some distance If you walk about  minutes farther to a Tintersection under a tall radio tower you can see Glendale downtown LA and on a clear day the ocean Explore in that direction or return to the parking area the way you came
