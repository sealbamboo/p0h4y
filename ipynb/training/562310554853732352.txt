Recent reports have shown many hospital accident and emergency AE departments are in crisis after facing unprecedented demand Panorama spent seven days in AE at the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton last year and it was busy but meeting its targets  In January we returned to try to find out whats putting AE departments under so much pressure  In Stockton we saw AE staff treating increasing numbers of old people with complex medical needs But we also saw elderly people arriving not because they were ill but because those caring for them could no longer cope Its a lot worse than it was explains Sharon Webb a patient process facilitator in AE Her job is to help move patients through the department as quickly and efficiently as possible Its a lot busier than it was last year everybodys under a lot of strain and sometimes you feel like youre not getting anywhere Alan Foster chief executive at the North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust told us Its not just the winter No its the demand on the health service from a growing elderly population In the small hours of the morning an elderly patient George who is  years old arrives at AE  A young friend of his brings him in because he thinks George cant look after himself He never goes into the shower His clothes stink I try to get him in the shower he just punches us George who hasnt had an accident or an emergency has nonetheless become AEs business Hell almost certainly need the help of social services but for now its the NHS that will care for him Leanne Johnson a staff nurse whos the first to see him says No he doesnt seem to have any medical problems whatsoever and hes going to end up getting admitted into a hospital bed probably And thats just what happens Beds throughout the hospital are at a premium Quite often a hospital bed that could otherwise be free is occupied by a frail and elderly patient who no longer needs hospital care In an acute ward in the hospital is yearold Jane Abrahams She has dementia and she was admitted into hospital from her care home She was well enough to leave hospital before Christmas but in midJanuary shes still here   I want to go home she tells her family But because Mrs Abrahams medical and nursing needs have increased she cant go back to the care home where she lived before   And this is where the hospital can become reliant on the actions of others social services and families themselves Her daughters have been struggling to find a suitable new care home Her daughter Terri Cruikshank says We are really concerned about my mother We desperately want her out of here I feel like theres a big block somewhere between the NHS and then what happens to somebody afterwards Her daughters spend hours on the phone and the internet trying to find a suitable new home for their mother Its unfamiliar and stressful work The family think they should have had more help from social services  But the local authority insists that theyve done everything that was required of them The hospital admits a failure in communication on its part has contributed to the delay in Mrs Abraham being discharged   More than a quarter of the days that patients spend in hospital in England after they are medically fit to leave are down to arranging social care The harder it is to get patients out of hospital the more the traffic jam tails back to an already overstretched AE Yet staff are still meant to meet the same official waiting time target  treating and then admitting or discharging  of their patients within four hours Sharon Webb on the front line in AE says When youre doing everything you can and youre still not hitting your targets it is very frustrating Last year we saw staff working hard to meet the target and they were succeeding  But now week by week just like many other hospitals up and down the country Stocktons failing Some staff sounded quite unapologetic Dr Dave Prosser a registrar in AE says If noone knows how bad the situation is how on earth are we going to get help If the system is broken we want that to be highlighted Alan Foster who runs the NHS trust says they dont like failing to meet the fourhour waiting time targets and if they do its not for want of trying  When a service is under pressure I think that is inevitable but nevertheless we do make sure that we have got the staffing that we need in place to make sure that those patients when they come into hospital are not put at risk he said Stockton is officially recognised as a good hospital   But even this good hospital is labouring under heavy burdens and some of its staff in AE say they cant take much more    Nurse Dave Brereton says Theres times when I feel like halfway through a shift just walking out because the pressure is that much   Meanwhile registrar Dr Dave Prosser is worried about whether they can continue to do their job properly with the the increased pressure His warning is stark We are broken we have reached our capacity theres no more to give  Prof Keith Willetts who is in charge of NHS acute care in England says change is needed and reform has already begun We are trying very hard to make sure that the system is coping and I believe the NHS is currently coping but we have an unsustainable system and it is something that will have to change Because the system demand means that at the moment the model we have to deliver care will increasingly find it difficult to do safe care Watch Panorama Emergency in AE on BBC One on  February at  GMT or later on the BBC iPlayer
