 Archeologists investigating an ancient shipwreck off the coast of Tuscany report they have stumbled upon a rare find a tightly closed tin container with wellpreserved medicine dating back to about  BC A multidisciplinary team analyzed fragments of the greengray tablets to decipher their chemical mineralogical and botanical composition The results offer a peek into the complexity and sophistication of ancient therapeutics The research highlights the continuity from then until now in the use of some substances for the treatment of human diseases said archeologist and lead researcher Gianna Giachi a chemist at the Archeological Heritage of Tuscany in Florence Italy The research also shows the care that was taken in choosing complex mixtures of products  olive oil pine resin starch  in order to get the desired therapeutic effect and to help in the preparation and application of medicine The medicines and other materials were found together in a tight space and are thought to have been originally packed in a chest that seems to have belonged to a physician said Alain Touwaide scientific director of the Institute for the Preservation of Medical Traditions in Washington DC Touwaide is a member of the multidisciplinary team that analyzed the materials The tablets contained an iron oxide as well as starch beeswax pine resin and a mixture of plantandanimalderived lipids or fats Touwaide said botanists on the research team discovered that the tablets also contained carrot radish parsley celery wild onion and cabbage  simple plants that would be found in a garden Giachi said that the composition and shape of the tablets suggest they may have been used to treat the eyes perhaps as an eyewash But Touwaide who compared findings from the analysis to what has been understood from ancient texts about medicine said the metallic component found in the tablets was evidently used not just for eyewashes but also to treat wounds The discovery Touwaide said is evidence of the effectiveness of some natural medicines that have been used for literally thousands of years This information potentially represents essentially several centuries of clinical trials he explained If   is used for centuries and centuries its not because it doesnt work A report on the analysis of the tablets was published in this weeks issue of the   The shipwrecked boat  the    was found in the Gulf of Baratti in  and first explored eight years later The analysis of the tablets was begun about two years ago Giachi said The vessel about  to  feet long was found in an area considered a key eastwest trade route In addition to the pills archeologists found other remnants of early medicine a copper bleeding cup a tin pitcher  boxwood vials and tin containers The tablets were well preserved for the last  years because the cylindrical tin container in which they were stored called a pyxis was hermetically sealed by the natural degradation of the metal Giachi said adding that very few other ancient medicines have been discovered elsewhere In London a granular cream was discovered in a small tin canister It was dated to the second century AD and was probably used as moistening or medicinal cream Giachi said Giachi noted that another   was found at the bottom of a dolium  a large Roman earthenware container  from the first century AD recovered near Pompeii Also in Lyon France cylindrical rods recovered from a second century AD burial site were considered to be eyewashes To analyze the material found in the shipwreck a fragment from the original tablets was studied with light microscopy and a scanning electron microscope Giachi explained DNA sequencing was used to analyze the organic elements Other experts in the field lauded the discovery as a rare find that offered valuable clues to the actual types of materials used in   What we know about ancient medicine is largely contained in manuscripts often corrupt  copied and recopied and fragmentary said Michael Sappol an historian in the history of medicine division of the US National Library of Medicine When the manuscripts refer to plants its not always evident what theyre referring to Theres a lot we dont know Dr Mark Fromer an ophthalmologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City said it makes sense that the medicine that was discovered on the ship was an eye wash to   a common condition even today Its easy to make its saline which has a pH acid balance close to tears he explained Its fascinating to realize that the problems that faced men and women thousands of years ago havent changed
