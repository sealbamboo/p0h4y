The declining teen birth rate is a welldocumented trend in the United States Between  and  the rate dropped steadily at an average of about  a year In the past four years it has dropped even more dramatically at a rate of about  per year  We were really curious as to what was going on said Kearney who has been studying teen pregnancy interventions alongside Levine for more than a decade When the researchers learned that Sarah Brown CEO of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy thought MTVs shows may have something to do with it they thought Could that really be true   and Pregnant premiered in June  and has been on for five seasons with a total of  episodes through October  The show features one teen every episode and follows her through several months during and after pregnancy The documentarystyle show inspired several spinoffs including the popular Teen Mom Both  and Pregnant and Teen Mom have experienced their share of controversy The shows are often criticized for glamorizing teen pregnancy  Instead of really helping viewers understand the daytoday responsibilities of attending to a new infant  scrubbing poop stains or spitup out of clothing  or dwelling on the mundane MTV chooses to focus on the girls volatile relationships with the babies fathers or their new body piercings and tattoos Parents Television Council Director Melissa Henson   That makes for better TV Kearney and Levine looked at Nielsen ratings as well as search data from Google Trends and Twitter to determine the shows potential impact on teen birth rates They recorded spikes in Google searches and Twitter mentions about the show when new episodes aired and looked specifically for searches on terms such as birth control and abortion alongside those spikes  They then analyzed geographic data to see whether locations with higher search activity and tweets about  and Pregnant showed higher levels of searches and tweets about birth control and abortion  They did  The researchers also looked to see whether high viewership in certain areas corresponded with a bigger drop in teen births It did  The results of our analysis indicate that exposure to  and Pregnant was high and that it had an influence on teens thinking regarding birth control and abortion the researchers write Thats all well and scientific but could a TV show really have that big of an impact on teen birth rates Its an extraordinary study done by two very cautious economists said Bill Albert chief program officer at the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy I jokingly refer to them as Drs No because they generally set out to say That doesnt work For that reason alone we take it very seriously  Kearney said that while she and Levine did a lot of fancy economic work to make sure their conclusion was right the most compelling evidence came from the teens social media language The text of the tweets are phenomenal This reminds me to take my birth control Watching   Pregnant going to take my birth control  she remembered reading  Of course no one including the study authors is saying that MTV alone is responsible for the declining teen birth rate  About half of the recent dramatic decline can be attributed to the recession Kearney says Research shows that all birth rates fall during slow economic times including teens those who were once ambivalent about using birth control often become more conscientious when they realize that finding  or keeping  a job to support a baby would be difficult  Kearney believes TV shows like  and Pregnant work to deter teens in a similar way  Shows that make it clear how hard it can be  affect girls who might not care otherwise she said You see shes fighting with her boyfriend on a daily basis Shes gaining weight Her friends are partying without her  Making the immediate cost clear seems to get through to teens more than statistics that show what happens to teen parents when theyre  Kearney says   Teens may turn to TV shows about sex because theyre lacking other options Albert says A recent study published in the medical journal JAMA showed that doctors certainly arent spending a lot of time talking about the important topic The average conversation about sex between doctors and teens in the study lasted less than two minutes  And parents Albert says are often shocked to learn that teens say their parents have a major influence on their decisions about sex  I think the takeaway here is that media can be and often is a force for good Albert said We have always viewed these particular shows as sex education for the st century
