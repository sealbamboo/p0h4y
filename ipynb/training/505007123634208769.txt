When Megan Thoemmes first found a tiny critter living in the pores of her nose she was disgusted The first time I found one on my face I didnt sleep for four nights says   a graduate student at North Carolina State University But shes made peace with her  mites not only accepting that the microscopic arthropods are hers for life but conducting a study that finds that everybody else has them too Theyre actually pretty cute Thoemmes tells Shots With their eight little legs they look like theyre almost swimming through the oil Thats the oil from the sebaceous glands on your face Scientists have known for more than a century that   mites like to hang out on human skin More recently the creatures have been investigated as a potential cause of the skin disorder   But the thought was that just a small minority of people played host to the translucent critters Boy were they wrong about that Thoemmes and her colleagues had gotten good at using little laboratory spatulas to scrape the sides of peoples noses at  in the RaleighDurhan NC area collecting a bit of the goop inside pores that the mites like to live in They tested hundreds of people and found mites  percent of the time But that number seemed suspiciously low so the scientists hit on the idea of looking for mite DNA on human faces rather than the mites themselves In DNA tests of  people  percent of those over age  carried DNA from   mites The were published Wednesday in the journal   Tests on more people have also come up with the same  percent number Thoemmes says Makes you feel kind of itchy doesnt it Scientists dont know how the mites spread among humans one theory is that theyre passed on from mother to child while breastfeeding Young people are much less likely to have them while theyve been found on almost all cadavers The mites probably crawl on our faces at night when its dark In a way that  percent number is strangely comforting Not only do I have face mites but so does Benedict Cumberbatch And Ruth Bader Ginsburg And Beyonce Its like having friends with you all the time Thoemmes says Realizing that everyone has them and theyre likely not causing any problems its pretty reassuring Thoemmes and her colleagues are pretty excited about using human mites and their DNA to figure out how people have migrated historically and how weve interacted with animals One of the two species of human mites   is related to the dog mite that can cause mange Indeed Thoemmes just got back from mitehunting in Mexico and Peru We want to get a lot of samples from humans around the world to see how that genetic diversity is falling out and have a fuller picture of what is happening
