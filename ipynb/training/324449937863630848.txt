From the first explosion in Boston on Monday to the second just  seconds elapsed And in those  seconds three people were mortally wounded including an yearold boy The number of injured topped  and for those of us watching it was a profound reminder of a reality wed prefer to ignore When these things happen it reminds you of the fragility of life and that death is something that can happen very suddenly very unexpectedly says   a psychologist at the University of Arizona who studies how people consciously and unconsciously respond to events that force them to confront their own vulnerability and mortality If terrorists dont get us something else might and eventually will The idea of our own death Greenberg says is incredibly challenging and often our response follows a kind of predictable psychological script Theres the horror we feel as we watch the event unfold but with it theres a quiet assessment  That happens Greenberg says generally in sort of a biased way to try to deny your vulnerability Greenberg says studies have shown that most of us find ways to discount the possibility that the thing on the screen could happen to us  big and small reasons why   in particular are safe Greenberg says he even sees this in himself On Monday after the bombing he found his mind making a calculation Im here in Tuscon Im like This is the last place that anyone is going to bother hitting You know its not me and its not now And Greenberg says in the early stages of   we  and our leaders  do what we can to kind of reassert our sense of control We make plans for what to do if something bad hits our city we increase our vigilance But whats really interesting is how events like this affect us after theyve left the front page and our conscious minds The thoughts of our mortality tend to linger outside of our conscious attention but still affect us he says Greenberg and his colleagues know this because for months after the Sept   attacks they gave people incomplete word stems and asked them to finish the words You could fill it out with a deathrelated word or a nondeathrelated word  so for example coff could be either coffee or coffin  he says For a long time after Sept  the probability that people would choose coffin instead of coffee was higher than normal And Greenberg says when the specter of our own death is there under the surface we see the world very differently than when its not When death is percolating close to consciousness people become more us vs them  they become defensive of their belief system positive toward those they identify with and more negative to those who espouse a different belief system he says Dozens of studies have shown this and Greenberg believes that this tendency to embrace our own belief system more strongly in the face of death is part the reason the country got more polarized after Sept  At first everybody got closer together That lasted a few months And after that America got more polarized than ever and people got more invested in their own belief systems whether they be conservative or liberal he says Now obviously when it comes to Boston its still early  its not close to clear who is responsible for what happened But still Greenberg says Boston is a reminder Death is coming Theres no way around it
