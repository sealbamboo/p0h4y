On the eastern edge of St Joseph Mo lies the small citys only hospital a landmark of modern brick and glass buildings Everyone in town knows Heartland Regional Medical Center  many residents gave birth to their children here Many rush here when they get hurt or sick And theres another reason everyone knows this place Thousands of people around St Joseph have been sued by the hospital and had their wages seized to pay for medical bills Some of them given their income could have qualified to get their bill forgiven entirely  but the hospital seized their wages anyway NPR and ProPublica   the increase in socalled wage garnishment   For this story we looked specifically at nonprofit hospitals and found the practice widespread in five different states around the country Nonprofit hospitals get huge tax breaks  they are considered charities and therefore dont pay federal or state income tax or local property tax In exchange they are obligated to provide financial assistance or charity care to lowerincome patients Some nonprofit hospitals around the country dont ever seize their patients wages Some do so only in very rare cases But others sue hundreds of patients every year Heartland which is in the process of changing its name to Mosaic Life Care seizes more money from patients than any other hospital in Missouri From  through  the hospitals debt collection arm garnished the wages of about  people according to a ProPublica analysis of state court data After the hospital wins a judgment against a former patient in court its entitled to take a hefty portion of the patients paychecks going forward  percent of aftertax pay For patients who are the head of household if they tell the hospital or court that information the hospital can seize only  percent of each paycheck But Heartland through the debt collection company Northwest Financial Services often sues both adults in a household  garnishing one at the  percent rate and the other at the full  percent of their pay The hospital also charges patients  percent interest the maximum allowed under state law Back in  Keith Herie was working as a truck driver making about  a year His wife Kathleen was a stayathome mom with their two kids The couple says they couldnt afford health insurance and Keiths employer didnt offer it But sometimes you have to go to the hospital anyway Thats what happened when Kathleen doubled over with a burst appendix and needed an emergency operation I felt sharp pains I was vomiting I was running a fever she says It was bad That operation meant upwards of  in medical bills It was a staggering debt for the Heries They say the hospital told them they could apply for financial aid but when he went to inquire about that Keith says they basically told me I made too much Just a few months after the operation the hospital expanded its charity care policy The Heries given their income would have qualified under the new policy But the hospital didnt make the change retroactive In  the hospital sued the Heries and got a court judgment against them for the full bill plus legal fees  more than  in total Ever since the hospital has been taking  percent out of Keith Heries paychecks He says that has also hurt his credit score Where I should be making a amonth car payment Im making  in payments he says Likewise the mar on his credit has prevented him from refinancing his mortgage to take advantage of lower interest rates It affects everything Keith says To make some more money Kathleen Herie got a lowwage retail job at Sams Club But then Heartland hospital began seizing  percent of her paychecks after taxes  meaning both she and her husband were now getting their pay docked at the maximum level allowed under state and federal law On top of that the hospital placed a lien against their home  which also prevents them from refinancing According to   this is done in all cases in which the company has won a judgment exceeding  Theyre greedy Kathleen says I owe more in interest on those bills than I do the bill alone Court records show that the couple has now paid more than  on this debt But because the hospital has been charging them  percent interest on that large bill for going on  years now the interest has added up  so the couple still owes  more Its like a nevernever plan Keith says Youre never going to get rid of it and youre never going to get ahead of it As far as the hospitals finances go  its doing well Heartland made  million in gross revenues last year and  million of that was profit Weve been very successful in terms of being profitable and being a good community asset says Tama Wagner chief brand officer for Heartland In fact the hospital brings in so much money that all of this wage garnishment turns out to be a minor item on its balance sheet Totaling up all the money the hospital seized from patients wages last year according to court records shows that wage garnishment brought in just half of  percent of its revenues Other hospitals in Missouri have found ways to avoid suing lowincome patients BJC Healthcare a nonprofit operates a chain of  hospitals including BarnesJewish Hospital in St Louis the largest in the state In  the BJC hospital chain filed just  lawsuits Unlike Heartland BJC automatically slices  percent off its standard rates for uninsured patients and never includes interest on payment plans said June Fowler BJCs spokeswoman By comparison Heartland hospitals debt collection arm filed over  lawsuits in Missouri courts in  Its not fair to those who are paying to not be aggressive with those who have the ability and arent paying Wagner says She says the hospital does everything it can to fulfill its mission as a nonprofit charitable institution Patients are offered multiple opportunities to qualify for financial assistance and avoid the possibility of legal action she says It would be better for everyone Wagner says if we attempt to work on things before it gets to this level In recent years the hospital has made its charity care policy more generous Heartlands policies state that anyone making   similar to what an insurance company pays and then get that amount cut in half If they make less than twice the poverty line the entire bill is forgiven The hospital makes every effort to let patients know that they may qualify for help Wagner says Financial counselors are available if a patient asks for that But if patients dont utilize those resources she says the hospital must take action No one goes into this with the goal or the desire to ruin someones life Wagner says But at the same time the services were rendered and we have to figure out how to get them paid for Asked why the hospital sues more patients than any other in the state Wagner said I dont know Last year about  Heartland patients had their bills cut or zeroed out according to data provided by Heartland About half of those were uninsured while the rest were spared full payment of deductibles or other obligations not covered by their insurance But uninsured patients like the Heries who dont receive charity care  either because they were turned down or never applied  are billed at Heartlands standard rates the sticker price that insurers never pay In  more than twothirds of the accounts the hospitals debt collection division handled involved uninsured patients according to data provided by Heartland In  Heartland sued Keith and Kathleen Herie again Keith was experiencing chest pains had tests done and ended up with new bills totaling upwards of  But this time based on his income on his tax returns the couple could have qualified to get their entire bill forgiven under the hospitals financial aid policy But they say nobody told them that They didnt formally apply for aid So the hospital charged them the full bill and garnished their wages again Altogether over the years the couple has paid  through garnishments according to court records They still owe  The Heries case highlights a key point When a hospital garnishes patients wages it learns how much they make But even if the patient is very lowincome Heartland doesnt consider that Once you get sued   The time to do that would have been back when you got the bill or when the bill initially went to collections Wagner says Hospital spokesperson Tracey Clark says charity care is reserved for patients who seek it and legitimately work with us Meanwhile the hospital is seizing the wages of many patients who could qualify for free or reducedcost care Just last year Heartland garnished the pay of more than  people who worked at WalMart fastfood restaurants such as McDonalds and a local pig slaughterhouse according to court records Clark said that WalMart employees constituted only  percent of the thousands of patients currently being garnished by the hospitals debtcollection arm The employees of the local pig slaughterhouse were Heartlands most frequent target One of the largest employers in St Joseph Triumph Foods processes  million hogs a year and has  employees according to its website In  at least  Triumph employees had their wages garnished by Heartlands debtcollection arm  about one of every  employees Tammy Berry who earns  an hour working at the fast food chain Taco Johns has been sued by Heartland repeatedly Berry  and her husband Keith  were first sued in  Since then the hospital has garnished  from Tammys pay almost all of it going to pay off interest Keith Berry says he does not work and is applying for disability payments The Berrys still owe  on that debt The couple have had a number of ailments including issues with Keiths heart but they arent sure which hospital visits led to the suits Then while still being garnished for those bills Tammy said she fell ill with pneumonia and went to Heartland for treatment again The hospitals debt collection arm sued them for  more Federal law only protects the poorest of the poor from garnishment and Tammy is not poor enough If she takes home more than  a month her wages can be garnished On the weeks she works full time the garnishments bring her takehome pay below the minimum wage But like the Heries the Berrys are poor enough to qualify for free care under Heartlands official financial aid policy In fact the Berrys had qualified for charity care at Heartland for bills at other times so the hospital has known that their finances were precarious Yet they were charged full price for Tammys treatment for pneumonia Clark the Heartland spokeswoman declined to explain this but said Information has to be a twoway street Outside a courtroom in the county courthouse on a recent Wednesday morning the couple slumps on a bench dejectedly They say theyre uncertain how they will absorb this latest blow Were living paycheck to paycheck Tammy says If a nonprofit hospital gets too aggressive with debt collection these days theyre putting at risk their federal tax exemption says Mark Rukavina He runs Community Health Advisors a consulting firm that helps hospitals comply with the Affordable Care Act The ACA actually sets a new and higher standard for debt collection The statute is quite clear Rukavina says It says nonprofit hospitals should not engage in extraordinary collection actions before making a reasonable effort to determine whether someone is eligible for financial assistance And if a hospital is garnishing wages of many lowincome residents in their community Rukavina says its really questionable whether that is in compliance Chi Chi Wu an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center says Heartlands tactics appear to run counter to its mission Nonprofit hospitals are given taxexempt status because they are supposed to be serving the public and especially the poor she says The NCLC has criticized hospitals in the past for charging uninsured patients higher prices than the hospitals charge insurance companies The insurance companies negotiate reduced rates from hospitals Wu says if hospitals are charging lowincome patients more than they charge insured patients and then garnishing their wages on the basis of these inflated amounts there ought to be consequences They should lose their taxexempt status she says The center has recommended that federal regulators prohibit debt collectors from garnishing wages based on the higher prices hospitals charge uninsured patients After NPR and ProPublica brought all this to Heartland hospitals board of directors the board says it is reviewing the hospitals debt collection practices Mark Rukavina says nonprofit hospitals around the country should do the same
