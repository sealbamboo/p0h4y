Cashstrapped states are coming up with an appealingly simple fix for soaring Medicaid costs Dont pay for emergency room visits for people who arent sick enough to be there Theres a problem though Its almost impossible to figure out whos sick enough and who isnt at the moment they walk in the door researchers say People dont come to the ER with diagnoses they come to the ER with symptoms says   an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of California San Francisco Shes the lead author of the   published in the latest   the   Almost a dozen states have come up with plans to refuse to pay for ER visits or require copays from Medicaid patients if they have a health problem that could have been treated in a doctors office Theyre operating on the widely held premise that people without private health insurance use emergency rooms for minor complaints that would best be treated elsewhere To find out if thats true Raven and colleagues looked at the discharge records for almost  people who visited emergency rooms in  They identified which people had problems that were primary care treatable and then looked back to see what symptoms brought them to the ER Just  percent of the people had a problem that could have been treated in a doctors office But it was impossible to identify them based on symptoms when they walked in the door because they were the same as those for  percent of all emergency room visits The hundreds of symptoms included toothache skin rash abdominal pain earache fever and chest pain Looking at the people with those symptoms  percent were triaged as needing immediate care and  percent were admitted to the hospital The three most common diagnoses were abdominal pain respiratory infection and chest pain If you have a yearold person who wakes up in the middle of the night with chest pain the only logical thing for him to do it to go to the emergency room Raven says Then the doctor comes in and says Good news youre not having a heart attack Maybe you have indigestion We certainly dont want people to be discouraged from getting emergency care especially because in many cases it could be a heart attack The idea of identifying primarycare treatable cases was not to kick them out of the ER but to make sure they got good primary care so they didnt have to go to the ER says   an ER doctor and policy analyst for the Rand Corporation If youre going to apply this logic to reduce support to the emergency department I suppose we should shut down fire departments because sometimes the public calls with a false alarm Kellermann told Shots These visits are not happening because people are dumb or lazy or indifferent Kellermann says Theyre symptoms that primary care is not adequate to meet the acute care needs of the population The Affordable Care Act requires that Medicare and private insurers pay for emergency care that a prudent layperson would consider necessary In other words they cant stick you with the bill if you go in with chest pain and it turns out to be heartburn But Medicaid patients didnt get the same protection In  Washington state said it would stop paying for emergency department visits by Medicaid patients if they were not necessary for that place of service but the plan was overturned by the governor If similar measures are enacted in other states hospitals would end up paying the tab for emergency room patients the state refused to cover
