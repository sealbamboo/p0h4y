British photographer James Ostrer purchased about  worth of junk food over the past two years  enough to fill up six or seven cars But all those Mars bars strawberry shoelaces donuts and cheese puffs werent meant for consumption Instead   caked them on himself and others with the help of cream cheese plaster to create a series of human sculptures Photos he took of his creepycool creations on candycolored backgrounds are on display at the   in London through Sept  The exhibit is called Wotsit all about Wotsits are the British version of Cheetos and was inspired by Ostrers complicated relationship with junk food It all started after his parents got divorced he tells The Salt He lived with his mother and each weekend I used to get picked up by my dad and he would always be late Ostrer says His parents would bicker and shout And afterward my dad would always drive my sister and I to McDonalds and wed have a Happy Meal Soon he says he started turning to junk food as a way to cope with stress Ostrer is tall and doesnt consider himself particularly overweight But as he got older he began to notice that his junkfood heavy diet was making him feel sick rather than nourished Its never going really to make you feel good he says For this project Ostrer says he started by designing junk food masks for himself I wanted to completely engulf myself in these food types to this extreme level he says The process of creating these was a kind of a cathartic experience Ostrer also used his friends and even his dad as models But it wasnt a comfortable experience for anyone The artist usually started with colored cream cheese which emulates frosting and makes for a good base He then layered other foods on top The fullbody treatments took about eight hours to complete he says Sculpting the faces was more challenging and Ostrer had to work quickly Once the models were fully covered he only had a few minutes to photograph them And he made sure to leave at least one nostril open Otherwise it would get difficult for the models to breathe he says In creating each sculpture he drew on his mental images of everything from famous works of art to celebrities hed seen on TV to the ancient people he read about in history class And the titles like EF  are inspired by the European   for food additives known as E numbers The EF in Ostrers titles stands for emotional fossil Nowadays when he walks by the aisles full of junk food at the grocery store Ostrer says he doesnt feel the same craving for it Now I kind of see them as sculpting materials
