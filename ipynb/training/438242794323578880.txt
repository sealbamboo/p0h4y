Sheila Lawless manages a small rheumatology practice in Wichita Falls Texas about two hours outside Dallas She makes sure everything in the office runs smoothly  scheduling patients collecting payments keeping the lights on Recently she added another duty  incorporating the trickle of patients with insurance plans purchased on the new   exchanges Open enrollment doesnt end until March  but people who have already bought Obamacare plans are beginning to use them We had a smattering in Januarymaybe once a week But I think were averaging two to three a day now says Lawless That doesnt sound like many new customers but its presented a major challenge Each exchange patient has required the practice to spend an hour or more on the phone with the insurance company Weve been on hold for an hour an hour and  an hour and  been disconnected have to call back again and repeat the process she explains Those sorts of hold times add up fast In the past offices have been able to make sure patients are insured quickly by using online verification systems run by the insurance companies But for exchange patients offices also have to call to make sure the patient has paid the premium If it isnt paid the insurance company can refuse to pay the doctor for the visit or recoup payments already made Thats because of a provision of the law that gives exchange patients a   of up to  days to pay During the first  days insurers have to pay any claims incurred But for the next  days nothing is guaranteed If a patient visits the doctor the insurer can pend the claim  it can wait to pay until the patient pays his premium At the end of the  days the insurer can cancel the coverage and refuse to pay the pended claims or recoup payments already made That puts the doctors office at risk So Lawless   with the insurer to make sure that everything is in order before proceeding with a visit If the premium has not been paid Lawless gives the patient the option of rescheduling the appointment or paying in cash and then applying to the insurer for reimbursement Most   run lean and mean  youve got one or two people to do this process plus do their other job duties that day as well which is tend to the patients in front of them says Lawless To manage the new workload shes had other staffers including nurses step in to answer the phone And that means longer hours more overtime and higher overhead expenses And then theres the plain old annoyance factor You call in and you hit option prompts and you get to listen to no less than an hour of   intro music I could sing you the tune thats how often Ive had to listen to it she says My staff said yesterday its a sad shame within their prompts you cant pick your music as well If youre going to have to wait that long at least let us listen to what we want to listen to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas is the only insurer offering exchange plans in Wichita Falls Chief Medical Officer Dr Dan McCoy says part of the problem is the health laws compressed timeline Clearly at the end of December there were a significant number of members who enrolled and its taken some time to work through that volume in membership McCoy says And we know this is a new day in the transformation of American health care So its going to take a little bit of time to work through that Health Care Service Corp which owns Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas has tried to address the situation by adding  employees to its call center to handle the influx of calls and by extending its business hours McCoy has also been working directly with the   to work out the kinks The real problem is that signing up for coverage on the exchange isnt as simple as the White House has made it sound according to Anders Gilberg senior vice president of government affairs at the   in Washington DC a trade group for practice administrators What weve found is that messaging out of the Obama administration right now thats aimed at the public it tends to oversimplify the complexity of what it takes to get covered on the exchanges says Gilberg Just because you enrolled in coverage doesnt mean your coverage is effective Even if the patient pays the premium right away it could be up to six weeks before the coverage   The middle of the month is a key date A plan purchased on Feb  would be effective March  But a plan purchased on Feb  for example would not become effective until April  Go to the doctor before then and your insurer doesnt pay Its not a surprise that given the subtle nuances and differences of what these exchange products are that youre in a gray area right now where theres a little confusion on the patient side and the practice side And I think thats what were seeing a lot of right now says Gilberg For a brandnew program thats to be expected he adds And it doesnt mean the exchange isnt working The real test will be what happens in April when open enrollment has ended and everyone who has purchased a plan is clearly covered In the meantime Lawless offers this advice to patients who have bought plans on the exchange If you pay your premium prior to visiting the doctor print that out and bring it with you because that will certainly save all a lot of grief
