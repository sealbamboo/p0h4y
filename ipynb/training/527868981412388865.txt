Maine Gov. Paul LePage said Thursday that negotiations have failed with a nurse who defied a state-ordered quarantine after treating Ebola patients and he would “exercise the full extent” of his authority to protect public health.. But the Republican governor didn’t say what legal steps he would take and said he was open to allowing 33-year-old Kaci Hickox to take walks, bicycle rides and generally leave her home in rural northern Maine as long as she avoided public places or coming within three feet of people.
