Mothers of young children may feel like they dont have much time to exercise but the more active the moms are the more active the children The activity level of young children is directly linked to that of their mothers researchers in the United Kingdom say But the problem is that mothers with young children arent very active says   a behavioral epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge and the studys lead author When researchers used accelerometers to track the physical activity of  mothers and their yearolds the mothers on average spent only  minutes of their waking hours each day doing moderate to vigorous activity Only half were active for at least  minutes on one or more days each week The children were more active with many getting eight hours of light and moderate activity daily But even then the preschoolers got only about an hour a day of running and vigorous play Mothers increased physical activity boosted childrens moderate and vigorous activity overall according to   published Monday in the journal  Its not entirely clear whether its the mothers activity that influences her childs or if mothers are more active because theyre busy keeping up with a playful child van Sluijs says So efforts to promote physical activity should include both mothers and children But busy mothers dont have to drop all other priorities to play with their children all day Van Sluijs says just small changes  walking to the park instead of driving or playing a good game of tag instead of a board game  can make a difference Increasing your physical activity just by a little bit already helps you dont have to become an athlete she says If you look at small increases in activity over a month or a year that can actually have quite large benefits Fathers werent part of the study but van Sluijs says that doesnt mean the call for more exercise should single out mothers We do recommend that interventions are not just targeted at mothers and their children she tells Shots Theyre actually targeted at the family unit because we know that siblings as well play an important role for childrens physical activity Its not entirely clear whether its the mothers activity that influences her childs or if mothers are more active because theyre busy keeping up with a playful child van Sluijs says So efforts to promote physical activity should include both mothers and children
