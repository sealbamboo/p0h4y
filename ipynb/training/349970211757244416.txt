The National Institutes of Health says  that the agency had been using for research Animal rights activists see the move as a big step towards ending the use of chimps in research but it will be awhile before any of the research chimps find their way into retirement homes Right now the NIH has some  chimps available to researchers The vast majority of the animals are used in studies of things like genetics and behavior But in recent years the scientific community has begun to feel even these studies are unnecessary In  the Institute of Medicine issued a   recommending that the vast majority of government chimps be retired In January an NIH working group agreed and   on what to do with NIHs chimpanzees And earlier this month the Fish and Wildlife Service   all chimps including lab chimps as endangered That would raise still another barrier to using them in research Chimpanzees are very special animals says Francis Collins director of the NIH We believe they deserve special consideration as special creatures Collins says that the NIH will largely follow the plan issued by its internal working group It will retire some  chimps to designated sanctuaries leaving as many as  in labs and available for new research proposals The  or so will not necessarily stay in research forever We will revisit the decision about the need for those  in a small colony five years from now Collins says The retired chimps will live out their lives in an environment similar to those in the wild They will be in social groups of at least seven and live inside enclosures where they can climb and forage for food But the NIH wont follow a recommendation that each chimp be given  square feet of living space Collins says We did not feel that there was adequate scientific evidence at present to support that requirement The cost involved with providing so much space was also an issue he says Retirement wont come right away however Many chimps are still in research projects that will be allowed to run to completion in the next year or two And the NIH has to work with Congress to change legislation regulating chimp retirement At present   caps the money the agency can spend on retirement at  million NIH is expected to hit that limit soon says Kathy Hudson deputy director for outreach and policy The agency must also find additional space in sanctuaries for the chimps That could involve expanding existing sanctuaries But it could also mean recategorizing some laboratories as sanctuaries The research facilities are quite nice Hudson says All of this is expected to take a few years according to Collins Kathleen Conlee the Humane Societys vice president for animal research says that todays announcement is a big step in the right direction This is a moment weve all been waiting for she says But she says more needs to be done Conlee would like the NIH to reconsider the space requirements of its chimpanzees and she bristles at the idea of turning labs into sanctuaries Its the culture of care she says Above all she says shed like to see the last  or so chimps designated to join their brethren I think were moving in absolutely the right direction and were going to keep pressing until the day when every governmentowned chimpanzee is in a sanctuary she says
