Cary Grants chin may appeal to you and Ingrid Bergman But that might not be the case among the indigenous people of Australia And the idea that a guys jutting jawline might not cause women the world over to swoon calls into question the notion that some characteristics are pretty much automatic signals of desirability for prospective mates researchers say  a doctoral candidate in anthropology at Northwestern University and a colleague at Dartmouth just published an   in the online journal   that finds quite a bit of variation in chin shape for  men and  women depending on where theyre from Thayer tells Shots the jawbones she analyzed came from the collection of the American Museum of Natural History in New York Sure its easier to measure the bones and chins of dead people but the more important factor she says is that all the samples predate the global spread of Western concepts of beauty Theyre recent enough though to reflect how we all still look Now if mates prefer a particular type of chin the thinking goes it should be passed on to offspring more often and be perpetuated And a prominent male chin thought to be a marker for virility is one of the characteristics thats part of the socalled universal facial attractiveness hypothesis Yeah thats a thing Only one problem The jawbones from Australia stood out Or rather they didnt The males had smaller less prominent chins Thayer tells Shots They were less projecting She calls the findings a cautionary tale about research that has largely asked people often college students to pick the faces that are most attractive to them Instead of looking just at preferences we need to look at difference in fitness  the number of offspring Thayer says Also it makes us question the idea that preferences are universal We need to move toward studying different patterns In the end she says human mate decisions are socially complex and are based on a lot more than just attractiveness Thank goodness
