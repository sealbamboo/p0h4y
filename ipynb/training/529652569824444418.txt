If youve had a kidney stone and want to spare yourself the agony of a repeat episode heres some simple advice Drink more water In a guideline   in the   the American College of Physicians recommends increasing fluid intake and spreading throughout the day It may take eight to  glasses of water over the course of a day to comply The recommendation calls for achieving at least  liters of urine a day It might also help to cut back on colas A   cited by the American College of Physicians found that kidney stone patients who agreed to change their beverage habits and abstain from soda  specifically colas acidified with phosphoric acid  cut their risk of a recurrence by about  percent The evidence isnt concrete but its suggestive says ACP President   If he sees patients with a history of stones he asks how many sodas theyre drinking a day If I find out theyre drinking three or four Diet Cokes a day I would strongly suggest they cut that back to one or none Fleming tells Shots So what might explain the link between colas and kidney stones Its not exactly clear but researchers know that phosphorus acidifies urine And an acid environment is conducive to stone formation Fleming told us Now upping the amount of water you drink is no guarantee against a recurrence But a fiveyear   found that participants who reached the two liter of urine threshold by hydrating were less likely to have a recurrence compared with people who didnt increase their fluid intake  percent and  percent respectively So despite the fact that its not a cureall drinking more water is about the most effective strategy that people prone to forming kidney stones can try This is the main recommendation Fleming told us And there may be other dietary strategies that help as well For instance this   found a diet rich in plant based foods and fiber can cut the risk of recurrent kidney stones And if these strategies fail to prevent recurrences Medication can be very helpful Fleming told us
