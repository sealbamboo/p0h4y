Two professions that have traditionally had a rocky relationship  doctors and lawyers  are finding some common ground in clinics and hospitals across the country In Akron Ohio for instance doctors are studying how adding a lawyer to the health care team can help improve a patients health As a TV drones in the background about a dozen women and children wait for their names to be called at the Summa womens clinic in Akron In the clinics conference room Meredith Watts is awaiting her next case Shes not a doctor or a nurse Shes a lawyer who specializes in housing and consumer work Watts works for Community Legal Aid a nonprofit that gives free legal help to lowincome people in eight Ohio counties Her firm is housed in a downtown office tower But Watts prefers working out of the clinic So if somebody comes in to the clinic and they get sent to me and its a housing problem and Im here I can give them advice directly on site she says Watts role on the team is to help solve issues that might affect a patients health but are outside a doctors control Lets say youre under threat of eviction because of something that happened she says Thats going to cause a significant amount of anxiety potentially and then youre suffering from these anxiety problems that wouldnt have happened if we had been able to intervene and perhaps help with the eviction problem she says And as a lawyer Watts makes house calls One of her clients Shirley Kimbrough lives in a subsidized housing unit in a north Akron neighborhood The clinic referred Kimbrough to Watts who last year helped her move into this handicappedaccessible apartment to care for her disabled granddaughter If I hadnt had her to help me I would have lost my granddaughter because I had already lost my daughter and I dont think I could have stood that Kimbrough says Attorney Marie Curry runs Akrons medicallegal partnership Its exciting to be able to do what we think of as preventative law rather than always being crisis intervention because you can help something not happen before it becomes a crisis Curry says But not all lawyers are quick to embrace a cozy new relationship with their old adversaries I dont understand how a medical clinic needs an attorney to be a part of its team It doesnt any make sense to me says Allen Schulman a malpractice attorney in nearby Canton who takes a more traditional view of the two professions I think there has historically been an animosity between lawyers and doctors I think we share some of the blame and I think the medical profession shares some of the blame he says But back at the Akron womens clinic researcher Michele McCarroll says doctors here like having a lawyer down the hall from the examination room We are trying to meet the needs of the patients right here on site in kind of a onestop shop where we know things  such as social issues can make a difference in health issues she says McCarroll and Akrons Community Legal Aid lawyers have enrolled  women in the first randomized study to determine whether having a lawyer onsite really does improve health outcomes Theyre measuring conditions like blood pressure stress and other health factors in two groups of women who had legal issues One group was introduced to a clinic lawyer the other group was given a number for the legal help line They plan to present their results next week at the national   in Washington
