Researchers at Boston University have found more evidence supporting a link between repeated knocks to the head and chronic brain disease The results just   in the journal   add weight to concerns about the effect of repeated mild head trauma in athletes whether theyre pros or peewees The sheer volume of cases I think is going to just overwhelm anybody that wants to be in denial about the existence of this problem Dr Robert C Cantu a codirector of Boston Universitys   told   Researchers including Cantu looked at brain samples taken after death from  people ages  to  who had experienced repetitive mild   such as concussions throughout their lives They compared those samples with others from similarly aged people without a history of brain injuries The group with a history of head trauma included yearold Nathan Stiles a high school player who   after a  head injury s running back   and other   The group was dominated by athletes  altogether including some men who were also in the military Roughly  percent or  of all the people with histories of hits to the head showed evidence of   CTE for short which results in gradual degradation of brain tissue CTEs mildest symptoms include headache and attention problems In more advanced stages of CTE people can experience depression dementia and aggression The researchers found evidence of CTE in  American football players   of whom played in the National Football League This study clearly shows that for some athletes and war fighters there may be severe and devastating longterm consequences of repetitive brain trauma that has traditionally been considered only mild the authors of the study concluded The findings come amid controversy over the effect of head trauma on younger players and   scientific evidence of persistent brain injury in athletes Theres also a consolidated lawsuit by former players against the NFL Thousands of them allege that the league withheld data suggesting that head trauma could lead to brain damage CTE has been seen in athletes before but the latest findings of an association with head trauma is the most extensive one to date By understanding its evolution from isolated focal disease to widespread devastating disease associated with dementia   a neuropathologist who led the BU study told   in an email We now have much clearer ideas about how to identify this disease in living people and how to treat it Even so the researchers agree that its hard to know how widespread the problem may be Its a gamblers game to try to predict what percentage of the population has this   a coauthor of the study and codirector of the Boston University center   the
