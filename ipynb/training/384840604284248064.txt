Midlife stress may increase a womans risk of developing dementia according to researchers  In a study of  Swedish women those who had to cope with events such as divorce or bereavement were more likely to get Alzheimers decades later  The more stressful events there were the higher the dementia risk became BMJ Open reports  The study authors say stress hormones may be to blame triggering harmful alterations in the brain   Stress hormones can cause a number of changes in the body and affect things such as blood pressure and blood sugar control And they can remain at high levels many years after experiencing a traumatic event Dr Lena Johansson and colleagues explain  But they say more work is needed to confirm their findings and ascertain whether the same stress and dementia link might also occur in men In the study the women underwent a battery of tests and examinations when they were in either their late s mids or s and then again at regular intervals over the next four decades At the start of the study one in four women said they had experienced at least one stressful event such as widowhood or unemployment A similar proportion had experienced at least two stressful events while one in five had experienced at least three The remaining women had either experienced more than this or none  During followup  of the women died and  developed dementia  When the researchers looked back at the womens history of midlife stress they found the link between stress and dementia risk  Dr Johansson says future studies should look at whether stress management and behavioural therapy might help offset dementia Dr Simon Ridley of Alzheimers Research UK said that from this study it was hard to know whether stress contributed directly to the development of dementia whether it was purely an indicator of another underlying risk factor in this population of women or whether the link was due to an entirely different factor We know that the risk factors for dementia are complex and our age genetics and environment may all play a role Current evidence suggests the best ways to reduce the risk of dementia are to eat a balanced diet take regular exercise not smoke and keep blood pressure and cholesterol in check  If you are feeling stressed or concerned about your health in general we would recommend you talk this through with your GP
