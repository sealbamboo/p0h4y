There are many reasons to visit New York in the fall and apples are one of them I was reminded of this when I found myself at the small Lincoln Center farmers market on a Saturday in late October I had been testing apple recipes at home in Los Angeles the previous week for this weeks Recipes for Health and now I regretted that I didnt have more recipes to test so generous was my choice of apples This did not stop me from buying quite a selection and enjoying them just about the healthiest snack on earth throughout the week  Most of the apples were types I cant get in California  Jonamac and Jonagold Mutsu and Macoun McIntosh Spartan Cortland Empire The West Coast apples I work with are good too  Braeburns Galas Pink Lady Fuji Granny Smith  but there is something about the tart juicy crispness of a New York state apple that cant be outdone Apples will see their way from the beginning to the end of my Thanksgiving meal starting with a chopped salad that pairs apples with walnuts and bitter lettuces endive and chicory or radicchio I made whole wheat applepecan scones that you can serve with the meal or eat for breakfast and sauted apple rings that make a very nice side dish with turkey or serve them for dessert with ice cream Apples and cranberries also add a new sweet dimension to my whole wheat bread stuffing All this is not to discourage you from making apple pie but if you want to make a dessert that is a little less demanding try my nowfavorite glutenfree applecranberry crumble 
	 
	
		A salad with a great mix of bitter and sweet flavors that is juicy crunchy and comforting	 
	 
	
		Having grown up with Pepperidge Farm stuffing I will always have a weakness for bread stuffing seasoned with sage and thyme with plenty of chopped onion and celery	 
	 
	
		An apple dish that can work on the breakfast table as a side dish or even dessert	 
	 
	
		Juicy apples work well in these nottoosweet scones	 
	 
	
		Cooking the apples first makes a huge difference in the sweetness of an apple crumble
