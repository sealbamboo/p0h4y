Well before signs of dementia trigger a diagnosis of Alzheimers disease a persons cholesterol levels may be a bellwether of amyloid plaque buildup in the brain a new study finds Long considered a reliable predictor of heart attacks and strokes worrisome cholesterol levels may now raise concerns about dementia risk as well prompting more aggressive use of drugs including statins that alter cholesterol levels The current study does not convincingly exclude the possibility that taking statins might lower amyloid deposition the researchers said But neither did it show that those taking cholesterol medication were less likely to have the sticky plaques that gum up brain function Only a larger study that gathers more of subjects past health history can determine what role cholesterollowering medication might play in protecting against Alzheimers disease the authors wrote Published Monday in the journal JAMA Neurology the latest research used PET Imaging to conduct a onetime snapshot of the brains of  older patients without dementia They looked specifically to gauge the presence and concentration of amyloid plaques in brain regions most prone to early signs of the abnormal protein buildup the frontal cortex lateral parietal cortex lateral temporal cortex posterior cingulate and precuneus Past research has found higher levels of amyloid deposits in the postmortem brains of people who had worrisome cholesterol readings before their death But this is the first to find that betaamyloid proteins may accumulate steadily in those living with higher cholesterol possibly resulting  should one live long enoughin dementia symptoms Among the subjects with an average age of  having high levels of LDLC bad cholesterol was closely linked to having more amyloid plaque deposits in those regions On average those with low levels of HDL cholesterolthe good cholesterol that at high levels is protective against cardiovascular diseasealso had more amyloid plaque in their brains The researchers from UC Berkeley UC Davis and USC found that other measures that physicians use to gauge a patients risk of heart attack or stroketriglycerides and total cholesterolhad no clear relationship to amyloid plaques in the brain While none of the subjects in the study had been diagnosed with dementia more than half suffered mild cognitive impairmenta decline in mental performance that sometimes progresses to Alzheimers disease  Three had been diagnosed with mild dementia As a group the studys subjects had been aggressively treated for high cholesterol however Their average cholesterol levels were within the optimum range set by the American Heart Assn until   minimized the importance of such guideposts Because researchers had only a onetime snapshot of subjects cholesterol levels as well they were unable to discern whether lowering cholesterol with medication resulted in fewer amyloid deposits How cholesterol levels could affect the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain is something of a mystery Roughly a quarter of the cholesterol in our bodies resides in our brains Cholesterol levels there seem to affect the synthesis of betaamyloid proteins their clearance from the brain and their toxicity once plaques are established But the central nervous systems cholesterol is virtually walled off from that circulating throughout the rest of the body by the bloodbrain barrier So the link between circulating cholesterol levels and amyloid plaques in the brain is unknown One possibility recently suggested by research oxysterols oxidized derivatives of cholesterol that pass through the bloodbrain barrier and may affect cholesterol levels throughout the body
