This is true for people who die of natural causes which account for  of all deaths according to the Centers for Disease Control Its also true researchers say for people who die of the five most common diseases circulatory problems respiratory diseases endocrinenutritionalmetabolic problems digestive diseases and cancer Theres a spike in deaths for all age groups on those days with one exception  children      who was the lead author on a couple of these studies noticed this trend when studying   Specifically Phillips a professor in the sociology department at   and his team looked at the number of people who died in emergency settings and those who were considered dead on arrival between  and  They found a spike in deaths on those three days  An earlier Phillips   from  found a similar trend specifically in cardiac deaths  A more recent   in Britain found patients admitted to hospitals as emergencies on public holidays are significantly more likely to die than those admitted on other days of the week  including weekends      Scientists still cant explain this phenomenon although there are plenty of popular theories    is the obituary writer at the Tampa Bay Times and president of the  Over the years he has noticed his workload pick up over the holidays   We are always getting a slew of obits this time of year Meacham said I noticed this happened pretty regularly so I did call around to funeral directors to see if they believed there was an uptick too He wondered if stress or sadness had something to do with it Ive written many stories about a spouse or a partner dying and then you see the remaining partner die within hour or days or weeks or months To me there seems to be a correlation between body and mind here Phillips and his team looked at the number of deaths among the   population theorizing they may be less aware of the holidays and the stress it can trigger  If stress were solely to blame he figured their deaths wouldnt spike on Christmas or New Years But sure enough he found cardiac deaths were slightly higher at the holidays when Alzheimers was listed as a secondary cause of death   More people do die in winter months than in any other season so Phillips looked to see if there were more deaths in the states that experience    That wasnt the case either The cardiac mortality peak is slightly smaller in the states that border Canada compared to states that border the Gulf of Mexico he found   What about festive eating or drinking Phillips team found deaths were still up for people who were in inpatient treatment  whose diet and alcohol consumption was strictly regulated In fact those who died with substance abuse listed as a secondary cause of death saw a smaller holiday peak than those who died from cardiac diseases alone  Despite  the   doesnt spike at the holidays In fact the suicide rate in December is at its lowest  it peaks in spring and fall The homicide rate also goes down for the holidays   Phillips thinks the true reason that Christmas and New Years are a risk factor for death may actually have much more to do with access to care People who arent feeling well may be putting off a trip to the hospital so they can stay with their family to celebrate Christmas or New Years he said  Holiday staffing at the hospital may also be to blame he said citing statistics from Level  trauma centers  For those deaths the spike was even sharper Phillips said Those are the cases where seconds make a difference and you may see a real difference between the response of a junior and senior member of staff He said he hopes his research could help hospitals and patients plan accordingly If the worst does happen resources are available  For instance   family services coordinator at the nonprofit   in St Joseph Michigan said she and her staff are prepared to help families find a healthy way to deal with grief over the loss of a loved one  We want to make sure we are ready for any phone calls to make sure people are all right in their grief Kohler said The holidays definitely are a harder time of year for people when this happens especially since they are such a time steeped in tradition and family If you know someone who loses a loved one over the holiday Kohler said be sure to be extra sensitive to their emotions  Everything can feel upside down for people There are emotional landmines everywhere so dont try to force anything Kohler said You dont need to fill the air with words Tell them you are ready to listen That can be more powerful than you know
