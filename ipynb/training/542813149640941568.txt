The gargantuan budget bill that lawmakers on Capitol Hill are expected to vote on Thursday does more than dole out federal dollars to keep the government running It also tweaks federal nutrition rules For starters the bill  aka the  Omnibus Appropriations Bill  includes a provision that will give school food directors more flexibility when it comes to adopting  percent whole grain items such as pasta and biscuits in school breakfast and lunch meals And when it comes to salty french fries or pizza schools may get more time to dial back the sodium content thanks to a provision that could postpone a mandate on sodium reduction thats scheduled to take effect in  Lawmakers say further reductions on salt should be predicated on the latest scientific evidence The School Nutrition Association which represents  school cafeteria professionals around the country   supporting these flexibility measures The association has been lobbying for changes as  have piled up that some kids have rejected the move to more healthful fare The SNA says that since the nutrition standards mandated by the Healthy HungerFree Kids Act took effect in  school lunch programs have lost at least  customers And some schools are losing money SNA greatly appreciates Congress recognition of the challenges school nutrition professionals have faced as they work to meet new nutrition standards while ensuring students continue to eat healthy school meals Patricia Montague the groups CEO wrote in the statement Earlier this year a political food fight ensued after the SNA   a proposal that would have allowed some school districts that were operating at a net loss to temporarily opt out of the nutrition standards But the optout waiver was dropped after first lady Michelle Obama and nutrition advocates   about the proposed rollbacks Nutrition advocates say theyre relieved by the compromises in the final spending bill Were pleased that Congress didnt waive all school lunch standards Margo Wootan of the Center for Science in the Public Interest wrote to us in an email But she adds that lawmakers should stay out of the way when it comes to implementing the nutrition standards Its best for kids if school nutrition is based on science not politics Wootan wrote And she says schools should be able to find the whole grains they need to meet those standards as food companies reformulate and make more whole grains available When it comes to sodium reduction Wootan says the Dietary Guidelines Advisory committee is likely to confirm that the science is strong There are a lot of published studies on the harmful effects of too much salt in our diets The first round of sodium reductions is now being implemented in the school lunch program The law requires another reduction in  The American Heart Association says any move to delay the further reductions of sodium in school meals  whether it be in a salty slice of pizza an order of fries or even a salty condiment  will harm kids health If Congress hits the pause button now on the sodium reduction its possible that more children could develop high blood pressure and be at risk for heart disease or stroke before they even become adults Nancy Brown CEO of the AHA wrote in a statement released last night Critics also jumped on a provision in the bill that would permit white potatoes to be included as part of the Women Infants and Children nutrition program which serves lowincome mothers and their children WIC vouchers can be used to buy fresh fruits and vegetables  but not potatoes And thats because at  pounds per capita most Americans already include plenty of spuds in their diet Nonetheless the industry has lobbied to let potatoes in  and it looks like the omnibus bill has finally granted that wish Last year when this issue   a post on the National WIC Association blog   conflicts abound in Congress but this one takes the cake or should I say the potatoes
