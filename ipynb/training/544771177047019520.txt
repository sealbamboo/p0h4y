Alaskas new governor won his election in one of the tightest races in the country a race that was too close to call even a week after election night Bill Walker who ran as an independent unaffiliated with the Republicans or Democrats took office on Dec  after campaigning on the promise that he would expand Medicaid as one of his first orders of business To make good on that hell have to face a Republicancontrolled legislature that hasnt been willing to even consider the idea But for Walker its a nobrainer Around  lowincome Alaskans would receive health benefits under Medicaid expansion most of those affected would be childless adults The federal government would pay  percent of the costs until the end of  and after that the states share would only slowly increase to  percent by  Plus Walker points out Alaskans already pay taxes that fund the expansion I always will default back to what is best for Alaskans he says and its best for Alaskans to have the health care coverage weve already paid for The Alaska Chamber of Commerce the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium all support the Medicaid expansion So far   have expanded their coverage and most of those governors have had legislative support says   a policy analyst with the Kaiser Family Foundation There have been a few states where the governor has acted on his own through executive authority she says but most states have generally incorporated it into state budgets which usually require legislative signoff In the case of Alaska Gov Walker will probably need the legislature because the state has to pay some administrative costs that would add up to as much as  million per year Those millions could be a tough sell for the Republican legislature Republican Sen   says Walker will have to make a strong case It will be a lively debate MacKinnon says but I look forward to working with him to the best of my abilities within the financial constraints that this state is currently facing To help his case Walker has appointed   as Health Commissioner Shes been a leader in the Alaska Native health care system and a determined advocate for Medicaid expansion since the health law passed She says shell rely on a cooperative work ethic as she negotiates with lawmakers over expansion Davidsons confident Alaska can get it done It may not be something everyones  percent happy with she says but we may be able to find middle ground that we can all live with I think thats what makes Alaska so great Davidson adds We dont back down just because things get difficult If its  below we go about our day and get things done Thats just what we do And we do that with policy issues as well Beyond any opposition by the legislature Alaska faces big technical hurdles before Medicaid expansion can work The states payment and enrollment systems   right now and Davidson wants to address those issues before any expansion
