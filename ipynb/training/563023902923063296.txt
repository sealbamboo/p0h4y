ata routinely recorded by pharmacies around the UK could provide physicians commissioners public health authorities and the pharmaceutical industry with invaluable insights into the effectiveness of medicines and the behaviour of patients Every day pharmacies around the country gather data on the use of medicines outcomes adherence levels and the progress of symptoms For instance the   in England collects a huge amount of data Typically lasting five to  minutes often significantly longer this free service takes an indepth look at the issues a patient may be having with their medicines Pharmacists record the conversation and may make recommendations to the patient and or their doctor As many as  MURs can be completed annually per pharmacy In the year ending April  over three million of these reviews were carried out across the UK   Yet this rich seam of data is rarely used Unlike data capture in other care settings MURs carry an automatic consent clause to enable details to be shared with GPs to improve care and with clinical commissioning groups and   England for service monitoring and payment purposes Patients must sign this form before an MUR can be carried out The value of this data can be seen with   launched in June  which tracks the level of support pharmacies are providing to patients through services such as MURs and the   A study reported in the Pharmaceutical Journal showed that pharmacist intervention via the NMS   Such awareness could prompt new approaches to compliance with pharmacists playing an increasingly significant role The most conservative studies state that  of patients with longterm conditions dont use their medications as directed In diabetes this can be as high as  Community pharmacies can offer the opportunity to identify and help people who are unable to use their treatments correctly New product development can also benefit as evidenced by the Salford Lung Study where GSK partnered with pharmacies in Manchester to conduct the worlds first Phase III pragmatic randomised controlled trial in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Chris Stirling global head of life sciences at   said Such cooperation is in line with wider efforts by pharmaceutical companies to work more closely with their local communities Indeed this type of example is just the beginning Another way to benefit from this data would be to use it to monitor patients longitudinally post approval providing real world information on how patients are responding to medicines over time These initiatives should be a catalyst for further use of community pharmacy data The patient medication records PMR systems that regulate stock and dispensing also record a range of frequency dosage and usage data This could be crunched through predictive models with the findings used to anticipate adverse medication incidents and initiate preventive action to avoid hospitalisation Industry professionals frequently bemoan the lack of data from GPs and hospitals A solution to this dilemma already exists  it is now time to use the rich seams of information lying in community pharmacies to drive improved patient outcomes  Levels of patient understanding of their medicines  Ability of patients to use medication or devices correctly  Adherence data such as dosage frequency and reasons for missing doses  Proportion of patients given a service such as a smoking cessation programme or MUR  To provide an evidence base for more interventions to increase adherence  Reduce needless hospital admissions  To calculate the return on investment for commissioners of MURs  To highlight the value of pharmacy as a research centre for many stakeholders
