The brains of college football players are subtly different from the brains of other students especially if the players have experienced a concussion in the past according to an important new brainscan study that while restrained in its conclusions adds to concerns that sportsrelated hits to the head could have lingering effects on the brain even among the young and healthy  Almost all of us have heard by now that concussions are more injurious than was once believed Its been  that the autopsied brains of some professional football and hockey players who experienced repeated hits to the head showed signs of severe and progressive brain damage Meanwhile   suggest that the brain may respond to even mild concussive blows with inflammatory and other reactions that while designed to spur healing could also contribute to tissue damage But many fundamental questions about the longterm impacts of blows to the head during sports remain unanswered including which portions of the brain are most affected whether any brain changes also affect the ability to think and if playing a contact sport might alter the structure and function of the brains of athletes even ones who have never experienced a confirmed concussion  So for a   researchers at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research and the University of Tulsa both in Tulsa Okla and other institutions started delving into those issues by turning to the universitys Division I football team Tulsa is of course in the heart of football country But the researchers say they met no resistance from the school team or players  Everyone around here loves football including me said David Polanski the head athletic trainer for the universitys sports teams and one of the studys coauthors  But we also know that you cant reduce the risks of participating he added unless you know what they are  With his help the scientists identified  players who had experienced at least one medically confirmed concussion while playing football Most of the injuries had occurred in college play but a few during high school Some players had experienced as many as five concussions but most only one or two The researchers also gathered another  players who never had a concussion diagnosis   They asked all of the athletes how many years they had been playing football  Finally they rounded up  healthy collegeaged young men whod never played football to act as a control group  Then they scanned all of their volunteers brains with a sophisticated MRI machine that could pick up slight differences in the size or shape of various parts of the brain   And there were differences as it turned out As a group the football players had less volume in the hippocampus a part of the brain involved in memory and emotional processing than did the nonplayers Among the players who had no history of concussions hippocampal volume was as much as  percent smaller than the control groups And the difference in size was even more striking among the players who had experienced a confirmed concussion whose hippocampal volume was about  percent smaller than in young men whod never played  That was a greater differential than wed anticipated said Patrick Bellgowan a faculty member at both the Laureate Institute and the University of Tulsa and the studys senior author The results are particularly baffling for the players with no history of concussion Interestingly those athletes in each group who had played the most seasons of football tended to have the least hippocampal volume suggesting that at least potentially cumulative playing time and repeated tackles might affect the brain even without a formal concussion   Of course the findings although provocative do not in fact show that playing a contact sport shrinks hippocampal volume This is a single snapshot of the players brains Dr Bellgowan said and reveals nothing about changes over time Indeed the results could indicate that in some indeterminate fashion having a smaller hippocampus predisposes someone to enjoy or excel at football  meaning that the anomalous brain structure predated the playing  And encouragingly the findings did not show that these brain changes are linked to impaired thinking or memory skills The scientists found little correlation between smaller hippocampal volume and thinking skills when they compared players scores on cognitive and coordination tests Some athletes performed well others less so but the size of their hippocampus played little role although surprisingly the more years a subject had played football the slower his reaction time tended to be  Over all the studys results underscore the importance of additional research Dr Bellgowan said He and his colleagues hope to rescan the brains of current players as well as of alumni  who no longer play to get a better sense of any brain changes over time They also want to scan players in high school or younger
