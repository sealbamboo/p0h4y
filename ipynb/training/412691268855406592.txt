In tropical South Florida its growing season Temperatures are in the s theres lots of sun and good rain and normally Hermine Ricketts plants would already be in the ground By now this should be probably Red Sails lettuce which is a beautiful color lettuce or purple mizuna which is a beautiful filigreed purple leaf she says But this year Ricketts vegetable planting has been derailed by a legal fight over what she can plant and where she can plant it Her garden is in the front yard of her home in Miami Shores because thats where the sun is  her house faces south and her backyard is mostly in the shade A retired architect originally from Jamaica Ricketts says she gardens for the food and for the peace it brings her This is a peach tree that I put in and around it I had kale and in between the kales I had some Chinese cabbage she says And I also had Swiss chard yellow Swiss chard There are lots of things planted in Ricketts front yard a pomegranate tree a blueberry bush papaya strawberries pineapples flowers and green plants But noticeably absent is anything considered by Miami Shores to be a vegetable Thats because earlier this year after tending her garden for  years with nothing from the neighbors but compliments Ricketts was ordered to dig up her veggies She says she was surprised several months ago when a zoning inspector stopped by He told me I was not allowed to have vegetables in the front yard she says Under a zoning ordinance tightened last spring residents in Miami Shores are not allowed to have vegetable gardens in their front yards In August Ricketts went before the towns code enforcement board to protest but board Chairman Robert Vickers was less than sympathetic The board ruled the vegetables must go The zoning inspector told Ricketts which plants she had to pull up She complied but wasnt done with her fight She contacted the Institute for Justice a national advocacy group that has fought numerous legal battles over the years on property rights issues Last month the group   against Miami Shores A lawyer with the group Ari Bargill says the ban on frontyard gardens violates a stateguaranteed right to use and enjoy property Its a right that he says can only be restricted for very good reasons And that is not the case with a ban on vegetables You can plant fruit you can have flowers you can adorn your property with pink flamingos  but you cannot have vegetables Bargill says That is almost the definition of irrationality Town officials say they responded to a complaint they received about Ricketts garden and that the law is clear The towns lawyer says hes confident the ordinance will stand up in court But that may be almost beside the point Since filing her lawsuit Ricketts has drawn lots of media attention both in South Florida and across the country Town officials say theyve received death threats  including an email in which someone penciled Hitler mustaches and swastikas on photos of village council members Last year the city of Orlando was involved in a similar dispute with a home gardener there After months of coverage that generated protests from gardeners around the country Orlando relented Its now   to allow vegetable gardens even in the front yard
