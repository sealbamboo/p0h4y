This summer was supposed to be a time to   to the Affordable Care Act and teach people how to sign up for benefits this fall But thats not whats happening Instead earlier this month the Obama administration decided to   most notably the requirement for larger employers to provide coverage or risk fines because they couldnt have reporting regulations ready in time for next years rollout Then this week the Republicanled House voted   for a year to match It was the th such vote against the law And now some are starting to worry that the White House is getting dangerously offmessage The administration tried to regroup Thursday It put President Obama front and center in the   surrounded by smiling beneficiaries of the parts of the Affordable Care Act already in effect Among those singled out those who have been on the receiving end of a somewhat obscure provision requiring insurance companies to pay   if the companies spend too much on administrative costs rather than medical expenses Dan Hart whos here from Chicago had read these rebates were happening said Obama But he didnt think anything of it until he got a check in the mail for  bucks This year an estimated  million Americans will get rebates thanks to the laws medical loss ratio rules Thats actually down from the   And Obama admitted that even those who are getting the checks dont necessarily associate them with the health law I bet if you took a poll most folks wouldnt know when that check comes in that this was because of Obamacare that they got this extra money in their pockets he said Which is a big part of the administrations messaging problem According to public opinion polls   But the law itself isnt Still And while the president is talking about a few million people getting refunds of  or  Republicans have been talking in much more expansive terms A governmentrun health care system is at its very basis a beginning of socialism in medicine and we oppose that said Rep Pete Sessions RTexas during the House floor debate Wednesday At his daily briefing Thursday White House spokesman Jay Carney derided Republicans continuing efforts to roll back the law Carney said the president is willing to make changes to the law as necessary But that is wholly different from this constant and now almost comical effort to spend most of the time in the House of Representatives hoping to repeal in some form or manner a bill that has been passed into law by both houses signed into law by the president and upheld as the law by the Supreme Court of the United States Still theres a major difference in the way Republicans   about the law and the way the president does says George Lakoff a professor of linguistics at the   and an expert on political messaging Lakoff says Republicans talk about the law as a moral issue Basically  they say that democracy is about liberty the liberty to pursue your own selfinterest without you having to take care of anybody elses interests or anybody else having to take care of yours But when Obama talks about the health law  at least this week says Lakoff  his message was all about money And Lakoff says thats pretty much been the presidents problem Hes mostly shied away from talking about health care on the same moral terms as have the Republicans But he could talk about it from the moral perspective of Democrats if he wanted to Lakoff says Health care is about life itself about living a decent life about living free from fear and also free from economic fear Fear of losing your home because you have to pay out of pocket for operations that really ought to be paid for by having health care insurance he said The administration however has   when it comes to its messaging about the health law Of course its been a lot easier for the Republicans Their message is pretty much one word No
