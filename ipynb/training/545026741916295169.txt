Ecigarettes can help smokers stop or reduce their habit a respected  has confirmed The first Cochrane review to examine the products considered two randomised trials with data from  current smokers The review authors from the UK and New Zealand said the results needed to be expanded on by other studies Public health doctors said they remained concerned that the devices could reverse progress on smoking The trial researchers found that about  of smokers who used ecigarettes were able to stop smoking for up to a year and possibly longer That compared with about  of smokers who used devices which did not contain nicotine And in the two trials  regarded as gold standard evidence   of ecigarette users managed to halve the number of conventional cigarettes they smoked compared with  who used placebo devices There was no evidence of serious adverse effects among people using ecigarettes However the Cochrane review authors cautioned that the results were limited by the small number of trials and the limited sample of participants  On some ecigarettes inhalation activates the batterypowered   Other types are manually switched on  A   inside the atomiser heats liquid nicotine contained in a cartridge  Liquid nicotine becomes   and is inhaled The smoke produced is largely water vapour Many ecigarettes have an LED light as a cosmetic feature to simulate traditional cigarette glow One of the review authors Prof Peter Hajek from Queen Mary University of London said Although our confidence is limited because of the small number of trials the results are encouraging  Both trials used ecigarettes with low nicotine delivery and it is likely that more recent products are more effective Several ongoing studies will help to answer the question more fully The review was welcomed by the antismoking health charity Action on Smoking and Health Ash which described the results as timely  But the UKs Faculty of Public Health vicepresident Dr John Middleton said Our position remains that while ecigarettes may help smokers who want to quit we dont yet have enough evidence of the impact they are having on other people It has taken decades of sustained effort to create a society in the UK where smoking is now not seen as the norm  Our concern is that ecigarettes could reverse this and create a new generation of customers for the tobacco industry
