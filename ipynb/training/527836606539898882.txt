Public health types are getting increasingly annoyed with people freaking out about Ebola in the United States from governors to the general public Its easy to see why when I heard a swim coach was getting questions from parents worried that their children might get Ebola from the pool water it was hard not to cue the eye roll On the other hand I suspect Im not the only person whose husband asked her to buy chlorine bleach and gloves the next time I went to the store Fear of the new unknown and deadly is normal its what prompts us to act to protect ourselves The question is how do we get from misplaced fears like Ebola in the swimming pool to the right kind of worry To find out I called up   a crisis communication consultant whos been working on how people and government officials respond to disease outbreaks for decades including SARS and HN flu Its certainly true in my judgment that the longterm risk to Americans isnt in the high school swimming pool It isnt in New York City and it isnt in Dallas and it isnt the debate about whether we quarantine or isolate or selfmonitor or actively monitor returning volunteers Its not any of that Its in whether we can get some control over whats going on in West Africa whether we can get the epidemic under control And its in whether if we cant get it under control or until we get it under control a lot of sparks fly and ignite epidemics in other parts of the world There are lots of reasons to think that the United States can put out those sparks But putting out the spark in Dallas was harder than we thought Its not easy its not cheap its not painfree but if we have  Ebola cases a month we can do it But if India has  a month Nigeria has  a month very few people feel they can do it If the epidemic in West Africa continues its hard to imagine that it isnt going to spread And many of the places it would spread to have healthcare systems that wont be able to cope Its one thing to argue that we should close the border to travelers from West Africa But imagine trying to stop people coming in from India Or worse yet imagine trying to stop stuff coming in from India Imagine India in chaos and what that would do to the United States Now imagine Mexico in chaos Thats what people should be worried about Sandman gets more deeply into pandemic Ebola risks in this   When people are coming to terms with a new worry its very normal to worry about the wrong things for a while You personalize it you localize it you imagine its happening here rather than there and now rather than later and to you directly Id like to see Americans shifting their focus from the risk thats small to the risk thats huge but thinking the small risk is huge isnt a stupid place to start The people who are trying to say stop worrying about Ebola in New York stop worrying about Ebola at Newark airport what theyre trying to do is lose the teachable moment If they succeed in getting people to stop worrying they will regret it because theres a lot to worry about it Calming us down shouldnt be a goal It would be different if people were panicking in the street But the evidence doesnt say that people are unreasonably dangerously upset Theyre sometimes worried about the right things more than the experts are I think its reasonable that when people read that the CDC and WHO say Ebola is characterized by a sudden onset of symptoms to think doesnt that mean you could be fine at  oclock and vomiting in the subway at noon Then I think you should stay home Whats irrational about that So what youve got are people who are climbing the learning curve and in some cases learning more quickly than officials  learning that you probably cant get it from someone who doesnt have symptoms but also leaning that the people who told you that have made some mistakes The public health people are getting it wrong and framing it disingenuously Theres certainly a case to be made that quarantine is excessive that active monitoring would be good enough But it seems to me to be a pretty open debate on whether quarantine is excessive or appropriate and it depends on how cautious you want to be Saying that the science proves incontrovertibly that quarantine is wrong  its bad communication and its bad science The CDC is desperately trying to recruit people to go to West Africa Nobody asks the obvious question  if youre worried that quarantine is going to hurt recruitment arent you biased when you say quarantine isnt necessary Thats a fair question If a friend said I buy your argument about sparks and Id like to make a contribution heres what Id tell them Help put pressure on the government to push harder on vaccine research Theyre pushing much harder than they were but its way smaller than the Manhattan Project Get them going on virus time rather than project time A second thing I would be urging my friend to is think about is whether you can make a personal contribution or urge a government contribution in the direction of spark suppression If the thing that endangers the us most is a dozen epidemics in countries around the developing world then if you want to volunteer volunteer to make that less likely If you want to contribute money find an organization that wants to do that Tell the CDC that you dont want  CDC experts in New York you want  CDC experts in Nigeria to help get ready to put out the next spark and the one after that and the one after that You have reason to worry that your daily life a year or two from now could be significantly worse if Ebola is all over the world And you have reason to work to prevent that and reason to prepare for it But what should you do in your daily life now to protect yourself against catching Ebola assuming youre not a healthcare worker with an Ebola patient Absolutely nothing The risk to the US isnt now its down the road
