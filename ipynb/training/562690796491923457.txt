Health disparities in the US lead to hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths each year according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention If all Americans had equal access to the best preventive care currently available somewhere in the country roughly  to  of premature deaths from the five leading causes of death could be avoided CDC researchers calculated Every year about  Americans under the age of  die as a result of heart disease cancer chronic lower respiratory diseases stroke and accidents government data show But many of them didnt have to To figure out how many people fit into that category the researchers calculated the mortality rates for each of those five causes of death in each of the  states plus the District of Columbia Then they looked for the three states with the lowest rates in each category and averaged them That average was used as the bestcase scenario Next the researchers applied those ideal mortality rates to each state and calculated how many people under the age of  would have died of heart disease cancer respiratory diseases stroke and accidents The difference between the ideal and actual mortality rates represented deaths that could have been prevented the researchers said The analysis was restricted to people under the age of  because the actual life expectancy in the US is about  the researchers said When they were done crunching the numbers they found that  Americans die unnecessarily of heart disease each year Another  die prematurely of cancer  die early because of chronic lower respiratory diseases  are killed by preventable strokes and  die as a result of unnecessary accidents Put another way if all of the states had mortality rates as low as they are in the ideal states about  of heart disease deaths  of cancer deaths  of respiratory disease deaths  of stroke deaths and  of deaths due to accidents could be avoided To make that happen Americans need to exercise more eat better lose weight quit smoking use sunscreen and wear seat belts in cars and helmets when riding bicycles or motorcycles They also need to work with their doctors to reduce their cholesterol control their blood pressure and keep their Type  diabetes in check among other things the researchers advised The researchers said there was no way to estimate the overall number of Americans who die prematurely from those five causes of death A person who avoids death from heart disease might then be exposed to a higher risk for dying from injury or cancer they wrote But better prevention would surely save lives overall they said In  these five leading causes of death accounted for  of all deaths in the US For the sake of comparison the next five leading causes accounted for only  of total deaths The   were published Thursday in the CDCs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report    and like   on Facebook
