When Staci Freeman and her sister Jami Valentine first took in a child ravaged by war in Afghanistan last year Arefa was a yearold in Hello Kitty shoes who quickly turned the daily routine of changing her head bandages into a counting game When Arefa arrived in Los Angeles from central Afghanistan three years after being injured Freeman says thirddegree burns mapped her body and her head was an open bleeding wound When she came she came crying and in pain and her head hurt Freeman says For months Freeman and Valentine bore witness to her pain sat vigil after surgeries and held her through both silent and excruciating screams When Arefa had healed to the point where she could return to Afghanistan the sisters hoped  they would see her again I think anytime I saw something with Afghanistan and especially that had to do with kids I just immediately  would think of her Id just picture her little face and think I pray its not her I pray its not her family  The child they had grown to love left her fingerprints behind on everything along with her drawings an errant sock and the stuffed animals that couldnt fit into her suitcase The sisters kept them all for her in a large box in the living room This summer they were back on the furniture for Arefas return Valentine says the child who returned this year had not only grown a few inches taller Theres been a much more goofy side she says Shes been very wiggly and dancey and just funny and laughing a lot So I feel she came back a different little girl for sure Arefa was just  when she was badly burned after a rocketpropelled improvised explosive device engulfed her familys tent in flames When US doctors saw her they said it was a miracle she had survived the years following the attack Today her most serious physical wounds are healed but her emotional ones still glow in the dark Its only at night that I remember  this glimpse I have of what her life is like at home and ongoing Valentine says She talks of being scared at night of hearing helicopters of waking up her dad of crying  all of these things So night is a time I kinda remember this is a little girl who has walked through some hard times and is continuing to walk through hard and scary times Arefa still needs another surgery Scar tissue prevents her from closing her eyes when she sleeps Arefa along with other children from Afghanistan was brought here for medical assistance by the nonprofit Solace for the Children As the planned US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan looms Valentine says it is becoming more difficult for the humanitarian organization to do its work As things get worse its getting harder and harder for us to get visas for the kids I just want to make sure that if I send her back that she is in a spot where she can live a healthy life Valentine says Because apart from everything else I realize theres a very real chance that it just wont work for her to come again with everything going on in our world The sisters knew this visit would be a shorter stay and Arefas departure day arrived all too quickly With her flight from Los Angeles International Airport leaving in three hours Arefa sat atop a bright pink carryon clutching a stuffed dolphin she named Flower Weve been saying goodbye for about a solid week now Valentine says And I talk about being sad and she talks about being sad At  minutes until departure Arefas host mothers are trying not to think about returning to their quiet apartment Arefa likes to write notes Freeman says so I think inevitably well probably be finding Postit Notes and different things around the house with her little scribbling with her name on it When the boarding passes are finally issued Arefa jumps into Valentines arms then Freemans These goodbyes are whispered When tears start to roll down Arefas face she buries her head in Jamis arms One of Arefas favorite things to do is to run along the beach or in the park So maybe thats why when Arefa grabbed the handle of her suitcase and looked back over her shoulder the sisters smiled waved and told her Run Run fast This time she didnt look back
