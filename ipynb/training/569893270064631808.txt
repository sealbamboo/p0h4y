Amanda Greene relies on lidocaine patches to help manage the chronic pain that her Lupus causes The anesthetic is available as a generic drug typically sold at a substantially lower price But this year the yearold Culver City resident says shes seen the patches nearly double in price Instead of  for a day prescription she now pays closer to  I asked if the box changed Did I get more patches The pharmacist said no Greene says To save money she uses the medication sparingly When Im lying here in pain I ask myself Is it patchworthy Generic drugs are chemically identical to their brandname counterparts and just as effective They usually become available after a brandname drug loses its patent and generic drug makers enter the market These medications have saved our society billions of dollars says Michael Kleinrock director of the healthcare research firm IMS Institute for Health Informatics In fact according to the Congressional Budget Office generic drugs save consumers an estimated  billion to  billion a year at retail pharmacies Today  of prescription drugs are generic according to a recent report by Kleinrocks organization Whats more the average outofpocket costs paid by consumers for generics are below  Though the vast majority of Americans are taking lowcost generic medications Kleinrock says it would be a mistake to assume all generics are inexpensive There are a number of products produced by a small number of companies and as a result when faced with market demands the price goes up he says For some patients the effect can be a dramatic change in the cost of their medicine The reasons for drug price increases are varied experts say Manufacturing delays and increased demand for a drug are two common causes and are the likely reason Greene has seen the price of her lidocaine patches double this year According to the FDA lidocaine is one of a number of drugs currently in short supply Other market forces can also cause prices to surge For example once a drugs patent has expired and its manufactured in generic form the price can become so low that it no longer pays for some manufacturers to continue making it At some point a drop in price goes too far for some companies to remain in the market Kleinrock says That reduces competition and manufacturers often respond by raising prices Perhaps the biggest effect on consumers outofpocket costs for prescription drugs  whether generic or brand name  is the type of insurance coverage they have If the drug you need is no longer covered by your health plan for example your costs will soar In addition many people are now paying higher outofpocket costs for their medical care including prescription drugs Today  of those with workbased insurance have a highdeductible plan meaning they pay the full cost of their healthcare until they reach a certain dollar amount According to the IMS Institute report average deductibles are up more than  from five years ago Today nearly  in  health plans come with a deductible more than half of which are  or more Whether youre on the hook for generic medications or for highcost specialty drugs there are ways to save money on prescriptions   A  report by Consumer Reports found that the cost of the generic version of five commonly prescribed medications including the blood thinner Plavix and Actos to treat diabetes varied as much as  between the highest and lowest prices for the same medication Most people have no idea prices for the same drug vary so just looking around is the first step says Doug Hirsch chief executive of GoodRX a website that tracks drug pricing and helps consumers find the best price Hirsch points out that even if your health insurance covers your medication its a mistake to assume your copay gives you the lowest price possible For example chain stores such as Target and Walmart sell  generic drugs Also be aware that prices vary even within the same pharmacy chain The same store two miles down the road may sell the medication for less   Always ask if there is a generic available says Michael Holmes president of RX Outreach Inc a Maryland Heights Mo mailorder pharmacy that helps people pay for prescription drugs A namebrand medication can cost  times what generics cost he says   Ordering a higher dose of scored pills that can be split in half can yield significant savings For example a search on the GoodRX website shows a day prescription for  milligrams of the cholesterollowering drug Lipitor costs  when purchased at a Southern California Target pharmacy The same pharmacy sells a day supply of milligram pills  twice the amount of the first prescription  for  And thats before I split it in half so that means its  for the same drug Hirsch says I just went from  to    Drug discount cards reduce the cost of medications at pharmacies all across the country Again costs vary and not every card works for every drug Discounts can be as high as  of a medications price and average about  according to Dr Richard Sagall president of NeedyMedsorg a national nonprofit group that provides information on programs to help people afford their drugs Sagall says these cards are a good way to save but he suggests avoiding any discount card that charges a fee Also discounts shift quickly What works this month may not give you the most savings next month Sagall says Generally you

increased drug costs says shes worried about prices continuing to rise Our drug costs have gone up but theres no costofliving raise with chronic disease
