President Obama affirmed Tuesday that theres evidence Syrians have been attacked with chemical weapons  in particular nerve gas But thats not the same as proof positive We dont know how they were used when they were used who used them Obama   We dont have a chain of custody that establishes what exactly happened Proving that someone has violated the   on chemical weapons can be very hard While governments seek more evidence Syrians may be in danger Thats why a physicians organization is trying to help medical workers in Syria recognize the signs of a chemical attack The effort is meant to save lives but it could also generate evidence that governments are seeking Physicians for Human Rights is   a network to get fact sheets about chemical weapons into the hands of Syrian physicians This group has a long record of working with medical professionals in trouble spots to protect civilians and reveal war crimes The fact sheets list the symptoms of exposure to mustard gas or   like sarin and VX They explain how to treat people and how doctors can avoid being contaminated themselves Getting this information to Syrians is also important to rule out false alarms says   who directs PHR There are times when symptoms may look to doctors as if they were caused by chemical warfare agents she says They might mistake other kinds of injuries or harms in a hot conflict with chemical warfare agents False alarms could cause panic or as happened in Iraq lead the US military to take action based on inaccurate claims about weapons of mass destruction The fact sheets also explain how to take samples of blood urine and hair from patients and preserve them as evidence Obviously if these weapons are being used have been used or might be used soon its in everyones interest that this be known and that they be identified Sirkin says That sample analysis would likely be done outside Syria Toxicologist   from the University of Leeds says nerve agents leave a trail in the body They attack a crucial enzyme that normally works like an onoff switch between nerves and muscles A nerve gas eliminates the off signal Basically its on on on on on all the time Hay who also works with PHR says So you then get a whole range of effects  Its absolutely dreadful Things like terrible headaches sweating seizures and respiratory failure which can lead to death But other ailments  like pesticide exposure  produce similar symptoms that can be mistaken for nerve gas exposure So the gold standard of proof for nerve gas Hay says is tracking down the agent itself in tissue samples The chemical nerve agent will be attached to the enzyme Hay says It physically inactivates the enzyme and remains attached to it You can track down and isolate that nerve agent even weeks after a person is exposed he says Physical samples of nerve agent in soil are harder to get because nerve gas evaporates quickly But Hay and PHR succeeded in doing that in  They brought back soil and a contaminated piece of a bomb from northern Iraq confirming that Saddam Husseins forces   But getting samples is just the start Hay notes To make a legal case whether its against the Syrian government or opposition group  you need an ironclad chain of custody You need to be able to have somebody swear if you like that the material was in their custody at all times whoever it is with before it gets to a laboratory Hay says
