As part of Sierra Leones broader effort to contain the deadly Ebola virus the country opened a new ambulance dispatch center in September in the capital Freetown Along with a new Ebola hotline the center is considered an important step forward in the war on Ebola But on the centers second day of operation a series of errors put the life of an apparently healthy yearold boy at risk The dispatch center is situated in a meeting room at the Cline Town hospital just north of downtown Freetown Inside the room a group of men and women are huddled around a table full of laptops Safa Koruma a technician points at a message on a screen It describes a possible Ebola patient reported through the hotline with the words vomiting and very pale Koruma forwards this message  along with hundreds of others  to the nearest health official A community health worker is then supposed to evaluate the patient and assess the likelihood of Ebola Probable Ebola cases end up on a large whiteboard on the other side of the meeting room Its the master list for ambulance pickups Victoria Parkinson of the   is one of the directors of the center She points at a name on the board with the number five written next to it indicating the number of cohabiting family members We want to get that person quickly because theres many people in the home that could be infected by she says One of Parkinsons colleagues Ama Deepkabos writes down an address and hands it to an ambulance driver Its  Hannah Street  Junction Do you understand she says imitating the local Krio accent Go directly to the patient No other stops The driver nods and hustles out to the dirt parking lot along with a nurse I attempt to speak with the driver and nurse but neither speaks good English They step into a white Toyota SUV with the word Ambulance in large red letters and pull out of the parking lot Sierra Leone is in the midst of a   intended to slow the spread of Ebola so the roads are clear The ambulance speeds across town and is waved through multiple police checkpoints After two wrong turns and several stops for directions it eventually bounces down a long dirt road in Waterloo a rural suburb  miles southeast of Freetown The driver and nurse spot the person they believe to be the patient a yearold boy in a blue Tshirt slouched on a white lawn chair They get out and put on glimmering white protective suits surgical masks and rubber gloves They walk over and escort the boy who is able to walk on his own into the back of the ambulance without touching him They kick the door closed behind him The boys guardian Suleiman Espangura is the principal of a nearby high school He recently took the boy Ngaima into his custody because his family was moving to a rural part of Sierra Leone and Ngaima wanted to stay at his current high school near Freetown He likes to play football Espangura says of the boy And hes very clever We teachers like children who are clever Espangura says hes unclear why Ngaima is being taken away in an Ebola ambulance He says the boy doesnt have any signs of Ebola  no fever no vomiting no diarrhea He just has a headache and a slight loss of appetite But because Espangura had heard multiple public service announcements encouraging people to report any signs of illness he contacted a health official and was told a community health worker would come to evaluate Ngaima Instead an Ebola ambulance showed up Espangura says the ambulance driver and nurse asked him if Ngaima was the patient Espangura said yes thinking the men were here to evaluate him Instead they ushered the boy into the ambulance and whisked him away The ambulance rushes across town to a military hospital with an Ebola isolation unit set up outside  a series of white plastic tents with a blue tarp stretched around the perimeter The hospital guards in military fatigues tell the ambulance driver and nurse that Ngaima is not on their list of expected patients A heated argument ensues The driver insists that he is merely following instructions and that this is the correct patient One of the guards eventually calls the head of the hospital who consents to admitting Ngaima The driver and nurse spray the back of the ambulance with chlorine and open the door to let him out Ngaima steps out of the vehicle and disappears behind the blue tarp fence into the Ebola ward A few minutes later another Ebola ambulance arrives The military guards are expecting this patient But they say the beds beds are now completely full  Ngaima has taken the last one The new patient is admitted anyway Its not clear exactly what went wrong here But now a yearold boy with a headache is sitting inside an Ebola isolation center
