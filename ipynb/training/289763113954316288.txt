Drugmaker Merck just stuck a fork in a vitaminbased drug to prevent heart disease and stroke The company is   a longacting pill combining niacin No  in the long list of B vitamins and   a chemical that reduces the unpleasant skin flushing caused by high doses of niacin Tredaptive was never approved in the US  the Food and Drug Administration   under another name in  But now Merck is taking the medicine off the market in  countries where it has been sold The company also told doctors to stop prescribing it Merck said in December that a   the drug didnt work Whats more people taking it had more serious side effects than those who got a placebo People in both groups also got simvastatin sold under the brandname Zocor to lower their bad cholesterol or LDL Tredaptive seemed like a great idea  on paper Niacin is one of the few ways to boost good cholesterol or HDL People whose HDL is too low are at a higher risk of having heart attacks and strokes even when their LDL is right where it ought to be Many people who take niacin for this reason cant tolerate it though So a drug that had the good effects of niacin without the discomfort looked appealing The failure of Tredaptive has cast a pall on the whole idea that raising HDL with a drug can help patients avoid heart attacks and strokes Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Steven Nissen   that he wasnt willing to ditch the idea that boosting HDL would reduce heart disease Nevertheless he said then the failure of Tredaptive represented a serious blow to the theory Mercks withdrawal of the drug wont put a dent in the fortunes of the company Global sales amounted to a puny  million for the three quarters that ended last September
