In his new memoir former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates heaped scorn on many members of Congress for pushing their parochial interests with him But he saved a special dig for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid With two ongoing wars and all our budget and other issues I didnt know whether to laugh or cry Gates writes describing how the Nevada Democrat urged him to have the Defense Department invest in research into irritable bowel syndrome Its an anecdote that drew snickers  and media attention including here at NPR But was Reids appeal to Gates really as absurd as portrayed Not according to doctors who treat Gulf War veterans and researchers like those affiliated with the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine They identify irritable bowel syndrome IBS which is marked by chronic cramping bloating and diarrhea as one of a range of illnesses that plague returning military women and men If you look at the veterans coming home and what proportion of them are becoming disabled by chronic conditions you will see that this is not something to ignore but something to treat says Dr Douglas Drossman an internationally recognized expert in gastrointestinal disorders There is a bill in Congress that would provide for research on this and I think thats why Sen Reid came up with that request Drossman says Reids office declined to comment But its worth noting that the  trillion omnibus spending bill currently being considered by Congress includes close to a billion dollars in medical research funding for the Defense Department Drossman served on an Institute of Medicine committee that in  determined that in addition to posttraumatic stress syndrome a large number of veterans of the  Persian Gulf War were reporting longterm multisymptom health issues They included IBS substance abuse anxiety and depression Evidence included in the report   showed a relationship between military deployment and gastrointestinal infections and subsequently postinfectious IBS That  study involved veterans of the  war ongoing studies of more recent returning veterans suggest that IBS and other multisymptom health issues continue to plague that population The Department of Veterans Affairs has determined that IBS is a disorder that can be classified as a disability if related to military service even though the exact cause of the syndrome is difficult to pinpoint says Dr   a University of Michigan medical school professor and expert in gastroenterology including IBS The link between being a veteran and having a higher risk of IBS is unclear says Schoenfeld partly because the underlying cause is unclear We dont know why all of a sudden those muscles in the colon dont work properly he says Stress may exacerbate symptoms by inducing chemical and hormonal changes female veterans suffering from PTSD are much more likely to have IBS than female veterans who dont have PTSD says Schoenfeld who heads the gastroenterology division at a VA hospital in Ann Arbor Treatment ranges from antidiarrheal medication to antidepression agents used to mitigate pain and the brains reaction to it he says Congress in  asked the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences to undertake a comprehensive review of best treatments for chronic multisymptom illnesses or CMI faced by Gulf War veterans  the Institute of Medicine committee confirmed that theres no consensus on the cause of CMI including irritable bowel syndrome and a growing belief that no specific causal factor or agent will be identified Stress and crowded war theater conditions that may exacerbate the spreading of infections have been suggested as triggers for IBS But researchers found that preliminary data suggest that CMI is occurring in veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the thousands reporting post war symptoms Diet lifestyle medication psychotherapy and hypnosis as well as relaxation and stress management techniques are treatments recommended to varying degrees Irritable bowel syndrome is a disorder that really compromises the daily lives of veterans Schoenfeld says But he says he understands Gates position given the issues on his desk and other more traumatic injuries suffered by veterans Its tough to put a value on what disorders need more research Schoenfeld says But IBS should not be dismissed as a minor ailment that doesnt have any impact on peoples lives
