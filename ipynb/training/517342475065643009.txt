Why did the superhero go to the toilet Because it was her duty Raya exclaims as she throws her head back laughing Sixyearold Raya is not shy at all  especially when it comes to talking about poop Thats because Raya is the sanitation Muppet Shes one of the newest additions to the Sesame Street family introduced back in March as part of the Sesame Workshops   campaign Shes got aqua green skin big pearl eyes and an orange button nose And her mission is to teach kids how to pee and poop in a sanitary manner Its a big job for a young Muppet Some  billion people do not have access to a toilet so they defecate in the open That can lead to diarrheal diseases which kill roughly   under  each year So Rayas job is to get people  both adults and kids  to talk openly about poop With her braided hair yellow   and sandals Raya is easy for youngsters to connect to She looks like a typical kid in South Asia and subSaharan Africa the regions most affected by sanitationrelated diseases She has appeared in public service announcements pamphlets books board games and posters across Bangladesh India and Nigeria  three places where open defecation is prevalent These are three very different countries but the core message of water sanitation and hygiene are universal says   who heads Sesame Workshops global health initiatives in subSaharan Africa He adds that in regions with low literacy rates cute Muppets like Raya are key Raya appeared in New York at last Saturdays   We caught up with her during a conference that preceded the concert Editors note The interview has been edited so it isnt too poopy Never I travel with my own soap and Ill sing a little song to myself as Im washing my hands I know here a lot of people use the alphabet and just sing ABCDEFG and while youre doing that you have to make sure you wash between the fingers and the tops of your hands and the bottoms of your hands and everything in between And you dont finish washing until you get to Z Lets face it we all got to go right So why make a taboo about it You should be able to just talk about it I use a toilet and Im proud of it And just call it what it is Where I come from a lot of kids poop out in the open because they dont have much of a choice   But I try to get people to use latrines because thats the safest thing to do And I always make sure too that they wear sandals on their feet when they go so that they dont get germs Im not entirely sure what you mean by sanitation but I do know that its important not to spread germs You know what germs are Germs are little tiny bugs  you cant even see them  but they can make you sick So I think it might have something to do with stopping the spread of germs and making sure that your drinking water and the water that you wash with are clean Does that sound right Ive never had a problem with it Im very proud of it in fact Because its the color of water as you may have gathered I feel very fortunate to get to do what I do and spread the good work about clean water Right outside the Metropolitan Museum they have these dancing fountains and they go   And then I run through them and its fun
