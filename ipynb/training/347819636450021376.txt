Thanks to an ingratiating new study we may finally be closer to answering that everpopular question regarding our health and fitness How little exercise can I get away with The answer it seems may be four minutes For the study which was   in the journal PLoS One researchers from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim Norway and other institutions attempted to delineate the minimum amount of exercise required to develop appreciable endurance and health gains They began by reconsidering their own past work which had examined the effects of a relatively large dose of highintensity intervals on various measures of health and fitness 
 For those unfamiliar with the term highintensity intervals are just that bursts of strenuous exercise lasting anywhere from  seconds to several minutes interspersed with periods of rest In recent years a wealth of studies has established that sessions of highintensity exercises can be as potent physiologically as much longer bouts of sustained endurance exercise In a   for instance Canadian researchers showed that  oneminute intervals  essentially  minutes of strenuous exercise braided with oneminute rest periods between  led to the same changes within muscle cells as about  minutes of moderate bike riding Similarly the Norwegian scientists for some years have been studying the effects of   performed at about  percent of each volunteers maximum heart rate and repeated four times with a threeminute rest between each interval The total meaningful exercise time in these sessions then is  minutes Which the researchers thought might just be too much One of the main reasons people give for not exercising is that they dont have time says Arnt Erik Tjonna a postdoctoral fellow at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology who led the study So he and his colleagues decided to slim down the regimen and determine whether a single strenuous fourminute workout would effectively improve health and fitness To do so they gathered  overweight and sedentary but otherwise healthy middleaged men determined their baseline endurance and cardiovascular and metabolic health and randomly assigned them to one of two groups Half began a supervised exercise program that reiterated the Norwegian researchers former routine After briefly warming up these volunteers ran on a treadmill at  percent of their maximal heart rate  a tiring pace says Dr Tjonna at which you cannot talk in full sentences but can use single words  for four fourminute intervals with three minutes of slow walking between followed by a brief cooldown The entire session was repeated three times a week for  weeks The second group however completed only one fourminute strenuous run They too exercised three times a week for  weeks At the end of the program the men had increased their maximal oxygen uptake or endurance capacity by an average of  percent or more with no significant differences in the gains between the two groups Metabolic and cardiovascular health likewise had improved in both groups with almost all of the men now displaying better blood sugar control and blood pressure profiles whether they had exercised vigorously for  minutes per session or four minutes per session and despite the fact that few of the men had lost much body fat This is not a weightloss program Dr Tjonna says It is instead he says a suggestion for how people can make a kickstart for better fitness or maintain fitness already gained when other obligations press on your time The results Dr Tjonna says persuasively suggest that getting in shape does not demand a big effort in terms of time That finding though inevitably raises the question of whether the bar could drop even lower Could for instance a mere two minutes of strenuous training effectively improve health and fitness Dr Tjonna the killjoy doubts it There are other groups of scientists looking at even shorter bouts of exercise he says but it seems like they dont get the same results regarding the maximal oxygen uptake as the fourminute sessions used in his experiment Since improved maximal oxygen uptake can reliably indicate better overall cardiovascular health he suspects that we need a certain length of the interval to trigger such health and fitness benefits Thankfully for those worried that a trip to the gym is an inefficient means of completing four minutes of exercise the workout can effectively be practiced anywhere Dr Tjonna says Sprint uphill for four minutes or race up multiple flights of steps Bicycle swim or even walk briskly as long as you raise your heart rate sufficiently for four minutes Obviously consult your doctor first if you havent been active in the past Everyone we think Dr Tjonna says has time for this kind of exercise three times a week Special thanks to the   and   for their contributions to the Well Minute Workout playlist
