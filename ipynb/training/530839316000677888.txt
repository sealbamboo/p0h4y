On Thursday we   of a yearold woman who lost her vision over the course of a few months More than  readers wrote in with their take on this terrifying case A couple of you nailed it but frankly this case was a superzebra  at least to me  The correct diagnosis is   While several readers correctly suggested that this was a paraneoplastic syndrome Dr Eileen Broomall a neurologist in Covington Ky was the first to properly identify this rare disorder by name Dr Broomall said she thought of these diseases because the progression of the blindness was so rapid and the eye and brain looked normal on MRI Thank you Dr Broomall
