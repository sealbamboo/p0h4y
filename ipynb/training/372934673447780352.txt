Desperate for rest in a frenzied world at least  million Americans take prescription sleeping pills to catch some Zzzs according to the first federal health study to focus on actual use Between  and  about  percent of US adults aged  and older popped popular prescription drugs such as Lunesta and Ambien in the previous month say government researchers who tracked  people to their homes and peered into their medicine cabinets About a quarter of those studied suffered sleep problems serious enough to report to their doctors said Yinong Chong an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention They told us they had difficulty getting to sleep or they were waking up and couldnt get back to sleep said Chong whose study is based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  The report provides the latest evidence that a good nights sleep is becoming more elusive In  market research from Thomson Reuters found that sleeping pill prescriptions had tripled among people younger than  The new study offers the first look at how many people are actually taking them Chong said Overall between  million and  million Americans suffer from sleep disorders or sleep deprivation according to the Institute of Medicine which advises public policy Adults typically need between seven and nine hours of sleep a night but more than a third of adults get less according to the CDC In the new report sleeping pill use started climbing among people in their s and s with at least  percent resorting to the drugs It was highest among those with more education  and among women with  percent reporting taking the pills compared with  percent of men the authors found That may reflect the strain of modern life with people particularly women trying to juggle the growing demands of work and family only to find it takes a toll on their sleep patterns said Dr Roneil Malkani an assistant professor of neurology at the Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago We know that insomnia is more prevalent among women than men he said I think that there are people who dont get enough sleep because they have responsibilities and jobs and expectations Just ask Chicago resident Yvonne Oby  a manager at a legal firm who started taking Ambien CR in  when sleep problems coincided with rampedup work demands  We were in the beginning of doing a merger to become international recalled Oby who found herself waking up at  am  and not being able to go back to sleep  I was at wits end I would have a long busy day ahead of me Im dealing with millions of dollars of billables she said Overall the new study found that sleeping pill use increased with age peaking at  percent in people older than  who often have chronic health problems that interfere with rest Chong said Researchers included use of hypnotic drugs and also antidepressants that have a sedative effect Use rose during the study period climbing from  percent in  to  percent in  before dropping again That uptick could reflect trouble sleeping during the worst part of the Great Recession Chong said The researchers are working on a larger study of trends over time and a study about how often people use sleep drugs but the data arent complete  About  million sleeping pills were prescribed in the US in  up from about  million in  according to IMS Health which tracks drug data  While the pills can provide solutions to sleep problems experts such as Malkani caution that there are risks The drugs are approved only for shortterm use even though some rely on them for months or years A  BMJ study found that people who took prescription sleeping pills were nearly five times as likely to die over  years as those who didnt  Even when its not so dire some people are allergic to the drugs while others report bizarre behaviors such as Ambienfueled sleepeating sleepdriving even sleep sex In January the US Food and Drug Administration cautioned that women should take lower initial doses of Ambien a brand name for zolpidem because of the risk that nextday grogginess could interfere with driving and other activities  Oby the Chicago legal manager said Ambien CR left her in a stupor Worse even when she didnt take the drug for days she could feel odd effects such as the day she imagined her car was running at dangerously high speeds on the expressway  I was praying to God and crying Help me find the exit she recalled It felt like I had no control She stopped taking the controlledrelease form of the drug on the advice of Dr Hrayr Attarian of the Northwestern sleep disorders center Instead Oby now relies on tools of cognitive behavioral therapy  a sleep log exercises to help calm her mind  plus a lowdose prescription of zolpidem a drug called Intermezzo which is formulated differently from Ambien and can help her sleep if she awakes in the middle of the night  I think that sleep therapy is a godsend she said  Anyone who suffers from sleep problems  whether its insomnia not getting back to sleep or daytime sleepiness  should seek medical help Malkani said  I think that the awareness of the importance of sleep is still growing he said Its important for people to get an adequate amount of sleep and to sleep well Its an investment for their function the next day
