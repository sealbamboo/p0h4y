Just the word Ebola can send shivers down the spine And no wonder Ebola is one of the   and there arent any approved treatments or vaccines for it Scientists have been experimenting with an Ebola   for the past few years but theyve been stymied Theres no easy way to test its effectiveness in people Immunologists at the Public Health Agency of Canada in Winnipeg have found a way to crack the problem Theyve discovered a molecule that predicts whether one kind of Ebola vaccine will work in monkeys  and the prediction appears quite good up to  percent accurate The findings just   in   could help move an Ebola vaccine into human tests Unlike HIV or the flu Ebola infections are rare and sporadic So researchers have been stuck testing the vaccine on animals What scientists have needed is a way to measure the shots potency without exposing people to the deadly virus Thats where   and his research team come in They gave  macaques an experimental Ebola vaccine either  days before or immediately after they infected the monkeys with the virus The scientists then carefully watched how the monkeys immune systems coped with the virus and the vaccine One response jumped out They saw a big increase in a specific antibody that appears to neutralize the virus Animals that survived the Ebola infection produced about  times more of the antibody on average than those who died And the antibody levels accurately predicted whether an animal could successfully fight off Ebola We can now predict protection against Ebola Kobinger tells Shots It is quite helpful for moving the vaccine to the clinic These results dont prove for sure that the antibodies are responsible for clearing out the virus Kobinger says But recent studies from his team and   demonstrate that these molecules can protect monkeys from Ebola even when given after an infection Thus scientists seem to be zeroing on the immune systems first line of defense against Ebola These antibodies stick to the viruss surface and they may help the immune system catch up with Ebola They buy time Or keep a lid on the virus until the full immune response comes up Kobinger says Fighting off Ebola is a complex process and you need every arm of the immune system to win the battle Kobinger says But he thinks these antibodies are the most critical artillery the immune system has against infection They seem to be responsible for about  percent of viral clearance while   contribute about  percent Now immunologists can start tweaking the vaccine to boost production of the antibodies But   an immunologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease warns that these antibodies might not be important for all types of Ebola vaccines She tells Shots the study supports the notion that for some genebased vaccines the antibodies are correlative of protection But she says we still have a fair way to go before we know how that relates exactly to fighting off Ebola
