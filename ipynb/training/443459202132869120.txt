MPs have voted through a controversial measure that gives Englands health secretary powers to close local hospitals even if they are performing well Clause  in the Care Bill allows a hospital to be closed or downgraded if a neighbouring trust is struggling financially The government maintains it is a good way to address local care issues But critics say the powers put finances ahead of patient care Clause  gives special administrators the power to make changes to neighbouring services while trying to rescue failing NHS trusts It was inserted into the bill after the High Court ruled last October that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had acted outside his powers when he decided the emergency and maternity units at Lewisham Hospital in southeast London should be cut back to save a neighbouring trust that was going bust  Queen Elizabeth Hospital Woolwich It means Trust Special Administrators who take over any failing NHS trusts in England can push through whatever other local changes they think are necessary although they will have to consult the public commissioners and staff A total of  MPs voted in favour of Clause  while  voted against it There have been several highprofile campaigns to save hospitals and services earmarked for closure in recent years including the Save Lewisham Hospital campaign Labour shadow health secretary Andy Burnham told MPs Clause  was dangerous and wrong  He said It creates an entirely new route for hospital reconfiguration   topdown financeled  It subverts the established process in the NHS which requires that any changes to hospitals should first and foremost be about saving lives rather than saving money and it puts management consultants not medical consultants or GPs in the driving seat Labour says more than  cashstrapped trusts could face closures But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said clause  would help drive forward changes to ensure patient safety when trusts were found to be failing A Department of Health spokesperson said the clause would only ever be used as a last resort Changes to the special administrator regime will ensure that patients get safe care and these powers have only ever been used in extremis twice since   It is a process of last resort when a hospital trust faces very serious financial or quality risks the spokesman said
