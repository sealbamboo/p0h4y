Lilys mother Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck died in the crash She was  years old How did her monthold survive One of the biggest factors was the car seat Lily was in the proper car seat for her age and the seat appears to have been properly attached Even though the child was trapped and upside down her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water Doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous but would be even more so if the baby were wet  Dry cold temperatures are more survivable than wet cold temperatures Ironically the cold might have actually helped Lily survive said Dr Barbara Walsh with the University of Massachusetts Medical School Shes going to have a lower heart rate Shes going to have a lower metabolism Shes going to need less sugar Walsh said Its almost like the body is sort of knowing that it needs to shut down to protect itself A variety of other factors were also likely at play We dont know what time the child was last fed when she drank Given that its wintertime and she was in her car seat she was probably wearing mittens a hat We tend to over bundle our children so the fact that she was dry she probably had on multiple layers because its winter and theres always a chance that she had just been sort of fed right before this happened probably all played a role Walsh said A final factor may have been that the girl as a toddler has baby fat  a little extra insulation If she had been an infant it might have been a different story Its amazing Children are very resilient and I think sometimes we dont realize how much they actually can withstand said Walsh
