There could be a role for CCTV in care homes the care minister has said after a BBC Panorama probe found residents of one being mistreated Norman Lamb said images shot undercover at the Old Deanery in Braintree Essex were absolutely disgusting They showed one resident being slapped and others taunted and roughly handled The home said it was shocked and saddened by the allegations which had involved a small number of staff One has been sacked and seven suspended Care Quality Commission figures seen by the BBC show that more than a third of care homes in England that received warning notices since  still do not meet basic standards More than  are still in place but some are related to issues including management and administrative processes such as recordkeeping  rather than care and staffing Allegations of mistreatment and poor care at the bed Old Deanery  one of the largest care homes in England  were initially raised by  whistleblowers in August  Essex County Council put it in special measures for three months until concerns were addressed But secret filming by Panoramas undercover reporter over  shifts found many of the same sorts of issues reported a year earlier including Last November while Panorama was undercover the home was inspected by the regulator and passed for the first time in  months When the CQC revisited this February after being told about Panoramas findings it found too few staff and some residents waiting an unacceptably long time for call bells to be answered Anglia Retirement Homes Ltd which runs the Old Deanery said the incidents involved a small number of staff and were not reflective of the high standards of care it demanded A statement said that as soon as the new management team was made aware of the allegations we took immediate action That included hiring an independent law firm to carry out a full investigation suspending eight staff who had not returned to work pending a full inquiry and dismissing the care worker responsible for slapping a resident Our priority remains the health and wellbeing of our residents and we have more than  dedicated members of staff who remain committed to the highest standards of care it added The company was taken over by new owners in November  Mr Lamb said the images filmed by Panorama turn your stomach and there was a case for considering the use of cameras in homes I think there is a real danger that if you think that you can create a good culture and compassionate care through CCTV you will fail completely he told BBC Radio  live But I think it is one of the weapons that the Care Quality Commission should consider using and indeed they are considering I think in specific cases where there are allegations or concerns about possible abuse or neglect then there could be a role for it Since   of Englands  care homes have been given warning notices by the Care Quality Commission and more than  are still in place BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said from this it would be easy to conclude that problems exist in just above  of homes  out of  and that in most cases the issues did not translate into the abuse found at the Old Deanery The CQC said it would work with the care sector to improve standards but it was determined to ensure problems were addressed Its new chief inspector of social care Andrea Sutcliffe said she was shocked and really angry about the poor care Panorama had found She said her heart goes out to those affected but also to the hundreds of thousands of good care workers who had been let down by the small minority People shouldnt be getting into this business if they dont care she said She said most care was good and the organisation would act on any concerns raised
