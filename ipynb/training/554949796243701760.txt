Prevention is the best medicine for your smile Although fillings crowns and professional whitening can make your teeth stronger and brighter its better and cheaper to avoid cavities and stains in the first place by brushing flossing andlast but not leasteating right As the following guide explains the food we eat can have a big impact on our teeth 
                   
                  Fortunately foods like candy that dont always play nice with our teeth are generally harmless in moderation Its when we excessively use one thing that it can become a problem says Matthew Messina an Ohiobased dentist and spokesman for the American Dental Association Citrus fruits and juicesa rich source of   and other nutrientsare good for you in many ways but not when it comes to your teeth Grapefruit and lemon juice in particular are highly acidic and can erode tooth enamel over time In a    that involved soaking pulled teeth in various citrus juices those two caused the most damage Orange juice caused the least 
                   
                  OJ is less acidic Messina points out and many storebought varieties are also fortified with teethfriendly calcium and vitamin D Fortified OJ is good for you on many levels he says Drink it but brush and floss as recommended The stickier the candy the worse it tends to be for your teeth Extrachewy candieslike taffy caramels or Jujyfruitsstick to and between teeth for a long time allowing the bacteria in our mouths to feast leisurely on the deposited sugar Bacteria burns sugar to make acid which dissolves the protective layer of tooth enamel and causes cavities Messina explains 
                   
                  Candies that are chewy sugary   acidica category that includes many sour varietiesdeliver a triple whammy of negatives Messina adds because they carry their own payload of erosive acid in addition to that produced by the interaction of sugar and bacteria Hard candies such as Jolly Ranchers dont cling to your teeth as readily as chewy candy but they have their own downside Unlike say chocolatebased sweets which are chewed quickly and wash away relatively easily hard candy dissolves slowly and saturates your mouth for several minutes at a time giving bacteria more time to produce harmful acid To make matters worse many varieties of hard candy are   
                   
                  Besides if you bite down wrong on some hard candies they can chip your teethsomething no amount of brushing or flossing can repair They dont call em jawbreakers for nothing Acid typically provided by vinegar is essential to the pickling process Its what gives pickles their sour salty tasteand its also what makes them a potential hazard to tooth enamel In one    that looked at the eating habits of English teenagers pickles were the solid food most closely linked with tooth wear Eating them more than once a day increased the odds of wear by about  
                   
                  Most of us dont eat pickles that often however and snacking on them every now and then isnt likely to noticeably affect your dental health Messina says Its no secret that drinking too many sugary sodas can breed cavities Whats less wellknown is that the acids found in carbonated soft drinks appear to harm teeth even more than the sugar The upshot Even sugarfree diet sodas like Diet Coke and Diet Pepsiwhich both contain citric and phosphoric acidcan erode enamel if consumed in large doses 
                   
                  If you cant do without soda your best bet is to drink it during a meal rather than sipping it throughout the day The food will help neutralize the acid Messina says and the time of exposure to the acid is much shorter If youre in the mood for something sweet or fizzy sports drinks and energy drinks may seem like a good alternative to soda But Gatorade or Red Bull wont do your teeth any favors either These beverages are acidic too and are potentially even more damaging to teeth 
                   
                  In a    researchers at the University of Iowa measured enamel wear after steeping teeth in several different beverages for  hours Lemonlime Gatorade resulted in the most wear followed by Red Bull Coke and Diet Coke Heres a rule of thumb Anything that will get you yelled at if you spill it on a white table cloth will also stain your teeth Messina says That means red wine which contains substances known as chromogens that produce toothdiscoloring pigments Whats more the   in red wine tend to dry out the mouth and make teeth sticky worsening stains 
                   
                  But even white wine can contribute to staining Reds and whites both contain erosive acid allowing stains from other foods or drinks to penetrate more deeply A    found that cows teeth soaked in black tea were more susceptible to staining if they were soaked in white wine versus water beforehand The refined carbohydrates found in saltines and many other types of crackers convert to sugar in the mouth very quickly providing fodder for cavityforming bacteria Crackers also become mushy when chewed turning into a pastelike goop that builds up in your molars and lodges between teeth 
                   
                  If you frequently binge on crackers you may have cause for concern but eating them in moderation isnt likely to cause any longterm problemsas long as you do a thorough job brushing and flossing Messina says Good oral hygiene will compensate for almost anything You know those stubborn brown stains that accumulate on the inside of a coffee mug Those give you some idea of how coffee drinking can stain your teeth over time Coffee stains appear to be even more persistent than tobacco stains in fact According to one   that compared the two types of stain coffeestained teeth were more resistant to toothbrushing and more likely to become discolored again following a bleach treatment 
                   
                  In addition to being unsightly teeth with heavy coffee stains tend to be sticky and apt to attract food particles and bacteria Messina says Tea may seem like coffees gentler kinder cousin but thats not necessarily the case when your teeth are involved Some black tea may even stain your teeth more than coffee Like red wine black teas tend to have a high tannin content which promotes staining 
                   
                  Not surprisingly teas that are less rich in tanninsgreen tea white tea and herbal teaarent as likely to discolor your teeth Herbal tea may have another drawback though In one   herbal tea was found to erode dental enamel substantially more than black tea did Now that you know which foods can stain or weaken your teeth its time to focus on those that can help prevent or even reverse this dental damage The good news is if you eat a healthy diet youre probably already getting plenty of them since many of the same foods that are good for our bodies in generallike vegetablesare also good for our teeth 
                    Sugarfree gum helps clean teeth by stimulating the production of saliva Saliva is natures way of washing away acids produced by the bacteria in your mouth and it also bathes the teeth in bonestrengthening calcium and phosphate In addition many varieties of sugarless gum are sweetened with xylitol an alcohol that reduces bacteria 
                   
                  You might want to stick with mint flavors however One    suggests that the acid used to create certain fruit flavors could damage teeth though only slightly Anything we taste as sour is more acidic but were getting so much good out of the saliva flow I could live with that Messina says Water like saliva helps wash sugars and acid off teeth It also contains fluoride a mineral that protects against tooth erosion and is found in toothpaste and some mouthwashes 
                   
                  Fluoride occurs naturally in water including some   and most tap water in the United States is also fortified with it 
                    Milk and other dairy products are the primary dietary source of calcium which is essential for healthy teeth Calcium is the key ingredient in a mineral known as hydroxyapatite that strengthens tooth enamel as well as bones Teeth arent bones technically but they share some of the same properties 
                   
                  Dairy productsespecially cheesealso contain casein a type of protein Research   that caseins along with calcium play an important role in stabilizing and repairing tooth enamel Leafy vegetables and other   promote good digestion and healthy cholesterol levels and they also do wonders for your teethmostly because they require a lot of chewing 
                   
                  Eating a bowl of spinach or beans is a bit like running your teeth through a car wash All that chewing generates saliva and the food itself physically scrubs your teeth as its mashed up into little pieces Its the MilkBone dog biscuit benefit Messina says These summer berries contain malic acid a natural enamel whitener Heres how to make your own   Crush a strawberry to a pulp mix it with baking soda and spread it on your teeth using a soft toothbrush Five minutes later brush it off rinse and voila a whiter smile Be sure to floss though as tiny strawberry seeds can easily get trapped between your teeth
