Scientists in Oregon have achieved something that many thought might be impossible They  Wednesday that they have cloned human embryos and then harvested the embryos stem cells The discovery if it holds up means scientists would be able to make personalized stem cells with their genetic code almost perfectly matched to that of a patient One day designer cells like these could help to treat an array of diseases like diabetes Parkinsons and heart problems So how did the scientists do it Specifically they used a method called   Despite its complex name the technique is pretty simple Take an egg donated by a woman and pull out its DNA Then insert DNA from a patients skin cell into the empty egg As the embryo develops it makes stem cells that the scientists can collect and grow in the lab The technique dates back to the s when John Gurdon at Oxford University cloned a frog using just one cell from a tadpoles gut He eventually   a Nobel Prize for that experiment Then in  a team in Scotland used a similar method to clone the first mammal a sheep named   This discovery triggered a rash of clonings  rabbits horses cows goats and of course cats and dogs But getting the technique to work with humans eggs has been an exercise in frustration For more than a decade researchers have been tripped up at the same point After they drop the new DNA into a human egg it divides a few times and then it gets stuck It stops growing But   and his team at Oregon Health  Science University figured out how to keep the embryo dividing until it creates stem cells Mitalipov says they had to trick the egg into thinking its been fertilized by a sperm Even if you transplant the skin cell inside the egg the egg still needs some kind of signaling  usually its delivered by the sperm The magic signal is quite complex It includes an electric shock a cocktail of chemicals and a splash of caffeine Really Adding a little caffeine to the embryos food helps it grow and make stem cells Mitalipov and his team then harvested the caffeinecharged cells and demonstrated that they could be transformed into a variety of cell types including heart cells that beat inside a petri dish The process is efficient enough Mitalipov says that he can get stem cells from each women who donates five to  eggs
