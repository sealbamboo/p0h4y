That narrower network comes as particularly bad news for the residents of Concord New Hampshire   Concords one hospital wont accept any policies offered by the marketplaces To see a doctor specialist or primary care provider affiliated with the hospital patients on these Obamacare plans will have to pay out of their own pocket The closest innetwork hospital is in Manchester Can you imagine having to go  miles away to Manchester to get access to a health care provider that is covered by your insurance Harte asked Right now Concord is one big black hole of health care for people buying these plans And its not just Concord Nationally consumers are learning a number of wellknown hospitals wont accept insurance offered through the marketplaces   In New York  will accept only a minority of the plans In Los Angeles medical centers will accept a couple In Atlanta   has limited the number of plans it will take Academic medical centers are often pricier because they tackle the more complex cases  WellPoint a Blue Cross Blue Shield insurer offering policies in  states is narrowing its networks in many markets after research showed consumers care more about the price than the provider   A survey done by  found that  of those surveyed considered the cost of the policy the most important factor when they pick a health insurance plan  But the picture isnt all bleak  Some coverage is better than no coverage said   an economist and professor of health policy at Johns Hopkins University Davis gives the ACA marketplaces high marks overall since it is a lot easier to compare plans in these marketplaces than when consumers were buying insurance on their own With the standardized essential benefits offered by all plans you can be a little bit more assured that Plan A and Plan B will provide decent coverage  Were going to get better benefits in this market said   an economist at MIT who was an architect on both the Massachusetts and US health plans  Right now in this insurance market not only is it discriminatory but the typical person with an individualpayer plan has a very weak insurance plan  Its not real insurance Were going to get rid of that  everyone will have guaranteed real insurance In the case of   the CEO and president   to the local newspaper explaining that his hospital wasnt opting out of Obamacare as a political statement Instead Michael B Green blamed Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield the state exchanges only provider for being unwilling to negotiate sustainable contract terms The hospital he wrote would be paid less than what it costs us to provide care and said his advisers told him the facility should be cautious about committing to rates that could be detrimental to ones organization Concord is not the only New Hampshire city with a limited network of providers Portsmouths hospital isnt taking the insurance either And only one of the two major hospitals in Nashua is innetwork according to Harte   Thats a big frustration to my clients who heard their President promise that if you like your doctor you can keep them Harte said Sure you can keep them if you pay cash for their services But if you want your new insurance to cover that doctor visit forget it Youre going to have to switch In selling his health care plan to the nation President Barack Obama did offer a   that if youve got a doctor that you like you will be able to keep your doctor The HealthCaregov site is more specific in its section   It explains Depending on the plan you choose in the Marketplace you may be able to keep your current doctor Different plans have different networks and providers May of course differs from a guarantee Across the board the networks and the PPOs preferred provider organizations are significantly narrower than people are used to said   a senior policy adviser dealing with health policies for Californias Bay Area Council a businesssponsored public policy advocacy group  Narrower networks is one way to keep costs of these policies down Some of the networks may be too thin at least for now anyway  Provisions in the health care reform law say there has to be an adequate number of providers offered in these insurance networks It still remains to be seen if that happens said Davis of John Hopkins In principle you couldnt exclude all obstetricians for instance That plan would not be considered adequate  As the marketplaces are around longer more providers may opt into the system according to   head of the Medical Group Management Association a trade group that represents multiple physician medical practices  of its members in September found that more than  were still deciding if they were going to accept the insurance offered through the ACA marketplaces Many of the practices are still struggling to know what it means for them Turney said The association suggests that people who already have a doctor call to see if they will accept a particular policy We know a number of our members have trained their staff to answer those kinds of questions If someone doesnt have a doctor online resources can help with selecting one  While providers are limited with these plans in the long run Davis said she believes its actually a good thing to reward higher quality lower cost providers as that could ultimately cut the cost of health care as the reform legislation intended
