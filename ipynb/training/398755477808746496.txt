 Sheila Solomon Klass died on March   She was   I am a legally blind octogenarian  I have wonderful adult children who often help me but I can never accept their help gracefully  It is a terrible thing to be a burden They say I am not but I know better Perhaps many of you have parents like me My own parents working class Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn were ordinary people trying hard but beset by the Depression and bad luck And I was their burden a second daughter when they needed a son My parents were survivors and their fears were real and I do not mean to belittle them But they left me with a lifelong fear and loathing of dependence   One day while playing kickthecan on the street a boy knocked the sharp edge of the open lid right into my knee  My weeping mother carried me to the doctor who sewed it up for fifty cents and for years afterwards my mother upbraided me for playing rough boys games and costing so much money I was determined never again to be a burden  Now I am   and almost blind  I cannot read the bills that come in the mail nor sign my own checks  I must be escorted to medical appointments  My busy children are kind beyond measure but I am uncomfortable in these situations And being uncomfortable makes me sharp and unpleasant When my children run my errands sort my medications buy me delicacies accompany me on medical trips  even do my laundry  I am somehow reduced to that Brooklyn girl whose struggling parents just couldnt cope  and it was her fault My children point out that this thinking makes no sense But that theres no logic to this is irrelevant  We are the sum of our years and experiences and I never could add properly My daughter the doctor is constantly on call for me and I am unable to accept it with any grace  She takes me every two months for a shot in my eye that controls my macular degeneration   The shot always scares me   My daughter comes to pick me up and suggests we take a taxi  I nix that idea and say I prefer the subway  The A train  If it was good enough for Duke Ellington I say its good enough for me  So we take the subway  I get the shot  I always feel terrible afterward blinder than usual and drained by the whole effort My daughter suggests we call a car service to go home but again I invoke the Duke  We go downtown on the A Once home she looks in my refrigerator and offers to go downstairs to the great food shop and buy me a really fine lunch to make me feel better  I decline and tell her I know theres enough food in the house  She makes disparaging comments about the wilted lettuce in my refrigerator but I refuse any delicacies   Shes eager to set up a book on tape or a musical recording to make my long blinderthanusual afternoon pleasant I decline Finally on an irritated note she goes away and I am left in my silent apartment with my wilted lettuce My children try so hard and after all they know what I like  My son and his family feed me gourmet dinners and I overeat because Im a glutton My younger daughter sends me free passes to interesting movie previews and discussions and I go and enjoy them especially because theyre free even with my limited vision   So why cant I just be grateful  Why am I so resistant so irrational so difficult and unpleasant  Because burdens arent grateful any more than theyre graceful It is not that I am unaware of all that is being done for me  Quite the contrary I am painfully aware of it  I hear the echoes from my childhood accusing me repeating a single word Burden I dont want to be taken care of and I resent that I have lost independence  that really I have no free choice  My life is now directed by other people the way it was when I was a child  That they are people who love me is irrelevant   Sorry kids but I was never gracious and it just gets harder and harder  I want the right at  to play kickthecan to do whatever I choose and that right has been forfeited to age and decrepitude and I mind it terribly  Which makes me a very ungrateful old lady   Do most people resent being old and losing freedom  Surely they must  Perhaps they have better manners and have learned to be complaisant But this is my life Still
