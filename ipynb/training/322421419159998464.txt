In late February Lorraine Bayless  died at a California independent living facility after an employee declined to provide CPR  for more than seven minutes   The incident was the subject of enormous public outcry and generated widespread criticism of the facility But it also raises important legal questions relevant to older adults and families living in similar settings Ms Bayless collapsed in the dining room at Glenwood Gardens in Bakersfield A nurse identified only as Colleen indicated to the  operator that she was constrained by company policy from administering CPR In a statement Glenwood Gardens said the employee was acting as a resident services director  not as a nurse  and noted that as an independent living facility Glenwood Gardens by law is not licensed to provide medical care to any of its residents By comparison assisted living and nursing home facilities do provide varying degrees of health care The company that owns the facility Brookdale Senior Living then issued a statement that said This incident resulted from a complete misunderstanding of our practice with regards to emergency medical care for our residents Yet the company has declined to respond to questions about what exactly those practices are Hoping to put the painful matter behind them Ms Baylesss relatives made it clear she wanted a natural death and said they would not pursue legal action Like many commenters on this blog experts noted that California and many other states have Good Samaritan laws intended to protect people who take action in medical emergencies from being penalized for trying to provide assistance Interestingly though it is not clear that the law would have applied in this instance Good Samaritan laws provide immunity from civil lawsuits alleging negligence or harm The statutes which vary considerably from state to state are aimed primarily at medical providers but also can cover ordinary people who step forward to help in emergencies But certain exceptions apply   In California the law applies to individuals who   This excludes doctors and nurses who are paid to offer medical care at institutions like hospitals medical clinics and nursing homes  When these health care professionals are on the job   and they of course can be sued for malpractice said Stephen Sugarman a professor of law at the University of California Berkeley   What is not clear is whether this exception would apply to a nurse like Colleen who serves as an employee of a nonmedical institution in a nonmedical capacity Whether she would be protected by the Good Samaritan statute would need interpretation said David Levine a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco   Adam Winkler a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles said The courts havent given enough guidance about what for compensation means under California law   On the one hand he said it could be argued that the woman should be exempt from the Good Samaritan law because she received a salary and had a work relationship that called for a certain level of care for residents On the other hand perhaps she deserved legal protections because her work wasnt medical in nature and she would have been acting outside of the scope of her job   Another wrinkle A separate California statute that applies to licensed nurses mandates that   when they provide emergency aid at the scene of an emergency which occurs outside both the place and the course of that persons employment Assuming Colleen is a licensed nurse this suggests she would not have been covered by Good Samaritan protections so long as she delivered CPR at her workplace said Eric Carlson a directing attorney at the    That doesnt mean that she would be liable automatically for a bad outcome That would become possible in the case of gross negligence or if she didnt act as a competent professional Mr Carlson said Policies of this kind are in place at independent living centers across the country Independent living centers say they are housingonly arrangements akin to what Mr Winkler called dormitories for the elderly In medical emergencies the policy of many institutions is to call  and wait for help to arrive This applies to CPR and other types of emergencies  when residents fall and break a hip or suffer a stroke or faint for an indeterminate reason But some experts question whether CPR should be lumped together with other types of medical assistance or whether it stands on a category of its own  what might be called basic life support services The question of the facilitys duty to provide care will largely turn on what was in the residents agreement said Jaime King an associate professor of law at the Hastings law school in an email The fact that it was an independent living facility with no claim to offering medical services suggests there is no obligation to provide assistance she wrote Mr Sugarman isnt so sure Suppose the woman was in fine health and in the facility dining room and was clearly choking he said Would it be OK for the staff just to ignore her even if they knew how to do the Heimlich I dont think so The issue has caught the attention of the California State Assemblys   Its chairwoman Assemblywoman Mariko Yamada recently held hearings about independent living operators to explore whether there should be some basic life support standard of care at these facilities   Did the nurse have a professional if not legal duty to perform CPR If someone licensed as a nurse is acting as a nurse then yes she must intervene and provide appropriate medical care said Russ Heimerich spokesman for the   an agency that includes the states board of nursing Failure to do so would put a nurses license in jeopardy he added   But if Im a nurse working part time at Ross selling clothes I dont have a duty to intervene he added The key question then is what the nurses responsibilities were at Glenwood Gardens As resident services director she would not have been required to provide CPR Mr Heimerich said so long as medical care was not seen as part of her job description The general rule in the US is that you have no duty to rescue someone in a medical emergency except if youre a medical professional whos on the job and acting within the scope of your medical practice said Mr Levine of the Hastings law school
