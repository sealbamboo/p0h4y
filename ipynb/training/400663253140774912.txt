
 Last month knee surgeons from the University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium   one that had not previously been specifically identified despite untold numbers of past knee dissections and scans This surprising announcement in The Journal of Anatomy should improve our understanding of how the knee works and why some knee surgeries disappoint and also underscores the continually astonishing complexity of human anatomy   To find and characterize this new knee part the orthopedic surgeons Dr Steven Claes and Dr Johann Bellemans and their colleagues gathered  knee joints from human cadavers and began minutely dissecting them   The knee as those of us who own and operate a pair know is complicated and somewhat fragile an intricate construction of bones cartilage fluids ligaments which attach bones to bones and tendons which attach muscles to bones Ideally the various parts move together smoothly but they can tear rupture or fracture if the knee abruptly twists or overpivots Knee injuries and pain drive millions of people to doctors every year and result in millions of knee exams scans and surgeries  So most of us probably have assumed that the entire internal structure of the knee has been fully mapped and delineated  But knee specialists themselves have long been less sanguine As far back as  a French surgeon named Paul Segond first speculated that in addition to the four obvious structural knee ligaments known then  the anterior cruciate medial collateral posterior cruciate and lateral collateral which loop around and through the joint  other ligaments must exist in the knee or it would not be stable He wrote that during dissections he had noticed a pearly resistant fibrous band originating at the outside front portion of the thighbone and continuing to the shinbone which in his estimation must stabilize the outer part of the knee preventing it from collapsing inward  He did not however give this pearly band a name and somehow in the decades that followed its existence was forgotten or ignored While some surgeons noted that a ligament seemed to exist there none named and systematically studied it and many came to consider it a continuation of other tissues such as the nearby iliotibial band  But a few years ago Dr Claes and his colleagues began to suspect otherwise Their interest had been piqued by a problem that occurred in some patients who had undergone reconstructive surgery for an injured anterior cruciate ligament or ACL Despite the repaired knees appearing afterward to be healthy the joint would sometimes give way as people moved We thought something is still not right in that knee said Dr Claes who wondered whether additional untended knee injuries might be to blame and if so whether they were occurring in uncharted knee parts I know it probably sounds crazy to say that we thought there might be this new ligament he said  But like Dr Segond so long before him Dr Claes became convinced that such a tissue must exist Positioned at the front of the knee it would be vulnerable to tearing when an ACL was injured the same forces would move through both ligaments But unlike torn ACLs this new tissues injuries would remain untreated potentially leading Dr Claes considered to knee instability and buckling  So knowing it should be there he and his colleagues began to search for this chimerical ligament in the  donated knees And there it was a narrow band of tissue clearly separate from the illiotibial band and neatly linking the femur and the tibia Because it was located on the outside front portion of the knee they named it the anterolateral ligament or ALL They subsequently identified measured and scanned the ALL in all but one of the donated knees and even in that final knee Dr Claes said he suspects there may once have been an ALL but it possibly ruptured and withered at some point  Whether a similar process occurs in living people who injure and dont treat an ALL  because they dont know they have one  is unknown Dr Claes said but is potentially the weightiest question raised by this new research We think that its quite likely many people who tear an ACL also tear an ALL he said and that lingering injury or weakness in this overlooked ligament could leave joints unstable  But at the moment that possibility is speculative although Dr Claes said that he and his colleagues had reexamined scans of some of the knees that they had operated on to repair ACL injuries and identified concomitant ALL tears in many of them  He and his colleagues have begun planning and practicing surgical procedures for treating ALL tears but at the moment so much remains unknown about the ligament including whether it can heal without surgery  We still have a lot of work to do said Dr Claes who with his colleagues will be presenting continuing results at orthopedic surgery conventions in the coming months But the fact that the ALL is now recognized is already an important step forward he said in understanding and potentially treating injured knees at least in those parts of which to date we are aware
