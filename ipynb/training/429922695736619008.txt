The head of the health watchdog says the NHS in England has a culture that doesnt listen and he has been shocked by behaviour he has seen Care Quality Commission chairman David Prior   was jeopardising safety and blocking improvements in care He said the NHS could go bust without serious change and called for more competition to drive up standards The government said it was trying to eradicate poor care and back openness The NHS has suffered a series of damaging scandals over recent years and Mr Prior warned that lessons from them had yet to be learned Last year an inquiry into Stafford Hospital found that years of abuse and neglect had led to the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of patients Writing in the Sunday Telegraph Mr Prior said Parts of the NHS have developed a culture that doesnt listen  or worse that stigmatises and ostracises those who raise concerns or complaints Too often it delights in the ritual humiliation of those deemed to fail tolerates and institutionalises outdated working practices and oldfashioned hierarchies and can almost encourage managers and clinicians to occupy opposing camps He said he loved the NHS and yet am too often shocked by some of the behaviour I see Mr Prior said lessons could be learned from the open and constantly learning organisations in the US He called for successful hospitals to take over failing hospitals and community services and for better care outside hospitals and for larger centres of excellence with savings from shared services such as pathology labs and radiology Without serious change the NHS will deliver poor care and ultimately go bust he said And he called for changes to the way the NHS is held to account  particularly an end to trusts being blindsided by waiting time targets that miss the point skew priorities and have unintended consequences Katherine Murphy chief executive of the Patients Association agreed with Mr Prior She said There is a culture in the NHS where process comes before humans For years weve tried to highlight concern about poor care Were often seen as a nuisance for highlighting these issues The behaviour and culture that was allowed to grow in Mid Staffordshire is no different from that in many trusts in many parts of the country today Julie Bailey of campaign group Cure the NHS who was behind moves to get the Stafford inquiry set up said Mr Prior was speaking the truth and something urgent needed to be done She said We have to face up that the NHS is in a crisis We need to do something about it I sat through every day of the public inquiry and thats exactly what came out The NHS doesnt belong to the public any more Theres something badly wrong with the culture of the NHS Dr Mark Porter chairman of the BMA Council said Mr Priors opinions mirrored what the organisation had been told by doctors frustrated by working in an NHS that needs change At Mid Staffordshire we saw how patient safety can suffer because of a combination of managerial obsessions and disengaged and disillusioned clinical staff he said We can no longer tolerate managers and clinicians seeing themselves as being on opposing sides Only by stepping out of our traditional roles can we ensure that patients continue to receive the excellent care they deserve The Department of Health said it was focusing on poor care like never before and was turning around  hospitals that are in special measures A spokesman said We are clear that targets must never come before clinical need  and based on clinical advice we have scrapped a number of them However its right that patients have certainty about how long they can expect to wait for medical treatment when they are ill In fact despite the NHS treating more people than ever waiting times are low and stable and there are  fewer patients waiting longer than  weeks than in May
