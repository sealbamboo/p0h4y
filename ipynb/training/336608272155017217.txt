Strapless multiway demi the pushups of summer  if you want a bra Victorias Secret stocks it Unless youre a breast cancer survivor that is and looking for a pocketed bra capable of holding a prosthetic breast form Allan Maiden the yearold daughter of a breast cancer survivor had hoped to change that and gathered  asking that Victorias Secret start offering a Survivor line of mastectomy bras But after several meetings and discussions the company sent a nogo response to her on Monday Through our research we have learned that fitting and selling mastectomy bras  in the right way  a way that is beneficial to women is complicated and truly a science reads a statement released Monday by a Victorias Secret spokesperson As a result we believe that the best way for us to make an impact for our customers is to continue funding cancer research Maiden who created the petition as a way to honor and support her mother a year breast cancer survivor says shes a bit disappointed at the decision but appreciates the fact that the lingerie maker took the petition seriously Maiden and her yearold mother were flown to Columbus Ohio where they met with people from parent company Limited Brands toured a cancer research facility the organization supports and walked representatives through a mastectomy bra shopping experience I do think they took it very seriously and that was ultimately why they decided not to do it says Maiden If they were going to do it they wanted to do it well and they didnt think they would be capable of doing that But Maiden says shes not done fighting for her mother and other breast cancer survivors arguing that there is still very much a need for accessible  and pretty  mastectomy bras for cancer survivors One of the great things about doing this petition was learning about   she says Mom and I went there and it was amazing But Nordstrom has less than  stores So Ive sent emails to other department stores asking if they could implement similar programs If Macys or Sears or JCPenney  stores with a larger reach  could do something similar that would give women the accessibility and could really help with this problem Maiden was moved to start the petition after seeing her mother who lives in rural Virginia struggle to find properly fitting bras often ending up with expensive and ugly mastectomy bras via online outlets Ive seen my mother go through the pains of chemotherapy and mastectomy surgery she says A strong woman like her should be able to go to a store in her local mall  and buy a beautiful bra like everyone else Mindy Greenstein a New York psychooncologist and breast cancer survivor says this is a completely legitimate sentiment This is not at all silly or superficial she says How you look to yourself and the world has an impact on how you cope Its not just an issue of wearing a pretty bra after mastectomy its about wanting to feel as normal as you can feel Greenstein says an important way we learn to cope is by feeling like part of the world not isolated from the world Unfortunately there are myriad reminders after a mastectomy that youre different  Everything reminds of us being different she says And nothings going to remind you more than driving five hours out of your way for a bra that doesnt even look good
