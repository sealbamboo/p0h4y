How would you like to control your dreams Researchers who zapped sleepers with a very gentle targeted electrical current were able to send them into a state of lucid dreaming  when they knew they were dreaming They hope the technique might be used to help people with mental illnesses such as post traumatic stress disorder PTSD and some types of schizophrenia Their study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience also offers an opportunity to   is rare and has intrigued philosophers for centuries Experts have also thought that if people could harness it it could be a  for therapy Sometimes the dreamer gains control over the ongoing dream plot and for example is able to put a dream aggressor to flight Ursula Voss of JW GoetheUniversity Frankfurt Germany and colleagues wrote in their report Vosss team knew that brain waves change during lucid dreaming Theyre often accompanied by waves in whats called the lower gamma frequency band  around  Hz But its not clear which comes first  the dream or the brain wave activity Does lucid dreaming trigger gammaband activity or does gammaband activity trigger lucid dreaming they asked Perhaps the capacity to generate gammaoscillatory activity sets the stage for lucid dream So they got  young adults to volunteer for a dream study pulsing their heads with various frequencies from  Hz to  Hz using a technology called frontotemporal transcranial alternating current or tACS Electrodes are put on the scalp to deliver the current They also did a sham treatment They woke up the volunteers at various phases of sleep and asked about dreams Delivering  Hz and to a lesser degree  Hz did cause lucid dreams they reported Heres what one looked like I was dreaming about lemon cake It looked translucent but then again it didnt It was a bit like in an animated movie like the Simpsons  the dreamer reported Then I realized Oops you are dreaming I mean while I was dreaming So strange Treatment with this kind of stimulation might be useful for some types of schizophrenia the researchers said or obsessivecompulsive disorder Finally promoting gamma oscillations during REM rapid eye movement sleep in posttraumatic stress disorder with reemerging nightmares might trigger lucid dreaming and eventually enable active changes in dream content they said
