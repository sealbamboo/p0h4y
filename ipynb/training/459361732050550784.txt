WASHINGTON  The Food and Drug Administration plans to begin regulating electronic cigarettes for the first time banning sales to minors and requiring manufacturers to put health warnings on the nicotinedelivering devices that have become a multibilliondollar industry according to officials who described the agencys proposal But the agency will stop short of steps that many public health advocates and some members of Congress have called for including restrictions on television advertisements and flavorings such as pumpkin spice or chocolate that may target younger consumers officials said The agency plans to announce the new rule Thursday Regulators do not yet have scientific evidence for a rule on flavorings but the subject is still being researched Mitchell Zeller director of the FDAs Center for Tobacco Products told reporters There are far more questions than answers he said adding that the new regulation would provide a framework for additional rules in the future Even without restrictions on advertising or flavorings the new rule represents a significant step in the agencys ability to regulate tobacco products Zeller said I call the market for ecigarettes the wild wild West in the absence of regulations The proposed rule which must go through a public comment process and overcome potential legal challenges before becoming final would impose restrictions on other tobaccorelated products as well including nicotine gels and pipe tobacco Companies would have to register the products and their ingredients with the FDA but would have two years to do so In the interim they could continue selling their existing devices and introduce new products without regulators approval The new health warning labels would caution users against the danger of becoming addicted to nicotine Ecigarettes come in several forms but all heat liquid nicotine into a vapor that can be inhaled and that gives use of the devices its popular term vaping The FDA has been trying to regulate the devices for at least five years In  the agency sought to impose restrictions on them as medical devices designed to deliver nicotine a chemical compound that is addictive After a federal court   the next year the   and declared that it could issue rules for the devices under the authority Congress gave it to regulate tobacco products Regulating the devices raises more complex issues than rules for traditional cigarettes because the health impact of ecigarettes is unclear Supporters say they could be beneficial by allowing users to get nicotine without the exposure to tar and other carcinogens found in cigarette smoke They have touted the devices as an effective way for some of the countrys roughly  million smokers to quit Opponents say that the devices inevitably will lead to more nicotine addiction that the health risks of longterm use are unknown and that widespread use of ecigarettes especially by minors will lead to increases in smoking Definitive data on the health impact of vaping do not exist an FDA official Priscilla CallahanLyon wrote recently in a medical journal in which she reviewed studies of the devices The agency spent years amassing data before declaring in the mids that nicotine in the amounts delivered by cigarettes was an addictive drug While the debate over the health effects of vaping has continued sales of the devices have rocketed

some devices In the last few years poison centers across the country have reported a sharp increase in nicotine poisoning particularly of small children Even small amounts of nicotine can cause nausea and vomiting if swallowed by an adult and can be potentially deadly for a small child The   this month that calls had increased from just one in September  to  this February with more than half of the

aggressively targeting minors with marketing tactics that would be illegal if used for traditional cigarettes The report singled out kidfriendly flavorings which are banned by law for traditional cigarettes and the sponsorship of popular entertainment events such as the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival With over a million youth now using ecigarettes FDA needs to act without further delay to stop the companies from marketing their addictive products to children said Waxman who has led efforts in Congress for decades to limit tobacco use
