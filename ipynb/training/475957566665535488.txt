Doctors should use newer medications rather than aspirin to treat a common heart problem say new guidelines for the NHS in England and Wales The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence says bloodthinning drugs like warfarin are better for those with atrial fibrillation which can increase a persons risk of stroke Experts say most doctors are already doing this  The advice will affect hundreds of thousands of patients Atrial fibrillation AF which causes an irregular heartbeat is the most common heart rhythm problem affecting up to  people  roughly one in   in the UK  In AF the heart cannot work as well as it should and blood clots can form which in turn increases the risk of a stroke  Aspirin has been used for years to help protect patients from strokes but mounting evidence suggests the drugs benefits are too small compared with other treatments The guidelines acknowledge this  it is the first time they will have been updated since they were originally issued in  The advice to switch from aspirin to a bloodthinning drug such as warfarin instead should prevent thousands of strokes  Newer anticoagulants other than warfarin may be most suitable as they do not require regular monitoring says NICE  Experts say if aspirin is to be stopped it should be stopped gradually and only under the advice of a doctor  Prof Peter Weissberg medical director at the British Heart Foundation said Strokes caused by atrial fibrillation are both common and preventable but only if the abnormal heart rhythm is identified in the first place and if effective drugs are given to prevent bloodclot development  The revised NICE guidance reflects accumulating evidence that warfarin and the newer anticoagulants are much more effective than aspirin at preventing strokes  This does not mean that aspirin is not important and effective at preventing heart attacks and strokes in other circumstances Patients who are unclear on whether or not they should continue to take aspirin should speak to their doctor Prof Peter Elwood an expert at Cardiff University warned it could be unsafe to suddenly stop taking aspirin If aspirin is to be stopped it should be stopped gradually he said
