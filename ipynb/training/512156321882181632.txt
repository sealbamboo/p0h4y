It is the biggest antiEbola effort yet After months of calls by aid workers for the global community to do something about the escalating crisis President Obama has announced plans for a massive international intervention His  million proposal is more expensive farreaching and ambitious than anything else thats been thrown at this outbreak Aid groups and health workers battling Ebola welcome the plan  but raise some concerns Obama made the announcement at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Tuesday afternoon Stating that the Ebola epidemic in West Africa has become a globalsecurity threat he said rapid action is needed to bring it under control Obama will send thousands of American military personnel to the region to build hospitals train health care workers and deliver relief supplies At the request of the Liberian government we are going to establish a military command center in Liberia to support civilian efforts across the region he said The Defense Department is also going to set up a logistics base in Senegal to ferry personnel and relief supplies to the countries hardest hit by the disease American troops will construct  Ebola treatment centers in Liberia Theyll also set up a healthcare facility to train thousands of locals to look after people infected with the deadly disease An administration official speaking on background says the tab for the Defense Departments Ebola response efforts could run as high as a billion dollars In addition the US Agency for International Development will help distribute hundreds of thousands of personal protective kits to homes in the region with gloves masks and disinfectant Doctors Without Borders has been warning for months that this Ebola outbreak is out of control Brice de la Vigne the operations director for the group in Brussels says the US plan is a step in the right direction He just hopes it can be put in place quickly Time is a key element says de la Vigne Whatever the deployment it needs to happen very very quick The Obama administration says military personnel are already being sent The goal is to have much of the program up and running within weeks The tasks that lie ahead are daunting says Fitzhugh Mullan a professor of public health policy at George Washington University who has studied health care in Africa The public health systems in the parts of West Africa where this outbreak is raging were incredibly weak even before Ebola arrived he notes and trying to train  new healthcare workers a week in even the best environment would be a challenge Mullan calls Obamas plan unconventional and experimental but says there arent many other options on the table I think its ambitious but I dont think you have a choice he says The alternative  to do this by the book  will undoubtedly let the epidemic get way out beyond you After all this is an unprecedented outbreak There simply arent enough healthcare workers on the ground to treat all the people who are sick right now  let alone the tens of thousands who could become infected in the coming months
