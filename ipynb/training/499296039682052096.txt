A car accident crushed Brandon Coats upper spine when he was  leaving him unable to walk His muscles still spasm disrupting sleep and causing pain If Im out in public its embarrassing Coats says Its always uncomfortable If I smoke marijuana it almost completely alleviates it  more he says than other prescriptions Coats smokes at night and says he was never high when answering customer calls at Dish Network I was really good at my job he says But five years ago after he was called in by supervisors for a random drug test he became persona non grata at the company I went to open up the door and my card wouldnt open up the door anymore Coats says Its been  years since the federal   was passed creating requirements for federal government workers and contractors Many companies including Dish Network followed suit and today more than a third of private employers have drugtesting policies Although marijuana is now legal in two states and approved for medical use in nearly half the drug policies of many companies havent kept pace Coats has sued Dish Network over its marijuana policy his case is now before the Colorado Supreme Court Were not pushing for use at work says Coats attorney Michael Evans Were pushing for if youre in the privacy of your own home youre registered with the state and abiding by the constitutional amendment is that an OK reason for your employer to fire you Since Evans sued Dish Colorado has legalized pot making it a regulated substance like alcohol But as Evans notes workplaces still treat pot  and test for its use  in a manner very different from alcohol The test that Dish did was a saliva test Evans says and all the test was concerned about was Is THC present yes or no  And therein lies a problem The standard urine test most commonly used in employer drug testing measures the presence of THC  a psychoactive compound in marijuana that persists in the body for days weeks or even longer So a positive marijuana test doesnt necessarily mean the person taking the test is high or has even used the drug recently Barry Sample is director of science and technology for Quest Diagnostics which conducts millions of drug tests He says there may eventually be intoxication tests for pot that are more like the Breathalyzers detection of recent alcohol use It might be possible at some point but its still developing he says For now businesses are neither changing nor relaxing the way they test for pot In a  survey of major employers by the   more than half of the companies responding said they conduct drug tests on all job candidates And that raises some questions for businesses says the societys Deborah Keary If you had a martini on Saturday night or smoked pot on Saturday night but youre fine on Monday morning how is Saturday night the employers business Keary says So I really think theyre going to have to change the way they do testing and define impairment And at least in Colorado the legalization of pot is putting employers in even murkier legal territory Under state law employers can prohibit use of marijuana at work But another state law the Lawful Activities statute prohibits an employer from discharging an employee for engaging in lawful activity   of the business during nonworking hours Thats where everything really gets muddied up says Lara Makinen legislative affairs director in Colorado for the Society for Human Resource Management She says employers are getting a very mixed message Were being told Keep your policy as it is but proceed with caution because if people are fired like Mr Coats we probably will see lawsuits  Makinen says Dish Network the defendant in the Brandon Coats case declined to comment But the company has said it is sticking by its drugfree policy which it says is consistent with federal law  law that still considers pot an illegal substance Oral arguments for Coats case are set to begin in late September
