Referrals to breast cancer clinics more than doubled in the UK after Angelina Jolie announced she had had a double mastectomy to prevent breast cancer The actress revealed in May last year she had had the surgery after being told she had an  chance of the disease because of a highrisk gene The news encouraged women with genuine concerns about their family history to get advice a study found About  of breast cancers are thought to be hereditary The Angelina Jolie effect has been longlasting and global and appears to have increased referrals to centres appropriately said a team led by ProfÂ Gareth Evans of the University of Manchester The researchers looked at referrals to more than  genetic centres and clinics in the UK after the story hit the press in May  In June and July the number of GP referrals for genetic counselling and DNA tests for breast cancer mutations increased two and a half times compared with the same period in  The study published in the journal   found referrals remained at twice the previous years figure from August to October Angelina Jolie stating she has a BRCA mutation and going on to have a riskreducing mastectomy is likely to have had a bigger impact than other celebrity announcements possibly due to her image as a glamorous and strong woman said Prof Evans This may have lessened patients fears about a loss of sexual identity postpreventative surgery and encouraged those who had not previously engaged with health services to consider genetic testing Most breast cancers happen by chance but a small number of people diagnosed with breast cancer  have inherited a fault in one of the known breast cancer genes BRCA BRCA or TP which puts them at higher risk Angelina Jolie is not alone in influencing health behaviour  Attendance for cervical cancer screening rose in  and  when the celebrity Jade Goody was diagnosed with cervical cancer and died Baroness Delyth Morgan is chief executive at Breast Cancer Campaign which partfunded the research Without Angelina Jolies openness in talking about her BRCA mutation and decision to have a riskreducing mastectomy followed by the publication and publicity around the updated NICE guidelines soon after many women may not have approached health services and so would never have had their risk and riskreducing options explained she said Funding for genetic services must be able to respond quickly to demand to ensure risk counselling and genetic testing is available for everyone in need she added  The current level of funding available for this service should be reviewed to avoid unnecessary delays which can be very stressful for patients Women in general have a one in eight chance of developing breast cancer during their lifetime but genes can put some at higher risk In the UK about one in  people will have inherited a BRCA mutation and a similar proportion will have inherited a BRCA mutation   Women who are tested early can take steps to prevent themselves from developing the disease This may mean a riskreducing mastectomy cancer preventing drugs such as tamoxifen and certain lifestyle changes like a healthy diet and more exercise Lester Barr chairman of   said While a womans risk of developing breast cancer andor ovarian cancer is greatly increased if she carries the harmful mutation of the BRCA or BRCA gene preventative surgery is by no means the answer for everyone  Of course a preventative mastectomy is the most effective way to cut a womans risk of breast cancer however other options should also be considered These include prevention drugs such as tamoxifen which has been approved by NICE  Alternatively many women with a mutated BRCA gene opt for annual checkups which can be arranged through the NHS
