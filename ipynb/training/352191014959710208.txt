The Obama administration has offered a oneyear break to employers who were supposed to start offering health insurance to their workers next year The  health reform law required anyone with  or more workers to provide health insurance  something small businesses have been complaining about loudly for years On Tuesday the government said they could have more time to get it done Saying the goal is to implement reform in a careful thoughtful manner assistant Treasury secretary Mark Mazur said the administration would spend the extra year finding ways to simplify the process Second it will provide time to adapt health coverage and reporting systems while employers are moving toward making health coverage affordable and accessible for their employees Within the next week we will publish formal guidance describing this transition Mazur wrote  We recognize that the vast majority of businesses that will need to do this reporting already provide health insurance to their workers and we want to make sure it is easy for others to do so  More than half of Americans   million people  get their health insurance through an employer something that was a voluntary perk until health reform Employers who dont provide insurance must pay a  fine for each uninsured worker In  the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust found that  percent of firms with  or more employees offered health insurance But just  percent of companies with three to  workers did and just  percent of employers who had fewer than  staff Its in part because health insurance premiums have soared from an average  in  to  in  for a single person  far faster than wages or inflation have grown Kaiser found Thus about  percent of fulltime workers had no health insurance at all in  One opponent of the mandate has been the US Chamber of Commerce which says it has discouraged hiring Second the employer mandate penalty once triggered is calculated based on the number of fulltime employees the Chamber  Further for the first time this new law defines a fulltime employee as someone who works  hours per week averaged over the course of a month rather than the traditional definition of  hours per week The idea of requiring employers to provide health insurance isnt new  both the administrations of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton proposed it and got shot down by opponents in Congress Employers want to offer health insurance to their employees and want to continue to grow and create jobs However the employer mandate threatens to penalize businesses for failing to offer affordable coverage whenmore than everpeople need jobs and employers need help growing and should be encouraged to hire more employees This law does the opposite at a dangerous time the Chamber says Dr Scott Gottleib a heath policy analyst at the American Enterprise Institute said the Obama administration may be worried the mandate would hurt jobs Now fewer businesses will feel compelled to start offering coverage next year So their employees will face a choice be forced to go into the Obamacare exchanges or be subject to the new tax Gottleib in Forbes Some of the biggest provisions of the Affordable Care Act are set to go into effect on January   They include the health insurance exchanges where people who dont already have insurance or who dont like their health insurance can go to buy it Many people can get a government subsidy to help them pay for it
