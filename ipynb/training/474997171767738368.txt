Next month, the FDA may take a significant step for MannKind. Wall Street appears to be betting that the agency will approve an inhaled insulin drug that has been a long time coming. And to say that investors are excited is the proverbial understatement. MannKind shares are trading near a 52-week high over anticipation that the product will become a blockbuster.. But this optimism is predicated on a few assumptions that may warrant further deliberation. The product, called Afrezza, would have to be embraced quickly by physicians. Insurers would not only have agree to reimburse customers but also provide preferential placement on the so-called formulary lists that determine whether a product is given favored status. And a big pharma would want to strike a marketing deal.
