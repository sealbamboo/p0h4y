Among a group of  patients being treated for   in the Boston area those who suffered from food insecurity and those who tried to save money by skimping on their meds were only half as likely as their more financially secure counterparts to be managing their disease This disparity turned up despite the fact that in Massachusetts nearly everyone has medical insurance and prescription coverage thanks to the states universal healthcare law The   published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine underscore the fact that some aspects of health are controlled by factors outside the medical system And yet doctors are increasingly being held accountable when their patients miss their targets for things like blood sugar and cholesterol the study authors noted It stands to reason that better access to medical care ought to improve peoples health But clinical trials have found that things arent always so simple especially for lowincome patients with diabetes Among the  patients only  lacked health insurance and  had no prescription coverage But about  of them had trouble paying for food medicine rent or energy and more than  reported more than one of such material need insecurity as the researchers put it Compared with patients who didnt have to worry about where their next meal would come from patients with food insecurity were  more likely to have high blood sugar and high levels of LDL or bad cholesterol  two signs that their diabetes was not under control Similarly compared with patients who could afford to buy all of their prescribed medications patients who couldnt were  more likely to have high blood sugar high cholesterol and high blood pressure the researchers found Housing instability and energy insecurity were not independently associated with worse health for the diabetes patients But in general for each additional type of financial hardship suffered by a patient the odds that he or she would have poor diabetes control rose by  according to the study The results suggest that doctors should think more expansively about ways they can help their diabetes patients At a minimum they raise questions about the wisdom of providing services like   to people who cant afford to buy enough food in the first place the researchers wrote Addressing access to food and to medication together may be important to improve clinical diabetes control they concluded
