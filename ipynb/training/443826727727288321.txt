Every age of parenthood  and parenthood at every age  yields some discouraging metric some new rating system on which parents can be judged and found wanting We endlessly jury family dinner rituals day care and nannies parents readiness to follow schedules or to ignore the rules and follow their childs directives Whatever you are doing is probably wrong Yes you yes right now Put down that cellphone and listen to me  In a   researchers observed diners in Bostonarea fast food restaurants looking at the new family configuration of adult child and mobile device The researchers were trained in anthropological observation techniques looking in detail at what went on between children and the adults taking care of them the researchers had no way of knowing if they were parents with a focus on the adults use of devices like smartphones and tablets  The object was to observe and to find out what kinds of questions we should be asking about these new digital devices as they relate to parenting Not surprisingly most used some kind of mobile device either continuously or intermittently or at the end of the meal Of the  groups observed in the study only  had no device in play  We definitely noted more engagement where there wasnt a device available said Dr Jenny Radesky the lead author and a fellow in developmentalbehavioral pediatrics at Boston Medical Center Adults who were typing and swiping were more fully focused on their screens than those who were making phone calls The ones paying most attention to their children were of course not doing any of those things  Children can feel hurt by this lack of attention said Catherine SteinerAdair a clinical and consulting psychologist who interviewed  children along with many parents teachers and young adults about the role of screens in childrens lives in researching her book The Big Disconnect Protecting Childhood and Family Relationships in the Digital Age  Children of all ages       used the same phrases to talk about how hard it is for them to get their parents attention when they need it sad angry mad frustrated she said They were complaining that their parents were focused on screens she continued like a childs chorus of all ages talking about this new sibling rivalry only its not a new member of the family  its a new screen its a device As mobile devices have become increasingly ubiquitous in family life some have raised alarms that   might be due to parents too busy texting or emailing to keep a proper eye on their charges  And evidence from screens that have been with us a lot longer  television screens  raise concerns about the impact on language and development In a  study in which researchers had children wear recording devices each hour of audible background television was associated with a decrease of  to  adult words spoken per day  Are some parents more attentive and others more distracted regardless of the particular distraction Was it different for those of us who remember holding our young children at bay so we could finish reading or writing a chapter in a book  A really important question are these devices just a marker for different parenting strategies andor different satisfactions different styles  or is the device itself impacting those interactions Dr Radesky said My guess is that the answer is probably all of the above Tending young children is hard work and dare I admit sometimes boring Any distraction literally right at hand from the righteousness of urgent work emails to the mindlessness of the games that I used to yell at my own children for playing is at least occasionally tempting  Dr SteinerAdair noted that children old enough to know the word hypocrite were always ready to apply it to parents who made rules about childrens screen use no texting at the table but disregarded those rules themselves We are all highly susceptible to the idea that our own messages or imperatives or contacts are singularly urgent We as parents have to be much more mindful about how our own wiring is interacting with technology in those moments when our children need us Dr SteinerAdair said We have to think about how we check in with ourselves about the importance of getting one more email done  these are very tricky moments because they happen all the time On her blog she suggests  from driving time and school pickup to bed and bath  Dr Radesky pointed out that while some adults observed in the Boston study were completely absorbed in devices many used them intermittently balancing electronics with engagement with children As a mother of two young children I understand how important it is to take a break sometimes to be connected with work and with friends she said Kathy HirshPasek a professor of psychology at Temple University and an author of Einstein Never Used Flashcards has studied use of ebooks and other electronics by parents and children and said the lesson of all the studies is that what really matters is the backandforth relationship  Look for something thats active engaging meaningful and interactive she said The bad news and the good news is you cant outsource learning to an app but the good news is theres really room for us two minutes of time five minutes of time look into our childrens eyes have the conversation
