A woman in her late s came to see me recently because her back hurt She works at a child care center in town where she picks up babies and small children all day long She felt a twinge in her lower back when hoisting a fussy kid The pain was bad enough that she went home from work early and was laid out on the couch until she came to see me the next day In my office she told me she had done some damage to her back She was worried She didnt want to end up like her father whod left his factory job in his mids on disability after suffering what she called permanent damage to his back Back pain is common I see someone with back pain almost every day Nearly   have at least one episode in our lives and twothirds of us will have it repeatedly If youve somehow lived into your s and never suffered low back pain congratulations Youre what doctors like me call an   In my patients case I was confident that her back pain wasnt serious A minor injury was the clear cause And nearly all back pain like   from a simple mechanical strain gets better on its own I wanted to reassure her I told her to go about her daily life Keep exercising but try to take it just a little bit easy until she felt better At a minimum I said she should be walking   a day Also try some ibuprofen which helps with inflammation and doesnt require a prescription But she wasnt buying it Dont I need an MRI or at least an Xray she asked My father had three herniated discs and wound up with two back operations He still never has a day without at least some pain I upped the ante I told her I could refer her to   one of the few things shown to be truly helpful for low back pain No dice She insisted on an MRI just to be sure A test like that wasnt warranted in my opinion because it would neither change her treatment nor the course of this firstever bout of back pain She would just get better To convince her of this I had to resort to my secret weapon I showed her an minute   created by   of Toronto You may be familiar with Evans work even if youve never heard of him Hes the man behind the famous   Hours   that says the singlebest move for health is being active for a halfhour or so a day The video became a viral Internet   racking up millions of page views and even a shoutout on the hit TV show  Evans is passionate about making complex medical ideas simple He and his team have made more than a dozen whiteboard videos on health topics including how to deal with stress acne quitting smoking and even flatulence Im looking for topics that affect a wide range of people and are generally ignored by the health care system Evans told me Themes common to Evans work include the importance of good daily habits and having a resilient attitude He touts the importance of basics walking healthful relationships avoiding stress and sleeping well In Evans video about lower back pain he cites a study in which  healthy volunteers got MRI scans Twothirds of the MRIs revealed some funky looking discs even though the people felt fine Just because a scan shows something doesnt mean theres a real problem In fact theres a surprising lack of correlation between back imaging and how someone feels and gets around Evans also points out that the most common mistake with low back pain is to stop being active The other common problem is worrying that the pain will never get better Evans who is  teaches us that back pain is something were all vulnerable to and for which it makes sense to have a coping strategy ready Has Evans who still plays hockey ever had back pain Im a member of the  percent club he affirmed meaning that like the vast majority of us hes both had back pain   that it has improved on its own Fortunately for my patient she wound up in the same club At her next visit she smiled and reminded me of the videos punch line Movement is medicine All of which is to say that the longer I practice medicine the more convinced Im becoming that less is often more
