 Four months after steroid injections from the New England Compounding Center NECC contributed to a deadly nationwide fungal meningitis outbreak that killed  people  more Massachusettsbased compounding pharmacies have been orderedÂ  to shut down In addition the US Centers for Diseases Control is under fire for the way it responded to the outbreak and its treatment recommendations In October  during the peak of the outbreak an investigation traced the contaminated steroids back to NECC The Massachusetts Department of Public Health MDPH later said that the center was   and federal agents   Since that raid the MDPH has conducted random inspections at  compounding pharmacies and just imposed disciplinary action  pharmacies have been ordered to completely or partially shut down due to failure to meet state standards and an additional  pharmacies have been cited for minor offenses The  closed pharmacies were not thought to be sources of the contaminated steroid shots which   leading to  cases of meningitis The announcement of these shutdowns comes one day after two commentaries on the CDCs handling of the outbreak were published online in the journal   The first commentary   questioned the treatment options recommended by the CDC in response to the meningitis outbreak Stevens offered several suggestions that he claimed are alternative approaches worthy of consideration He took exception to the initial CDC recommendation to use only two specific antifungal drugs and not to use antifungal chemotherapy to prevent the spread of meningitis The CDCs initial recommendations for therapy of affected cases were to use systemic voriconazole  liposomal amphotericin B for therapy explained Dr Stevens in the article Not to routinely use intrathecal mphotericin and not to use antifungal chemotherapy for prophylaxis The   and addressed some of Stevens concerns regarding preventative antifungal therapy The CDC developed a decision analysis model to estimate the risks and benefits of administering antifungal agents to asymptomatic persons stated the commentary written by a group of scientists that included one CDC official This model compared three different options for treating asymptomatic patients in an effort to stop the spread of meningitis One option was to closely monitor patients The other two options were more aggressive perform a spinal tap for diagnostic purposes or start antifungal treatment on all exposed patients the latter representing an option similar to what Stevens suggested in his commentary However the CDCs model predicted that giving antifungal treatment to all exposed patients offered the highest risk for drugrelated side effects Clinicians must carefully weigh the benefit of treatment of asymptomatic patients with the significant expense associated with drug acquisition monitoring drug levels and substantial drugdrug interactions the commentary stated
