The University of Notre Dame is trying again to get a court injunction so it can stop covering contraception for its employees, following a favorable Supreme Court order in a similar case.. Notre Dame struck out once at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit last year. Then the Supreme Court last week blocked the federal government from enforcing the contraception requirement against the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Roman Catholic nonprofit that operates homes for the elderly poor.. On Tuesday, Notre Dame filed a new request to the Seventh Circuit, saying the Supreme Court’s order suggests the university is also entitled to a stay while litigation continues.. The 2010 health law requires most employers to include birth control in employees’ health coverage without out-of-pocket costs.
