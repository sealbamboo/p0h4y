A hospital has admitted failings in medical care and poor communication resulted in a child being stillborn Parents Deborah and Richard Horner from North Yorkshire expected their daughter Abbie would be delivered at St James Hospital in Leeds in  A midwife in charge of Mrs Horners care was suspended by the Nursing and Midwifery Council and later retired Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust admitted liability and said the care offered fell short of high standards Mrs Horners pregnancy was considered high risk because of her age  she was  at the time  and she had previously suffered a miscarriage On  August  the couples daughter Abbie was delivered stillborn in an emergency Caesarean section operation at the hospital But the care given to Mrs Horner and her baby leading up to delivery was far short of the high standards of care we normally provide the hospital trust admitted Mrs Horner  said Its as hard today as when I had Abbie it doesnt get any easier  I want them to make a formal apology its horrendous its a living nightmare it never goes away its never going to get any better We just want to stop it happening to someone else An investigation by the hospital revealed misinterpretation of a foetal heart trace reading and inadequate and inaccurate record keeping Julian Hartley Chief Executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said The events leading up to the loss of Abbie fell far short of the high standards of care we normally provide and for this I am very sorry   A full investigation led by a senior doctor was undertaken into the failure to recognise and escalate concerns in the labour care  This report has been shared with Mr and Mrs Horner and I can reassure them that we are committed to using this to ensure we learn from every aspect of what happened Quite rightly our clinical staff have to be accountable for their actions  The midwife concerned was immediately removed from practice and referred to the local supervisory authority midwifery officer  Subsequently she chose to retire so is no longer employed by us
