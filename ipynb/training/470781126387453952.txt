Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding may want to start taking an iodine supplement Many American women are deficient in iodine an element that is essential for babies brain development according to an American Academy of Pediatrics statement published Monday in Pediatrics The iodine problem had been solved in the past by adding iodine to table salt But these days most salt consumed by Americans comes from processed foods and that salt is not iodized said Dr Jerome Paulson a pediatrician at Childrens National Health System and chairman of the AAPs council on environmental health Paulson doesnt want to scare moms unduly Iodine levels arent so low that babies will have severe brain damage he said The brain development issues are very subtle and are not likely to be noticed in an individual child Paulson explained Its an issue for society as a whole when you have a large number of children who are not reaching their full potential In other words kids will appear perfectly normal they just wont be all they could have been Women dont need to have their iodine levels tested Paulson said Even if iodine levels are optimal a supplement wont hurt Women should make sure they are taking a supplement when they are thinking about becoming pregnant or are pregnant Paulson said Taking a supplement with potassium iodide in it will maximize the childs potential long term Currently only  to  percent of pregnant and nursing women are taking supplements containing iodine Paulson and his colleagues noted They recommend women augment the iodine they get in foods with a supplement containing  micrograms of the element Dr Luigi Garibaldi said he hoped the new statement wouldnt alarm women especially since no one knows exactly what the effects of a slight iodine deficiency are Nevertheless it makes sense for women to supplement their iodine to be on the safe side said Garibaldi clinical director for pediatric endocrinology at the Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center I think the main thing is that the FDA Food and Drug Administration should make sure that prenatal vitamins contain all the essential nutrients Garibaldi said Its very important that vitamins such as Vitamin D which is useful in calcifying bones and elements such as iodine be part of prenatal vitamins Because the FDA doesnt regulate dietary supplements there are no rules specifying what goes into a prenatal vitamin
