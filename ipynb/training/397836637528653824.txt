Theres plenty of criticism of the Affordable Care Act and how its being implemented But lets introduce you to someone who is quite pleased with her Obamacare experience Lela Petersen of Flagler Colo Shes a small business owner with a very big health insurance bill But thanks to the health law she expects that bill will be cut by more than half in January Petersen is  and her husband Mike is  They have some preexisting conditions He has diabetes She has a back injury The HMO policy theyve carried since  has risen over the years to  per   just for the two of them When you pay  for insurance you might as well forget retirement says Petersen says Theres just no way Five years ago she was planning on an early retirement but she didnt anticipate health insurance costing as much as the rest of her bills combined At the beginning of October she checked out Colorados insurance exchange and found the exact same policy from the same insurer for only  a month Its dropping us down about  a month We can retire We can go fishing We can actually see a future says Petersen Becoming part of an insurance pool helped Petersen reduce her cost The federal law also forbids insurance companies from charging more for preexisting conditions That saved her a lot And federal tax credits brought the cost down even further The Affordable Care Act will bring big changes for a lot of people especially those who want to retire before theyre eligible for Medicare A  survey by Employee Benefit Research Institute found   polled planned to stay in their jobs longer than they wanted to so they could keep health insurance through their employer So clearly lots of people feel tethered to their jobs because of health insurance but it doesnt mean legions will follow Petersen into early retirement We dont really know how its going to play out at this point how many people will choose to do something different and how fast that might happen says   director of the health research program at EBRI Fronstin points out that poll was taken in  before a lot of people understood how the Affordable Care Act would affect them Even now many are unsure Theres a lack of knowledge about the law because people cant get on the website and find out what the premiums are for them says Fronstin Colorado has been one of the exceptions Its among the  states and District of Columbia that are running their own healthcare exchanges and websites We went up and opened the website on Oct  and the technology has been up and operational since that point in time says   CEO of   Lela Petersen found the Colorado website confusing so she got help over the telephone with only minor wait times Petersen doesnt belong to a political party and says she votes across the spectrum But she lives in a solidly Republican area and her positive opinion of Obamacare is not widely shared by her neighbors Even my son is against it so we do argue about that says Petersen Still shes signed up and her new cheaper policy will take effect on January first
