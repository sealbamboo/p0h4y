In just  years the oldest members of the huge babyboom generation will turn  Many will need some kind of longterm care A new study from   says that care could vary dramatically in cost and quality depending on where they live The  was motivated by a simple fact The number of available   is declining In  there were potentially seven for each person  years old or older By the time baby boomers reach that age there will be only four potential caregivers for each of them And those numbers are expected to continue declining Chalk it up to longer lives and smaller families  a senior vice president at AARP says the study can show states where they need to improve The gradual pace of improvement has to pick up she says We dont have the time to get ready for the demographic imperative that is before us The study looked at  different variables in each state from affordability and access to whether care is delivered in private homes or more expensive nursing homes Reinhard says states that encouraged more care at home got higher marks Its a philosophy its a value that states have and they work hard to make that happen she says AARP calls its study a   So if youre keeping score the state with the highest marks was Minnesota followed by Washington Oregon Colorado and Alaska Bringing up the rear were Indiana Tennessee Mississippi and Alabama with Kentucky coming in last Nevertheless Reinhard says all of the states improved in some ways from the previous study in  For example it has become increasingly common for family members to perform some medical tasks like giving injections or treating wounds But in the past couple of years  states have also allowed nurses to train paid caregivers to perform such tasks in the home That means that the family caregiver doesnt have to run home from work and do it says Reinhard While the states are the generators of public policy related to longterm care theres also a role for the federal government says   Hes CEO of the SCAN Foundation one of the cosponsors of the study and was also recently chairman of the Federal Commission on LongTerm Care It would be good to have national standards for training   workers Chernof says We can help make sure that that training is good and adequate In California for example you need more training to be a cosmetologist to cut hair than you need to be a home care worker The costs of care  whether at home or in a nursing home  varied widely across the states But there wasnt one where care was affordable for most middleclass families The study found that home care services on average would consume  percent of the income of a typical older middleincome family For nursing home care it was  percent of income Thats why the study gave high grades to states that had adopted measures to improve the circumstances of family caregivers Because with the high costs of longterm care older adults will continue to rely on family caregivers even as their numbers dwindle
