                  So many factors affect our health whether its the behaviors we exhibit toward each other or the habits that we pass on to each other says psychologist Maryann Troiani PhD coauthor of   So whether youre dating casually shacking up or already married keep in mind these  key ways your romantic bond may influence your mind and body Its a common belief that couples let themselves go after pairing off and there may be something to it According to a    people tend to gain weight as they settle into marriage and lose weight when a marriage ends 
                   
                  But Troiani has seen the opposite happen quite often as well A happy couple can motivate each other to stay healthytheyll go to the gym together set goals and feel responsible for each other When couples do pack on the pounds she adds it may be a symptom of conflict not slacking off Dissatisfaction in the relationship can lead to passiveaggressive eating behaviors and sleep problems which will lead to weight gain she says Surprise surprise Regular physical intimacy appears to reduce stress and boost wellbeing One   published in  in the   found that people who frequently had sex were healthier mentally and more likely to report greater satisfaction with their relationship and life overall 
                   
                  Sex is just one aspect of a relationship however And your partners behavior outside the bedroom can just as easily send stress levels soaring in the opposite direction Parenting disputes   or even questions as simple as who does which household chores have been shown to increase stress Sex isnt the only type of physical contact that can lower stress and improve health In a    of  couples University of North Carolina researchers found that both men and women had higher blood levels of oxytocina hormone believed to  after hugging The women also had lower blood pressure posthug and lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol 
                   
                  These types of caring behaviors are so important a touch on the arm holding hands a rub on the shoulder Troiani says It only takes a few seconds of contact to stimulate those hormones and to help overcome stress and anxiety Sleeping next to someone you love and trust can help you fully relax and embrace sleep Troiani says A big exception to that rule of course is if your bedmate keeps you up at nightby snoring for instance or by tossing and turning In a    people were more likely to experience daytime fatigue and fitful sleep themselves if their partner was struggling with

                  These links can be difficult to untangle however since anxiety has been shown to breed relationship problems and not just vice versa Whats more some research suggests marriage may help protect against anxiety In a  World Health Organization   of  people in  countries those who were marriedhappily or otherwise the study didnt specifywere less likely to develop anxiety and other mental disorders Depression and anxiety often go hand in hand so it makes sense that relationships can affect depression in similarly complex ways On the one hand   have found that longterm relationshipsand marriage specificallycan ease symptoms in people with a history of depression 
                   
                  On the other hand fraught relationships have been shown to dramatically increase the risk of clinical depression In one small but highly cited   womenregardless of their personal and family history of depressionwere six times more likely to be clinically depressed if their husbands had been unfaithful or if their marriages were breaking apart Our romantic partners have a noticeable impact on how much alcohol we consume and how often One   which followed more than  couples during their first four years of marriage found that peoples drinking habits tended to mirror those of their spouse if their partner drank heavily they too were more likely to do so 
                   
                  Its also true that relationship conflict and a lack of intimacy can drive people to drink Research   that both men and women drink more in response to relationship problemsand excessive drinking in turn can add fuel to those problems A persons diet exercise habits and stress levels can all have an impact on blood pressure so its not surprising that your relationship statusand the strength of your relationshipcan too

                  Being in an unhealthy relationship causes your body to release stress hormones and your heart to beat faster says Troiani adding that those factors can push blood pressure up over time The link between relationships and cardiovascular health goes well beyond blood pressure Studies have consistently reported that being married is associated with a   and better outcomes after   especially for men 
                   
                  What explains this pattern Stress and other underlying biological factors including blood pressure are thought to be involved but the emotional and tangible support that partners provide likely plays a role as well Its the caring behaviorsaffectionate touches thoughtful actionsthat really make a difference in a persons recovery Troiani says In several studies supportive marriages have been shown to improve survival rates in people with cancer including prostate lung and colon cancer In a   of  million cancer patients published in   of married people lived for  years postdiagnosis compared with  of people who were never married  of divorcees and  of widows and widowers 
                   
                  People who were separated from their spouses fared worst of all with only  surviving for  years The loneliness and unexpected stress of going through a separation may have a negative effect on the bodys immunity the study authors noted Although it might seem like pestering at times a partners watchful eye and daytoday carewhether its pointing out worrisome symptoms or checking that youve taken your medicineseem to foster a healthier lifestyle and closer attention to health problems Case in point A  Canadian   found that married men experiencing chest pains tend to get to the hospital sooner than single ones regardless of whether their wives were even home at the time 
                   
                  People in healthy relationships really do take care of each other Troiani says and they may even feel more of an obligation to take care of themselves too Its not just your current relationships that can affect health but your past ones as wellespecially those that ended in hurt feelings and rejection In  researchers from Columbia University   that thinking about an exlover can have similar effects on the brain as physical pain
