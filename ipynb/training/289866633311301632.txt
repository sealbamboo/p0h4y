Its been only a few years since Congress granted the federal government the power to approve how tobacco products are made and sold in the US The Food and Drug Administrations new Center for Tobacco Products established under a  law that gives the agency jurisdiction over tobacco must review all new cigarettes or smokeless tobacco as well as any changes to existing brands But the agency has yet to clear any products under the new system and some cigarette makers are frustrated by the backlog of applications The FDA typically evaluates new drugs and other products with a safe and effective standard But Lawrence Deyton the Center for Tobacco Products director says that standard doesnt work for tobacco products Its Deytons job to figure out how a public health agency will regulate a consumer product that has proved to be addictive and deadly Because theres no safe way to smoke Deyton says the FDA is using whats called a population health standard to evaluate tobacco I sort of think of it as a ceiling of harm Deyton says Things will get no worse and any changes or new products that come on the market have to be appropriate for the protection of public health or raise no different questions of public health Tobacco companies have not yet asked the agency to approve any   products but they have submitted more than  applications for changes to existing brands  changes the companies say are so minor they dont raise any of those different questions The FDA has not approved any of the applications some pending for more than a year and a half Deyton says the applications are getting the appropriate scientific scrutiny and that he would rather get it right than get it fast Major cigarette makers declined to be interviewed by NPR for this story But in a petition filed with the FDA Lorillard which manufactures the Newport and Kent brands among others calls the inaction a de facto embargo on new product introductions  one that hampers competition Deyton says thats not the agencys intention Were absolutely not deliberately trying to slow products from getting to market he says What were doing is the scientific review that the law requires us to do But Jack Russo a tobacco industry analyst with the investment firm Edward Jones says the new regulatory framework is likely to slow the pace at which products get to the shelves Its going to be tough really to get any new product through says Russo who also notes that the apparent FDA logjam is frustrating for an industry looking to expand as more people quit smoking Getting any new product on the market might help a company outperform the competition a little bit in what is a very tough industry to grow Russo says So every little bit helps  but the FDA certainly isnt making it easy on anybody For their part antismoking activists believe the FDA hurdle is long overdue Danny McGoldrick vice president for research at the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids isnt at all troubled by tobacco companies not being able to get their products on the market as quickly as they would like The industrys history of innovation shows us that it tends to make the products more addictive more appealing and more harmful McGoldrick says And we dont need any more of that Some public health advocates would like to see the FDA crack down even harder on the tobacco industry by banning mentholflavored cigarettes and imposing tighter restrictions on advertising and marketing for example The agency has tried to mandate harsh new warning labels for packaging but cigarette makers have challenged them in court Stanton Glantz director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California San Francisco thinks the FDA should reject   applications for changes to tobacco products If making these changes wasnt  going to somehow positively affect sales the companies wouldnt be doing it Glantz says Because theyre in business to make money Money that is ever harder to make now that US smoking rates have remained stagnant at about  percent of the population for almost  years The question is whether the FDAs new role can further curtail tobacco use  the leading preventable cause of death in the country
