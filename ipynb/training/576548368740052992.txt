CP is not genetic It happens from trauma in utero at birth or within the first few months of life Common causes are lack of oxygen infections strokes premature birth and infant brain trauma In my case I was born on Labor Day and the doctor who delivered me was drunk as a skunk I came out fistfirst ready to fight the power The doctor panicked and cut my mom six different times in six different directions  He smothered me in the process and gave me the lifelong gift of CP Happy birthday to me  Today I am a touring standup comic who cannot stand up Within three minutes I begin to wilt lose my balance and topple over I can tap dance and run in heels but I need to use a wheelchair to navigate airports  I shake all the time Its exhausting and causes chronic pain in my joints and muscles It is also the only life I have ever known I use yoga dance nutrition and breathing to help manage my symptoms  I dont resent the fact that I have CP but I do resent the doctor He could have killed my mother and me  I am not ashamed of my disability CP does not define me but it is a part of me and shaped who I am today  Not everyone with CP is like me Our disability is a spectrum and its manifestation varies Some use wheelchairs while others walk independently Some are verbal and others use technology to express themselves  There are also those with CP who have multiple disabilities It is not a onesizefitsall disease In fact it is not a disease at all It is also not an intellectual disability  People with CP range from highly intelligent to whatever the politically correct opposite of that is   and we are the most underrepresented in media and entertainment Ableism is real and Hollywood is a repeat offender Folks like me are currently nowhere to be found on daytime or prime time TV  The most wellknown celebrity with CP is RJ Mitte from Breaking Bad He follows in the legendary wobbly footsteps of Geri Jewell who debuted on The Facts of Life in  I remember watching Geri and thinking Woah She has CP like me   Children with CP are considered cute while adults are ignored It is harder to find jobs housing and after age  it is hard to find a doctor who understands CP All the focus is on children Once we are adults the services disappear One of the biggest misconceptions is that people with CP especially those who are nonverbal cannot be educated Technology and legislation like the Americans with Disabilities Act have helped mainstream children with CP into the US school system Unfortunately this is not the case worldwide Nor was it always the case in America  When I started public school my parents had to sue the school to have me attend I do not believe I would be who I am today an actress on the Zlist destined to win an Oscar unless my parents had not fought for my right to an education There is still a long way to go including here in America If you ask me what I most want people to know about CP my answer is simple You dont need to cure us but you do need to respect us as equals  This is where I drop the mic because Im palsy and we tend to drop things and thats OK
