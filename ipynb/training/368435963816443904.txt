An Iowa woman recently discovered something worse than being overweight swallowing a parasitic worm in order to drop a few pounds  The woman went to her doctor and admitted shed bought a tapeworm off the Internet and swallowed it says Dr Patricia Quinlisk the medical director of the Iowa Department of Public Health The womans doctor understandably wasnt sure of what to do in such a situation and so he contacted the states public health department for advice This week Quinlisk relayed a warning and treatment advice in her weekly email to state public health workers Ingesting tapeworms is extremely risky and can cause a wide range of undesirable side effects including rare deaths Quinlisk wrote in the email as the Des Moines Register   Those desiring to lose weight are advised to stick with proven weight loss methods  consuming fewer calories and increasing physical activity There are a few different kinds of tapeworms but its the   or Taenia saginata that is usually used in these sorts of quick weightloss schemes Quinlisk says In the late th and early th centuries advertisements touted easy to swallow sanitized tape worms as a weapon against fat  the ENEMY that is shortening your life as one vintage ad recently showcased by the   reads More recently reports surfaced that   were swallowing tapeworms to lose weight And in  Tyra Banks  in which she interviewed women who said they would be willing to swallow a tapeworm if it really meant they could easily drop a few pounds  Quinlisk says that the capsules sold in the past by snake oil hucksters and online today likely contain the microscopic head of a Taenia saginata  When people would order from snake oil medicine kinds of people a weight loss pill it would be the head of a Taenia saginata  and it would develop into a footlong tapeworm in your body Quinlisk says The worm would get into your gut  its got little hooks on the head  and it would grab onto your intestine and start growing  And technically this parasitic infection called taeniasis does cause weight loss  Tapeworms will cause you to lose weight because you have this huge worm in your intestines eating your food Quinlisk says  At a dangerous disgusting cost The   include weight loss and loss of appetite in its list of the symptoms of taeniasis  a list also including abdominal pain and upset stomach Quinlisk adds that this could kill you  Also from the CDC The most visible sign of taeniasis is the active passing of proglottids tapeworm segments through the anus and in the feces In rare cases tapeworm segments become lodged in the appendix or the bile and pancreatic ducts To get the parasite out of a persons body doctors will usually prescribe an antiworm medication like praziquantel or niclosamide which force all the muscles in the worms body to contract killing it The tapeworm will then harmlessly pass through the intestines and out of the body Years ago Quinlisk volunteered for the Peace Corps and spent time in Nepal where she would see people suffering from tapeworms they swallowed while eating undercooked infested meat The tapeworms made these Nepalese Quinlisk saw very ill robbing them of many nutrients their food would have otherwise provided for them  I cant imagine anybody doing this on purpose she says  Diet historian Susan Yager just cannot believe people would use tapeworms to shed pounds Yager who studied the history of diets in America for her  book   says if people used tapeworms as a weight loss method either now or  years ago its likely a very small number The CDC for example says that the number of new tapeworm cases is probably fewer than   and many of those cases may be from undercooked beef or pork Probably some people have done it I have no question in my mind that people have done everything in the world to try to lose weight Yager says But I dont think it was ever widespread The only other diet that even halfway compares to the overthetop nature of the tapeworm diet Yager says might be the hCG diet in which dieters inject themselves with a hormone found in the urine of pregnant women The hCG diet was popular in the s and s and experienced a resurgence in recent years  Then theres absolute fasting Proponents of this one say you can live your life in exactly the way you always have you just dont get to eat any more ever again Yager says Its easy to make light of extreme dieting strategies but if a person is so desperate to lose weight theyre tempted to try something as horrific as inviting a foot parasitic worm to take up residence inside their intestines  well that could be a sign that theres a bigger issue happening here says New York City registered dietitian Elisa Zied I think thats a red flag  that they would be willing to sacrifice their health in order to lose weight says Zied who urges anyone considering an extreme weightloss plan to contact someone with a background in science like a dietitian or nutritionist or as a first step to visit a reputable website like      If you get to the point of desperation where you will try anything you need to just get back to the basics and really think about whats going on in your life and how youre eating and how youre being physically active she says
