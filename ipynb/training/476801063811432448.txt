If youve Googled tennis elbow or plantar fasciitis or Achilles tendon pain youve almost certainly come across plateletrich plasma a treatment that uses a persons own blood to create an injection intended to speed healing Youve also probably come across names like Kobe Bryant Maria Sharapova Rafael Nadal and Alex Rodriguez pro athletes who supposedly have availed themselves of the treatment But just because   and roared back to win the French Open doesnt mean it works Thousands of studies have been done on PRP but doctors say theyre still not sure whether it helps with chronic or acute injuries The most recent bit of confusion came Wednesday when French researchers   at a conference in Paris They gave  people with   a painful tendon irritation two injections four weeks apart Half the people got injections of PRP half got injections of saline Most people were painfree after a year but the people who got PRP did no better than people who got saltwater OK Im confused Welcome to the club says   a sports medicine doctor in Memphis Tenn and president of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons I do believe it has promise Azar told me But theres confusion at this point because the data does conflict Studies done in petri dishes show that the growth factors in platelets help tendons ligaments and muscle heal faster But randomized controlled trials like the French study are all over the map As one   put it rather tartly The observed trend towards benefit with PRP use still remains questionable One reason for the confusion may be that theres so much variation in the ways PRP is being used including body part being treated how the solution is prepared how its injected and even the type of injury thats being addressed Some doctors have used PRP to treat acute injuries like ankle sprains but most are using it for hardtotreat chronic injuries like   on the bottom of the foot PRP appears to be relatively safe Azar says aside from a small risk of infection or injury on a par with corticosteroid injections But it can painful and the pain can last for several weeks Patients need to be aware of that Azar says also that theres not enough data to support it And because of that your insurance almost certainly wont pay for PRP That means you can be on the hook for costs ranging from  to  for preparation of the solution and injection which is often guided by ultrasound Still Azar says At the end of the day I think were going to find certain pathologies that its good for He thinks they might include chronic tendon injuries like   tennis elbow and plantar fasciitis And if I dont feel like being a guinea pig Are you in a hurry Azar asks It will probably take another three to five more years to work through this
