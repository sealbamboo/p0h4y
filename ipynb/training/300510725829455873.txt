 What is your healthy eating motto Eat to live dont live to eat The more you know the more you can eat Learn about good nutrition to choose the best foods Eat everything thats fresh enjoy small treats which provide satisfaction dont obsess over food If it is not in the house you will not eat it When I buy cookies or chips for my yearold son I buy the types I do not like I do not tempt myself I may be a dietitian but I am human and I am tempted just like everyone else If I had brownies or Doritos or Oreos in the pantry I would eat them especially when I am relaxing at  pm watching my favorite TV shows That is a vulnerable time for me as well as for most people But I think of the health consequences and that I feel better when I am in shape so I do not buy them at all Be a Qualitarian It allows you to choose from all of the foods that exist in nature It means that you will give your body what it naturally recognizes as being best for it so that it functions most efficiently and as a result you get your best energy skin weight etc Make a choice Whether youre eating chocolate cake salad pizza or quinoa think about what youre going to eat make a choice eat it and dont feel guilty afterward If youre unsatisfied with your decision consider why and then decide how youre going to make a different choice in the future All foods can fit I encourage my clients to follow my  philosophy in that  percent of our foods should be nutrientrich while  percent of them can be less nutrientrich Depriving ourselves usually increases the risk of disordered eating and yoyo dieting Frontload your calories so you do not get too hungry Getting too hungry creates food problems When people get too hungry they not only eat but also overeat  and tend to choose the wrong foods That is they dont choose apples but apple pie They seek carrot cake rather than carrots I dont know if this is more of a tip or motto The fewer the legs the better when thinking of protein So think beans especially soybeans tofu then fish then poultry and finally the fourlegged sources Only keep nutritious foods in the home and at the office If you feel like chips cookies candy you will have to go out and buy it If you do decide to buy highcalorie lownutrient foods buy for one snack only not for the week Eat simple eat fresh eat at home All foods in moderation except for vegetables  no limit on those The base of your diet should be healthy  vegetables and fruits lean proteins whole grains low or nonfat dairy and healthy fats However other foods such as sweets alcohol and even fried food on occasion can fit into a healthy eating plan I often see people who are trying to eat healthy become overly fanatical with regard to limiting certain foods ie strictly limiting all carbs or fat What usually ends up happening is that they cant sustain this way of eating and end up going back to old behaviors I encourage people to take a more moderate approach Think of this as a way of eating for life mdash not for the short term Healthy eating has a longstanding bad reputation  and it needs to change Most of my clients realize very quickly that eating healthfully really can and does taste and make you feel great Each of us needs to reexplore foods tastes textures and flavors to discover what we really enjoy Fuel and nourish your body evenly throughout the day with lean protein fruits and vegetables healthy fats and highfiber carbohydrate choices Start eating when you feel hungry not starving and stop when you feel satisfied not stuffed All foods can be incorporated into a healthy diet in moderation Healthy eating can and should taste delicious The only food I dont eat is highly processed food Fullness  water  good fats  protein  fiber Fiber is often neglected in this equation Fullness does not hinge on protein alone Getting kids to eat right can be a lot of fun I say this because I have spent time with thousands of schoolchildren over the years and they will eat all kinds of things if they get involved in food preparation They also love to visit farms farmers markets ethnic grocery stores and grow foods in a home or school garden Eat lots of whole foods like fresh fruits vegetables lowfat dairy whole grains and lean protein There is no medicine more powerful or supplement more effective in promoting health and longevity than the combination of good nutrition with daily exercise My tagline is Helping you reach your nutrition goals one bite at a time and thatd be my healthy eating motto too We dont need diet overhauls but rather simple healthy eating tweaks that we can live with Healthy eating isnt perfect eating No one can eat perfectly  percent of the time without getting burnt out Aim to eat mostly healthful foods such as whole vegetables fruits whole grains and lean proteins  percent of the time allowing yourself to treat yourself with possibly less healthy foods you crave  percent of the time Eat right and still have fun Healthy eating does not have to be boring and leave your taste buds out in the cold If you dont enjoy your diet you will not stick to it no matter how beneficial it may be for your health Eating clean real foods that are close to nature is the best way to fuel your body I tell my clients to eat clean  percent of the time Eating clean means avoiding foods with artificial ingredients Choosing foods that are easy to pronounce You should not feel like you are taking a chemistry exam when you read the ingredient labels on your food
