Eating a bowl of cereal in the morning seems like such a simple thing but its close to impossible for some of the  million Americans who struggle with the tremors of Parkinsons disease There are also as many as  million Americans who have a disorder called essential tremor  sometimes mistaken for Parkinsons  which when severe also can make eating a struggle Thats obvious when Joe Bremhorst tries to eat a bowl of Cheerios His essential tremor is so strong that the cereal bounces right out of his spoon and back into the bowl No Cheerios make it as far as his mouth This is the problem that engineer Anupam Pathak wanted to solve He couldnt cure Bremhorsts tremor But he could develop a spoon that would cancel out its effects He calls the spoon   Theres no on switch the spoon starts up automatically when its lifted from the table The chunky handle vibrates a little in the users hand Theres a little motion sensor right near the spoon Pathak explains If I had tremor its going to move opposite to what the shaking is doing So if I move to the left itll physically move the spoon to the right And that cancels out the tremor as the spoon moves from plate to mouth In a   the Liftware spoon canceled out more than  percent of a users tremor I dont think it took us five minutes to say This is remarkable  says Sheila Garner who oversees twodozen senior and assisted living facilities in Northern California run by Brookdale Senior Living She was impressed enough with the Liftware spoon to order some for her residents with essential tremor Well be able to free up staff time from assisting people with eating Garner says But her focus she says is on restoring the dignity that her residents with essential tremor lost when they could no longer feed themselves Stabilizing technology has been around for a while Steadicam for example is used to shoot movies The Liftware device has to compensate for larger movements and still fit comfortably in the hand Pathak says he got the idea while still in grad school I was working on technologies for Army Research Lab  to stabilize rifles for soldiers in combat he says But that wasnt what really moved him Ive always had this sort of drive he says of wanting to make technologies with  very personal and immediate impact You can see that impact when Bremhorst digs into the bowl of Cheerios with the Liftware spoon Though his hand still shakes he doesnt drop a single O Bremhorst is part of an essential tremor support group that tested prototypes of the Liftware spoon While he now has a brain implant that can control his tremor he shut it off to participate in the tests The Liftware prototype was once a chunky thing with wires sticking out and a plastic picnicspoon taped to the end Sharon Alexander the facilitator of the support group says members gave Pathak a lot of feedback The product became available commercially last December  and at roughly  via the   or   its not cheap Pathak wouldnt disclose exactly how many he has sold but says its more than  So far Medicare and private insurance dont pay for the devices but a handful of Veterans Affairs medical centers do Meanwhile Pathak has raised enough money on the Internet and through foundations to give away a couple of hundred spoons to people who cant afford them And soon there will be new attachments A fork and a soup spoon should be available by the end of June Devices for holding a door key steady and for grabbing small objects are on the drawing board We want it to be kind of like a Swiss army knife says Pathak something to help stabilize the lives  and maintain the independence  of a lot of people with tremor
