A healthy woman has a routine mammogram to check for signs of breast cancer and the results arent normal Her doctors run further tests such as additional imaging or a biopsy Ultimately she gets a clean bill of health But what is the emotional cost of this falsepositive result This is the question that researchers try to answer in a study published online Monday by JAMA Internal Medicine The authors examined data from a large clinical trial of digital mammography and concluded that falsepositives produced a significant increase in anxiety though it was only temporary The researchers focused on  women   who had a falsepositive reading on a mammogram and  others of similar age who were tested at the same medical centers but had clean results None of women was diagnosed with breast cancer All of the women in the study completed questionnaires to assess their general health in the previous four weeks and their anxiety level at the time of their interviews The researchers attempted to talk to the women during the period after they were told their initial mammogram was concerning but before they learned there was nothing to worry about However some women werent reached until after they knew they were out of the woods All of the women were also asked about their breastrelated medical care in the year after their mammogram At baseline and again at their oneyear followup women in both groups rated their overall health highly  scoring an average of  on a scale that ranged from a low of  to a high of  However women in the falsepositive group had higher levels of anxiety On a scale from  least anxious to  most anxious the women who had falsepositive mammograms and were interviewed before they had gotten their final results scored a  on average those who were interviewed after they got the allclear scored an average of  By comparison the women with totally normal mammograms scored  on average The difference for the women with falsepositives was statistically significant that is too large to be due to chance After one year the average anxiety score among all of the women with falsepositive mammograms had dropped to  while the scores for the women with normal mammograms remained at  according to the study Not surprisingly women with falsepositive mammograms had more breastrelated medical treatment than women with normal mammograms For instance  of of those in the falsepositive group had a biopsy compared with only  of women with normal mammograms Researchers asked all of the women about their anxiety related to their followup care and found that  of those in the falsepositive group reported moderate a lot or extreme anxiety The corresponding figure for women with normal mammograms was  according to the study A commentary that accompanies the study makes the case that the researchers choice of survey methods probably underestimated the true anxiety of the women who had falsepositive test results In particular neither the anxiety survey nor the overall health survey asked questions specifically related to breast cancer Other studies that did were more sensitive in detecting patient distress after mammography with falsepositive results and they found that the distress lasted for up to three years the commentary said Regardless of their personal anguish or lack thereof the overwhelming majority of women in both groups  about   planned to have another mammogram in the next two years according to the new report About  of women in both groups said they would probably have moderate or worse anxiety if they got a falsepositive result in the future The figure was slightly higher for those who already had a falsepositive test but the difference wasnt big enough to be statistically significant Also all of the women were highly motivated to avoid falsepositive results in the future with about  of women in both groups saying they would be willing to travel up to four hours to get a hypothetical advanced type of mammogram that was just as good at catching cancers but had a lower rate of false positives Whats more nearly as many women in both groups said if they could choose theyd rather have a mammogram with fewer falsepositives than a mammogram with less breast compression Women are motivated to avoid falsepositive mammograms concluded the researchers who were from Dartmouth the University of Wisconsin Brown University the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill UC Davis and the Medical University of South Carolina In light of this clinicians must find better ways to talk with their patients about the reality of falsepositive mammograms wrote commentary author Dr Kurt Kroenke of the US Department of Veterans Affairs Center for Health Information and Communication in Indianapolis Thats especially true for patients in their s  an age group for which the net benefit of screening mammograms depends greatly on how women feel about harms like anxiety he wrote Other things he advised doctors to do to minimize anxiety for women included expediting their followup tests make sure radiologists have access to a patients previous mammograms to improve the accuracy of their reads and encourage women to get tested every other year instead of annually Over a year period the cumulative probability of getting at least one falsepositive result on a screening mammogram is  for women who get tested annually and  for women who get tested every other year Kroenke noted As a result a womans cumulative risk of getting a biopsy over that period is  for those who get annual mammograms and  for those who get screened every other year he wrote  The American College of Radiology sought to downplay the mental anguish associated with falsepositives reminding everyone that anxiety regarding inconclusive test results is real and is only natural In   released Monday the organization even suggested that by asking women to recall their anxiety studies of this type could make things worse by prolonging whatever emotional pain they have In terms of benefits vs harms of breast cancer screening short term anxiety regarding test results does not equate to dying from breast cancer the ACR said in its statement The proven benefits of breast cancer screening far outweigh any harm According to National Cancer Institute data since mammography screening became widespread in the mids the US breast cancer death rate unchanged for the previous  years has dropped more than  percent While screening deserves much of the credit many experts also attribute the sharp decline to   during that period Thats one of the reasons why the US Preventive Services Task Force   that women at average risk for breast cancer continue to get screening mammograms though less often    and like   on
