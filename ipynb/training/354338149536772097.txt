Here is what happened to my daughter Therese Allison when she tried to be just the sort of shrewd and informed patient that politicians should love Therese is more than seven months pregnant and uninsured  in fact she is uninsurable   is a preexisting condition so she cant get   at any price And now that the birth of her baby is imminent she wants to find out what a delivery will cost maybe even negotiate a price for this   In a way shes lucky She and her husband who are selfemployed live in New Jersey so she qualifies under a littleknown and unadvertised law that caps hospital expenses for uninsured people with incomes less than five times the poverty level Under the law a hospital can charge  percent of what it accepts from   for the same services Although most Medicare beneficiaries are  or older the federal program also includes younger people who are disabled As a result Medicare covers pregnancies California New York and as of last year Colorado have   but none are as generous as New Jerseys Her Alice in Wonderland tale began in June when Thereses   offered to call the two hospitals she uses and get their prices Therese is planning and fervently hoping to have a normal vaginal delivery without an epidural anesthetic and to leave the hospital the next day Elmer Hospital in Elmer NJ said it would charge  for a normal delivery without an epidural and with no complications Newborn care would be  more Kennedy University Hospital in Washington Township refused to say but told the midwife that Therese could apply for   or New Jersey Family Care she does not qualify for either and could apply for charity care if she was turned down If accepted she would have to pay only a fraction of what the hospital charged But what would the hospital charge The hospital was mum saying it could not give a price because if Therese needed additional services its quote would be wrong Therese called the hospitals herself But all she heard  after calling Kennedy University Hospital three times and asking for a price  was two voice mail messages In one she was told to apply for New Jersey Family Care In the other she was told to apply for Medicaid Isnt there a law Therese asked me requiring hospitals to reveal their prices I asked Uwe Reinhardt a Princeton health care economist who is a frequent contributor to The New York Times No he said Hospitals do not have to tell you their prices and often they keep them secret until they send the bill When I was chair of the New Jersey commission on hospitals two years ago my wife at my behest tried to get a price for a normal delivery from the Princeton Medical Center Dr Reinhardt said She pretended to be an uninsured entrepreneur earning  a year She got nowhere I then called to try out a   I got nowhere too The commission then recommended that all hospitals be required to list their prices for their top  procedures That never happened but instead the New Jersey Legislature passed   limiting hospital charges for the uninsured with low incomes The problem though is that even if you know what a hospital charges you may not be able to find out what Medicare pays Medicare publishes a   with its payments for the  most popular hospital procedures and treatments in  hospitals across the country Pregnancy is not on the list Even people with insurance can have a hard time finding out what they will have to pay After my inquiry Dr Reinhardt did a little sleuthing Private insurers he said claim they let patients know what their outofpocket costs are likely to be So he checked UnitedHealthcares Web site First he put in normal delivery Nothing came up He tried vaginal delivery Nothing Then he tried another common procedure an   Nothing I called the UnitedHealth hot line and asked the lady there to help me find the cost estimates as they are called for normal delivery and appendectomy Dr Reinhardt wrote in an email She couldnt find the items either It is all so pathetic he said Last month Senator Charles E Grassley Republican of Iowa and Senator Ron Wyden Democrat of Oregon introduced a measure to make Medicare reveal what it pays providers for every service Mr Wyden said the uninsured could use the data to negotiate as could people with health care savings accounts A searchable list of Medicare payments should be a fundamental service Mr Wyden said Every single person in government tells people Oh youve got to make good choicesÂ  he said in an interview But patients have their hands tied They cant get costs and they cant find out about quality If that bill were law Thereses problem would be solved But for now she needed some extra help to find out what those two hospitals were allowed to charge So I emailed Donald McLeod a Medicare spokesman and asked for assistance He got the answers Medicare would pay Elmer Hospital  for a normal delivery without an epidural and  for newborn care Kennedy is a teaching hospital so it gets bigger payments  for a normal delivery and  for newborn care I finally called Kennedy Health System identifying myself as a reporter and not surprisingly was given a price The systems president and chief executive Martin A Bieber called to tell me A normal delivery is approximately  and newborn care costs about  And he added Kennedy charges all uninsured patients those prices which are  percent of the Medicare rates no matter what their income In a way even with the overcharges by Elmer its prices  and Kennedys  look like a bargain Dartmouth   says it charges the uninsured about  for a normal delivery and newborn care Meanwhile Therese found the bill for her previous pregnancy She had a normal delivery with no epidural in December  and refused all extras even Tylenol She was insured and her baby was born at the University of Pennsylvania Her insurers negotiated price
