The number of middleaged men with prescriptions for   is climbing rapidly raising concerns that increasing numbers of men are abusing the powerful hormone to boost their libidos and feel younger researchers reported on Monday Testosterone replacement therapy is approved specifically for the treatment of abnormally low testosterone levels a condition called   The hormone helps build muscle reduce body fat and improve sex drive But a study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine found that many men who get prescriptions for the hormone have no evidence of a deficiency at all The new study is the largest of testosterone prescribing patterns to date involving nearly  million men who were tracked through a large health insurer The report showed that the number of older and middleaged men prescribed the hormone has tripled since  Men in their s represent the fastestgrowing group of users About half of men prescribed testosterone had a diagnosis of hypogonadism and roughly  percent had erectile or sexual dysfunction One third had a diagnosis of fatigue The medical group that sets clinical guidelines for testosterone replacement therapy the   recommends treatment only in men who have unequivocally low testosterone levels That finding requires a blood test But the new report found that a quarter of men did not have their levels tested before they received the hormone It was also unclear what proportion of men who did undergo testing actually had results showing a deficiency Testosterone therapy can cause thickening of the blood   and reduced sperm counts Many doctors worry that it also raises the risk of heart disease and   though some experts say that those concerns are unproved   the lead author of the new research said that the safety of longterm testosterone use had yet to be established in good studies I think these relatively healthy men who are starting testosterone at age  are potentially going to be exposed for a very long time and we dont know what the risks are said Dr Baillargeon an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston In men testosterone levels normally begin a gradual decline after the age of  The average levels for most men range from  to  nanograms per deciliter of blood But testosterone levels can fluctuate so greatly depending on so many factors  sleep the time of day medication  that many men who fall into the hypogonadal range one day will have normal levels the next Some studies estimate that up to  percent of men ages  to  have a true deficiency though only a small percentage actually develop clinical symptoms like depression hot flashes and    an endocrinologist at the University of California Los Angeles and an author of the Endocrine Societys treatment guidelines said the recommendations were quite clear that treatment is for men who have had blood tests showing a testosterone deficiency as well as symptoms consistent with the disorder I dont think its appropriate for patients to be treated for hypogonadism without chemical evidence to support it he said Dr Abraham Morgentaler a professor of urology at Harvard Medical School and the author of   said the findings were a good sign that more testosterone deficiencies were being diagnosed and treated While many doctors worry about the side effects of testosterone abuse he said there are also studies showing that men with low testosterone levels have shorter life spans and an increased risk of   heart disease and   Aging is associated with bad vision bad hearing bad teeth bad arteries bad joints and   and we treat all of these things Dr Morgentaler said I think its an unfair stretch to say that because something is common or natural that we shouldnt treat it
