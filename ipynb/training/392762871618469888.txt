Consumers arent the only ones frustrated by problems with the online health insurance exchanges being run by the feds Private companies that sell health insurance on the Internet are also in a bind Websites like   that were planning to start selling new subsidized health care policies on Oct  still cant offer them to customers First the online brokers got a late start They didnt get permission to sell exchange plans until late July And the companies say theyre still working with federal website engineers to ensure that connections between their sites and the governments are fully functional The Obama administration declined to comment on the nature of the problems that have the online brokers stuck EHealthInsurancecom has been selling health coverage online since  Then the Affordable Care Act passed and the federal government said it was going to open online insurance shopping sites   CEO of eHealth the company behind the site fought long and hard for the right for private firms like his to sell subsidized policies too The government finally relented But at this point many consumers still cant shop for these plans on commercial sites and Lauer says he has no firm date for when theyll be able to I hope in the next few weeks and Ive been saying that for the past couple of weeks Lauer says Were somewhat dependent on this federal exchange working in a stable fashion Telling potential customers theyll have to come back later is a problem for companies like Lauers and for the White House But   with the consulting firm Avalere Health says if the White House is going to reach the goal of getting  million Americans signed up for health coverage in the laws first year then it needs electronic brokers help I think theyre very important and I think particularly because theyve been in the business for a long time theyve really refined an easy shopping experience Pearson says Many of the people who are eligible for subsidies in the exchange are folks that already have shopped with eHealth EHealth she says has a slick display and strong functionality that are going to be very appealing to consumers So I think they represent a very important partner to the government assuming they can get full data from the federal government and get up and running fully sometime soon she says The federal government is not commenting on why online brokers arent able to start selling or when theyll be able to But in the meantime eHealths Lauer says his company is offering rain checks to shoppers who qualify for new subsidies to help them afford insurance and hoping theyll come back Were in communication with the federal government every day Lauer says And its just occurring slower than we would like Were being patient and were working with them constructively because we want to get this up and running and available to people who are lower income I just think its critically important Although uncertainty is bad for business these online brokers arent totally dead in the water They can still sell health policies to people who dont qualify for subsidies Lauer says his company is still selling plenty of those And the health care law is substantially boosting traffic to his site But people with subsidies represent a huge new market and commercial online brokers still cant offer them the product the federal health care law requires If were collectively late by a few weeks sure its a glitch but big picture its still a small bump in the road says   CEO and cofounder of the startup company   which was hoping to start selling subsidized health care policies online on Oct  too Krishnan is disappointed his company still isnt able to do that But as long as the government fixes its website in the next few weeks he says he thinks ebrokers will be OK The reality is that most folks have until Dec  to make their final purchase decision Krishnan says Were recommending that they use this early period to learn about their options educate themselves not rush to a decision Avaleres Pearson agrees that online brokers can probably weather problems for the first few weeks but she says theyre understandably nervous about when the bugs might be worked out I mean thats the milliondollar question at this point that everybody is asking Pearson says We have seen gradual improvements over time but at this point its really hard to predict when well have a smooth shopping experience
