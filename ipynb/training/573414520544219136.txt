Last week the Mirror Online    a year old breast cancer patient who has refused the surgery and chemotherapy her doctors advised electing instead to try and treat her condition with an intense regime of raw food and supplements While nobody would dispute Logans right to make her own choices about her body theres little doubt at this point that raw vegetables cannabis oil and herbal supplements are not the answer oncology has thus far been overlooking Yet despite medical developments over the last  years   theres no shortage of voices within the the socalled alternative movement advising seriously ill cancer patients to abandon proven medicine for the latest rumoured natural cancer cure Although most of the treatments promoted by wellmeaning but ultimately illinformed alternative cancer activists merely offer no benefit some can be actively dangerous in their own right Laetrile extracted from apricot kernels and often known as Vitamin B   Black salve   linked via the Mirror article is a herbal paste designed to burn away the skin allegedly searing out cancerous tumours along the way leaving an open hole in the patients flesh I strongly advise against Googling the horrifying results  the images require the strongest of stomachs Alternative treatment regimes such as   or   cost patients tens of thousands of pounds and require adherence to an overbearing and deeply uncomfortable schedule  Prof Edzard Ernst an internationallyrespected researcher in the field of alternative medicine is unequivocal on the lack of evidence for such treatments There is no alternative cancer treatment that would cure cancer or prolong the life of cancer patients he told me There will always be patients and consumers who go on the internet to find out about healthrelated matters and in the course of it get everything wrong that one can possibly get wrong It is sad enough that they are subsequently prone to harming themselves through their lack of insight If however such a story then gets written up and published in an uncritical sensational fashion it becomes an issue that concerns us all Here perhaps is the most worrying aspect of the Mirrors report last week the uncritical portrayal of Logans choice as that of the defiant mother who would rather heal herself with herbal remedies than be pumped full of chemotherapy by doctors who are biased towards conventional treatment The only note of caution in the article came in the form of a quote from Macmillan   Support at the very end of the story long after many readers may already have been given the impression that Logans story  and with it her medical advice  is worth following It seems clear that in failing to highlight the dangers of following the advice contained within the article the Mirror implicitly endorsed it  certainly a look at the comments left on   show no shortage of agreement as well as further suggested cures from eager commenters Perhaps most frustratingly of all the very apricot kernel supplements pictured and praised in the Mirrors latest article were   labelled potentially toxic and sold by a conman in the same publication When I put it to the Mirror that this article was irresponsible in its uncritical promotion of dangerous alternative cancer treatments a spokesperson told me The story you refer to came from Caters News Agency  the bylined journalist works for them It was also carried by the Mail and on ITV Good Morning Britain  While its true that both   and   covered the story both recognised the need to temper the promotion of these unproven treatments with advice from qualified experts The Mail whose willingness to speculate on the causes and cures of cancer has in the past made them the subject of numerous online spoofs specifically sought out and prominently included additional advice from a medical oncologist and Cancer Research UK For the Mirror to publish so irresponsible an article and then to attempt to absolve themselves of responsibility for the claims they elected to publish and promote under their own masthead is quite frankly astonishing Ernst was equally shocked by the Mirrors response Journalists and newspaper editors have a considerable responsibility to inform the public responsibly This article is a textbook example for irresponsible coverage of a health matter that concerns thousands of readers  Articles like this one are extremely regrettable they jeopardise the efforts of the many professionals who work tirelessly to improve the prospects of cancer patients In short they have the potential to kill many patients I contacted Logan to ask if she felt her advice may lead people to turn away from evidencebased treatments in favour of those promoted on her blog She explained In regards to cannabis oil there are thousands of testimonials from people all over the world who have healed using it Laetrile has numerous success stories The reason why there isnt scientific evidence is because its being suppressed  As I stated in my interview this is my choice for me and my life I am not in any way promoting anybody to follow me everyone has to go on their own journey My blog is for those who are open minded and who have maybe looked into it themselves but didnt know where to look so it covers most alternatives I am not promoting people not to have chemotherapy I am asking people to research as its their life The timing of the Mirror article provides a tragic footnote not only was it published the week after the release of Logans detox ebook but it appeared the day before the death from cancer of   Ainsough was a young woman faced with a serious diagnosis who elected to treat her cancer with a regime of supplements and juices gaining regular positive coverage in the media and recommending her lifestyle to a social media following of tens of thousands of people before her ultimately untimely and tragic death at the age of  last week The parallels between the uncritical media coverage of these two stories are hard to ignore
