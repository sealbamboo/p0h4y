More than 6 million Americans in total have enrolled for individual insurance plans for 2015 through HealthCare.gov, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said on Tuesday.. HealthCare.gov sells individual plans created by the national healthcare reform law in 36 states. The rest of the states, including California and New York, have their own online exchanges and those figures are not included in these latest numbers.. About 1.9 million new customers have signed up. The balance — or 4.5 million people — are re-enrollments, Burwell said during a webcast press briefing. And roughly 30 percent of those re-enrollments included people who actively signed up for coverage in 2015, she added.
