When Henry Wanyoike and Joseph Kibunja first started running it was out of necessity The childhood friends had no other way to travel the three miles from their Kenyan village to school So they made the barefoot trek every day in both directions regardless of weather Thirty years later Wanyoike and Kibunja are still running together only now theyre headed to the finish lines of races around the world  and often getting there first Although Kenya is known for producing champion runners the duo stands out Wanyoike is blind and Kibunja serves as his guide In  two years after graduating from high school as a track star Wanyoike suffered a stroke He lost his sight and thought hed never run again Three years later at a rehabilitation center someone suggested he try with a partner To his amazement it worked And it worked even better once his pal Kibunja took on the guide role They stay sidetoside and hold a footlong blue and green rope between them  in Wanyoikes right hand and Kibunjas left Through a combination of verbal and physical cues Kibunja indicates when they need to turn avoid an obstacle and of course speed up to stay ahead of the competition The technique has allowed them to win gold medals at multiple   set world records including the fastest blind marathon in just  and serve as an example for just about everyone they meet Our message is that we need to work together We can achieve more with combined effort Wanyoike says just after leading a group fun run at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington DC last month He and Kibunja were part of the Kenyan delegation showcasing their culture to visitors on the National Mall The power of Wanyoikes story says Kenyan singer Linda Muthama has made him one of the most beloved people in the country She even sings a song about him He dreamed he overcame The dream of many young Kenyans is to become a professional athlete Running or soccer can provide enough income to take care of a family even a community But running isnt just for the pros Wanyoike believes A marathon is quite hard So if you can do a marathon and then get another job to do youll do it even better Wanyoike says Hes established the   which organizes a number of programs to reach out to young people both disabled and not We use sports especially running to bring communities together Wanyoike explains You might come from a humble background but there are opportunities By focusing on athletics he adds youth can learn not to get into drugs and things that wouldnt be helpful The foundations major annual event is the Hope for the Future K race which attracts thousands of participants and raises funds to provide wheelchairs walking sticks and scholarships for disabled students Wanyoikes dream is to develop a fullfledged sports academy where students can train in any sport Athletic achievements are even more critical for anyone with a disability adds Wanyoike who knows firsthand how much running boosted his confidence But both Wanyoike and Kibunja recognize that many disabled Kenyans arent getting all the opportunities they should Things for people with disabilities are very expensive Kibunja says That includes wheelchairs which are also nearly impossible to fix The spare parts you cant find them and guide dogs there are none Hed also like to see Kenya build better infrastructure Roads in the US arent bumpy he marvels When it rains in Kenya the road is slippery and we have to stop training Here the roads are smooth so you can run any time any day Unfortunately one thing Kenya has imported from the US is an unhealthy lifestyle thats contributing to a growing obesity problem Kibunja says Kids in their small village ride buses to school now and in Nairobi  kilometers away  hardly anyone walks anywhere he added The ways have changed Diabetes and high blood pressure so many people are suffering from these diseases Wanyoike laments We used to have organic food  we got it from the garden But now we are going to junk food Still Wanyoike is optimistic for the future The Kenyan government is encouraging more activity in schools and teaching people about proper nutrition he says He predicts that as the economy strengthens conditions will improve Even at the age of  Wanyoike is certain he will improve He and Kibunja look forward to breaking their own records at the Rio Paralympics in  But there are many races to go before then Up next tomorrows K   in London
