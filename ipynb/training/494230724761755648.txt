Small fatty fish like mackerel herring sardines and anchovies are high in     and low on the food chain Those shining attributes have earned them plenty of nods from doctors and environmentalists alike as weve   Theyre not among the   in the US though partly because of their fishy taste But if you knew that eating these fish would mean shrinking your carbon footprint a wee bit would that convince you to buy them over say that bag of frozen shrimp you just mindlessly threw into your grocery cart  is betting that if you care about eating greener youll want to know about how much fuel it takes to catch your favorite fish Hes a PhD candidate from Nova Scotia studying the fishing industry at the University of Tasmania in Australia Parker and   who directs the School for Resource and Environmental Studies at Dalhousie University in Halifax recently published an analysis of a fishing industry fuel use database Tyedmers developed Their analysis finds that fisheries producing the small fish  sardines mackerel and anchovies  are among the most energy and carbonefficient forms of protein production The paper appeared in the journal   on July  They also found that fishing for shrimp and lobster are almost as fuelintensive as raising livestock As weve   raising livestock has more of an impact on the environment than any other food we eat For example Parker says to catch a metric ton about  pounds of sardines or anchovies it takes about  gallons of fuel In contrast to get the same amount of lobster or shrimp youd burn an average of  to  gallons of fuel Now US and Canadian lobster outfits are a bit more efficient because of the higher lobster biomass in the ocean he says But they are still burning close to  gallons of fuel to catch those  pounds of crustacean So why is all this fuel getting burned As the fishing industry has evolved in the last century from throwing out a few lines over the local dock to industrialized operations weve been able to fish in more parts of the ocean and freeze our catch right on the boats And the boats  not the packing plants or trucks transporting fish to the store  are where the bulk of the burn comes from Parker says The energy needed to get fish to the dock accounts for  to  percent of the fishing industrys total energy use and emissions Fuel is the second biggest cost in fish production says Parker and labor is first so to encourage more efficient fisheries  and fewer greenhouse gas emissions  we should be implementing measures shown to decrease fuel consumption And what people do with the fish is inefficient too Much of the mackerel sardines and anchovies get turned to livestock and   rather than going right to hungry humans So were taking an efficient system and making it part of an average or inefficient system he says But getting more people to eat these fish is a tough sell at least on this side of the Atlantic Parker himself admits that he wasnt always a herring fan but on a trip to Denmark thats what was served at the hotel breakfast so he gave it a try Now hes a believer If you have pickled herring its one of the most delicious things he says Parker acknowledges that his fuel and fishing study has some limitations For starters its largely built from fisheries data from Europe and Australia where the best records are kept as well as some from North America The database does not have much data on fuel use and fishing in the developing world  yet Also he notes fisheries are not generally giant offenders when it comes to the food systems carbon emissions Fisheries in general have a relatively low carbon footprint when it comes to food  they dont have   associated with cows and feed costs he says But they hope their work goes beyond emissions Were looking at all the different factors now  we need to feed people we need to support rural communities we need to provide healthy and high quality food to people  one niche issue is the role of fisheries in fuel consumption
