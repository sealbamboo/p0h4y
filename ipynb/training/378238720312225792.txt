Physical and sexual abuse of children has gone down over the past  years but reports of neglect have gone up a panel of experts reports on Thursday And the biggest threats to any child are the parents Its not clear why either trend is happening the panel at the Institute of Medicine says  although its very welcome news to see sexual and other physical abuse on the decline It may be because of increased awareness in the population that its something that has a profound impact on children and should be reported says Dr Angela Diaz professor of pediatrics at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and one of the panel members Dr Lolita McDavid medical director of child advocacy and protection at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland says she believes awareness explains a lot I think we are much more aware now that there is physical and sexual abuse and I think we do a much better job of making families and children understand that McDavid told NBC News We are empowering children But the experts say its vital to look into the reasons that physical abuse may be going down yet neglect and emotional abuse are staying at the same levels They call for sustained federal research into whats going on and a new database to track child abuse statistics Even if numbers are going down overall many children are abused and neglected in the United States the panel of experts reports Each year more than  million referrals for child abuse and neglect are received that involve around  million children although most of these reports are not substantiated the report reads In fiscal year  the latest year for which data are available state child protective services agencies encountered  children or about  of every  children who were found to be victims of child abuse and neglect including physical abuse sexual abuse psychological abuse and medical and other types of neglect More than  of the children most under age  died because of the abuse or neglect The report which is mean to inform and advise federal policymakers and Congress quotes data from the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data It shows that about threequarters of reported cases in  were classified as neglect about  percent as physical abuse and about  percent as sexual abuse About  percent of perpetrators are parents  percent of whom are biological parents More than half of perpetrators are female the Institute an independent nongovernment organization says in a statement Rates of child maltreatment fell from  per  children in  to  in  But rates of neglect stayed the same at  per  Rates of physical abuse fell from  per  children to  and rates of sexual abuse fell from  to  Sexual abuse has shown the largest decline in reported rates the report adds One study shows sexual abuse down  percent since Â  The sharpest declines occurred during the late s but the downward trajectory has continued with a  percent decline being reported between  and  the report reads But the report says these numbers are likely to be underestimates For example the most recent National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect from  to  estimated that the rate of child abuse and neglect was  of every  children totaling more than  million children and many more were determined to be at risk the Institute says Police teachers neighbors and relatives are all likely to be reluctant to report abuse and neglect the panel of experts says And this costs both children and society The thing that surprises some people sometimes is that neglect has pernicious effects across all domains of development as does abuse says Mary Dozier chair of child development at the University of Delaware and a panel member We see this all the way from growth to illness to things like diabetes and all kinds of other illnesses the frequency with which children miss school and so forth Dozier said in a telephone interview  There are some known mechanisms  stress can affect the glands that secrete hormones in turn affecting growth and the immune system And theres also a growing body of evidence that childhood stress can affect the genes McDavid says it reaches across generations She sees it when she sees her patients in the pediatrics clinic and counsels them about protecting themselves from abuse I have had mothers who get tearful because they were molested as children and because they didnt tell or nobody believed them when they told she says Pediatricians are much more proactive in helping families that may be under stress We now talk about such things There was a time when we didnt talk about it
