The sexy male model makes bedroom eyes and says Malaria The sexy female model twirls her glossy hair in a flirtatious manner and says Diarrhea Its part of a  minute  second public service spot called The Most Important Sexy Model Video Ever And no its not a spoof  the aid organization founded in  wanted to come up with a public service spot to promote its cause A staffer lamented Moms and kids dying is just not a sexy issue And from those words a sexy ad was born Josh Ruben and Vincent Peone who have made videos for the website   came up with an idea They hired models to be part of a sexy new campaign says Peone We kept it very vague The models were told to read cue cards Then the director says Keep it sexy and really pour it on this time The models struggle to make statistics about maternal and child death and the names of diseases sound sexy This is not a sexy statement one says Another has to take a walk to collect himself After filming the models were told they were part of a Save the Children video Watching the models squirm is a bit uncomfortable Feeling that discomfort at least for me was part of what made the video really work says Save the Children CEO Carolyn Miles The purpose was to get people to look at things like the   we released this week If I just put that message out there we know a lot of people will tune out Both Miles and Peone are happy with the ad which was produced mainly with donated services although the unsuspecting models were paid There are two big questions to ask Is this weird or what And will it be effective Yes it is weird Weird almost obscene says   a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development But I think it likely to work with people who might otherwise immediately switch news feeds or type TLDR Confession I had to look that up It means Too long didnt read As for the ads effectiveness it is too soon to tell   professor of communications and psychology at Ohio State University doesnt think it will accomplish much He ran a   that looked at how well  subjects remembered an ad shown during a television program with sexual content compared with  subjects who viewed the same ad during a neutral program Those who watched sexy programs showed poorer memory of the ad compared with the ones who watched nonsexy shows Bushman reports  because they were distracted by the sex Sex doesnt sell he says The more intense the sexual content the more it draws attention away from the products Indeed some of the comments for the   talk about how hot the models are But others talk about the issues of child and maternal health The hope is that some of those folks will click on the learn more slug at the end and perhaps make a donation As for the possible controversy over the sexy angle controversy is nothing new to Save the Children The organizations founder Eglantyne Jebb was arrested in  for posting pictures of starving children in Londons Trafalgar Square Putting up pictures was illegal at the time In court the judge said hed pay her fine because he believed in what she was doing Dare I say it Now thats pretty sexy
