Talk to women here in the office and it quickly becomes clear that were confused about what to do about mammograms And no wonder Two months ago a widely publicized Canadian   found that mammograms did not reduce breast cancer deaths but that study was fiercely criticized by the nations radiologists as   A few weeks earlier an    ound that screening all women annually starting at age  as the American Cancer Society recommends costs  billion more a year more than following the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation that women be screened every other year starting at age  Now the latest entries  two studies that try to put all the previous research on mammographys harms and benefits in perspective First researchers at Harvard took a broad look at all the research on mammograms since   more than  years of study They also looked at evidence on the harms of false positives and overdiagnoses in which a woman is treated for a cancer that would never have proved deadly And they reviewed whether current efforts to try to personalize a womans cancer risk helped a woman figure out whether it was worth her while to get a mammogram Their conclusion The benefits of mammography though real have been oversold while the harms have been minimized Annual mammograms reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer by about  percent but the benefit varies widely based on a womans age and underlying cancer risk the study found For instance about  women in their s would have to be screened to prevent one death compared with just  women in their s Thats because breast cancer becomes much more common as a woman ages At age  a womans risk of getting breast cancer in the next  years is  percent At age  its  percent And a yearold has a  percent risk in the next decade The   were published Tuesday in   the journal of the American Medical Association The analysis found that about  percent of women who are diagnosed with breast cancer as a result of a mammogram are overdiagnosed  getting surgery chemotherapy or radiation to treat a cancer that would never be lifethreatening The bottom line the researchers say is that mammography is a lessthanperfect screening test and doctors and patients need a lot more help figuring out if and when to use it Decisions about mammography should involve discussion of risks benefits uncertainties alternatives and patient preferences the authors write And women age  and older really need to consider whether they should be having mammograms at all a second   in   reports As the researchers point out there are no randomized controlled trials of mammography in women in that age group So theres no way to know how much they might extend a womans life So the harms of screening probably outweigh any benefits in women who will live for less than  years the researchers say and women who think they will live longer than that should talk with their doctors about the benefits and risks
