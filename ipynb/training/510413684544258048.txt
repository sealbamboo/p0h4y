A string of Republican candidates for Senate are supporting an issue usually associated with Democrats easier access to contraception Theyre supporting it on the road and in ads like one from antiabortion conservative Cory Gardner In it he says he believes the pill ought to be available over the counter round the clock without a prescription Tom Tillis and Ed Gillespie also antiabortion conservatives have made similar statements Some of them have been associated with state legislation to restrict abortions or with socalled personhood amendments that would give constitutional rights to fertilized eggs So what gives First of all Republicans are in a deep hole with female voters and polls show all voters are less likely to support candidates who restrict womens reproductive rights Republican strategist Katie Packer Gage says the GOP needed to get out of its defensive crouch She says when Republicans saw what happened to Mitt Romney in  where womens groups very falsely and very aggressively attacked him claiming that he wanted to do away with birth control the party started to say Look were going to have to play offense on this message because otherwise were going to be totally misdefined by our opponents  Calling for an overthecounter pill allows Republicans to support access to birth control while also supporting the right of corporations to avoid covering it Getting the pill at a pharmacy without a prescription leaves insurers and employers out of the picture altogether But some Republicans are having trouble with their new talking points Colorado Rep Mike Coffman stumbled on the issue in a recent debate I am just prolife and Im proud of that And uh I do not support personhood But uh I support a womans access to to um certainly to  this Hobby Lobby decision  to uh to get   At that excruciating moment Coffman is rescued by the audience which feeds him the word hes been looking for birth control The exchange is followed by laughter but Democrats do not find this the least bit funny It really is quite ironic that suddenly now the Republican Party and candidates after voting repeatedly to take away birth control access for women are trying to kind of do this before the November elections says Cecile Richards president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America It has no credibility based on their voting records  What it demonstrates is how important womens health is as an issue to women voters and how important it will be in this election she says Planned Parenthood is also for overthecounter birth control But so far no drug company has asked the FDA for permission to sell contraception over the counter Democratic pollster Celinda Lake says Democrats should respond to Republicans with an argument about cost and fairness because insurers generally do not cover overthecounter medicine and the pill can cost  a year When voters hear that Republicans support your employer denying coverage for birth control when Viagra is still covered theyre very angry about it she says When we make the argument it really backfires because women say this is going to cost me  and this is a very cynical ploy But Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway says Republicans have finally found a way to blunt the Democrats charge that the GOP is conducting a socalled war on women Whats happened with the overthecounter birth control issue is that the Democrats didnt see it coming says Conway They think that theyve got a monopoly on talking to women from the waist down Anything that has to do with reproduction and birth control and abortion  they call it womens health then they call it womens issues They feel like how dare the loyal opposition go ahead and take them on and really neutralize and defang this issue Theres no doubt Republicans are trying harder this election year to appeal to women which is a big difference from the past two cycles when some GOP candidates alienated female voters with comments about rape and unwanted pregnancies Republicans know they cant eliminate the gender gap altogether they just hope to shrink it enough to win elections
