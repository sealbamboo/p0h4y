Your pets may feel like members of your family but that doesnt make them human Foods and medications that are harmless to youor even healthy for youcan actually be fatal for a dog or cat Their bodies are different from ours and while you probably know better than to let your furry friends near obviously harmful household chemicals and cleaners the list doesnt stop there   by storing these other dangerous items out of their reach If you suspect your pet has eaten something he shouldnt contact your vet or poison control center immediately Dont wait it out it can make the difference between life and death says Karen Doc Halligan doctor of veterinary medicine and chief veterinary officer for the Lucy Pet Foundation
