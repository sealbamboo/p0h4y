Brain tissue samples from children with autism look markedly different than the brain tissue of other kids researchers say The physiological differences could explain many of the wellknown symptoms of autism spectrum disorders and they suggest that the developmental problems that lead to autism begin before birth A group of scientists from around the country obtained frozen cubes of brain tissue from the   and the   The cubes measuring one or two cubic centimeters were taken from children ages  to  who had died The samples were from three brain regions in the cortex the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex the posterior superior temporal cortex and the occipital cortex These parts of the brain play a role in social cognition inhibition and abstract reasoning The researchers analyzed  samples from children with autism and  samples from typically developing children They were looking to see whether the samples had developed into six distinct layers  each with its own set of gene markers  which should happen in prenatal development Some of the genes they examined are linked to autism including     and   In  of the  samples from children with autism the researchers found patches of tissue where some layers were missing according to   in Thursdays edition of the New England Journal of Medicine In the  samples that were used as controls only one had an abnormal patch The fact that we were able to find these patches is remarkable given that the cortex is roughly the size of the surface of a basketball and we only examined pieces of tissue the size of a pencil eraser Ed Lein a study coauthor from the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle said in a statement This suggests these abnormalities are quite pervasive across the surface of the cortex And that is a sign that something is going wrong in the womb since thats where the six layers are formed Our data are consistent with an early prenatal origin of autism or at least prenatal processes that may confer a predisposition to autism the researchers concluded in their study However the results dont reveal the pathological mechanism that causes the disorder    and like   on Facebook
