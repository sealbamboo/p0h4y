We give them cookies and beds and dress them in clothing They love their toys their play time plus cuddling with mom and dad  and its no wonder Our dogs react to us in a manner that eerily mimics how human children respond to their parents a new study has found Similar behaviors between our pooches and our tots and us is rooted in a type of bonding that happens when hounds or kids consider their protectors to be a secure base a living anchor that injects them with confidence comfort and safety according to research published in the journal  One of the things that really surprised us is that adult dogs behave towards their caregivers like human children do said Lisa Horn of the Vetmedunis Messerli Research Institute in Vienna and the author of the report Horn used three experiments to explore whether Ks tend to  like children  thrive due to the socalled secure base effect thats typically found in the tight emotional ties between parents and their children Her dog test subjects  which were allowed to earn food rewards by manipulating interactive toys  were placed in situations in which there was an absent owner a silent owner and an encouraging owner She found that the animals seemed much less interested in working for the treats when their caregivers were not present versus when they were in the room But whether the dogs owner additionally encouraged the dog during the task or remained silent had little influence on the animals level of motivation In short the pooches appeared to be most comfortable and most willing to take a chance simply due to being near their owners  offering the first evidence for the similarity between the secure base effect found in dogowner and childcaregiver relationships the study reported  Science already had discerned a comparable effect in human children when kids were confronted with a problemsolving task those children that were able to use their mother as a secure base were found to be more motivated and persistent in solving the task Horn wrote adding that study has important implications in the future of behavioral testing done with dogs  The findings did not surprise LosAnglesbased dog trainer and behaviorist   who has learned that dogs develop and function in healthier ways through a foundation of interaction with their owners  Some daycares tire out dogs so much that they dont have any interaction with their owner Klein said An owner should learn to interact with its dog just as a parent does with their child
