Some people read nutrition labels with the kind of zeal others reserve for tabloids The pleasure is in the appraisal Those crackers in the supermarket with no trans fats Basketworthy A cafes peach muffin has one measly gram of fiber As if 
I too am labelconscious But until now my own baked goods were stubborn little mysteries No more Last week I ate a ounce zucchini muffin with raisins and walnuts that had  calories and  grams of   The previous Wednesday I chose the lesser of two evils a calorie slice of homemade   instead of a heftier calorie triangle How do I know   is a new smart food scale for home cooks that doesnt just weigh food but also provides a breakdown of its nutritional content Its instructive not only during preparation but also with leftovers A month ago I set out to address a paradox I take time to cook healthy meals at home daily But some meals still lack protein and nearly all are devoured instead of savored I hoped that Prep Pad could offer more nutritional transparency and that another device the Bluetoothenabled   could slow me down The inchbyinch scale made by the Orange Chef a Googlebacked company is sold at   for  It works with the   app on my iPad which displays a breakdown of proteins carbohydrates and fats as I build a meal An iPad  or newer is needed Discoveries lie in wait Some made me wince My  pm snack while watching House of Cards  plain yogurt strawberries and granola  topped  calories  percent of them from fat My healthy dessert was as sneaky as the shows politician protagonist Frank Underwood By contrast putting green beans on the Prep Pad then typing in the ingredient led to a pleasant surprise decades late green beans have roughly four grams of protein per cup Jennifer K Nelson the director of clinical dietetics at Mayo Clinic confirmed that nonstarchy vegetables like broccoli have about that much protein My greenbean epiphany mattered because one of my goals in using Prep Pad was to eat more meatfree protein like the groundup almonds that were the flour in my clementine cake Food scales have fallen out of favor with some nutritionists like Ms Nelson because the specific weight  say three ounces of steak  was divorced from nutritional information But after being told about Prep Pad she said merging information with a scale can be a powerful tool in raising awareness However Ms Nelson cautioned people generally find it a pain to weigh their food Actually weighing each ingredient was pretty effortless though it did take slightly longer to weigh the item and type each ingredient into the app What got annoying was how many bowls were dirtied For raw eggs you must first put a container on the scale press a button on the app to account for its weight then start cracking eggs into it Ditto for mashed clementines Ditto for flour By the sixth bowl I grumpily had to call in reinforcements to wash dishes to make counter space Thankfully you have to do this only once per recipe then for instance you can add meat to your vegetable lasagna without starting over Most bar codes on packaged food can be scanned But even though more than  ingredients are in the scales search engine some basics cant be found Quaker Instant Oatmeal comes up three grams of fiber per serving of  grams but what about oatmeal with more fiber Plantains didnt come up so I classified them as bananas which have fewer carbs For a scale thats aiming for full nutritional transparency this is a major weakness Taimoor Dar a founder of the Orange Chef says the company is improving the search results It is also adding items
