MSPs have questioned whether a key target for Accident and Emergency AE waiting times in Scotland is reasonable or achievable  NHS boards are supposed to see then admit transfer or discharge  of patients attending at AE units within four hours In September the target was met for only  of patients Members of the public audit committee at Holyrood have asked ministers to reconsider the national standard The Scottish government said it was continuing efforts to reduce waiting times It has also announced an additional m to help health boards cope with extra pressure during the winter months and to tackle the issue of delayed discharge Figures for the year ending September showed that an interim annual target for  of people to wait no more than four hours from their arrival at AE was also missed The figure achieved across Scotland was  no change from when the target was introduced in April  A report by the committee highlighted that some patients may need to stay in AE departments for longer than four hours for clinical reasons Convener Hugh Henry said To have five of the  health boards failing to meet the interim  target on time is disappointing to say the least especially when only three NHS boards are meeting the  standard set by the Scottish government However there is always a clinical need to balance speed of care with quality of care and we agree with the AGS Auditor General Scotland that waiting times for an AE department can be an important indicator of pressure on the health system as a whole Against this backdrop and with the majority of boards failing to meet the set standard we question whether that standard remains reasonable or achievable Committee members welcomed additional funding of m to help health boards address the deterioration in AE performance Their report highlighted the need for accurate information on AE referrals to tackle the problem of people turning up at AE departments unnecessarily Mr Henry added NHS boards need to better understand why people are coming to AE when patients could be redirected to other areas of the health service and treated just as effectively Some boards are doing great work in this area and we know the Scottish government is supporting this However whether other services are available when they are needed and whether people know enough about the alternatives to attending AE needs to be examined further He added We have called on the Scottish government to take action to increase understanding in this area and improve the robustness of data collection Only in understanding the problem can more appropriate action be taken to address it A Scottish government spokesman said We want to ensure that people are treated as quickly as possible in our AEs and our unscheduled care action plan has already delivered a significant reduction in patients waiting long periods in AE and fewer than  of all patients waited longer than  hours in the most recent statistics  Nevertheless we will continue to strive to reduce this further and improve the experiences of people attending AE  We have made an additional m available to health boards to assist with seasonal pressures over winter and to tackle the key issue of delayed discharge The Winter Resilience Fund comes on top of an m investment by the Scottish government to help ease the pressure on Scotlands NHS over the winter months
