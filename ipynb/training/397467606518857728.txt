Seven years ago Jordan Smith offered her two dogs a Christmas treat pieces of chicken jerky Within hours Eugene a yearold wirehaired pointing griffon and Choppy White a poodle of uncertain age had diarrhea and were vomiting A week later Choppy White died of liver failure Eugene hung on for a few more weeks but died in January  The two dogs were among the first cases of pets apparently poisoned by chicken jerky dog treats They immediately both got very ill seriously ill said Ms Smith  a reporter at The Austin Chronicle in Austin Tex I narrowed it down to this jerky because it was the only thing they had in common and it was within hours after they ate it Ms Smith eventually settled with the manufacturer of the pet treats under an agreement prohibiting her from revealing the companys name But she said she recently saw the product she believes poisoned her dogs still on sale Eugene and Choppy White are far from the only pets to suffer problems after eating jerky treats The Food and Drug Administration has been investigating cases of suspected poisonings since  with scant success The   the numbers last month there have been more than  reports of illnesses associated with the treats and more than  deaths almost all among dogs Dr Richard E Goldstein the chief medical officer at the   in New York first noticed the problem in late  or early  Were still seeing patients now and a lot of vets dont know about it The cause of the poisonings if that is what they are remains a mystery About  percent of the cases nationwide involve gastrointestinal illness  percent kidney ailments and the rest convulsions tremors and skin irritations Often the animals suffer from Fanconi syndrome a kidney disease that is otherwise very rare in dogs The breed or size does not appear to matter  Dalmatians and dachshunds pugs and German shepherds mutts and purebreds have all been affected Chicken is the most common ingredient in the products but some also contain duck sweet potatoes yams and dried fruits Many are manufactured in China and in April  FDA officials inspected several factories there gathering information on manufacturing processes equipment sanitation and product testing They found nothing in any of the factories that would explain the poisonings They did find that one factory had falsified papers about glycerin a common ingredient in the foods and not considered harmful in small quantities Chinese authorities seized the firms products and suspended exports to the United States The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets has been investigating as well Officials found low levels of antibiotic residues in some of these products and in January asked for a voluntary recall of several brands including Waggin Train and Canyon Creek Ranch chicken jerky treats both distributed by Nestl Nestl removed the products from stores in New York but issued   asserting that the antibiotic residue does not pose a safety risk A sharp decline in the number of complaints followed but the FDA agreed with Nestl that antibiotics do not explain the problem and said that the reduced number of complaints probably reflected the smaller number of products available after the recall Still the agency is continuing to test for possible contaminants FDA technicians ran  tests on samples collected from  to  and since then have collected about  samples connected to consumer complaints plus  more bought at retail stores The agency has performed more than  tests on these new samples Testing these products is not easy according to Dr Martine Hartogensis deputy director of surveillance and compliance at the agency Theyre very hard and dry not soluble more challenging than a raw or fresh product she said Its harder to establish methods for testing them Nevertheless FDA technicians have searched for a variety of germs toxins drugs and other contaminants They have screened samples for Salmonella mold yeast and fungus They have tested for additives and preservatives like nitrites and sulfites and for  food dyes They have run screens for lead zinc titanium and almost two dozen other metals They have used a gas chromatography mass spectrometer to search for toxic chemicals They found Penicillium species in one sample and some other antibiotics in some samples none in quantities large enough to cause disease or death They found glycerin in some products that were mislabeled as containing none But after all this the FDA has found nothing that could explain the apparent poisonings We have a staff in our office of research working on jerky pet treats exclusively Dr Hartogensis said And through our veterinary lab network we have numerous labs throughout the country working on it On Oct  the agency appealed to veterinarians asking them to report illnesses associated with jerky treats and to collect urine and blood samples The FDA has since received more than  reports including many from veterinarians Weve put out a lot of consumer alerts said Dr Hartogensis but this is the first time weve talked to vets our eyes and ears out there Were trying to get samples from active cases where the animal is currently sick We really need more tissue urine and blood samples she said Thats where toxins are concentrated
