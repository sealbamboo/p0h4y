A new toolkit announced by Apple on Monday would allow medical researchers to tap into an expanding universe of iPhone users to recruit and enroll study participants collect data and monitor health outcomes that are the object of research Apple on Monday made publicly available five new apps built by Apple and various university researchers using the toolkit The company said it would release the openaccess software for the toolkit next month so other researchers could tailor apps to their needs Researchers studying asthma Parkinsons disease diabetes cardiovascular disease and breast cancer will be the first to use the new apps to conduct studies Most of the research being launched with the new applications appears to allow participants and researchers to track the daily lives and functioning of subjects and detect patterns that might lead to better diseasemanagement practices One of the apps will be used as a part of an observational study that collects data from Parkinsons patients in an effort to more fully understand the disease and how it affects daily life Parkinsons patients who download the appÂ will be able to use the iPhones GPS and accelerometer to provide data on dexterity balance gait voice strength and memory several times a day Another app released Monday  called Share the Journey Mind Body and Wellness after Breast Cancer  will let breast cancer survivors track and report fatigue cognitive difficulties sleep disturbances mood changes and reduction in exercise performance in the wake of treatment A third app released Monday will be the centerpiece of a largescale asthma study conducted by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai The study will aim to track symptom patterns in subjects and identify potential triggers for asthma exacerbation The Asthma Health app is designed to facilitate asthma patient education and selfmonitoring promote positive behavioral changes and reinforce adherence to treatment plans according to current asthma guidelines said a statement issued Monday by Mt Sinai Health System Mondays announcement was greeted with enthusiasm and some questions by biomedical researchers Dr Pamela Tenaerts executive director of the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative said the broader use of wireless technology in research would allow investigators to cast their nets more broadly to recruit study participants Hopefully well get more people involved in trials better data and more answers for diseases said Tenaerts whose organization  a partnership between Duke University and the Food and Drug Administration  aims to improve the quality and efficiency of clinical trials At the same time said Tenaerts this would all have to happen with the same rigor as current clinical trials Obviously no one wants to lower the bar Some experts questioned whether such apps would be sufficient for carrying out the kinds of rigorous clinical trials that are the gold standard of biomedical research When iPhone apps are used to conduct such studies enrollees would likely be expected to give informed consent provide personal data and to report adverse events  possibly without ever having met with study investigators Terri Hinkley interim executive director of the Assn of Clinical Research Professionals said problems are sure to arise Hinkley noted for instance that most wireless device users routinely click the I Agree option without reading the fine print of user agreements I would just shudder to think that informed consent would be collected that way because I dont think anybody would say that passes muster said Hinkley Hinkley added that study subjects who have had no contact with investigators might not recognize or report side effects or adverse events while participating in a trial Where there is no reciprocal exchange of information between researcher and subject such problems may be overlooked or underreported she cautioned
