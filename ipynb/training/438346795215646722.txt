It is the morning after the weekend before  Another Tuesday in Northern Irelands health service when the emergency departments are in recovery mode  Many local healthcare staff say that turning recovery areas into wards battling breaches of the hour waiting time target and calling in extra staff is becoming the norm rather than the exception at weekends On Monday the Belfast Health Trust narrowly missed declaring another major incident at Belfasts Royal Victoria Hospital Or did they simply call it by another name  On Wednesday  January senior managers called in extra staff and opened more beds to deal with a spike in patients This was declared a major incident Less than two months later on Monday  February once again senior managers took the decision to call in extra staff and additional beds were opened The latter however was called an escalation plan What is the difference The buildup began last Friday  Again almost all of the health trusts were reporting that emergency departments were extremely busy Perhaps we should expect nothing different  Critically it appears that lessons were not learned from the previous times when there were too few staff not enough beds and people were attending when they should not have been While we are told to refer to these areas now as emergency departments it is difficult not to refer to them as AEs in other words for anything and everything  On Saturday and Sunday the pressure began to build Beds could not be found and some staff members in the Belfast Northern and Western health trusts said some patients were discharged prematurely because there were no beds  The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said it had taken  patients to the Royal Victoria Hospital on Sunday That was more than on the two previous Sundays  As the BBC revealed on Monday at about  GMT  people had been waiting on trolleys some since  GMT on Sunday night There were also more than  people in the waiting area  By  GMT on Monday that number had fallen to  patients waiting on trolleys  In the Northern Trust Antrim Area Hospital was under similar pressure One source told the BBC that nursing staff were transferred from Holywell Hospital which deals with patients who have mental health problems Nurses were left to cope there as best they could  Extra beds were opened in what was once the old AE area now a GP assessment area This forms part of the winter planning system   According to staff the GP assessment unit is working well and has helped remove some of the pressure from the emergency department  In the Western Health Trust the South West Acute Hospital experienced similar difficulties On Monday morning about  patients were waiting to be allocated a bed of those five had breached the hour waiting time  Northern Irelands waiting times are dire  Last year the College of Emergency Medicine said they were the worst in the UK  In January  of those who arrived at accident and emergency were seen within four hours  A total of  people waited more than  hours  While the hospitals may be located in different areas the problems are similar Despite all the promises from Transforming Your Care the road map for change in Northern Irelands health care very little has been delivered on the ground  Rightly or wrongly the public are still attending their emergency departments partly because the service is not available in many of their local communities   Added problems include the lack of a sevenday working culture in the health service and the fact that not enough day procedures are being performed in the community  While statistics are used to illustrate what is happening we should not forget that statistics as boring as they are represent people
