Welsh Health Minister Mark Drakeford has launched a stinging attack on the Conservatives for telling a tissue of lies about the state of the Welsh NHS UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has claimed   Mr Drakeford accused him of intending to selectively quote from a planned review of NHS services in the UK But Mr Hunt said the findings of the   should not be withheld The war of words between the two health ministers follows   Mr Hunt added his voice to the attack on Welsh Labour in response to health questions in the House of Commons on Tuesday He told MPs that for every English patient treated in a Welsh hospital five Welsh patients were treated in England creating huge pressure for English hospitals  Ive written to the Welsh health minister to say that the NHS is happy to treat more Welsh patients but the trouble is they arent prepared to pay for it and thats why Welsh patients get a secondclass health service he said   Mr Hunt also claimed Labour was trying to prevent publication of an independent study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD comparing the four different NHS systems in the UK Mr Drakeford wrote an angry response accusing Mr Hunt of attempting to subvert the process of publication of an independent report He also warned that the Welsh government might commission its own report from the OECD to avoid the risk of contamination by an overt politicisation of the process It follows a letter sent by Mr Hunt to Mr Drakeford on Monday The assertion in your letter that you feel you have a right to quote selectively from an unpublished report in the lead up to the General Election is truly shocking  it flies in the face of every principle of the proper conduct of public life Mr Drakeford wrote   Your failure to clearly and openly set out such an intention at the time when the study was commissioned will appear to some to be deliberate and deceptive The NHS in Wales will not be the victim of any Conservative Party ploy to drag its reputation through the mud for entirely partisan political purposes At a time when the four home nations of the UK need to be working closely together address the threat of Ebola your willingness to put the interests of your party above those of the public is especially reprehensible Mr Drakeford said he intended to publish Mr Hunts letter to him saying it was grossly discourteous that it had already been given to the media and a backbench Conservative MP by the time it arrived at his office In response Mr Hunt denied trying to subvert the OECD report due for release in February  However he added On a matter as important as this I do not agree with you that their findings should be withheld from the public I believe we owe it to taxpayers who fund the NHS to show we are willing to learn from other parts of the UK as to where our performance can be improved In a second letter to health staff in Wales Mr Drakeford said he was very proud of their work adding that political and media attacks would intensify in the runup to the general election It saddens me to see our NHS used in this way he wrote warning of the potentially damaging impact on morale Defending Welsh Labours running of the NHS during First Ministers Questions on Tuesday   but he said he was not prepared to play politics with peoples health The disagreement between Mark Drakeford and Jeremy Hunt is one of the worst clashes between a Welsh and a Whitehall minister since the assembly was established in   The timing of the clash couldnt be worse coming as it does as the UK and Welsh governments enter delicate negotiations about increasing the assemblys powers in the wake of the Scottish referendum on independence  Holding such negotiations in the run up to a UK general election was always going to be difficult And with the Welsh government accusing Jeremy Hunt of deception and discourtesy trust could be very hard to establish
