Schofields voice with its lingering Liverpool accent trails off   Schofield  was diagnosed with Type  diabetes in  People who have Type  diabetes do not produce insulin a hormone the body needs to convert sugar and starches into energy Their white blood cells attack and destroy the cells that produce insulin in the pancreas Like most Type  diabetics Schofield learned to control his diabetes with insulin injections and constant monitoring But he still experienced hypoglycemic attacks when his blood sugar levels got too low It was like being in a fog  one he couldnt escape until someone helped him If it went on too long he would lose consciousness  As he got older Schofields body adapted to the extreme lows so when his blood sugar levels dropped below normal he didnt experience the typical symptoms In other words he didnt know he was in danger until he passed out  Over time your body just starts to break down he says They say diabetes is a slow killer and it is Pancreas transplants for patients such as Schofield are not typically an option because they are difficult to perform said   associate professor of medicine at University of Pennsylvania But an experimental procedure using the   is being tested at medical centers around the country If its approved by the Food and Drug Administration it could make a difference for patients who are no longer able to successfully manage their diabetes  Islet cells contain beta cells that produce insulin as well as alpha cells that produce a hormone called glucagon Both are used to regulate the bodys glucose or sugar levels In the s scientists in Alberta Canada figured out how to isolate these islets from a deceased donors pancreas and transplant them into the liver of a diabetic patient The procedure was dubbed the    Since then researchers have been trying to improve the survival rate of the cells during transplantation Most patients who undergo the procedure now need two infusions of islet cells to maintain normal glucose levels longterm  Rickels and his colleagues   in the journal Diabetes detailing a new protocol which gives the extracted islets three days to rest before theyre transferred to the living recipient All of the patients in Rickels study were able to come off insulin therapy for at least a year after a single transplant  Data from patients in other countries where the procedure has already been approved shows some patients can stop using insulin for anywhere from five to  years Rickels said  Schofield had been following the islet cell research since the s One Saturday morning after a particularly bad hypoglycemic attack he decided to fill out a survey to see whether he qualified for a trial funded by the National Institutes of Health Two days later he received a message from the UCSF Medical Center in San Francisco  Schofield flew from his home in Scottsdale Arizona to California to learn more about the transplant   director of the Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplant Program at UCSF told Schofield that the procedure would take less than two hours and he would be home within two or three days He would however have to remain on immunosuppressant drugs the rest of his life The drugs prevent the patients white blood cells from attacking the new islet cells Posselt explained  The next year was filled with medical tests Schofield didnt receive a donor pancreas in time to participate in the government trial But he discovered his employer health insurance would pay for the experimental transplant His doctors helped him submit a request to the FDA to get the private procedure approved  Now all he needed was a donor  Michael Baptiste was a good kid his mom Elizabeth says Growing up he was my pain in the butt she remembers with a laugh He was my third child He was the one who gave me the headaches  He was also a giving person When his mom took him to the DMV to get his drivers license he checked the organ donor box without hesitation  At  he was taking responsibility for his life and his family He was going to school to become an electrician He worked nights at Home Depot to provide for his yearold daughter Angelina He took his mom to Disneyland  He was moving up Elizabeth Baptiste says And it was cut short On March   Michael Baptiste was goofing off with friends in a restaurant parking lot He fell out of a car while the driver was doing donuts and he hit his head Doctors kept him alive for six days before pronouncing him brain dead  A few days later Schofield received his first infusion of islet cells Two weeks later he was off insulin He looked down at his glucose monitor one day and saw a flat line for the first time in  years That was euphoria he says He still wears his monitor to this day enjoying the high looking at the flat line gives him  Schofield sent a note to his anonymous donors family thanking them for giving him a second chance at life He then began speaking publicly about his transplant urging the FDA to approve the procedure for others in the United States  People need to be aware that this is an effective alternative treatment Posselt said Funding is very difficult to get for this kind of procedure in the US as a result were falling behind other countries Two human clinical trials are underway in the United States Once both are completed researchers will submit the data to the FDA for review Rickels hopes in the next two to three years all his and his colleagues hard work will pay off  Only about  of people with diabetes have Type  according to the American Diabetes Association Islet cell transplantation cannot help those with Type  diabetes Posselt said because they already produce insulin  their bodies just have a greater resistance to the hormone  I think that this procedure can definitely benefit some diabetics but I dont think its the panacea for every diabetic he said  On June  Schofield met Elizabeth Baptiste at Pier  in San Francisco She wore a Donald Duck Tshirt to represent her sons favorite Disney character  When she saw Schofield she waved her hand high in the air and had a flashback to the days when she used to do the same for Michael when he ran off in a crowd  The meeting was a mix of emotions for Schofield  Its a happy moment that I got the transplant got to meet her say thank you Schofield remembers Its a sad moment because having three children of my own I cant imagine the pain  But for Baptiste it was therapeutic She hasnt heard from any of her sons other recipients Ive told people I know my son is dead  she says But I know other people have his parts so I know hes still alive Michael came to me at the right time  I needed a hug from my son and thats what he was there for
