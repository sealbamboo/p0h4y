A  tax on sugary drinks would reduce the number of obese adults in the UK by  say researchers writing in the British Medical Journal The impact would be greatest in the unders   suggests But some groups say a tax is misguided and simplistic and would not have an impact on older age groups who might benefit most from losing weight  Earlier this year doctors called for a soft drinks tax to reduce sugar intake Sugarsweetened drinks when taken regularly have been shown to increase the risk of obesity diabetes and tooth decay A typical sugary drink can contain six to  teaspoons of sugar One teaspoon of sugar is equivalent to g of sugar or  calories A  tax would add about p to the price of a ml can of fizzy drink bought in a supermarket or about p to the cost of twolitre bottle The researchers in this study estimated that such a tax could cut drinks purchases by  and lead to a reduced energy intake of  calories per person per week Overall they estimated that such a tax would reduce the number of obese UK adults by  and the number of overweight adults by  Among younger adults aged  who drink larger quantities of sugary drinks ml per day than older adults ml per day the researchers predicted a reduction of  in the number of obese adults  a bigger impact than for other age groups But Gavin Partington director general of the British Soft Drinks Association said soft drinks were not to blame for obesity Theres ample evidence to suggest that taxing soft drinks wont curb obesity not least because its causes are far more complex than this simplistic approach implies   Indeed the latest official guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence points to the need to look at overall diet and lifestyle  Trying to blame one set of products is misguided particularly when they comprise a mere  of calories in the average diet Dr Adam Briggs lead study author from the Nuffield Department of Population Health at Oxford University said their research led them to conclude that taxing sugarsweetened drinks is a promising population measure He said Sugarsweetened drinks are known to be bad for health and our research indicates that a  tax could result in a meaningful reduction in the number of obese adults in the UK  Such a tax is not going to solve obesity by itself but we have shown it could be an effective public health measure and should be considered alongside other measures to tackle obesity in the UK The study modelled the health effects of a  tax using data from a number of different surveys which provided information on drinks consumption drinkspurchasing trends and the prevalence of obesity in the four countries of the UK Some experts including Tom Sanders professor of nutrition and dietetics at Kings College London felt the findings were naive He said Most nutritionists agree it would be better to drink water than sugarsweetened beverages However many consumers like sweet drinks and if they could not afford to buy sugary fizzy drinks they can always revert to drinking tea with added sugar as in the past  The cost of sugarsweetened beverages is currently so low that any price increase would be so marginal that it would be unlikely to affect intake In the past year however  s and   Malcolm Clark from Sustain said the BMJ study provided more evidence that a duty on sugary drinks would improve the diet and health of children and young people  He said the duty should cover all sugarsweetened drinks including those  like flavoured waters and juice drinks  that parents often dont realise have added sugar  He added We challenge the government to show it has a public health backbone by introducing a sugary drinks duty alongside better protection for children from junk food marketing and robust nutrition and sustainability standards for all the food served in schools hospitals and other publicly funded places A spokesperson from the Department of Health said the Responsibility Deal which a number of soft drinks companies have voluntarily signed up to pledging to reduce sugar in their drinks was helping people to make healthier choices
