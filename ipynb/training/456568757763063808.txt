Every free sample comes with a price Dermatologists who accept free tubes and bottles of brandname drugs are likelier to prescribe expensive medications for acne than doctors who are prohibited from taking samples a study   Wednesday The difference isnt chump change When patients see a dermatologist who gets and gives free samples the average cost of medicines prescribed is  per office visit That cost drops to about  when patients see a doctor who cant hand out freebies a team at Stanford University found The findings published in the current issue of   adds to the   that free handouts may influence doctors prescribing habits  and the type of medications people request When a doctor gives a sample to a patient its a very strong endorsement of a drug says Georgetown Universitys   who wasnt involved in the study Patients think the physician has chosen this sample because its the best drug for them she says They dont realize that the doctor might have chosen it because a drug rep gave him samples and it was what he had around the office Once doctors have given a free trial pack its hard for them to prescribe a different generic drug FughBerman adds That would look really inconsistent So some physicians  in all specialties  end up prescribing an expensive branded drug when a cheaper alternate is available she says That connection between freebies and costlier drugs is exactly what Stanford Universitys   and his colleagues found among dermatologists The team analyzed the prescribing habits of  dermatologists in private practices across the country They then compared that data with prescribing patterns at Stanfords clinics where doctors arent allowed to take samples from drug companies The difference was stark Doctors in private practices where samples are common recommended brandname medications nearly  percent of the time At the academic clinic only  percent of drugs were name brands Physicians dont realize the effect free samples have Lane tells Shots Dermatology may be especially effected he says because handing out samples is common in the specialty About  percent of all drugs prescribed in dermatology in  started with free samples Lane and his team found But only  percent of medications in all other specialties started with freebies Not long ago Lane was actually a fan of such samples Then in  Stanford University and many academic clinics started prohibiting doctors from accepting them We fought the change he says We thought it would have a negative impact on our practice But the result was the opposite Now Im absolutely delighted that were not using samples Lane saysWhen I look at the cost difference to patients Im glad Im not writing more expensive medications The quality of care at his clinic has changed in a good way he thinks But he worries that some people think better of doctors who offer samples Doctors think patients want them Lane says When we stopped giving them patients started complaining right a way One recent   found that more than a third of doctors surveyed say they sometimes prescribe a brandname drug because a patient requests it even when theres a generic available Of course all samples arent bad They can be a big help for patients who lack insurance or are on tight budgets And some of the namebrand drugs come in a timereleased formulation which may be more convenient for some people But often its up to the patient to ensure their drug bill isnt getting an extra unwanted bump Patients need to be aware that by receiving samples or branded drugs they may be paying more for something that isnt documented to be any better than a generic Lane says
