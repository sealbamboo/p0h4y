Parents love it when their babies are good eaters whether its polishing off a bottle or happily grabbing bits of pasta But researchers think babies who chow down with gusto might be setting themselves up for obesity later on By looking at pairs of twins researchers were able to separate a babys eating habits from parental influences In this study twins who were enthusiastic about food and took longer to get full had by  months gained  pounds more than a less enthusiastic sibling Considering that the babies mean weight at that age was  pounds its a pretty big difference The researchers at University College and Kings College in London looked at twins so they could figure out how much of the weight difference was due to the childrens behavior instead of differences in how parents feed them They studied only fraternal samesex twins to make the comparison clearer Parents were asked to report on their babies appetites at  months when they were still fed milk They asked how enthusiastic the babies were about food and how long it took for them to become full Of the  twin pairs in the study  had one sibling who responded more enthusiastically to food at  months or who ate for longer At that age the heartier eater already weighed a bit more than his or her sibling And that trend accelerated over the next year The results   in   At this point you may be thinking well of course the heartier eater is going to weigh more But the forces controlling appetite and eating are complex With small children parents attitudes about food have a huge influence The structure of this study makes it clear that even when children are at a tender age their food preferences can affect their weight long before they can say more And since fraternal twins share half of their genes it makes it less likely that their weight differences were due solely to genetic factors Scientists are looking hard for the genetic roots of obesity in the hope that people who are genetically predisposed to gain weight can be identified and helped early on The obesogenic environment does not affect all children equally   who studies the genetics of obesity at Duke University writes in an accompanying   Since children dont get as much exercise as in generations past and theyre surrounded by caloriedense foods knowing which children are more at risk of gaining weight could make it possible to give them help early on Belsky says A second   in this issue of   found that children who shared genetic markers associated with obesity were less likely to fill up quickly and stop eating The scientists call this low satiety responsiveness But this doesnt mean that were anywhere near having a genetic test for obesity Genetic influences on weight remain an enduring puzzle Belsky points out if not exactly a mystery The focus in both studies is on babies who gain weight more quickly but these results could have implications for the less enthusiastic eaters too Someone whos less interested in food as a baby may not have to be careful about weight gain where parents of a child who has always loved to chow down may need to be more vigilant about food choices A study   earlier this year found that children who are heavier as early as kindergarten are more likely to be obese by middle school Previous   have found that more babies are topping out the weight charts Parent who have a hearty eater in infancy may want to be aware that that could make them more susceptible to being overweight or obese later on the British researchers say But this study didnt follow the children beyond  months of age so theres no clear cause and effect
