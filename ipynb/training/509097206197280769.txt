 has found that the DHS is totally   for something like the  HN influenza pandemic  or something worse such as a global   or the  flu pandemic that killed an   according to a report released by the Office of the Inspector General on Monday   In  Congress gave DHS  million to prepare for such a national medical crisis  And the department did go shopping it spent millions on this equipment that might now be completely worthless missing or unnecessary   For example the audit found more than  bottles of expired hand sanitizer in storage with the DHS Many of those bottles have been expired for up to four years   Some  of the antiviral drugs the DHS has will expire by the end of next year And  of the Tamiflu is set to expire in   Some  of the Relenza DHS has will expire then as well It was unclear to investigators whether the antiviral medication had been stored at a proper temperature The departments entire respirator stockpile has reached or will soon reach the manufacturers date of usability  And the report suggests the department failed to determine reallife needs before buying the equipment in the first place The DHS Capital Region pandemic stockpile has about  white coverall suits according to the report Investigators say there is no justification or related documentation available to support that number of suits nor does any kind of documentation explain why they were necessary   The same is true for surgical masks There are  million in the departments inventory no reason was given for having that many Overall DHS failed to keep good records about what it purchased and what it received according to the report That may be why the government had to report a secondary stockpile containing  surgical masks and hand sanitizer as lost  The report concluded it is imperative that DHS be prepared to continue missionessential operations should a pandemic occur and yet it found that DHS didnt develop a clear plan on how to replenish their stockpiles of equipment Nor did they have a good way to keep a good control over their inventory to monitor expiration dates on material   DHS is responsible for ensuring it is adequately prepared to continue critical operations in the event of a pandemic Inspector General   said in a news release  DHS agreed with all  suggestions the Inspector Generals Office made to improve the program The department will assign an office to oversee the supplies and develop an adequate strategy for making sure the material stays current It has applied for a shelf life extension with the Food and Drug Administration to extend the expiration dates on the antiviral medicine it has that will expire in    We will work with them to see that this vital program is strengthened Roth said
