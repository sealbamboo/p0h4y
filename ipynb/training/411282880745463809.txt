We all know James Bond had a hankering for martinis But it looks like the international spy threw back far more   his martini of choice than was good for him Dr Indra Neil Guha a liver specialist and his colleagues at Nottingham University Hospital in England spent a year poring over Ian Flemings James Bond   and tabulating how many drinks the suave spy drank a day Their conclusion Even just steadying his   might have been difficult for Bond On average Bond consumed about  drinks a week or six to seven a day the authors   Thursday in the Christmas edition of   formerly the   Thats way more than the amount considered   for men by the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism It wasnt just chronic drinking that roughed up Bonds liver He also went on some mean benders In   Bond knocked back nearly  drinks before going on a highspeed car chase getting in a wreck and then spending two weeks in the hospital We hope that this was a salutary lesson the authors wrote dryly This man clearly consumed what are considered to be harmful amounts of alcohol says psychiatrist   who directs the Vanderbilt Addiction Center There are data that show that drinking like this about  grams of alcohol a day is highly likely to be associated with liver cirrhosis and also cognitive deficits It would also be likely to   for depression and sexual dysfunction conditions that would not be very Bondian But Martin says Bonds habit might not have been quite as bad it first seemed For starters the recommended maximum number of drinks is calculated for the average man weighing about  pounds Bond was  feet  inches or maybe  inches tall and probably weighed close to  pounds So that would mitigate the numbers Martin an admitted Bond fan adds You have to remember this was the s People drank more and smoked more And Bond was hardly alone Think about how much a person like Winston Churchill drank Martin says He drank a lot But yet he ran the effort of the western nations in the world war So this is not unprecedented Duke neuropsychologist   doesnt buy the Bond myth He thinks all those Vesper martinis over the years would have hurt Bonds career Bond isnt going to be downing three or four martinis and then winning a fight with five guys Swartzwelder tells Shots He might be starting the fights but hes not winning them The old saw that every drink kills lots of brain cells isnt true Swartzwelder says But chronic drinking does damage neurons and brain circuits over time he says And there are parts of the brain that you dont want to damage if youre an international spy First off chronic alcohol abuse can injure the cerebellum the brain region involved with coordination Swartzwelder says It allows you to string together a series of athletic movements If Bond is pickling his cerebellum on a regular basis hes not going to be able to learn fight sequences jump through windows and shoot at the same time or even learn those dance sequences with his girlfriend he says The second brain region damaged by years of heavy drinking is the hippocampus Swartzwelder says Shaped like a little sea horse the hippocampus is dedicated to forming new memories It is very sensitive to the effects of alcohol he says Bond wouldnt be able to remember all those names card numbers at poker games or even all his girlfriends phones numbers if his hippocampus wasnt working correctly  Believe me Swartzwelder says Bond wouldnt have been doing the things that we he was doing in those movies if he drank as much as the study found And Swartzwelder thinks the authors of the   study did a pretty good job of accurately calculating the spys drinking habit The authors astutely counted the martinis as three alcohol units or  drinks Swartzwelder says Most college students  even many people  dont know what   So they underestimate their alcohol intake A wineglass filled up more than a third of the way thats more than one drink Plus he says people have to be careful with beer these days because many of them have almost as much alcohol per volume as wine I went out for a beer with a young friend of mine whos all into all these fancy beers and I was drunk after drinking just one Swartzwelder says Then I realized the beer had more than  percent alcohol in it It was like I was drinking a pint of wine spoke with Dr Patrick Davies one of the studys researchers about the findings You can listen to the audio by clicking play above
