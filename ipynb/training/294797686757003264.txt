 The results of a new speeddating study suggest that when romantic sparks fly so do testosterone levels with   giving rise to a hormonal spike in both men and women The findings do suggest that we have some sort of radar to detect whos attracted to us  but its not clear from this study whether people are consciously aware of this or not said one outside expert Dr Robin Edelstein an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor In the new study roughly  heterosexual men and women volunteered to take part in about  speeddates All participants offered up four saliva samples for hormone analysis Two were taken a week before their speeddates while another two swabs were obtained right before and after the dates The result Testosterone levels did not rise as a result of onesided attraction When the feeling was mutual however both men and women experienced a testosterone bump the researchers found In other words unless the feeling was mutual simply being liked by a date romantic popularity or liking a date romantic attraction was not enough to affect hormone levels in either gender Many people think that only men have testosterone but thats not the case explained study lead author Eli Finkel a professor of social psychology at Northwestern University in Evanston Ill Its true that men have much more testosterone than women do but the links between testosterone and   and testosterone is associated with a stronger sex drive in both sexes For  years researchers have shown that male animals  rabbits monkeys starlings  exhibit a spike in testosterone and engage in matinginitiation behaviors when introduced to a female they hadnt met previously Finkel said But he added that the spike typically occurs only when the animals have a realistic chance of mating Now consider humans Finkel said It is extremely rare that humans mate in the absence of mutual consent Feeling attracted to a new person or having that person be attracted to you is not a reliable indicator that you have a good chance of initiating a sexual relationship with him or her Mutual attraction is required for that So a spike in testosterone may promote efforts toward establishing a relationship with the other person Finkel theorized He and his colleagues presented their findings this month at the annual meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology in New Orleans Data and conclusions presented at medical meetings should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peerreviewed journal According to Edelstein the Northwestern research opens up really interesting questions The hormonal changes are specific to mutual attraction suggesting some sort of effect of chemistry she noted So how accurate are people about this mutual attraction and are some people better at detecting it than others And might those differences be related to testosterone Another expert said the study had real merit The study confirms past research that has shown that the feeling that someone else is attracted to us is one of the strongest contributors to us being attracted to them in return said Jeffrey Hall an assistant professor in the department of communications studies at the University of Kansas in Lawrence If you actually ask people to list what they most want in another person right up toward the top is finding someone who is attracted to them he noted Its such a strong effect that just the thought that another person might be attracted to us is compelling So in being able to show physiological evidence of mutual interest I think this study is very exciting
