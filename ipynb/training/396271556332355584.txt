For the study   Finnish researchers divided  pregnant women into two groups Five times a week the learning group played a CD that included a oneminute rendition of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star which the unborn children heard an average of  times before birth The control group did not hear the recording Then the scientists did EEG tests on the children at birth and again at  months as they listened to the original tune and a version in which several notes were altered  The learning group had a larger response to the melody than the control group did and the difference was still apparent at  months And the amplitude of response to the changed melody correlated with the number of times the infants were exposed to the original melody in utero The lead author Eino Partanen a researcher at the University of Helsinki urged parents not to make too much of the finding A baby can be relaxed and soothed by melodies it hears before birth he said But there is no evidence that it will get your baby into Harvard
