People who have had a very mild form of stroke called a transient ischemic attack or TIA are at risk of posttraumatic stress disorder with almost onethird of people later diagnosed with PTSD a study finds Earlier studies have shown that PTSD is more common in people who have had a fullblown stroke Stroke patients also are more likely to be   and have lower quality of life This appears to be the first study to look exclusively at PTSD in people with   which typically last just a few minutes and dont have lasting symptoms The study followed  people in Germany who had had a TIA Three months later  of them met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD including reexperiencing the event That rate is  times as high as in the general population The people with PTSD were also more likely to have symptoms of anxiety and depression The study was published Thursday in the journal   Twentynine percent seems pretty high says   a professor of neurology at Duke University Medical Center who was not involved in the study The overall average is  percent for TIAs and strokes combined Goldstein told Shots Studies on this vary a lot in how symptoms are measured Goldstein notes And doctors arent always attuned to the fact that PTSD can be an issue after a TIA Patients are very frequently quite anxious after a TIA he says Were relatively wellattuned to managing anxiety but I dont know how wellattuned we are to PTSD The anxiety is understandable since about onethird of people who have a TIA will eventually go on to have a   according to the National Institutes of Health People who have been diagnosed with a TIA are often put on bloodthinning medication to reduce risk But a TIA diagnosis isnt always a sure thing Goldstein says and people may be getting worried about something that never actually happened to them If people have a spell and doctors cant figure out a cause its labeled as a TIA he says It certainly happens not infrequently The best response is not to worry but to take steps to reduce the risk of stroke Goldstein says That includes identifying   and acting to reduce them by quitting smoking exercising eating right and getting blood pressure under control according to the NIH The fact that patients who have had TIAs can develop PTSD suggests that its not brain damage or disability typical of a stroke thats causing the problem the study authors write People who have trouble coping after a TIA deserve more help they say
