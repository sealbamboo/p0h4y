Dr. Jesse Steinfeld stepped into the role of U.S. surgeon general in 1969. By 1973, he'd been forced out of office. But before he was, he became leading crusader in the anti-smoking movement. Dr. Steinfeld has died at 87; to remember his life and achievements, Audie Cornish turns to Stanton Glantz, professor of tobacco control at the University of California, San Francisco.
