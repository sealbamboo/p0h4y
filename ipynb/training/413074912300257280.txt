Still I have many patients who refuse to get a vaccination despite my best efforts to persuade them And I also have patients who are on the fence about getting vaccinated  either because they dont have all the information they need or theyve heard myths that have made them feel skeptical  So in my most public attempt to convince them otherwise here are the top seven myths I hear about the flu vaccine and why you should get it anyway   When I was a thirdyear medical student I got the flu shot Three days later I came down with an epic flulike illness that lasted for days So I understand that this is the very reason why many think the flu shot causes the flu But the truth is that the flu vaccine  the flu shot or nasal spray  cannot give you the flu So what happened to me you ask Why did I get sick after getting the vaccine There are a few possible reasons   It can actually take a couple of weeks for the body to become protected from influenza after getting vaccinated So it is possible that I became infected during this time   Many viruses can cause flulike symptoms Even though I felt like I had the flu a different virus could have caused my infection   The influenza vaccine protects us against the three or four most common strains predicted to cause illness in any given season thus it is possible that I had a strain of the flu that wasnt covered by the vaccine   The conventional flu vaccine is pretty effective but its not  effective  But regardless of why I ended up getting sick it was not from the flu vaccine itself It just doesnt work that way I hope my patients are reading this Nothing could be further from the truth It DOES make a difference The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that vaccinations prevented  flu hospitalizations and  million fluassociated illnesses during the  influenza season Complications from the flu can be serious and result in hospitalization and even death for some patients The best way to prevent the flu is to get vaccinated   With rare exceptions everyone  months and older should get the flu vaccine Pregnant women those younger than  or older than  and people with certain chronic medical conditions are at higher risk for flurelated complications If this is you you should definitely talk with your doctor about getting the vaccine   Even if you dont get sick  or only experience mild illness when you are sick  others might not be as lucky Infants the elderly and people with multiple medical conditions or weakened immune systems may not be able to fight off Influenza as well as you do  Getting vaccinated not only protects you but also helps protect others who may not be able to fight off illness as well as you Side effects of flu vaccination are generally mild If you get the flu shot you might feel achy or have redness or soreness where the shot was given If you get the nasal spray vaccine you could get a stuffy nose or throat irritation Talk with your doctor to find out which type of vaccine is right for you and make sure to let him or her know if you get any of these symptoms Often we can recommend supportive measures to help you through these  But most potential side effects of the vaccine are nothing compared to how bad youd feel if you had to suffer through the actual flu   If youve never had a flu vaccine its definitely time to get one Last weeks   shows fewer than half of all Americans have gotten vaccinated so far this flu season Its time to change this If you have never had the flu vaccine go out and get one   No its not too late That its December is even more of a reason to get your flu vaccine now Flu activity tends to peak in January or February and flu season can last as late as May so there is plenty of time to receive benefits from the vaccine What are you waiting for So if you have given your doctor any of these excuses for why you havent gotten your flu vaccine now you know better Now its time to do better Get vaccinated
