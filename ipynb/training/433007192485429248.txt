The Food and Drug Administration is taking second look this week at the heart safety of pain medications used by millions of Americans to treat arthritis and other everyday aches and pains   The question is whether naproxen  the key ingredient in Bayers Aleve and many other generic pain pills  carries a lower risk of heart attack and stroke than rival medications like ibuprofen sold as Advil by Pfizer and Motrin by Johnson  Johnson among others   Debate about whether one drug is safer than others in the class has waged for more than a decade without a clear answer underscoring the lingering questions that hang over even the most established medicines   The FDA is asking its panel of medical experts to review a massive analysis published last year suggesting that naproxen does not increase the risk of heart problems as much as its peers The finding came from Oxford University researchers who reviewed results from more than  NSAID studies involving roughly  patients On Tuesday panelists will vote on whether naproxen has a lower risk of heart problems than other NSAIDs The FDA panel will also vote on whether overthecounter NSAID labeling should be changed to warn patients of the shortterm risks The FDA is not required to follow the groups advice though it often does   Last year US consumers bought more than  million boxes of overthecounter NSAIDs representing  billion in sales according to retail tracker IRI Prescription NSAIDs brought in billions more led by the Pfizers blockbuster Celebrex with sales of  billion   This weeks FDA meeting is the latest chapter in an ongoing safety review that stretches back to  when Merck  Co Inc pulled its blockbuster pain reliever Vioxx off the market due to links to heart attack and stroke  The Associated Press
