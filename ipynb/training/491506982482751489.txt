At Oakland Tech like high schools all over passing period is a time for passing judgments Aaliyah Douglass a yearold gives me a taste of how harsh critiques can be at the school in Oakland Calif She starts by evaluating a male classmate who walks by wearing shorts a Tshirt and Vans Its the classic teenage boy look she says I dont know he could probably dress nicer More hipsterlike I guess Next her gaze falls on a female classmates hairstyle Well thats a weave and I dont like weaves that much because they look fake on many people she says No one likes being cited by the fashion police whether youre a teenager or an adult According to a   conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health appearance ranks as a cause of stress for about a quarter of those reporting a high level of stress in the past month Twentyeight percent said that particular unhappiness was a cause of stress for them Teenagers of course totally get what all the stress over appearance is about At school if you dont wear a certain thing people notice and you will get made fun of said yearold Raina Pelly Her classmates yearold Kamari Keonez and yearold Sophie Varon agreed On weekends maybe Ill stress about it more than maybe like lets say a weekday Pelly said but yeah I stress about it most when Im going somewhere and seeing a lot of people Ive hated being short my entire life and I guess wearing high shoes and wearing clothes that I feel make me stand out kind of makes up for that said Varon But I always wished I was taller Girls arent the only ones wishing they were taller fitter or better dressed According to the NPR poll adult men worry about appearance just as much as women And for some guys the worry starts young I was a fat Jewish kid from Brooklyn said Tufts University professor   and many times psychologists study themselves So as a pudgy Jewish kid from Brooklyn  notice I went from being fat to now I was only pudgy  I wanted to know why I wasnt so popular For nearly  years Lerner has been studying how attractiveness affects the lives of young people Obviously beauty is in the eye of the beholder and according to Lerners research if you find someone attractive youre more likely to help them The advantages of looking well are making good impressions and getting positive social evaluations and social opportunities more so than people who look less attractive he said adding that its likely society has always operated this way I would venture to say the folks in Queen Elizabeths court also wanted to look attractive by the standards of attractiveness of those days he says I think wanting to look good to other people is part of the nature of what it means to be a human It might also be part of the nature of what it means to be a teen I discovered that how to use your looks to get ahead in high school is one lesson some of us learn easily and some not so much My classmate Isabella Lew understands it well Our high school voted her Best Dressed Senior of  She walks away with more than just the title shes also gained an important life skill If you dont dress well people are not going to think you have your life together she said I mean thats the first impression they get At least for me if my grades arent right or if somethings wrong with my life this is a way of faking it and pretending to people that you have your life together For yearold Dani Tarver getting dressed is not about covering up her flaws but showing her true self Most teens spend their mornings sleeping in But for Dani this is a time for unleashing her inner artist crafting the perfect outfit to match her mood School is practically her fashion runway On a recent morning this June she gets up at  oclock in the morning  thats late by her standards  to pick out her outfit for the day She lays out four or five different outfits and begins the twohour process of mixing and matching On this particular day she decides on a blouse with flowers tank top with colored stripes black jeans with brown stitching red socks and a pair of blue Converse sneakers Yes it takes me long to get ready but I have my reasons Tarver said I have feelings I have things to consider going throughout my day like I have to work today so I look good for work I look good for school I dont look like Im showing too much because Im not showing anything But yup this is me And Im cute Tarver calls this particular style her girlygirlseriousdontmesswithme look And its just one of the many personas Dani is trying out Thats what high school is partly about  figuring out how we want to appear to others It makes a lot of sense to me In the chaotic life of teenagers we have very little control over the other things that stress us out the curfew our parents set the pop quizzes our teachers give and the shade our peers throw at us But one thing we can own is the way we look And if you figure out how to do that waking up at  am could seem like a pleasure and not a stress nightmare
