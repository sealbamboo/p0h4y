Financial belts are being tightened in many areas  including medical research But scientists say funding for such work is crucial for the UKs research industry as well as for patients In this weeks Scrubbing Up  Dr John MooreGillon a respiratory health expert and honorary medical adviser at the British Lung Foundation suggests the solution in the case of the asbestosrelated cancer mesothelioma could be to turn to the insurance industry  and that this could be a model for supporting other areas of research Each year the insurance industry pays out hundreds of millions of pounds in compensation to people who have developed mesothelioma  a cancer of the outer covering of the lung  as a result of exposure to asbestos at work  With the UK having the highest rates of mesothelioma in the world it is estimated that these payments will cost the insurance industry in excess of bn over the coming years A far more profound cost is borne though by those actually living with this often very painful disease  With no cure and little by way of effective treatments mesothelioma can act with devastating speed  Fewer than one in  sufferers are alive just three years after diagnosis and many survive just a matter of months  Compensation can help a family cope financially but nothing makes up for the loss of a loved one Wellfunded medical research is essential if this situation is to improve  but such funding remains shamefully low with that for mesothelioma lagging well behind levels invested in diseases like skin cancer that kill similar numbers of people With about  people expected to die of mesothelioma in the UK over the next  years unless new treatments are found the need to address this funding shortfall is urgent  But with public finances still tight the key question is how can we afford this extra investment without cutting back elsewhere One solution is to work with the insurance industry If each year insurers invested in mesothelioma research just a tiny fraction of the amount they will end up paying out in compensation  for example just  of that bn  it would absolutely transform mesothelioma research  What is loose change for a multibillion pound global industry could prove lifesaving for thousands And what is more as treatments improve and more mesothelioma patients live healthy fulfilling and economically productive lives the amount of compensation insurers would have to pay out would fall  Its a winwin situation that should save the industry money This principle of turning potential private sector beneficiaries into benefactors may sound unorthodox  However I believe such approaches to medical research funding will be crucial in future not only to cope with the burgeoning health problems presented by our ageing population and modern lifestyle but to ensure that diseases like mesothelioma arent neglected  Of course it wouldnt address all our researchfunding needs across all disease areas   And making it work will require a level of cooperation between politicians and industry that frustratingly we havent yet seen for mesothelioma even though both sides publicly support a deal  However with mesothelioma we have an outstanding opportunity  If government and industry pass this test it may not only help the tens of thousands of people who will otherwise die of mesothelioma over the coming years it could also fundamentally change in the long term the way we think about funding medical research
