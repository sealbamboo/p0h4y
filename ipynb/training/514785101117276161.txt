 Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc. and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. will work to cut beverage calories in the American diet 20% by 2025 through promoting bottled water, low-calorie drinks and smaller portions.. The pledge marks a rare commitment by beverage makers in the fight against obesity at a time when the industry is under increasing scrutiny of its products. Drink-makers opposed a cap on sugary drink portions in New York City, and are trying to stop a new tax on sugary drinks that San Francisco residents will vote on in November.
