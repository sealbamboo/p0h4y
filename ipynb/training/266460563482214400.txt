President Obamas reelection and the retention of a Democratic majority in the Senate means the likelihood of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act has receded So what now The law is here and we should at this point expect it to still be here Jan   says Alan Weil executive director of the nonpartisan   Jan   is the date the   like the new insurance policies available to individuals and small businesses are supposed to become available The question is says Weil what does implementation look like Theres not a lot of time left to get ready Many   and some key parts of the   delayed gearing up much of this past year They assumed either the Supreme Court would rule the law unconstitutional  which    or that Mitt Romney and a Republican Congress would be elected and   That didnt happen either Now one of the laws big implementation deadlines for states is bearing down fast When it comes to insurance exchanges states have nine more days to decide whether they want to run their own or let the federal government do it for them says Weil  are where people will go to shop for insurance coverage They are also where people will get help paying for that coverage if they qualify for subsidies from the federal government So far according to Weil only  states and Washington DC have said they plan to set up their own exchanges If states decide not to set up their own exchanges the federal government will step in and do it instead But federal officials still havent spelled out exactly how that will work Meanwhile opponents of the law say the measure is still   yet The problem goes back to those subsidies that will help people afford coverage starting in  They are a crucial part of the law Without them the law is not going to work says   who heads health policy for the libertarian Cato Institute Health insurance markets are going to collapse right after health insurance premiums are going to go sky high Thats because he contends the law only makes those subsidies available through exchanges set up by states  and not by those run by the federal government Thats also the contention of a   But other experts say not so fast The law is not beautifully crafted but there are enough crossreferences within the statute to make it clear that the subsidies are meant to be available to everyone based on their income Weil says I dont think who runs the administrative apparatus is relevant I actually think the statute is quite clear in that regard he says  meaning the subsidies should be available whether the insurance exchanges are run by states or by the federal government The insurance exchanges are not the only big question mark facing the law Cannon says Its vulnerable because  it was handed a defeat by the Supreme Court when the Supreme Court said that the Medicaid expansion is optional for states he said That led   to vow that they would not add millions of new lowincome adults to their Medicaid programs  even though the federal government will pay most of the bill But now   and others who serve those currently uninsured people are agitating to bring that federal money in So those governors may find themselves under increasing pressure at home
