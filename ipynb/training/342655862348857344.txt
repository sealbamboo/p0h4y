After a mile training run Trish Staine was in pain Not posttrainingrun pain Real excruciating  I was yelling and screaming  I thought I was dying says Staine who was in training for Grandmas Half Marathon in her hometown of Duluth Minn at the end of the month Her family called an ambulance and when they got to the hospital they expected a diagnosis of a pinched nerve a kidney stone maybe a burst appendix   But what the nurse treating Staine found was a fetal heartbeat And Im like looking around like no I dont believe it Staine told TODAY on Thursday She says hadnt missed any periods she didnt have a baby belly  and her husband John had had a vasectomy  But despite all that Staine soon delivered a healthy girl weighing  pounds  ounces The Staines already have two biological children ages  and  and two foster children plus Johns three boys who are   and  They havent yet decided on a name but Trish has an idea I wouldnt mind just naming her Miracle and calling her Mira for short she told TODAY This is the kind of story that makes you say as TODAY anchor Savannah Guthrie did after the interview aired REALLY Can this really happen It can and it does says Dr Nancy Snyderman chief medical editor for NBC News In the medical literature its called denial of pregnancy and Snyderman cites a  done in Germany that found  out of  women who delivered a baby did not realize they were pregnant  There seem to be three general reasons this can happen One the woman is very obese and so does not notice the growing baby belly Two the woman is very thin or anorexic and because of that perhaps already has irregular or skipped periods Or three  denial denial denial In obese mothers who didnt know they were pregnant there can be problems with high blood pressure or blood sugar issues that can put mom or baby at risk But despite lack of prenatal care Snyderman believes the Staines surprise baby will be fine although she has not treated the infant herself The story sounds unbelievable but Snyderman has seen it herself Early in her medical career she was treating an obese woman who came into the emergency room complaining of what she thought was a stomach flu Guess what I held a baby Snyderman says Ive seen it in person
