Air disaster experts  who readily admit they are as baffled as everyone else about the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight   say it is technically possible but almost unimaginable that the plane landed somewhere A week and a half after the jet vanished over Southeast Asia the possibility of an intact landing perhaps on a remote airstrip seems to survive because no other theory of the case cleanly matches all the facts But safely landing a footlong jetliner without anyone noticing  and keeping it hidden from the world for the  days that have followed  would be an unprecedented disappearing act You cant completely eliminate it but its unlikely said Bill Waldock a professor of safety science at EmbryRiddle Aeronautical University in Prescott Ariz and an aircraft accident investigator Investigators figure that the jetliner was along one of two arcs each thousands of miles long when it last made contact with a commercial satellite at  am Malaysia time on March  Along the northern arc China India and Pakistan have reported no sign of the plane according to The Associated Press Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have   in their airspace US intelligence officials believe the southern arc is the likelier possibility The southern arc stretches from Indonesia into the yawning expanse of the Indian Ocean where radar coverage is more scarce It brushes close to Australia where there is vast mostly uninhabited outback where it might be possible to land a plane Probably there would be some places flat enough to put an airplane down Waldock said The question is isnt somebody going to see it Its  feet long and  feet wide counting wingspan Thats going to show up like a sore thumb And in the remote islands along the southern arc theres nothing built up enough to put an airplane down on he said Besides the problem of landing a  in the territory of a sovereign country a sinister pilot crew member or hijacker would have to take control of the more than  people left on the plane And using it in a nefarious plot would require refueling it Theres a lot of moving parts to do that Don Borelli an NBC News national security analyst said Monday on TODAY And to what end And the fact that theres no chatter in the intelligence community talking about such a plot It seems unlikely he concluded but Im not going to rule it out Robert Hager who covered aviation for NBC News for  years before retiring said that even if civilian radar didnt pick up the plane spy satellites or radar that we dont know about probably would have I just dont see it he said If they find the plane on the ground its going to be in little pieces in the Himalayas or the bottom of the ocean The theorizing is complicated by the fact that the families of the  people on the plane are increasingly distraught and desperate for answers about what happened to their loved ones Hishammuddin Hussein the Malaysian defense minister told a news conference Monday that finding the plane was still the focus of investigators and he did not rule out finding it in one piece The fact that there was no distress signal no ransom notes no parties claiming responsibility there is always hope he said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang whose country is home to more than half the passengers sounded a similar note As long as there is one thread of hope we will continue an allout effort Tom Casey a retired American Airlines pilot who flew the Boeing  said that it could land and stop on a runway as short as  feet if it were coming in light on fuel as Flight  would have been after flying for seven hours And the New York public radio station WNYC relying on data from the aviation site XPlane   of  feet or more in the countries surrounding Malaysia including Micronesia and the farflung Maldives If they flew over the wrong place they would show up on airdefense radar Waldock said And all the sudden you get lit up by a missile Casey too questioned how a landed  could be hidden especially given the enormous media attention paid to the missing plane And anyone who wanted to land the plane would have had to know exactly where they were going he said Still he added It makes a lot more sense to me that youd fly a plane to somewhere than fly a plane into oblivion He questioned whether other countries might have missed Flight s radar blip  at the time the world was just learning about a missing plane  or might be loath to admit that a plane had penetrated their radar systems without anyone noticing We know they flew for six or seven hours he said It doesnt make any sense at all for a plane whether its a rogue crew or an intervention to fly like that for seven hours and then crash and die An intact landing is difficult to imagine he said but I think its as likely as any scenario  This is the first disappearance of its kind that we know about period
