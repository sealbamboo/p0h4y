 is not always pink That is the message of a provocative new photography series featuring the faces and scars of men with breast cancer The photos by the New Yorkbased fashion photographer David Jay are part of his continuing   a series of mostly blackandwhite portraits that capture the devastation of breast cancer The vast majority of the photos in that project are of young women shown topless with scars where their breasts used to be The pictures which are both shocking and beautiful are featured in a traveling exhibition that will be on display next month in Toronto But most visitors to the Scar Project find the photos on the Internet where they have been viewed by millions of people One of those people is Oliver Bogler a cancer biologist in Houston who found out that he had breast cancer  months ago after noticing a lump in his chest 
 As in a womans breast the duct cells in a mans breast can undergo cancerous changes fueled by hormones that influence the growth of cells It is not clear why some men get breast cancer while most do not but risk factors include a family history of breast cancer inherited gene mutations radiation exposure extended occupational exposure to certain chemicals or intense heat       and other cancer treatments All of these factors can influence the level of hormones in a mans body and potentially spur breast cancer That said many men who develop breast cancer do not have any of these risk factors Fewer than  percent of breast cancers are diagnosed in men but that is little comfort to the  men a year who learn they have the disease For Dr Bogler  the diagnosis was particularly shocking because his wife had learned five years earlier that she had breast cancer I struggled with the huge coincidence Dr Bogler said We were both diagnosed when we were  It seemed a bit unlikely I couldnt imagine having this conversation with her either Honey I think I have what you haveÂ  Like many cancer patients Dr Bogler found himself spending time online in hopes of learning more about his disease He stumbled across the Scar Project and asked Mr Jay if he would consider including men in the series As a result the Male Scar Project was created The photo of Dr Bogler shows him next to a radiation machine his chest covered with marker lines used to guide the radiation beam The photos of men with breast cancer are admittedly less jarring than those of women One reason may be that it is less surprising to see a shirtless man and the absence of his breast and nipple is not as immediately noticeable But the portraits of the men are still haunting and show in a more subtle way the spiritual ravages of cancer The photos are also similar in that they capture both the vulnerability and the strength of breast cancer patients regardless of their sex One of the subjects William Becker of Bridgeport Conn said he had wanted to be photographed to raise awareness among men who may be ignoring a lump not realizing it could be breast cancer I was dealing with a lot of health issues that could have been avoided had I done something sooner about the lump that I had found on my chest Mr Becker said No man should be going through what I was enduring Mr Becker said he felt the photo captured his experience better than words could The photo is very striking he said It gives you a sense of fear in that there is this man with a scar on his chest and burn marks surrounding it from the radiation treatment  a kind of dont let this happen to you image Dr Bogler worked with Mr Jay to include men in the Scar Project because he felt that more awareness was needed about the male experience with the disease He also believes that more research into male breast cancer could help unlock new knowledge about the disease for both men and women Dr Bogler added that while ovarian uterine prostate and testicular cancers are inherently genderspecific breast cancer is no more genderspecific than lung or   I was surprised to learn how little awareness there was for men he said Breast cancer is skewed toward women but its not just a womans cancer Even when filling out forms at the doctors office Dr Bogler found that many of the questions were aimed at women I live in this very pink world he said Im not complaining about it I dont mind skipping the Are you pregnant part of the form But I realized most people dont even know men get breast cancer
