To stop the raging Ebola epidemic in West Africa we need to pay attention to where the fire is burning That means there is no magic solution   the head of the World Bank told NPRs Steve Inskeep during an interview on   So appointing an Ebola czar to monitor the international response isnt going to suddenly stop the outbreak Neither will closing the borders between US and the three hardesthit countries Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone To Kim thats not a longterm solution Its like youre in your room and the house is on fire and your approach is to put wet towels under the door That might work for a while but unless you put the fire out youre still in trouble The way to stop this epidemic from coming at an even higher level in the United States is actually try to stop it in its tracks he says of the many US health workers who have volunteered to go overseas He says whats most important is not only getting protocols in place in the United States but also in Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone That means quickly identifying cases and instituting a high level of infection control  not just standard precautions Weve got to have very highquality protective equipment he says When patients get sick we need to provide intensive care The good news he says is that leaders like President Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron have stepped up in their aid But the response has just been inadequate for an outbreak that dates back to December of last year We are only now getting comprehensive plans for how we are going to attack this epidemic he says Whats really missing are health workers he says While we can move thing and build structures what we need are skilled health workers who can do all the complicated things you need to stop the epidemic Kim pointed to Nigeria to illustrate the level of intervention needed to stop the current outbreak With the help of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization Nigeria was able to contain the outbreak with  confirmed cases and only seven related deaths Still it cost them  million and more than  physicians and  other health workers he says They had to do  home visits taking temperatures in order to get it control He acknowledges that with nearly  cases so far theres a lot of work to be done Yet hes confident that the international community will be able to stop Ebola  although he stresses that weve got to move much more quickly
