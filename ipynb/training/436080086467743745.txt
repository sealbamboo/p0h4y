A year after getting secret weightloss surgery New Jersey Gov Chris Christie is clearly much reduced in size but still far from what youd call thin The recent highprofile controversy over closures of access lanes to the George Washington Bridge has drawn slams not only from those whove questioned Christies leadership but also people piling on about whether hed failed in his effort to curb his girth Its been especially nasty on Twitter where users havent missed an opportunity to insult Christies size and conservative pundit Glenn Beck jumped in on the thread last month dubbing the scandal FatAndFurious But a top bariatricsurgery expert estimates that the Republican governor actually has shed between  pounds and  pounds from his foot frame slimming down to an estimated  pounds after hushhush gastricbanding surgery in February  In the world of the superobese thats success says Dr Ninh T Nguyen president of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Were trying to get somebody into a healthy lifestyle and reduce their obesityrelated conditions said Nguyen director of bariatric surgery at the University of California Irvine Medical Center Were not trying to make somebody skinny here In fact most people are not like TODAYs Al Roker who famously lost more than  pounds a decade ago after gastric bypass surgery slimming down to  pounds from a high of  Some can never get that low experts say and even Roker  that he struggled after the surgery regaining  pounds during a family medical crisis For Christies part his size has drawn darts for years with speculation that his extra weight could derail any plans for a  US presidential bid The fatshaming died down a bit when word leaked that Christie had undergone weightloss surgery but it flared again when the bridge scandal erupted Christie  has remained all but mum on procedure that has helped him shed pounds What I will say is that Im more than halfway to my goal he told CBS News in late September But he didnt divulge what that goal was or when hed get there Judging by photographs however Nguyen says that it appears that Christie has lost  percent to  percent of his excess weight in the first year about what might be expected from adjustable gastric band surgery more commonly known as LapBand From the images I saw I would say yes I would regard it as successful Nguyen said That view was echoed by Dr Thomas Inge a bariatric expert at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital who often works to reverse obesity in adolescents before they become ultraheavy adults With everything the man is dealing with it is a wonder he has done so well Inge told NBC News Christie chose the leastinvasive option for bariatric surgery in which an adjustable silicone band filled with saline is wrapped around the upper part of the stomach creating a small pouch that restricts food intake About  procedures have been performed worldwide since the US Food and Drug Administration approved the device in  It now accounts for about  percent of the weightloss surgery market according to a study by Duke University Medical Center researchers presented last fall Gastric bypass surgery is still more popular accounting for about half of all surgeries With gastric bypass procedures the stomach is reduced to the size of a walnut and then reattached to the small intestine avoiding part of the intestine and limiting absorption of calories Gastric bypass surgery generally results in greater weight loss in the first year than the adjustable band procedure but those who use the band typically catch up later as long as the patient stays on the wagon Inge says But the truth is even with surgery most superobese people are not going to join the ranks of the thin Inge says At that level a person might have a body mass index a measure of height vs weight of  or  Even with surgery BMI might fall to  or even  But a BMI of  is still considered obese Its a category that is quite challenging Nguyen said Christies extra challenge is losing weight  or maintaining a loss  in the face of ongoing public scrutiny In my view every question is fair since he is a public figure Nguyen said This is a personal issue but you are in the public eye and everything you do is being watched Unfortunately that comes with his job
