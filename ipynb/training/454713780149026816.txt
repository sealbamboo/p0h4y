The   in West Africa is terrifying because theres no drug to treat this often fatal disease But the disease is so rare theres no incentive for big pharmaceutical companies to develop a treatment Even so some small companies given government incentives are stepping into that breach The result More than half a dozen ideas are being pursued actively And these are boon days for drugs that can treat viruses Think of treatments for AIDS and hepatitis C Potential treatments for Ebola pursue many strategies These include conventional drugs custombuilt antibodies and vaccines that are designed not simply to prevent the spread of a disease but to treat it in people who are in the early stages of infection Each idea has shown some promise in animals But nothing has yet passed critical human testing so theres nothing ready to be tried during the current outbreak Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is hopeful about this multipronged approach but says I think its really too early to make a prediction about what is the more or less promising one among them One challenge is that there are several different species and strains of Ebolalike viruses so there may not be a onesizefitsall solution But one experimental drug could conceivably fit that bill Its called BCX Travis Warren at the   lab in Frederick Md has been working on this antiviral drug It worked great against both Ebola virus and the closely related Marburg virus when tested in mice he says It also protected guinea pigs from these viruses and yellow fever So the   was in a small number of monkeys who had been infected with Marburg virus When we started the drug either  hours or  hours after the infection  percent of those animals survived Warren says Its notable that this drug is being developed by a small company called   It just wouldnt make the cut at a major company says Dr William Sheridan BioCrysts medical director who once worked at the drug giant Amgen Ebola scary as it is has only made about  people sick since it was discovered in  killing about  of them So the market for a drug like this is tiny Still Sheridan says his company has good reason to pursue it beyond his desire to address an important public health issue There is a market and the market is the US government he says The government has promised to buy a stockpile of drugs that are effective against Ebola in case someone should try to use it as a biological agent on the battlefield or in an act of terrorism Federal agencies also are helping to pay for the research so the company is pushing forward as quickly as it can Were currently manufacturing the drug and will be conducting typical animal safety experiments that you typically do before you put drugs in humans Sheridan says And once thats successfully completed I anticipate by the middle of next year that we should have completed phase one studies in people Phase one tests will tell them whether the drug is relatively safe but it wont tell them whether it would actually be an effective treatment Assuming the drug seems safe it would be ready for testing in a future outbreak of Ebola Of course most potential drugs dont live up to their early promise and theres no assurance this one will either But Travis Warren at the Army lab says that given all the advances in developing drugs to treat viruses something will emerge out of this broad quest for an Ebola drug Im absolutely certain it will happen Warren says Its just a matter of time
