Only bacteria classified as group A strep are technically flesheating says Rajal Mody a medical epidemiologist in the CDCs Division of Foodborne Waterborne and Environmental Diseases The dozen species of Vibrio bacterium known to cause disease in humans are not in this group but do account for an estimated  illnesses  hospitalizations and  deaths each year in the United States  The difference is that  attack the bands of tissue that surround muscles nerves fat and blood vessels Vibrio vulnificus on the other hand gets into the blood stream from either the skin or intestinal tract and can damage organs and cause skin lesions that may appear similar to the skin damage caused by strep A Mody says Vibrio vulnificus multiplies in warmer water temperatures and tends to reach peak levels in midsummer according to Mody so the higher bacteria count coincides with the height of beach season This adds to the publics fear of the bacteria After all no one wants to get a limb amputated while on vacation The important thing to remember is that these infections are rare Mody says The   estimates that nationwide there are  Vibrio vulnificus cases each year including  hospitalizations and  deaths And typically the bacteria are only a summer health hazard with  of infections occurring between May and October  Most at risk for severe illness and death from Vibrio vulnificus are people with a weakened immune system or who suffer from chronic liver disease Mody says Milder   caused by this bacteria include diarrhea vomiting and stomach pain Some people might not show any signs of infection Two parasites found in contaminated water Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia can also cause similar symptoms according to the   Still shooting that raw oyster or cutting your foot on a shell during your beach vacation shouldnt be taken lightly If you experience symptoms a few hours or days after eating shellfish or being exposed to coastal water seek medical attention immediately Rapid treatment is really critical Mody says If someone is eating raw oysters especially in a highrisk group or is swimming in the ocean and notices skin lesions that are worsening quickly it is important to get early treatment Mortality rates increase if treatment isnt started on the first day of symptoms For those concerned about the safety of their summer vacation spot states that typically report the most infections are Florida Texas and Maryland In  the   reported  deaths and  infections Texas    to  annual cases while   say they see an average of  infections per year California took action in  to reduce health risks by implementing a regulation to restrict the sale of raw oysters harvested from the Gulf Coast during warmer months when the bacteria count tends to be higher In a   published in  by CDC and the California Department of Public Health researchers found that this action was strongly correlated with the reduction of deaths and illness Mody says based on the data it can be assumed that oysters harvested in the Gulf of Mexico between April and October have the highest levels of the bacteria  In addition to avoiding raw oysters the CDC also recommends wearing gloves when handling raw shellfish and thoroughly cooking it and discarding closedshell varieties that dont open after cooking  For visitors to the beach or bay if you have an open wound or broken skin avoid exposure to warm salt or brackish water if youre in a highrisk group
