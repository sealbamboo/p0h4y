he NHS has had a pretty horrible Christmas with AEs swamped more than a dozen hospitals declaring major incidents and a bleak midwinter bed shortage worthy of firstcentury Bethlehem Various causes have been cited not enough money too many ill people the government the previous government and GPs But a major contributory factor appears to be the    helpline Thats the number youre now supposed to ring if you dont need an ambulance Not any time you dont need an ambulance obviously Not for example when you need a fire engine or the police instead  stick with  for those Its for when you dont need an ambulance a fire engine or the police but if you were pressed youd have to admit its an ambulance that you dont need least If you were to pick one of those things you dont need and try to make some sort of use of it youd go for the ambulance On balance Because come to think of it you might actually need an ambulance I absolutely cant think of a simpler way of describing it It seems that  works slightly differently from NHS Direct which preceded it and was staffed by nurses in that very few of the people who answer the phone are medically trained They have no more chance of fixing a human body themselves than someone in an EE call centre has of generating a G signal using an alkaline battery and a radio transmitter They work off a computer system called Pathways which tells them what questions to ask and then the answers having been typed in what advice to give As triage goes this is flawed The first stage of it  the decision to opt for  rather than on the one hand  or on the other a paracetamol and a liedown  is conducted by the patients themselves This ensures that the new service gets a nice mix of those who are definitely dying but dont want to be any trouble and malingerers who are losing the courage of their convictions Then the next stage is a sort of medical version of those magazine surveys that claim to tell you whether youre romantic or sociopathic or spiritual or a typical Scorpio But regardless of whether most of your answers are As Bs or Cs the system still just advises you to consult someone trained to diagnose whether theres anything really wrong with you rather than waste any more time describing your nasty rash to a guy whose last job was coldcalling about missold PPIs And thats what causes the trouble for AE the combination of a riskaverse computer algorithm call centre staff who dont want blood on their hands and the scarcity of GP appointments on public holidays weekends and when theres good skiing to be had is driving thousands of  callers into AE to be put on a trolley and ignored like a   in a s restaurant The solution is simple the algorithm needs some backbone By which I dont mean that the decisions should be taken by actual live vertebrates  thats obviously unworkably expensive But we need to be honest with ourselves the whole point of this phone line is to fob people off  to stop them going to hospital not encourage them Deep down they want to be told theyre fine and to stop moaning  otherwise they wouldve dialled   so a new version of Pathways needs to be designed with that in mind Recorded Voice Were sorry that you too have found it necessary to call NHS  We apologise for the delay but were experiencing extremely high callÂ volume Its that time of year Colds sniffles  nothing serious but you know how people are Bloody hypochondriacs Not saying thats you of course Im sure youre at deaths door Just hope theres no one with a burst appendix in the phone queue just behind you thats all Wouldnt want you to have that on your conscience Still nice music eh Stirring stuff I expect youre feeling better already Calls may be recorded for subsequent publication as a book of hilarious and embarrassing medical anecdotes Your continuing to hold will be taken as consent for your name to be used Q Thank you for calling NHS  Please enter the last seven digits of your NHS number into your HealthSentry device sponsored by Nivea Visage and read out the resultant letter Medicode Q How are you Q Have you experienced your current symptoms before Well they didnt kill you last time  And you didnt think you might give it a week and see if they clear up Q How can you be sure that the way you feel now isnt how youre meant to feel and the way you used to feel wasnt an illness from which youve now recovered Q Are you aware that in the vast majority of cases theres nothing wrong with the patient that wont clear up of its own accord Q Are you aware that in a significant percentage of the remaining cases theres no effective treatment and so its probably kinder to remain undiagnosed Q You dont fancy giving homeopathy a try do you Its very convenient assuming youve got access to mains water Q Have you made a will Dont you think thats a priority instead of wasting time on the phone  Its not from one of those will kits is it Because theyre about as likely to stand up in court as Oliver Reed after a heavy night I mean you might as well just bequeath everything to lawyers now No you need a proper one done by a solicitor Its an absolute priority to get that sorted before you let some junior doctor open you up and poke around Q On a scale of  to  where  means strongly disagree and  means strongly agree how would you respond to the phrase Weve all got to go some time
