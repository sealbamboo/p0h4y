When I entered the exam room to see my first patient of the day a doctor from another department at my hospital I found her sitting in the chair I usually occupy typing away at the computer on the tiny desk  The hospital would be proud of you doctor working right up to the time of your own appointment I said shaking my head in mock disbelief at her dedication She laughed as she shut the screen down Just finishing up some patient charting I sat in one of the other chairs She had been diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia a couple of years ago when she was  and while she tolerated her initial therapy extremely well even continuing to work full time it did not eliminate her leukemia as much as we had hoped Her next medication caused too many side effects but finally we were able to find a drug that both worked and had minimal toxicity  Throughout this experience she educated herself in the latest scientific articles about her leukemia and asked for my interpretation of the results and how they related to her In other words she made sure I was at the top of my game when I made treatment recommendations to her We spent appointments discussing these papers or hospital politics or each others families like old friends The past year had been a rough one for her Her father also a doctor had died and she suffered a heart attack out of the blue She cut back work to part time and started to talk more about retirement and her own mortality I asked her what she had been doing recently Cleaning out old stuff at home she said And I have a question that you are best suited to answer She continued You know how when you get into medical school the first thing you do is go out and buy the black doctors bag And then you put things like your stethoscope and reflex hammer and tuning fork into it and then you never actually use the damn thing when you become a doctor I laughed and nodded Well I still have mine at the back of my bedroom closet And over time the kids have pilfered all of my medical equipment out of it for when they used to play doctor or for science projects  I offered that the reflex hammer was also commandeered as occasional weaponry Right exactly She smiled Well I went to throw the bag out and at the bottom discovered a letter I stashed in it from when I did my residency It was from the mother of a patient I cared for She sent it after her son died  Was it a grateful letter or did she wonder what more could have been done to save her child I asked Actually a little of both she answered So my question is what do you do with the letters you receive from families of patients youve lost  I did receive these letters sometimes in response to the condolence card I sent sometimes before a card went out  Most were genuinely appreciative You gave us two years with Mom we thought wed never have Some included photocopies of the obituary or programs from the funeral and included facts about my patients I hadnt known previously He fought at Guadalcanal during World War II Others were a mix like my patients letter from her patients mother We appreciate everything you did for him but still wonder if the doctors in the intensive care unit started the antibiotics in time I told her I suspected that family members sometimes sent those types of letters because they werent sure theyd done everything they could to help prevent the death I asked her if shed answered it No she said I didnt know what to say But I also cant bring myself to throw it out  She became pensive and I wondered if she was thinking about the letter that might be sent to me after she died and whether I would save it or toss it in the trash I dont throw them out either I said Its almost like a part of the person I cared for and it seems callous to discard it  I told her I kept a file folder of those letters in my desk drawer and that my wife joked that one day a crew would come to clean out my office like one of those hoarders homes on TV She laughed  Im happy to take your letter and put it in my file I offered Itll be safe there Maybe thats the best place for it she agreed and seemed relieved it would have a home
