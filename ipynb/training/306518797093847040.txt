When we asked you via our Facebook page to tell us about the weekday challenges your families face given the competing demands of work commutes schoolwork and activities you didnt hold back Especially on the subject of squeezing in a family dinner This topic hit my central core wrote   Its amazingly hard says mom Samantha Kolber of Plainfield Vt Lots of balls in the air says Katherine Hennessy of Boston Witching hours is how working mom Czarina Kulick of Pittsburgh Pa described the daily hurdles and tagteam efforts to feed bathe and complete homework It often feels like no one wins My family dinners while they are surely Norman Rockwell in my head in real life its more like the TV show   says   of Wisconsin mom of three kids She referenced one episode where Homer Simpson cajoles the family off the couch Were not going to shovel food in our mouths while we stare at the TV Homer says Were going to eat at the dining room table like a normal family If you listen to my story on   youll get a shockingly honest and real snapshot of Leichsenrings family dinner Its quick eight minutes and full of distractions think iPods TV and kids complaining they dont like milk And Leichsenring is not alone Our NPR   conducted with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health finds about a quarter of children surveyed live in homes where  on a given night  the TV is on or someone is using an electronic device The poll was based on a nationally representative sample of US households with children About  caregivers are included The poll also found that despite families ranking a family meal as a high priority about half of children live in a home where on a given night families dont sit down together to eat or share the same food Lots of families we heard from told us that family dinners are special times They just dont happen  night For many its a weekend dinner where everyone looks forward to being together But for a choice few it seems family dinner is the glue that holds the family together We profile one such family the BrownSpencers in our photo gallery above So why are we asking about family dinners Several studies have suggested that regular family meals contribute to healthy eating habits For instance one  found that middleschool kids who routinely ate with their families tended to be healthier eaters when they reached high school And there also seems to be emotional benefits as well We think family dinners matter because they provide an opportunity for families to sit down together to relax to communicate to share happenings about their day says   an associate professor at Cornell University whose research focuses on modern family dynamics But in an era when so many families are stretched thin its possible that a nightly dinner may not be the prime opportunity for communicating or relaxing together If a meal is slapdash and stressful is it really making a family stronger Musick says its not clear Our   shows that the benefits of family dinners are not as strong or as lasting as previous studies suggest says Musick It may be that quality time spent together  away from the table  is just as beneficial as eating together For Jessica Leichsenrings family this means playing outside together after school or reading together at bedtime Leichsenring says shes come to terms with her eightminute dinners and she feels shes got strong relationships with her children As long as Im present in their lives and involved with them and showing them what it is to be a good person I dont think having dinner together is going to sway that one way or another she says So does family dinner matter Tell us what you think
