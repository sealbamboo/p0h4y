Americans like big butts The numbers cannot lie Last year cosmetic surgeons across the country performed nearly  buttock augmentations up from the approximately  done in  according to new stats from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons Lets put this into context The numbers for the Brazilian butt lift as its nicknamed still arent anywhere near the popularity of the most common plastic surgery procedures nearly  times as many breast augmentations were done in that same time period for just one example But the new statistics do show a  percent increase in butt augmentations from  perhaps a side effect of a nations ongoing quest to keep up with Kim Kardashian Its just amazing the numbers said Dr Douglas Taranow a boardcertified plastic surgeon in New York Citys Upper East Side Its with J Lo and Beyonce and everyone else having a great derriere  I think people see that and they want to mirror image it Taranow says he started getting requests for Brazilian butt lifts about three and a half years ago now its the second most popular procedure he does Its still not quite as popular among his patients as liposuction but it surpassed breast augmentations last year He says hes lately been doing as many as four or five Brazilian butt lifts in a week and while its mostly women hes had two male patients in the past six months Plastic surgery used to be a reduction specialty so when we did nose jobs we reduced the nose But now as we are more sensitive to ethnicity and different body types we sometimes augment the nose Well same thing with the buttocks said Dr Robert X Murphy Jr president of ASPS and a plastic surgeon in Bethlehem Pa Cosmetic surgery as an industry continues to grow according to the report  million procedures were done last year which is up  percent since  Those figures took a slight dip in  but have been inching up every year since And the most interesting findings in this years report are all about the booty  percent of cosmetic surgeons ASPS surveyed in  said they were doing butt augmentations compared to  percent in  This is the first year the plastic surgery association has included the procedure in its annual statistics The particular procedure is buttock augmentation with fat grafting which means surgeons liposuction fat from somewhere the patients got plenty of it  usually the tummy thighs or hips  and inject it into the tush This kind of procedure is being used more in many different kinds of cosmetic surgery including breast augmentation and some reconstructive surgeries Fat is one of the great resources we have in this country Murphy said As a tissue its been underappreciated But he says surgeons prefer it because the fat tissue is pliable giving the physician more control than they have when working with synthetic materials and patients like the twofer benefit of losing fat in an area they didnt want it But patients also gravitate toward fat grafting for cosmetic surgery because the idea sounds so much more natural Its still you after all Just  rearranged Its like youre taking it from one area and youre putting it where you need it said Marissa a patient of Dr Taranows Shes a yearold mother of three who lives in the Bronx and just had a Brazilian butt lift done two weeks ago She didnt want to give her last name And its your own fat its not like youre getting some foreign subject in your body You hear all these horror stories about people getting these butt injections that are like things from Home Depot Shes talking about the horrific case of the fake doctor   for injecting a womans buttocks with a combination of cement FixAFlat mineral oil and superglue But there was also the yearold mother of two   after receiving a round of injections meant to enhance her derriere or the British tourist   after getting silicone injections into her buttocks in Philadelphia The procedures increasing popularity means that there are a lot of quacks out there wanting to make a quick buck and so its especially important that patients make sure that theyre in the hands of a boardcertified surgeon Murphy saysThe website for the plastic surgery association has a  tool patients can use as one way to ensure that their surgeon is properly trained Murphy says hes seen so many terrible sometimes irreversible complications happen to people whove gone to nonprofessionals It may be cosmetic but he reminds Plastic surgery is still real surgery
