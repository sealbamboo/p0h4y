Got milk If youre drinking it to prevent bone fractures or to boost your overall health you might want to go back to the fridge and opt for a yogurt or a slice of cheese instead A new   in the journal BMJ casts doubt on the widely held view that milk can help adults ward off hip fractures and broken bones After tracking more than  Swedish men and women for up to  years the study authors saw no link between milk consumption and fracture risk However they did find that avid milk drinkers were more likely to die at younger ages than their counterparts who drank little to no milk The Dietary Guidelines for Americans   everyone over the age of  to consume three cups of milk per day or the corresponding amount of yogurt cheese or other dairy products Many European countries offer   After all milk is a convenient source of calcium vitamin D and phosphorus three nutrients that are important for bone growth However the researchers  from the Uppsala University the Karolinska Institute and the Swedish National Food Agency  wondered whether this advice was scientifically valid No randomized clinical trials have shown that drinking milk causes the risk of fractures or premature death to fall and observational studies that might reveal an association between milk and better health have had mixed results The research team cited another reason for their skepticism Dgalactose This is produced by the body as it breaks down lactose the sugar in milk Studies in animals have shown that chronic exposure to the nutrient causes oxidative stress damage chronic inflammation neurodegeneration decreased immune response and gene transcriptional changes they wrote In fact when scientists want to mimic the effects of aging they give animals shots or food containing Dgalactose So the researchers turned to two large studies of Swedish adults The Swedish Mammography Cohort included data on  women who answered questions about their diet between  and  Among them  answered a more detailed diet survey in  In addition the Cohort of Swedish Men contained data on  men who completed a diet questionnaire in  All of the study participants were tracked until death as verified by Swedish health records or until Dec   The results Among the women  suffered some type of fracture including  who had a hip fracture Drinking milk did not appear to reduce the risk compared with women who drank less than one glass of milk per day women who drank at least three glasses of milk per day were  more likely to have any fracture and  more likely to have a hip fracture In addition the researchers calculated that the avid milkdrinkers were  more likely than their counterparts to die during the course of the study Those who drank at least three glass of milk were  more likely to die of cardiovascular disease and  more likely to die of cancer compared with women who drank less than one glass of milk per day The effects were smaller in men Those who drank at least three glass of milk daily were  more likely to die during the course of the study than were men who drank less than one glass of milk per day That was mainly due to a  increased risk of cardiovascular disease the researchers found Milk consumption seemed to have no bearing on the risk of cancer or fractures for men But what about yogurt cheese and other fermented dairy products Compared with milk these foods have much less lactose Thats because they are   with   bacteria which eat the lactose and convert it into lactic acid With less lactose these dairy foods produce less Dgalactose So if the researchers hunch about Dgalactose were correct yogurt cheese sour cream and buttermilk should have the beneficial effects frequently associated with milk Some of the volunteers in both studies gave urine samples and researchers analyzed them to measure a biomarker called iso PGF alpha a measure of oxidative stress For men and women drinking more milk was associated with higher levels of this biomarker and eating more yogurt sour cream and buttermilk was linked with lower levels Cheese had no effect Some of the men also gave blood samples allowing researchers to test for interleukin a biomarker of inflammation The researchers found that men who drank more milk had higher levels of this biomarker and men who ate more yogurt and other fermented dairy products besides cheese had lower levels Among all of the women in the study those who ate more of these fermented dairy foods had lower rates of fractures and premature death compared with women who ate less of them Each additional serving corresponded with a  to  reduction in the risk of both the researchers found However the effects for men were more modest or nonexistent according to the study The results certainly raise questions about dietary guidelines that encourage people to drink lots of milk However the researchers cautioned that it would be premature to pour your milk down the drain Longterm studies are needed to show that drinking lots of milk actually causes the health problems seen in this study they wrote Also all of the study participants were of European descent and the findings may not apply to people of other ethnic groups An   published alongside the study noted that countries in Europe and North America have both the highest levels of milk consumption in the world as well as higher rates of hip fractures and heart disease The author   a public health epidemiologist at the City University of New York also noted that the ability to digest milk as an adult arose several times in human history and appears to have an evolutionary advantage However she wrote the benefits may help people live long enough to have children and help this trait spread but they might not help people survive into old age As living standards rise in countries around the world milk drinking becomes more widespread Schooling wrote That means questions about possible milkrelated health risks are important for a growing number of people The role of milk in mortality needs to be established definitively now she concluded
