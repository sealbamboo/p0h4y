 Susan Schneck began suffering from frequent painful heartburn in  In the evening and especially after lying down to go to sleep I would invariably experience heartburn Schneck said It was a burning Not exactly nausea but that same type of upward sensation only with that burning Like youd had a hot drink or really really spicy food And once it started it wouldnt go away It never occurred to Schneck now  and living in Madison Wis to go to a doctor for treatment I kind of knew Oh its heartburn It never occurred to me it could be something worse she said It also never occurred to me it could be something I could fix Instead she dealt with the problem by chewing antacid tablets Id never done anything but take Tums she said I took two Tums a day at least Pretty much every day I experienced symptoms and every day I had to take Tums for them This went on until  when she was working at a hospital in North Carolina and saw that a clinical trial was being offered that involved an endoscopic evaluation The trial was looking for people with chronic heartburn to test them for   a potential side effect of gastroesophageal reflux disease that can lead to cancer I realized Geez I shouldnt have let this go untreated for so long Schneck recalled Schneck had the endoscopy and the researchers found no severe damage However they told her that if she was experiencing heartburn as often as she reported she needed medical treatment I just went to my primary care doctor and told her what Id been told Schneck said She put me on a twoweek trial of   a proton pump inhibitor and it was amazing I had relief from the first pill on I didnt have heartburn that afternoon for the first time in I dont know how long Schneck also started working on her weight She weighed more than  pounds when she began experiencing symptoms and by  she was up to  pounds After her mother and sister were diagnosed with   she decided to try to drop some pounds to decrease her risk for the disease Weight loss she discovered had the added benefit of relieving her acid reflux too As soon as I lost the first  pounds my symptoms really started going down Schneck said By  she was able to stop taking medication I would say Im symptomfree now all but maybe one day a month she said Her advice for anyone suffering from   as she did Get help I cant believe I suffered from that every day for so long and never thought it was something worth treating worth going to the doctor for she said
