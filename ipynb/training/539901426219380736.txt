President Barack Obama headed to the National Institutes of Health outside Washington Tuesday to laud US efforts to fight the Ebola virus using the success of a small vaccine trial as a premise to say the US and West Africa alike are better prepared to   And he pushed hard for more funding Vaccine experts at the NIHs National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases  that the first evidence from their tests of an Ebola vaccine in human volunteers shows its safe and likely to protect people from infection Its nothing unusual for vaccine development but Obamas asking Congress for more than  billion to fight Ebola and he needs evidence that the money will produce results Congress has until the middle of this month to approve a budget that would include the money Its a good Christmas present to the American people and to the world Obama said The moneys running out he added We cannot beat Ebola without more funding If we want other countries to step up we are going to have to lead the way Obama argued that fighting Ebola is a bipartisan issue that shouldnt get bogged down in messy American politics Its a basic commonsense issue that all Americans agree on he said The White House issued a comprehensive round up of US Ebola efforts We are supporting the development of five Ebola vaccine candidates in various stages of development it said in a statement Two vaccine candidates  have been in Phase  human clinical trials three others are still a few months away from the start of trials And West African governments working to try the vaccines in people there  where true life exposure to the virus will help show whether they actually do work These trials are anticipated to begin in the near future the White House said NIH the Department of Defense and the Health and Human Services Departments Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority BARDA are helping to pay for production of tens of thousands of doses of the vaccines to test them The hope is to have millions of doses ready by  Experts say vaccines will play only a small role in fighting Ebola which has infected at least  people in the current outbreak and killed at least  More important is quickly isolating people so they dont infect others and safely burying bodies Federal agencies are also working with companies to speed development of drugs including ZMapp the antibodybased drug grown in tobacco plants Clinical studies are expected to start in early  at NIAID Other clinical studies are slated to begin in affected African countries in early  the White House said Other drugs ready to be tested in people included TKMEbola BCX brincidofovir and favipiravir ZMapp and brincidofovir have been given to Ebola patients treated in the US Protective gear kits are also ready to be delivered anywhere in the US within  hours and now  labs can test patients for the Ebola virus within four to six hours the White House said And The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  to treat Ebola patients The World Health Organization that there was some progress against Ebola in Sierra Leone Guinea and Liberia But the charity group Doctors Without Borders contradicted this on Tuesday saying efforts were still far too slow and criticizing rich countries for failing to act quickly enough The international response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa has been slow and uneven leaving local people national governments and nongovernmental organizations to do most of the practical handson work the group known widely as Medecins Sans Frontieres or MSF said in a statement People are still dying horrible deaths in an outbreak that has already killed thousands said Dr Joanne Liu MSF international president We cant let our guard down and allow this to become double failure a response that was slow to begin with and is illadapted in the end But Obama praised the US contribution Because we stepped up our efforts in recent months we are more prepared in terms of protectiing Americans here at home he said Obama said US leadership was vital to encourage other countries to step up too If we are going to solve Ebola for ourselves we have to solve it in West Africa as well Obama said Nearly  military personnel are in West Africa In the past month alone the US military has completed three Ebola treatment units in Liberia and several more are slated to come online in December it added The US military will construct a total of  Ebola treatment units and USAIDfunded partners built an additional four all are slated to be complete within the next several weeks US efforts have helped double the number of beds available to treat Ebola in Liberia the White House said WHO has said that in fact there may be too many beds in urban parts of Liberia now As of December there are approximately  beds available to Ebola patients in facilities built or supported by the United States and we expect nearly  to be online by January  the White House said And while military troops are not actively treating Ebola patients they are training African civilians to do it As of November we have the capacity to train  health care workers per week in Monrovia alone the White House said Through the US military moreover we have established mobile teams to train up to  health care workers per week outside of Monrovia We had no such capacity prior to last month and the US military since last month has trained hundreds of such health care workers And the Monrovia Medical Unit set up to treat Ebolainfected health workers has treated and released its first two patients the White House noted Separately New Yorks health department said Tuesday that all  health care workers who cared for Dr Craig Spencer are now cleared of any risk they caught Ebola from him   last month from Bellevue Hospital
