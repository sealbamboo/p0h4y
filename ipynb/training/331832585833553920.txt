For years health officials have told parents not to share utensils with their babies or clean their pacifiers by putting them in their mouths arguing that the practice spreads harmful germs between parent and child But new research may turn that thinking on its head In a   scientists report that infants whose parents sucked on their pacifiers to clean them developed fewer allergies than children whose parents typically rinsed or boiled them They also had lower rates of eczema fewer signs of asthma and smaller amounts of a type of white blood cell that rises in response to allergies and other disorders The findings add to growing evidence that some degree of exposure to germs at an early age benefits children and that microbial deprivation might backfire preventing the immune system from developing a tolerance to trivial threats The study carried out in Sweden could not prove that the pacifiers laden with parents saliva were the direct cause of the reduced allergies The practice may be a marker for parents who are generally more relaxed about shielding their children from dirt and germs said Dr William Schaffner an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University who was not involved in the research Its a very interesting study that adds to this idea that a certain kind of interaction with the microbial environment is actually a good thing for infants and children he said I wonder if the parents that cleaned the pacifiers orally were just more accepting of the old saying that youve got to eat a peck of dirt Maybe they just had a less disinfected environment in their homes Studies show that the microbial world in which a child is reared plays a role in allergy development seemingly from birth Babies delivered vaginally   on their skin and   than babies delivered by Caesarean section and that in turn has been   to a lower risk of hay fever asthma and food allergies But whether a mother who puts a childs pacifier in her mouth or feeds the child with her own spoon might be providing similar protection is something that had not been closely studied said Dr Bill Hesselmar the lead author of the study In fact health officials routinely discourage such habits saying they promote tooth decay by transferring cavitycausing bacteria from a parents mouth to the childs In February the New York City health department started a   warning parents of the risk Dont share utensils or bites of food with your baby the ads say Use water not your mouth to clean off a pacifier In the new study doctors at the University of Gothenburg and elsewhere followed a group of about  children from birth The children were examined regularly by a pediatric allergist and their parents were instructed to keep diaries recording details about food introduction weaning and other significant events By the age of  months about a quarter of the children had eczema and  percent had asthma Those whose parents reported at least occasionally cleaning their childrens pacifiers by sucking them were significantly less likely to develop the conditions  particularly eczema  and blood tests showed that they had lower levels of a type of immune cell associated with allergies Analyses of the childrens saliva also showed patterns that suggested the practice had altered the kinds of microbes in their mouths  The researchers then looked to see if the method of childbirth provided any additional protection It did The children who were delivered through Caesarean section and whose pacifiers were rinsed or boiled had the highest prevalence of eczema nearly  percent The group with the lowest prevalence of eczema about  percent were born traditionally and had parents who cleaned their pacifiers in their mouths But are these parents also transmitting harmful infections to their children The bacterium that causes dental cavities Streptococcus mutans is highly contagious Studies show that children can be infected at a very young age and that the strain they pick up is usually one that   That is why health authorities tell parents to do things that can lower the rate of transmission to their children like not sharing utensils or putting their mouths on pacifiers  But Dr Joel Berg president of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry said those efforts are misguided since parents are bound to spread germs simply by kissing their children and being around them This notion of not feeding your baby with your spoon or your fork is absurd because if the mom is in close proximity to the baby you cant prevent that transmission he said Theres no evidence that you can avoid it Its impossible unless you wear a mask or you dont touch the child which isnt realistic Dr Berg who does salivary research at the University of Washington said the new findings underscore something he has been telling his patients for years that saliva is your friend It contains enzymes proteins electrolytes and other beneficial substances some of which can perhaps be passed from parent to child I think like any new study this is going to be challenged and questioned he said But what it points out pretty clearly is that we are yet to fully discover the many and varied benefits of saliva
