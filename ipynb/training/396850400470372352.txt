A police chief is calling for a national database holding the details of people suffering from dementia Sir Peter Fahy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester said it would help emergency services assist people who are either confused or agitated It will enable the caring agencies to give a much better service when we receive a call and decide how to treat it Sir Peter said  The Alzheimers Society said it could cause more problems than it solved It is estimated there are  people in the UK who are suffering from some form of dementia and that figure is set to rise to more than one million over the next decade  Many people with dementia live in the community rather than in care homes Greater Manchester one of the largest police forces in England estimates that the equivalent of  of its  officers each year are deflected from traditional policing roles to deal with people who have mental health issues Part of that mental health workload is related to people suffering from dementia Its a growing issue and sometimes it is because people suffering from dementia go missing sometimes its because they have fallen at home and they are confused and we need to gain access on behalf of the ambulance service Sir Peter told   We have some people with dementia who are ringing us  times a day and clearly we have to take every one of those calls seriously he added He said the police service needed to look at procedures which would ensure people with dementia get a better service One thing I would like to see is a national database where carers and the families of elderly vulnerable people can put their contact details so if the police or ambulance get a call to that particular address they can phone that relative and immediately get some background information Sir Peter said  While some might see that as a threat to civil liberties and the state having too much information   in reality it will enable the caring agencies to give a much better service he added But the Alzheimers Society which campaigns for improved services for people with dementia is wary about such a scheme Too many people with dementia currently go under the radar and lose out on access to the health and social care support they need Agencies like the police need to be able to identify people with dementia but giving them access to a national database may pose problems George McNamara the head of policy at the society said  If the police and social services were to simply share existing information more effectively this could go a significant way towards aiding the police and enabling people with dementia to live independently in their own homes he added  Research by the BBC has shown that some police forces have seen an increase in incidents involving people with dementia Around a quarter of forces across the UK    were able to provide figures based on a trawl through their incident logs  All the forces that responded indicated that these incidents had risen over the last two years Sussex Police for example  which covers the popular retirement towns on the English south coast  saw an increase from  in  to  in  People with some rarer forms of dementia can exhibit antisocial behaviour and as a result of their symptoms may be more likely to come into contact with the police  Angela Potters husband was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia when he was  This form of dementia affects peoples ability to reason and communicate  His character changed and just became less inhibited He started to shoplift He saw things that he wanted and he just took them he didnt understand that you have to pay He was banned from many shops she said  Fortunately her local community police officer in north London was sympathetic  He met my husband and understood the situation He was willing to listen and try and understand and I called him any time I needed to he was always very helpful she said  In Greater Manchester Sir Peter said dealing with people with dementia and mental health issues can deflect officers from their more traditional roles Sometimes it feels like crime is an ancillary activity for us  and to some extent crime is relatively straightforward We know what to do with a burglary or a burglar  But often you are dealing with a complex issue involving a vulnerable person and you are struggling to get help from a medical person and that can be a very difficult issue to solve he added  An officer can be tied up for five six or seven hours at a hospital waiting for a proper assessment to be made or waiting for them to be found a bed  and that clearly is a huge use of police time it affects police morale and absolutely affects our ability to do our primary job of reducing crime  In a statement the Department of Health said There are no plans to introduce a national database of dementia patients Any decision to do so would have to be backed up by robust evidence demonstrating that it helps vulnerable people with the condition remain more independent The choice of being included on such a database must be made by the individual and their family We want to ensure that people with dementia can lead as independent lives as possible This is why schemes such as Dementia Friends which help to raise public awareness and understanding of the condition are so important  Send your comments and stories to  live
