For more than two decades Lucy Barh has been helping women deliver babies Even during Liberias violent civil war when other midwives left Barh stuck around But none of this prepared her for a patient she saw a few months ago I was on duty that day when the patient came in says Barh at the headquarters of the   in Monrovia We did the examination She was not in labor The woman didnt even seem close So Barh sent her home and told her to return to the maternity ward when her contractions started Barh was expecting her in a couple of days maybe a week But to our utmost surprise the very next day she says that woman was rushed on our ward bleeding profusely The woman was in full labor The midwives raced to deliver the baby Right after the fetus came out that woman started bleeding from all over Barh says We did everything we could just to save her life But even with a blood transfusion she ended up dying The baby died too And it was only then that Barh and her team learned the truth about the womans medical history Two of her relatives had died of Ebola If a person can get treatment he or she has nearly a  percent chance of surviving Ebola But for a pregnant woman and her fetus Ebola is almost a death sentence One small study   a fatality rate around  percent The woman invariably passes the virus to the fetus And the fetus dies before labor or its born and dies shortly after The devastation doesnt stop there Both the baby and the womans amniotic fluid are flooded with Ebola virus  and are highly infectious After a few days the midwife who did that delivery came down with Ebola Barh says She spent  days in a treatment center It was only by the grace of God that she recovered Many other midwives havent been so lucky Right outside Barhs office is a whiteboard There are about threedozen photos taped on it At the top it says Nurses and midwives who have died during the Ebola crisis Not all of them caught the infection from pregnant women but in Liberia you hear the same story over and over again Someone got Ebola while trying to help a pregnant woman in trouble When a woman is bleeding minutes can mean the difference between life or death for the baby and mom Barh says Sometimes it doesnt even give you ample time to put on your gloves  That alone is so dangerous for the midwives With so much blood and so much bodily fluid involved in deliveries even doctors with access to protective gear are getting infected Thats how the American doctor   got Ebola in August Sacra who is now recovering in Worcester Mass was helping pregnant women at a hospital outside Monrovia called   or ELWA Sacra was being very cautious says ELWAs assistant director   But its also just very risky What we consider our two riskiest places are the OB ward and the operating room The problem he says is that women who are miscarrying often have bleeding and cramping like someone with Ebola So its very difficult to tell the difference The risk to health care workers is so high that many clinics in Liberia refuse to treat pregnant women Hospitals have closed their maternity wards The ripple of effects of that breakdown in the health care system could be more catastrophic than Ebola itself ELWA is one of the few health facilities in Monrovia where a woman can deliver her baby The midwives there now wear full Ebola suits  gown gloves face mask goggles  during every delivery And they get sprayed down with chlorine after a shift just like in the Ebola clinic So far by the grace of God we havent had another infection Fankhauser says But all we can do is take great precautions We cant stop caring for patients Even as careful as Fankhouser was he is now back in the US   after possible exposure to Ebola So far hes had no symptoms And many midwives across Liberia have stopped caring for patients says Ester Kolleh the lead midwife at ELWA Theyve quit or stopped coming to work Everybody is afraid of catching Ebola she says because most nurses who caught Ebola died Around that moment a nurse walks by in the hallway of ELWAs OB ward In her arms is a baby who isnt moving Kolleh explains what happened Last night we received three ladies she says They had been in labor one week two weeks Nobody to help them The three women had gone from hospital to hospital in Monrovia They were turned away at each one By the time they made it to ELWA it was too late for their babies All of them had stillbirth she says They couldnt get help from anyone The babies died before they came Now we have three dead babies in the delivery room The United Nations Population Fund   the problem is widespread across Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea Maternal death rates are climbing And tens of thousands of women  and their babies  could die in the region over the next year unless more maternity wards reopen and ERs start seeing pregnant women again the agency predicts Kolleh says thats why shes not quitting no matter the danger We keep doing it because we have to do the work she says We have to save lives And bring tiny new ones into the world too
