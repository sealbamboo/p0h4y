In the sixminute video Cohan and her team dance to Beyonces hit single   Cohan really shows off her dance moves shaking and grooving in her surgical gown The dance party was actually orchestrated by Cohan herself and posted on   a site that connects friends and family together during a health event On the site Cohan created a page called Deborahs Healing Journey where she detailed her flash mob plans My fantasy is for you to play the song  and dance wherever you happen to be Cohan wrote on her CaringBridge site She also requested friends and family to send photos and videos of themselves dancing to the song  I have visions of a healing video montage Nothing brings me greater joy than catalyzing others to dance move be in their bodies Are you with me people The UCSF Medical Center at Mount Zion says Cohan was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday
