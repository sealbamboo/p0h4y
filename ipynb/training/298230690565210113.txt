 A new study finds that an active lifestyle may help protect against Alzheimersrelated   in people who have a wellknown genetic risk factor This factor is the e allele version of the apolipoprotein E APOE gene The presence of an APOE e allele is the most established   for Alzheimer disease with a higher percentage of individuals with   having an e allele in comparison with the general population the authors write in the article published online Jan  in the journal   Its been suggested that the presence or absence of this gene variant might affect the relationship between lifestyle factors such as exercise engagement and risk of cognitive decline and dementia added researcher Denise Head and colleagues at Washington University St Louis They examined the association between exercise and amyloid deposits in the brain among  cognitively normal patients ages  to  with and without the APOE e allele Deposits of amyloid protein in the brain have long been associated with Alzheimers disease Patients with an   had less cerebral amyloid deposition than those with a sedentary lifestyle the study found The researchers conclude that the presence of the APOE e gene is associated with increased risk of cognitive decline and elevated amyloid deposition But they add that exercise engagement has been associated with reduced risk of cognitive decline and lower levels of amyloid deposition In summary our findings suggest that exercise at levels recommended by the AHA American Heart Association may be particularly beneficial in reducing the risk of brain amyloid deposition in cognitively normal epositive individuals they concluded
