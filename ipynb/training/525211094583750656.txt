When Ebola began killing people in the Monrovia suburb of Clara Town several months ago some residents blamed vaccines One vaccinator in the town says mothers didnt want her near their babies They had a notion that when the people come to the hospital we would inject them and kill them says vaccinator Che Che Richardson at the Clara Town Health Center because it was the hospital giving the people Ebola Rumors like that combined with the closing of many health facilities have caused childhood vaccination rates to plummet in Liberia Now thousands of children are vulnerable to potentially fatal diseases The indirect effects of Ebola may prove more deadly than the virus itself In response Richardson and other health care workers have been waging a campaign against misinformation as well as disease Vaccinators have gone out into the community with a simple message for moms she says We encourage them to bring their babies because we told them the longer they stay away it would not be good for the child Richardson says Let them bring their babies so that they can be able to fight against the sicknesses There are a lot of those sicknesses in Liberia Even before Ebola more than  percent of children here died before reaching age  Many of these deaths are from preventable diseases says Adolphus Clarke who helps manage the governments immunization program It hurt me most if I saw a child coming down with measles he says Indeed it hurts me it pains me The numbers tell a tragic story Before Ebola  percent of babies were getting their routine vaccinations Now the figure is  percent That almost certainly means more children will die Clarke says I wouldnt be surprised if we see that we have the hepatitis outbreak because we know that they are susceptible he says The number is huge So we are trying to act as fast as we can It may not be fast enough There are already ominous reports from places hit hard by Ebola says UNICEFs Sheldon Yett Weve already had cases of measles in Lofa County which was the original epicenter of the disease in Liberia he says So thats already happening Before Ebola arrived Liberia was making huge progress in reducing childhood diseases Now that progress is in tremendous risk of reversing Yett says That is to me one of the biggest tragedies The great momentum we had going in one direction is at risk of going exactly in the opposite direction There are a lot of reasons vaccination rates have fallen Clinics have been closed education programs have been suspended and health care workers are in very short supply Were all focusing on Ebola  thats important Yett says But theres another storm cloud on the horizon here right now Thats the storm cloud over the collapse of the health care system itself That all said there are some hopeful signs At the Community Clinic in Louisiana Township about  miles from Monrovia vaccination is getting back on track Clatus Sheriff has been the vaccinator here since  He shows me the solarpowered refrigerator where he keeps vaccines I have all my routine vaccines here Sheriff says This is my yellow fever  I have some measles here Sheriff knows the community and says people here trust him And he knows exactly how many babies under age  he expects to vaccinate by the end of year  he says Business is picking up after a lull Sheriff says Hes now vaccinating eight or  children each day In the clinics waiting room are several mothers with their children I ask three of them if their children have been vaccinated They all say Yes Another mother has a newborn baby She says the clinic did a good job delivering her baby So she will trust them to vaccinate her child
