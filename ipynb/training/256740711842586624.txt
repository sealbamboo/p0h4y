Nerds rejoice Its Nobel season  the Oscars for lab rats peacemakers and cognoscenti alike Every fall big thinkers around the world wait for a middleofthenight phone call from Sweden dreaming of what they might do with the  million prize The entire European Union   the coveted peace prize today while Chinese novelist   received the   yesterday for his hallucinatory realism Check out his eyepopping   on Chinese food culture in   And earlier in the week American researchers picked up awards in both chemistry and physics So what does it take to create a genius worthy of a Nobel The answer may have something to do with chocolate According to a very tongueincheek   published online this week by the   a countrys propensity for producing Nobel laureates might just be correlated to its national appetite for the sinful stuff  a cardiologist at New Yorks St LukesRoosevelt Hospital penned the article and hes done a lot of interviews this week After being asked to peer review an article on flavanols the substances found in tea wine and chocolate among other things that seem to help   or even reverse the mental slowdowns of aging he began to toy around with a silly idea If chocolate consumption could boost a septuagenarians brain power might it also boost an entire countrys Messerli who is Swiss knew that his homeland had the highest percapita number of Nobel Prize winners It occurred to me that the Swiss also had the highest chocolate consumption in the world he tells The Salt I put two and two together and thought Well China must have much less chocolate consumption and probably not that many prizewinners per capita Lets just plot the two  One rainy afternoon while stuck in a Katmandu hotel Messerli got to playing around with the data When he plugged in numbers from  countries they made a neat linear plot on the page Not only was the correlation between chocolate consumption and Nobel Prize winners very significant but the probability that the distribution was due to chance  what researchers call the    was tiny I have published about  papers in peerreviewed journals he says and every single one of them stands and falls with the pvalue And now here I find a pvalue of  and this is to my way of thinking a completely nonsensical relation Unless you  or anybody else  can come up with an explanation Ive presented it to a few of my colleagues and nobody has any thoughts While Messerlis work isnt exactly   material   has a history of occasional humor and satire A    examined the probable atropine poisoning of fictional characters in Nathaniel Hawthornes   More recently clinicians have  on the rise of Nintendoitis severe pain in the region of the extensor tendon of the right thumb and   the obvious cure for this malady  that is taking a break from reading  was rejected by two of the patients The only outlier in his data set Messerli likes to point out is Sweden  the home of the Nobel prizes Its chocolate consumption predicts only  laureates yet it has produced more than double that number One cannot quite escape the notion that either the Nobel Committee in Stockholm has some inherent patriotic bias when assessing the candidates for these awards he writes or perhaps that the Swedes are particularly sensitive to chocolate and even miniscule amounts increase their cognition
