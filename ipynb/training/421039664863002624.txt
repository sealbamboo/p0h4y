Canadian health officials have confirmed the first known fatal case of the HN avian influenza strain in North America Canadian Health Minister Rona Ambrose said the deceased person was an Alberta resident who had recently travelled to Beijing Calling the death an isolated case Ms Ambrose said the risk to the general population was low Ten people have died in Alberta this season from swine flu or HN  HN infects the lower respiratory tract deep in the lung where it can cause deadly pneumonia The   it is difficult to transmit the virus from person to person but when people do become infected the mortality rate is about  In the latest incident the infected person first showed symptoms of the flu on an Air Canada flight from Beijing to Vancouver on  December officials said  The passenger continued on to Edmonton and on  January was admitted to hospital where they died two days later Dr Gregory Taylor deputy chief public health officer for Canada told CBC News Network that the patient was relatively young with no underlying health conditions People usually most susceptible to HN are older with underlying health problems which make them weaker and less able to deal with the virus  Ms Ambrose said Canadian officials were working with Chinese authorities on the case But she stressed The risk of getting HN is very low This is not the regular seasonal flu This is an isolated case Canadian authorities have followed up with all close contacts of the infected person and offered Tamiflu as a precaution None of them have symptoms They said the infected person had not been to a poultry farm or had much contact with birds whilst they were in Beijing so it is unclear how they caught the virus  which is usually contracted through very close contact between infected bird and humans According to the WHO between  and December  there were  confirmed human cases of HN infection in  countries leading to  deaths Experts say that if the HN virus were to mutate and become easily transmissible between humans the consequences for public health could be very serious Timothy OLeary a WHO spokesperson said the organization would not be changing its risk assessments on HN in view on this development  He said It usually takes two to eight days for symptoms of HN to show up So if anyone else were infected then wed probably know about it by now  There is reason to be concerned but this appears to be an isolated case It was imported from outside of northern  America We would be surprised if there were any cases related to this one from China Its hard for people to get it  Prof Nick Phin a flu expert fro Public Health England said HN has been circulating in poultry over the last decade and occasionally humans are infected Infection of humans causes severe illness with a high death rate but the virus does not transmit readily from persontoperson
