If Facebook is any indication new parents love to take photos of their partners happily dozing with a sleeping baby But while this moment may be picturesque how safe is it The practice of having infants sleep in the same bed as mom and dad is known as bedsharing Sometimes done deliberately and sometimes done out of sheer exhaustion it has become a hotbutton issue among child sleep experts and parents alike The American Academy of Pediatrics frowns on bedsharing and called it hazardous in a  policy statement The main concern is that it increases the risk of death for the child either by being smothered or from sudden infant death syndrome SIDS Advocates of the practice say that when done correctly sharing a bed helps parents  particularly nursing mothers  bond with their infants and even get a better nights sleep Read on for two views on the topic Theres simply no scientific evidence that says bedsharing is safe There is scientific evidence though that bedsharing increases the risk for SIDS as well as the childs risk of suffocation The baby can be overlain by the parent they can get entrapped between the mattress and the box spring or under the pillow or they can be suffocated by heavy bedding A baby is diagnosed as dying from SIDS if  after a complete review of the medical history an autopsy and examination of the death scene  no other cause of death can be found Studies have found that the risk of SIDS increases anywhere from two to tenfold when parents bedshare depending on the bedsharing situation and the age of the baby We dont know exactly why that is but we do know that babies who die of SIDS often have brainstem deficits associated with their ability to regulate their breathing and heart rate specifically when faced with reduced carbon dioxide and elevated temperatures In a bedsharing environment given that the baby is sleeping with other bodies and potentially with blankets we can hypothesize that SIDS would be consistent with these potential environmental stresses When we talk about the potential risk for overlay entrapment and suffocation its a little more clearcut Parents cant always be awake and cant always be watching their baby Babies have very compressible chests when theyre little as well as tiny little heads and tiny noses and tiny mouths If these get covered its very dangerous In our day and age when everybody is working just to make ends meet and new parents dont have a lot of time to spend with their baby I completely understand that there are a lot of reasons why parents would want to bring their baby in bed And thats fine as long as theyre awake When its time for the parent or the baby to go to sleep the baby needs its own separate place The best sleeping environment for babies is to have their bed or crib in the parents room We dont really know why but we do have evidence that roomsharing reduces the risk of SIDS Its good for the baby and a wonderful way to bond But bedsharing is dangerous Ive seen what SIDS or overlaying has done to the families of parents who have overlain their children  some families do well and some families fall apart But I can tell you one thing they never forget that baby I know that there are bedsharing advocates that say theyve always done this and theyve never lost a baby but this is about probabilities What I tell patients is that the best place for a baby to sleep is wherever the parents and baby get the best nights sleep Research has shown though that its best for babies to be within sensory distance from mom so they could be in a cosleeper thats attached to or near the bed or safely placed in the bed with the parents I dont think bedsharing is right for everyone but I do think that it can be very beneficial First of all bedsharing makes nighttimebreastfeedingeasierBreastfedbabies wake up more often since breast milk is digested faster When a baby and mother share a bed the mother often wakes up just when or even just before the baby is ready to wake up and she is able to easily nurse the baby with a minimal disruption to her own sleep Babies get more milk this way which helps them thrive Many moms even find that despite the baby waking up more to breastfeed both baby and mother are better rested Many mothers also work outside the house during the day When they share a bed with their babies at night it gives them the closeness and touch that they miss during the day That is also beneficial to the babys development Researchers at the University of Notre Dame have even speculated that bedsharing may have a protective mechanism Because of what might be an increased sensitivity to one another in a bedsharing situation the mother may instinctively awaken if the babys breathing changes There are some potential downfalls to parents and babies sleeping separately When a baby is unattended to at night or sleeps apart from its mother its stress hormones may become higher When the baby has high stress hormones it depletes the immune system raises the heart rate and can even damage the brain particularly since babies dont yet have the cerebral maturity to detoxify excess stress hormones When babies and moms are closer together on the other hand the babys stress hormones have been shown to go down and its oxygen intake is more stable Not all parents should bedshare Parents who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol should not sleep in the same bed with their babies nor should very obese parents or parents who smoke Mothers who have a heightened awareness of the baby should sleep next to the infant while bedsharing rather than fathers and no babysitters aunts uncles or other caregivers should bedshare Parents should not sleep with their infants on a couch beanbag or water bed  only a safe firm mattress with light bedding and no excess pillows stuffed animals or throws
