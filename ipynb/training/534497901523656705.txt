Babies around the world face a lot of risks to their health pneumonia diarrhea and malaria to name a few But it turns out that no single infectious disease takes a greater toll than the simple fact of being born premature Premature birth is now the single largest cause of death among babies and young children Every year  million children under age  die due to health complications that stem from being born before week  of pregnancy a week pregnancy is considered fullterm A   on the toll of prematurity was published in   Researchers from the World Health Organization the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine looked at the causes of child mortality in  countries from  to  An   in this weeks  published today on World Prematurity Day pointed out that its the first time an infectious disease has not been the leading killer of children under  To learn more Goats and Soda spoke with report coauthor   the director of the Institute for International Programs at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University Its a twopart answer When the birth is premature the organs are not yet fully formed and that can lead to lungs that are very immature that dont open as well as they should Many of these babies can survive with intensive care but in lowincome countries for the most part neonatal intensive care is not available The second part Babies born premature are more fragile more susceptible to infection It may not happen at the time of birth but can happen soon after during the first month of life They may get pneumonia sepsis a systemic infection The     of preterm mortality are in West Africa There are about  deaths for every  live births The countries with the     of babies dying from preterm birth complications are India Nigeria and Pakistan Infectious causes have been reduced more than the causes related to prematurity However the statement that prematurity leads to more deaths than infections is not true Prematurity is the single largest cause of death in children under  The No  cause is pneumonia followed by diarrhea malaria injury and meningitis All the infectious causes add up to be substantially more than the causes related to prematurity In lowincome countries things can be done that would prevent many of these deaths On the maternal side there are prevention efforts such as improving nutrition and reducing infections especially syphilis Smoking reduction would help too From the newborn side thermal care needs to be taught Once a preterm baby is born it does need to be kept warm Often a baby is kept without being wrapped up or taken care of when delivery is still going on  even in India where people tend to think of as a hot place But in houses in northern India during some times of year the temperature can go quite low and can be dangerous to babies So yes kangaroo care is recommended  for keeping babies warm and initiating breastfeeding Thermal care and breastfeeding are two major things that could help reduce deaths Certainly highincome countries still have a problem with preterm births They just have more sophisticated medical care Nevertheless babies still die from prematurity
