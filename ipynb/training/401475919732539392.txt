When President Obama announced his plan to explore the mysteries of the human brain seven months ago it was long on ambition and short on details Now some of the details are being sketched in The   will include efforts to restore lost memories in war veterans create tools that let scientists study individual brain circuits and map the nervous system of the fruit fly The Defense Advanced Projects Agency or DARPA which has committed more than  million to the effort offered the clearest plan The agency wants to focus on treatments for the sort of brain disorders affecting soldiers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan according to   deputy director of   That is our constituency Ling said at a news conference at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego So DARPA will be working on problems including PTSD and traumatic brain injuries Ling says In particular the agency wants to help the soldier who has a terribly damaged brain and has lost a significant amount of declarative memory Ling said We would like to restore that memory DARPA hopes to do that with an implanted device that will take over some functions of the brains hippocampus an area thats important to memory The agency has already used a device that does this in rodents Ling said and the goal is to move on to people quickly The agency plans to use the same approach that created a better   in record time Ling said We went from idea to prototype in  months he says The National Institutes of Health plans to invest  million in the BRAIN Initiative over the next year One major goal is to create new tools that will allow scientists to see how specific brain circuits function according to   director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke We believe that the tools and technologies that will come from this initiative will actually enable all brain scientists to do their work better faster and with more impact Landis said at the news conference That could lead to better treatments for people with brain a disease such as Parkinsons Landis says For several years now people with Parkinsons have been able to reduce their tremors with a treatment known as   While it works its incredibly crude Landis said Imagine if we knew exactly how that circuitry worked You could design a much better way to do deep brain stimulation But   director of the National Institute of Mental Health said its important to remember that the immediate goal of the BRAIN Initiative isnt developing treatments but understanding the inner workings of the most complex system in the universe Much of the early work will involve animals not people Insel said And some of it will be done not by the NIH but by private research organizations that have agreed to take on some major portions of the BRAIN initiative For example the   based in Maryland is working to map the entire nervous system of a fruit fly And the   in Seattle is studying how a mouse brain processes visual information Even though this sort of research is not aimed at curing Alzheimers or epilepsy Insel said it should be of great interest to the public Theyre interested in the brain as a way to understand who we are what makes us different and what is special about the human brain The president has asked for an extra  million in federal money to help fund the BRAIN Initiative in the next year But scientists say the effort will accomplish a lot even if that money doesnt materialize
