Tammy Spencer did a double take when she read the address on her paper and looked at the house in front of her Spencer a volunteer with the nonprofit Enroll America was spending a hot and humid Saturday morning knocking on doors in Boca Raton a mostly posh South Florida city looking for people without health coverage She wanted to let them know about new online insurance marketplaces that open for enrollment Oct  The spacious house was on the Intracoastal Waterway complete with its own boat dock The woman who answered the door said she already had coverage through Medicare and Spencer went on to the next house After two hours of canvassing she found one uninsured woman and got contacts for three others It was worth it said the yearold insurance agent But next time we need to go to a poorer area or set up a table in the mall Spencer is one of hundreds of volunteers for   Get Covered America campaign which canvassed neighborhoods across Florida New Jersey Ohio and several other states Saturday to kick off several months of outreach efforts Enroll America is led by veterans of the Obama White House and Obamas presidential campaigns and is using campaignstyle techniques to locate the uninsured Funders include   a consumer advocacy organization that pushed for the health law Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has tried to raise money for Enroll America though those efforts have   from Republicans in Congress Most people are unaware of the marketplaces   They will offer coverage to individuals and small employers and offer government subsidies to anyone making less than  percent of the federal poverty level or  for a family of four Many people are also unaware that insurers will no longer be able to deny coverage for preexisting conditions or charge higher rates to people based on their health status The Obama administration hopes to get  million people enrolled in the first year of open enrollment which ends in March Leaders of Enroll America say its volunteers arent knocking on doors randomly but are relying on Census data and information from telephone surveys to pinpoint neighborhoods and houses where people are mostly likely to be uninsured But the canvassing in Boca Raton showed how challenging the work can be Florida is one of the target states for Enroll America because it has nearly four million uninsured residents It is relying on the federal government to run its Obamacare marketplace and as a result has   federal dollars for outreach efforts In addition to Boca Raton canvassers Saturday went to  other Florida cities including Miami Fort Lauderdale Tampa Jacksonville and Delray Beach Weve been building our efforts on the ground in Florida to engage folks in their homes and communities said Nick Duran who directs Enroll Americas operations in Florida He said the group which has  paid staff in the state already has hundreds of volunteers and hopes to recruit a few thousand more in coming months The way we gauge success is helping millions of Floridians who lack coverage learn about their new options Duran said We want to maximize the number of Floridians who sign up That is our mission He said he does not have a target for how many Floridians he hopes to enroll    Florence French field organizer for Palm Beach County said Boca was on the list because it has uninsured residents as well as a volunteer network willing to help One of them was Mark Powell  who works the deli counter at a Publix grocery store and says he does not have insurance because he cant afford his companys plan He learned about Enroll America when he searched for information about the law and he thought their campaign could help him and others People can see that I am sincere about this when I talk to them Powell said Also canvassing was Yves Laplanche  an engineer who had worked as a volunteer for both of President Obamas election campaigns He said he remembers how years ago his mother struggled without health insurance He wanted to tell people about a law that might help them if they signed up for coverage Laplanche and other volunteers were given a sample script to approach people explaining what Enroll America is and that they are not selling anything They were instructed to avoid talking about Medicaid the statefederal health program for the poor which is not being expanded in Florida next year under the health law because state lawmakers did not approve it Dont get into any political conversations French told the nine volunteers who met outside the citys new library Jennifer Depaz  was one of those who came to the door and was willing to engage volunteers in conversation Health care is so expensive here I had to go back to Guatemala to have my wisdom teeth out said Depaz who works at a nearby ice cream shop and has no insurance Spencer took down her information and left her an Enroll America brochure
