If only dropping pants sizes were as easy as switching from Coke to Coke Zero Sure youre cutting out empty calories when you ditch the sugarsweetened drinks in favor of artificially sweetened ones But theres a growing body of research that suggests this isnt really helping in the battle of the bulge The latest ding against diet drinks Researchers   this week that overweight and obese people who choose diet beverages eat about the same number of total calories as their counterparts guzzling sugary drinks  theyre just getting more of their calories from solid food In other words their drinks may be nocalorie but theyre making up for it at meal and snack times And that suggests that public health messages urging people to drop the sugarsweetened drinks in favor of diet ones to combat obesity need to be tweaked says the studys lead author   an associate professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University We need to go beyond telling them You need to drink less sugary soda  Bleich tells The Salt Thats because when people make the switch from regular to diet theyre not making many other changes to what they consume Americans diet soda habit has   in the past  years    of us now consumes one on a daily basis Overweight and obese adults are about twice as likely as their healthyweight counterparts to drink diet beverages according to Bleichs findings which appear in the   And it makes sense she says that this reflects a desire to shed excess weight But Bleich and her colleagues wanted to know how Americans rising diet drink habit relates to overall calorie consumption So they looked at data for adults  and older gathered between  and  by the   Its an ongoing program that collects details on eating habits and other healthrelated information from a nationally representative sample of people in the US And what did they find It turns out that overweight adults who drank artificially sweetened beverages ate on average  more solidfood calories per day than their weight counterparts who drank sugary beverages while obese diet drinkers ate an extra  calories per day Whats more when they snacked these heavierset drinkers of diet sodas tended to get more of their calories from sweet treats the researchers found That jibes with research that suggests artificial sweeteners may be messing with the bodys feedback loop when it comes to sweet tastes What weve seen from animal data is there is something metabolic that changes when you consume artificial sweeteners says Bleich The brain is tricked into thinking it is less full So whats going on Basically when we eat sweettasting foods that signals our brains to release hormones to process the sugar Its part of a mechanism that tells the body how much energy its just taken in and when its had enough But in people who are regular drinkers of diet sodas the theory goes the body gets confused and no longer releases enough hormones As a result researchers suspect diet drinkers end up eating more  and gaining weight For some individuals that constant exposure to that sweet taste does drive appetite says Sharon Fowler an epidemiologist at the   Fowlers own   has found that over a seven to eightyear period habitual diet soda drinkers were twice as likely to go from being healthy weight to overweight or obese as those who didnt down the artificially sweetened beverages And she points to   that have linked a diet soda habit to increased risk of metabolic syndrome Type  diabetes heart attack and stroke So the question is Are diet sodas innocent bystanders in the obesity epidemic or are they accomplices Fowler tells me I dont think they are innocent  for some people at least Of course the case against diet soda isnt so clearcut For example as weve   researchers from Boston Childrens Hospital found that ditching the sugarsweetened drinks for nocalorie options like diet soda helped overweight teens manage their weight And Bleich for one isnt ready to throw diet drinks under the bus We need to make recommendations that work with life she says If you are an obese person and I get you to switch from regular to diet soda Ive made gains by getting you to switch But the reality is if you want to lose weight you need to make other better choices
