Any difference can set schoolchildren apart from their peers and potentially make them a target for bullying But a severe food allergy is a unique vulnerability It takes only one lunch or cupcake birthday party for other children to know which classmates cannot eat nuts eggs milk or even a trace of wheat It can take longer for them to grasp how frightening it is to live with a lifethreatening allergy Surprisingly classmates may prey on this vulnerability plotting to switch a childs lunch to see if she gets sick for example or spitting milk at a childs face and causing a swift anaphylactic reaction In a recent survey of  sets of parents and children with food allergies   in January roughly a third of the children reported being bullied for their allergies Parents knew about the threatening behavior only half the time Dr Robert Wood the director of pediatric allergy at Johns Hopkins Childrens Center in Baltimore gets very frequent reports of bullying from patients and their parents he said Just last week one childs face was touched with peanut butter endangering the child Typically bullying is not as extreme but the phenomenon has been there the whole time he said Now however the issue is starting to earn attention In May Food Allergy Research and Education a nonprofit group in McLean Va released a  highlighting the issue that featured a pupil lamenting the cafeteria as a scary place It has more than  views on YouTube has been shown on the CW network and spurred dozens of parents to share unnerving anecdotes on   Bullying should never be regarded as a rite of passage said John Lehr the chief executive of the group Its never a joke but food allergy bullying is really not a joke because someone can be taken to the emergency room Childrens National Medical Center in Washington just hired a psychologist to join its food allergy program in part to help young patients who feel isolated or are being bullied Dr Hemant P Sharma the director of the program said a third of the centers patients report being bullied Every few months a child recounts being forcefed an allergen Dr Sharma said adding Even if its just a child who feels singled out because of their food allergy it compounds the emotional burden Indeed some children with food allergies   or anxious Dr Wood routinely sends children to a psychologist because they wont touch a doorknob or use a bathroom because they fear inadvertent exposure to their allergen The   in Manhattan not only offers children and parents counseling after bullying but will call principals on a patients behalf Victims of bullying dont always tell their parents But Miles Monroe  of Bethesda Md who is allergic to milk eggs and wheat told his that he didnt feel comfortable in the lunchroom after a classmate held a Kit Kat candy wrapper near his face and kept chanting You cant eat this Miles wasnt scared he would get sick from it but he felt attacked said Courteney Monroe  his mother and the chief marketing officer for National Geographic Channel Miless understanding teacher nipped the problem in the bud by talking to the yeller about what it would be like if he could not eat his favorite food bad or got teased about it worse or had to go to the hospital if he ate it until then that outcome was inconceivable Not every teacher is as concerned Food allergyrelated bullying does not always stem from peers but from adults such as teachers said Elisabeth Stieb a nurse at the Food Allergy Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston At least  states have guidelines for management of food allergies in schools and many tackle bullying specifically   urge zero tolerance for bullying related to food allergy   suggest cafeteria monitors be trained to intervene quickly to help prevent trading of food or bullying activities Bullying is distinct from ordinary teasing What separates them is not only a power differential between the children said Dr Rashmi Shetgiri a pediatrician and   at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center but that someone is intentionally trying to harm someone else Just as cyberbullies use electronic devices to hurt others food allergy bullies are asserting their power using the allergen Dr Shetgiri said
