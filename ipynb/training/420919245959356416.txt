People are increasingly turning to   to manage health issues and meditation classes are being offered through schools and hospitals But doctors have questioned whether this ancient Eastern practice really offers measurable health benefits A fresh  of the evidence should help sort that out Meditation does help manage anxiety depression and pain according to the  studies analyzed in   on Monday but does not appear to help with other problems including substance abuse sleep and weight We have moderate confidence that mindfulness practices have a beneficial effect wrote the author of the paper   of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in an email to Shots He says the positive effects on anxiety depression and pain can be modest but are seen across multiple studies It was surprising to see that with so little training about  hours of meditation practice per week we were still seeing consistent effects Goyal wrote One type of mindfulness training that was used in many of the research studies is called  or MBSR Its typically taught in eight sessions Think of it as Buddhist meditation but without the Buddhism says   the father of MBSR Its completely secular The focus of mindfulness meditation is to train the brain to stay in the moment To do this practitioners are taught to let go of the regrets of the past as well as anxieties about the future This study reviewed earlier research that evaluated the effectiveness of meditation for managing a whole range of medical conditions  from breast cancer irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia to depression With diseases like breast cancer meditation is not used as a treatment for the disease Its supportive care designed to help a person deal with the stress that comes with cancer In one   researchers enrolled  women with stage  or stage  breast cancer The women were randomized to either an week mindfulnessbased stress reduction class or to other kinds of more standard supportive care Techniques taught during the meditation class included visualizations to help shift attention away from thoughts that cause anxiety One technique is called the body scan This is where you lie back on a mat and the teacher has you check in with each part of your body Youre told to relax all the tension in your jaws then your neck your shoulders and so on down the body   The point is stop the mind from wandering off and to connect with your body Do your toes feel colder than the rest of your body Are you feeling resistance in any part of the body The teacher guides participants to tune in After four months the women who meditated experienced significant improvements in what the researchers called quality of life and coping outcomes compared to the women in other groups Clearly meditation is not for everyone Its a discipline that needs daily time and attention And in many of the studies meditation was no more effective than medications and other nonmedical treatments including exercise In addition the metaanalysis found little evidence that meditation programs could help treat substance abuse sleep or weight issues But the researchers concluded that meditation has no harmful side effects And its free and something people can easily do at home Heres my favorite mindfulness visualization If youve got a nagging thought that wont go away just picture a cloud Visualize that nagging thought being attached to the cloud Now watch it float away Whats left behind A clear blue sky And hopefully a clearer mind At least for the moment
