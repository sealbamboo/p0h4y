The mother of a yearold man has severely criticised the Southern Health trust for failing her son after he died weeks after an operation  Peter McAneney from County Armagh was admitted for a routine ear operation at Craigavon Area Hospital in  Jennifer McAneney described the care her son received as substandard  A spokesperson for the trust said it recognised the devastating impact Peters death had had on the McAneney family Mrs McAneney is also critical of why it took seven months before the trust launched a serious adverse incident investigation into her sons death   As a mother I have lost one of my greatest gifts she said  Peter was our youngest and our only son and its just been so long since I have heard him call my name and I just long to see him come down that path with his football bag  I have to keep searching for the answers why he died  Northern Irelands coroners office has begun its own investigation and has recruited the expertise of three health professionals   The McAneney family has accused the health trust of a catalogue of failings both during Peters care and after his death  These include Jennifer McAneney told the BBC the family has been hampered by the lack of response from health trust officials      I suppose over the last couple of years the silence of the trust has been really deafening she said And thats one of the things that wed noticed from the outset  It wasnt until we started to write to the agencies the chief medical officer the NI coroners office the RQIA Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority the chairman of the hyponatraemia inquiry and the health and social care board that our voice was finally heard The BBC has learned that seven months after Peters death the Northern Ireland coroners office wrote to the Southern Trust asking for a copy of the report into his death  A report did not exist  It was only at this stage that the health trust then reported Peters death as a serious adverse incident SAI  It took a further three months for the investigation to be initiated  In December  following discussions with the pathologist and at the familys request the coroners office agreed to conduct its own investigation    In a statement to the BBC the Southern Health and Social care trust said The circumstances surrounding Peters death are now the subject of a review by the Northern Ireland coroners office and therefore we are unable to make any comment on the questions raised by the BBC However the trust has been cooperating fully with the coroners office and we will continue to provide whatever assistance is requested while the review is ongoing In April  Peter McAneney was admitted to hospital for an inner ear operation to his right ear  He had undergone the procedure on two previous occasions to enhance his hearing and reduce infection  However without him having given his consent he also received a titanium implant to improve his hearing  But within three weeks Peter was readmitted as many times with ear infections and chest pains During an outpatients visit he was diagnosed with an allergy to iodine  Despite telling staff that he was allergic to iodine Peter suffered an adverse reaction when given iodine in preparation for an Xray  Mrs McAneney has challenged the trust about why the incident was not recorded by staff despite Peter collapsing and requiring oxygen  He died within three weeks from his initial admission following two heart attacks  His father Tommy described the past two years as a living nightmare  I still wake up around am every morning the hour the hospital rang for us to come straight to the hospital His death was so unexpected he said  We have progressed this as far as we can  We need help to bring Peters case to the forefront because we have been met by a wall of silence They think they are untouchable  Mr and Mrs McAneney said they are adamant they will continue to search for the truth about the circumstances surrounding their sons untimely death  It would have to be said there would be no investigation by the health trust they were more than happy to close Peters case and thats what we find really shocking Mrs McAneney said Theres only been an investigation because we pushed and pushed for it Its very difficult for lay people to tackle the trust  Its more concerned about protecting their corporate identity than working with the likes of us  The familys solicitor Paul Haughey believes the trust could have been more forthcoming with information I believe that the family werent properly informed of the gravity of Peters condition from when he was admitted on  April  for which was really a routine operation to his death on  May and that lack of communication appears to be a recurring theme throughout he said
