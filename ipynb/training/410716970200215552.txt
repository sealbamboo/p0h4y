Increasing resistance to tuberculosis drugs around the world is a ticking time bomb says the World Health Organization WHO It estimates almost  people around the world have a type of TB which is resistant to at least two of the main types of drugs used to treat the disease  But most are not diagnosed and are walking around spreading these more deadly strains  More than half the cases are in China Russia and India  The WHO says the overall number of people developing the disease is falling but  million people were diagnosed with TB last year and more than a million people died from the disease  Through the hot winding cramped streets of Mumbais sprawling Dharavi slum we have come to meet Ranjhu Zha and her family  The family of five is crammed into a space no more than about  sq m  Ranjhu sits with her son and mother on the floor  Her mother Parvati is wearing a surgical mask  She has what is known as an extensively drugresistant form of TB XDRTB  It is not responding to most of the main drugs used to treat the disease She caught the disease from her yearold granddaughter Bharati who died of TB in June  She was resistant to two of the main drugs used to treat the condition  My daughter was as beautiful as a flower says Ranjhu  But slowly slowly she wasted away I remember her always  But what is the point in thinking about someone who is no more She is never coming back Tuberculosis is an airborne disease Its very contagious and can spread from person to person by breathing in an infected persons germs  The cramped conditions in places like the Dharavi slum create the perfect environment for the fast spread of TB and other diseases  People are living cheek by jowl and theres not much ventilation Ranjhu says her daughter wasnt given the full course of treatment when she first developed TB and that made her resistant to the two main types of TB drugs  Ranjhus mother is now getting treatment from the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres  She says she has not been able to get the right drugs from government schemes   Her treatment includes painful injections every day and will last around two years  MSF says her treatment costs somewhere in the region of   Standard TB treatment costs around  There are several drugs used to treat TB says Lorraine Rebello medical services manager at the MSF TB and HIV clinic in Mumbai  But when two of the primary drugs that are essential to treating TB  rifampicin and isoniazid  are no longer killing the TB bacteria then the patient has drugresistant TB  The Indian governments Revised National TB Control Program aims to provide free TB treatment to every tuberculosis patient in the country  But the WHO says out of the estimated  drugresistant cases in India in  only  were diagnosed  Lorraine Rebello puts the rise in cases she has seen down to a number of factors  We have a huge unregulated private sector she says We have doctors who are not properly medically qualified like Ayurvedic doctors who are treating drugresistant TB  They probably dont have the knowledge to treat the condition but they prescribe a cocktail of drugs  Some patients are even going to pharmacies without prescription and buying drugs over the counter So we are seeing a rampant misuse of antibiotics Dr Mario Raviglione director of the WHOs Global TB programme describes the situation as a public health crisis What could happen is progressively multidrug resistant TB takes over from normal tuberculosis  If this happens not only would millions of patients potentially die of this form of TB but if I look at it from an economic perspective the cost of dealing with millions of potential cases is enormous He describes the fact that  of multidrug resistant TB cases around the world are not being treated as a ticking time bomb Dr Ruth Mcnerny senior lecturer at the London School of Tropical Medicine who works with TB charity TB Alert says Were just silently watching this epidemic unfold and spread before our eyes TB is very clever because it kills you very slowly And while its killing you very slowly youre walking around spreading it The issue of TB is if you get someone on treatment theyll become noninfectious quite quickly  But if the treatments not working because it is a drugresistant strain then they stay infected and they stay spreading drugresistant TB The treatment for drugresistant TB is very very difficult and at some stage it becomes impossible In India the government says it is doing all it can to improve diagnoses and treatment  Hanmant Chauhan heads the TB programme for the state of Maharashtra  He says around  multidrug resistant TB patients have been treated in the last three years We are taking every step so that every TB affected person gets treatment as soon as possible he says We are also trying to see that the disease doesnt spread We are trying to make people aware about the precautions and treatment so that the patients get the treatment and TB gets eradicated soon Back in Ranjhus slum her yearold son Santosh is studying for exams  He sleeps on the floor of his tiny home with his infected grandmother and three other relatives  He knows he is at high risk of catching this particularly deadly form of TB I do feel scared but what can we do we only have this one place to stay all together he says  If she removes the mask which makes her so uncomfortable because it is so hot and stuffy here there is always a danger we will also catch the disease
