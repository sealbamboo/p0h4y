There are two things you can always count on public radio pledge drives and the local blood bank asking for a donation of a very different sort Both kinds of giving can fill you with a sense of goodwill But lets be honest the tote bags help too When it comes to blood donations though ethical concerns and risk have led to limits on incentives for donors in many places The World Health Organization has set a goal for governments around the world to reach completely voluntary and nonremunerated donations of blood by  The WHO   made in Melbourne Australia in  came in part because the assembled public health officials asserted their belief that paid donation can compromise the establishment of sustainable blood collection from volunteers Also paying people to give blood may hurt the quality of donations Three economists argue in the latest issue of   that its   In the last few years there have been some realworld experiments with incentives that suggest they can help increase donations without causing trouble In Switzerland the reward of a lottery ticket valued at a little over five bucks lifted donations by about  percentage points from a base of about  percent of the population that typically gave blood In the US a  gift card increased donations by  percentage points over the usual  percent donation level The economists including   of the University of Toronto Mississauga wrote that the incentives led to quick and localized upticks in donations which could help with blood shortages There are a few things that can be done to minimize potential problems Offering incentives framed as rewards rather than outright cash payments would make sense for instance And giving rewards to people who show up to donate  not just to those people who complete donation  could reduce the incentive for people to lie in order to qualify as a donor This practice may be critical for blood safety when incentives are offered the economists write The details can be fiddled with and researched some more But there should be little debate that the most relevant empirical evidence shows positive effects of offering economic rewards on donations the authors conclude
