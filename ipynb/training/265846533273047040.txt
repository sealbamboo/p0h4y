Depression is the most costly among  common risk factors linked to higher health spending on employees according to a new study drawn from the experience at seven companies The   published in the journal   found that these factors  which also included obesity high blood sugar and high blood pressure  were associated with nearly a quarter of the money spent on the health care of more than  workers First the employees were assessed for health risks then researchers tracked their medical spending from  through  The average medical spending for each employee was  a year In total  million or  percent of the  million annually spent on health care for the workers was attributed to the  risk factors the study found The relationship between   was the strongest with  percent more spending for workers with a propensity for that widespread problem People with high blood sugar had medical expenses that were almost onethird higher as did people with high blood pressure Obesity was associated with  percent more spending Tobacco use sedentary behavior and high stress also were related to increased spending although not as much as those other risk factors People with multiple risk factors tended to have the highest health costs The study couldnt show that any of these risk factors caused the higher spending merely that they were related And the study discovered that three risk factors  high cholesterol poor nutrition and eating habits and alcohol drinking  were actually associated with slightly lower health spending The researchers suggested various explanations for these counterintuitive findings As for alcohol they wrote that the nationally recognized threshold for high risk three drinks a day for men and two for women may need to be revisited because drinking at these levels would not constitute alcohol abuse They questioned the usefulness of the way the study measured a nutritious diet writing it might not be enough to simply measure fruit and vegetable consumption As for cholesterol they asserted that its impact on health might be more complicated than a simple causal relationship The study was led by   director of Emory Universitys Institute for Health and Productivity Studies and an executive at   in Washington DC Truven and NPR are partners in a regular   The researchers said the overall results of the study could offer encouragement to employers to do more to screen workers for highrisk behaviors and get them treatment On the question of whether employers might try to screen out prospective employees with these risk factors the authors said that so many people in the nation have one or more of these risk factors that any such effort might crimp hiring More important the authors wrote taking this approach would also be unethical and illegal
