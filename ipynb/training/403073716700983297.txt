A nonemergency NHS  phone line will not be introduced before April  the Welsh government has confirmed The news comes months after health minister Mark Drakeford said he wanted to speed up introduction of the line to ease pressures on AE departments Now he says it will not begin until potential pitfalls are ironed out and maximum value can be delivered Shadow health minister Darren Millar AM said there was no worthwhile reason to delay it for so long The Welsh government wants the nonemergency line to replace   as a gateway to services such as outofhours GPs district nurses and eventually social care It is hoped the line would make people less likely to use accident and emergency departments In April Mr Drakeford said he wanted to accelerate the introduction of the service He says the  line is still important and a phonefirst approach could help people access the care they need in the right place  However the earliest the phone line could be introduced is in the financial year  and it might only be in some parts of the country or certain parts of the health service  The Welsh government said the cost of the new service had not yet been determined Shadow Conservative health spokesman Darren Millar said There is no worthwhile reason to delay the introduction of this service for so long  While a timeout to reflect on success and failures elsewhere is sensible a delay of at least two years is unacceptable With waiting times at crisis point hospitals downgraded and recordbreaking cuts weighing down hard working staff trust must be restored in our health service and services improved  A well thoughtout and efficient  service could play a big part in that and aimlessly kicking it into the long grass benefits noone The British Medical Association which raised concerns in May about the plan said the Welsh government was right to take its time over the introduction  The deputy director of the BMAs GP committee David Bailey said The Welsh government is trying very hard to learn lessons from the way the whole thing was mishandled in England  Its trying to make sure the service is integrated so that people handling the calls can get quick clinical advice from out of hours services and from ambulances  Its something that potentially has a lot of benefits for patients but its only going to work if its done right The problem in England is it was done quickly In Wales we appear to be doing it right There have been problems with the introduction of NHS Englands  line which was introduced in April   suggested the line had not reduced AE admissions as much as had been hoped  The Department of Health in England said the lines performance was improving and it was looking at proposals from NHS England medical director Bruce Keogh about how it could be enhanced further
