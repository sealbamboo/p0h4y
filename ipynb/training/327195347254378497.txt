Scientists have discovered what may be an important new risk factor for heart disease And heres the surprising twist The troublesome substance seems to be a waste product left behind by bacteria in our guts as they help us digest lecithin  a substance plentiful in red meat eggs liver and certain other foods Doctors say the research further illustrates the complicated relationship we have with the microbes living inside us and could lead to new ways to prevent heart attacks and strokes I think its an incredibly big deal says   of Harvard Medical School It really provides completely new insight into a mechanism for heart disease and stroke that we didnt appreciate previously Saturated fats and cholesterol certainly can have a role in heart disease and stroke But doctors also have long known theres more to it than that Some people who have high cholesterol  seem to never go on to develop heart disease says   of the Cleveland Clinic who led the new research And then some others who have more modest levels of cholesterol  have a very early heart attack So Hazen recently started hunting around for other substances in the blood that people who have heart disease have in common And one substance known as TMAO or trimethylamineNoxide kept turning up Its a metabolite of certain food components such as lecithin and Lcarnitine But Hazen wasnt sure TMAO was connected to heart disease so he decided to put his theory to one kind of test He measured fasting blood levels of TMAO in more than  people who had gone in for nonemergency angiography He then kept track of them for three years to see what happened What we saw was that the blood level of TMAO strongly predicted who was at risk for experiencing a heart attack stroke or death in that ensuing threeyear period says Hazen who   his findings in this weeks   The people in the study with the highest TMAO levels seemed to have roughly twice the risk of having a heart attack stroke or death compared to those who had the lowest TMAO levels Hazen says a lot more research is still needed to prove that TMAO is more than just an innocent bystander  that it actually causes heart disease And its not entirely clear how that might work though TMAO might help cholesterol damage arteries If TMAO does play a damaging role where does it come from Hazen has an idea about that too based on earlier research He strongly suspects that bacteria in our guts basically burp out something that gets turned into high levels of TMAO when the microbes break down certain foods including red meat and eggs We had kind of proven that TMAO in the blood was coming from bacteria in the mice but it had not been proven in humans Hazen says So the researchers conducted a second experiment that they described in the same   paper They fed  volunteers things that they knew would generate TMAO such as two hardboiled eggs But then if subjects were placed on a cocktail of antibiotics that are good at eradicating bugs in the intestines absolutely no TMAO appears in the bloodstream Hazen says The effect of the antibiotics was only temporary  once the drugs were stopped the bacteria and the TMAO came roaring back That Hazen says shows that the gut bacteria are crucial for producing TMAO This is like if you will the waste product that the bacteria are not digesting he says The results help confirm similar findings Hazen reported recently in a smaller study involving red meat This study shows that blood levels of TMAO are a strong independent predictor of future risks for heart attack stroke and death he says And this appears to be so in individuals who have heart disease and even for people who dont have heart disease or dont have significant risks Nobody suggests taking antibiotics as a solution to heart disease But Hazen and others say that taken together the findings from  could lead to new ways to prevent heart disease not by eliminating gut bacteria but by shifting their mix Perhaps a probiotic approach that would involve the intentional ingestion of certain types of bacteria that might alter the population of bacteria in the gut to one that is beneficial could help Loscalzo says Perhaps more importantly the work focuses attention on the   that humans have with the microbes that inhabit our bodies They require us Hazen says We require them And we have coevolved over the eons together And they play an essential role in eating and digestion but no one had really appreciated until very recently that they also can sometimes participate in disease processes
