A long workweek may drive you to drink new research shows Researchers analyzed data on more than  people and found that those who worked at least  hours a week were up to  more likely to engage in risky alcohol use compared with those who were on the job for only  to  hours a week according to a   published Tuesday by the journal BMJ Risky alcohol use was defined as more than  drinks a week for women and more than  drinks a week for men That much alcohol makes people vulnerable to a variety of health problems including heart disease stroke liver problems and cancer For good or ill alcohol and work frequently mix In one   cited by the research team onethird of workers said theyve come to work with a hangover and  said they have been drunk on the job But the nature of the link between work hours and alcohol is murky So the team members combed through the medical literature in search of data sets that included information about peoples work and drinking habits Two types of studies emerged In one category were crosssectional studies which offered a snapshot of work hours and alcohol consumption for  people in  countries In this group people who worked long hours  any amount exceeding  hours a week  were  more likely to be risky drinkers than people who worked more traditional hours The other group of studies included  people in nine countries who were tracked by researchers at least twice Among those who didnt start out as risky drinkers those with lengthy workweeks were  more likely to become risky drinkers than their peers who didnt log overtime The group that faced the biggest risk consisted of people who worked  to  hours a week Compared with people who worked  to  hours a week they were  more likely to be risky drinkers These increases may not sound like much but when multiplied across the entire labor force of the  countries represented in the study they translate into more than  million people who may be turning to alcohol to cope with their demanding workloads according to   who studies workhealth issues at the Harvard School of Public Health and wrote an   that accompanies the study Most of the information about alcohol use was selfreported by study subjects Since heavy drinkers tend to understate their drinking the true link between long work hours and risky drinking might be greater than the study results indicate the researchers wrote The study didnt answer the obvious question of why people who work more are more inclined to drink but the researchers had some theories One is that drinking helped relieve stress brought on by stressful work conditions Another is that hardcharging people naturally wind up in work hard play hard situations A third possibility is that people who have sleep problems or are depressed might require more hours to finish their work and also be more inclined to drink
