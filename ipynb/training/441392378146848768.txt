On the last day of his life Charles Caldwell was surrounded by seven members of his family but no one thought he was dying He was in a Dallasarea nursing home recuperating from surgery to insert a feeding tube Caldwell had Parkinsons disease Hed lost his ability to swallow explains Caldwells soninlaw Bill Putnam Things began to go wrong Putnam says when a  gave Caldwell some medication through his feeding tube The medicine wouldnt stay down So as Putnam describes it the nurse came back with the medication in three large syringes and forced the liquid into Caldwells stomach Within a few minutes he was choking This medication is traveling up his esophagus and then into his lungs Putnam says and he cant expel it like you and I could So within minutes Dads thrashing his arms and legs for his last breath He has no pulse His eyes are fixed Hes not breathing Putnam says that the family could do nothing but watch Caldwell drown The case is similar to the many reviewed in a   The report was released this week by the Office of the Inspector General of the US Department of Health and Human Services In a large sampling of Medicare patients discharged from hospitals to skilled nursing facilities in one year roughly a third of the patients were harmed by their treatment in the nursing homes the study found Most of that harm could have been prevented Although Caldwell died three years before the departments review team began its study the officials say his case fits with the misjudgments and ignorance they found repeatedly in their analysis We were surprised at the seriousness of many cases says Ruth Ann Dorrill a deputy regional inspector general in the Department of Health and Human Services the office that conducted the study Dorrill says that many of the problems they observed were failures in ordinary everyday care Lack of monitoring and paying attention was definitely a factor along with what clinicians would call substandard medical care She sites the example of a patient already on  different medications  not that rare among nursing home patients  who was then given an additional anticoagulant such as an aspirin or something similar And then they would have a bleed Dorrill says a fatal bleed About  percent of nursing home residents harmed by their treatment wound up back in the hospital as a result such injuries likely cost Medicare about  billion a year officials say Thats just the hospitalization cost It doesnt account for extra doctor visits and longer nursing home stays that also result from patients injuries Nursing homes are inspected by state officials not by the federal government But the HHS investigators hope their report will provide guidance for state inspections and will improve patient safety Thats especially crucial because todays nursing home patients are sicker and more fragile than they used to be Its been a gradual thing Dorrill says Twenty years ago the typical patient might be found in the game room playing cards But now Dorrill says the average resident might be on a ventilator The nursing home industry doesnt dispute the findings of the report but representatives say it doesnt take into account more recent initiatives to improve care  is head of quality and regulatory affairs for the American Health Care Association which represents about  percent of nursing homes The report reflected care from  and  Gifford says while it wasnt until  that his organization started a quality improvement initiative So weve been seeing progress since  but we still have a ways to go A very long way to go according to   an attorney with the Center for Medicare Advocacy She says she thinks the inspector generals report suggests a simple remedy The inspector general found that staff didnt monitor residents and delayed in providing necessary care Those are staffing issues Edelman says We dont have enough nurses in nursing homes providing care to residents But for Caldwells family it wasnt just the size of the nursing home staff but what they were trained  or not trained  to do that meant the difference between life and death
