Like many people George Rue loved music  He played guitar in a band He attended concerts often  In his late s he started feeling a dull ache in his ears after musical events  After a blues concert almost nine years ago I left with terrible ear pain and ringing and my life changed forever said Mr Rue  of Waterford Conn  He perceived all but the mildest sounds as not just loud but painful It hurt to hear Now he has constant burning pain in his ears along with ringing or tinnitus so loud its like a laser beam cutting a sheet of steel Everyday noise like a humming refrigerator adds a feeling of needles shooting into my ears said Mr Rue who avoids social situations and was interviewed by email because talking by phone causes pain Mr Rue was given a diagnosis of hyperacusis a nonspecific term that has assorted definitions including sound sensitivity decreased sound tolerance and a loudness tolerance problem  But hyperacusis sometimes comes with ear pain too a poorly understood medical condition that is beginning to receive more serious attention  This is clearly an emerging field said Richard Salvi of the Department of Communicative Disorders and Sciences at the University at Buffalo and a scientific adviser to   a nonprofit group that funds research on the condition Further work is required to understand the symptoms etiology and underlying neural mechanisms Loud noises even when they arent painful can damage both the sensory cells and sensory nerve fibers of the inner ear over time causing hearing impairment said M Charles Liberman a professor of otology at Harvard Medical School who heads a hearing research lab at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary And for some people who are susceptible possibly because of some combination of genes that gives them tender ears noise sets in motion an anomalous response he said  The prevalence of hyperacusis with or without pain is unknown Some studies suggest that  percent of people have an unusual intolerance of ordinary environmental sounds while  percent have troublesome hyperacusis Hyperacusis with pain is a fundamentally different physiological entity than mere increased sensitivity Dr Liberman said The auditory nerve contains myelinated fibers which are used to perceive loudness and to process speech as well as unmyelinated ones Though it has not been proven hyperactivity in these unmyelinated fibers may be responsible for the increased pain sensation in affected individuals he said Pain could also stem from pain receptors on the eardrum or from the tiny middleear muscles or joints Dr Salvi said A   in    funded by   along with the   underscores how little is known about hyperacusis with noiseinduced pain and the confusing and misleading terminology surrounding the condition Words like sensitivity make it seem that sound feels a little louder or stronger said Bryan Pollard the president of Hyperacusis Research But when hearing is actively painful pursuing a normal life is impossible There is no place on earth without sound Sufferers can barely sit at a dinner table where ordinary voices and clanking dishes can cause ear pain that lingers for hours days or more The pain is often accompanied by the feeling of pressure known as aural fullness along with tinnitus Three years ago Ann Lesky then a math teacher in Newton Mass was subjected to a wolfwhistle mere inches from one ear The pain was excruciating Within an hour the ringing started resembling a whistling teakettle  Struggling with pain from classroom noise Ms Lesky had to leave her job Pain which she describes as a steel rod stabbing and turning in my ear canal is always present in her bad ear Tinnitus plagues both ears Routine sounds like the beeping from a store scanner or a vehicle that is backing up can trigger hours of additional pain Louder noises hurt more and last longer Ms Lesky  said I feel like I am getting better and then some noise sets me back She manages with earplugs protective earmuffs and noisecanceling headphones It is difficult to communicate she said People think I am rude Surprise noises are the hardest to deal with she said I am always thinking what noise will hurt and how do I avoid it The quality of my life is almost unbearable Silence is my only comfort Like many patients Ms Lesky visited multiple doctors seeking relief None helped One ordered a loud MRI which led to months of increased pain and added another permanent tinnitus tone like breaking glass  Patients are sometimes prescribed pain drugs or treated with sound therapy where the volume and duration are increased slowly to help with desensitization  Shortterm improvement is deceptive said Mr Pollard of Hyperacusis Research who seeks to educate audiologists and earnosethroat specialists about the horrible facts of how a noise injury typically behaves and what a patient really experiences  Significant relapses occur with new noise exposure he said We continue to hear from people who follow the bad advice they receive and who go right back out into the world confused and hurting themselves further
