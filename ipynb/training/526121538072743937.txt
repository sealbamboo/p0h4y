In a white tent outside an Ebola treatment ward in Monrovia Dr Dan Lucey fondles a surgical glove He rubs the latex between his thumb and forefinger the way a tailor might caress a piece of fine silk They have very good gloves here Lucey gushes about the Ebola suits used by Doctors Without Borders also known by its French acronym MSF The MSF personal protective equipment is the best Lucey a professor of immunology at Georgetown University calls the MSF protective gear the gold standard And I can say that from working in Sierra Leone in a nonMSF situation he adds Lucey is running a ward at one of the medical charitys Ebola treatment units in Liberia Personal protective equipment or PPE as its called in the field are the hazmat suits that healthcare workers wear when theyre on the front lines These suits made of an impermeable synthetic fabric serve as the thin barrier that separates doctors and nurses from the potentially fatal virus At first glance the suits all may seem to be the same but Dr Lucey says thats not the case Some gloves are far more durable than others And the PPE system used by Doctors Without Borders covers every inch of the body and face which Lucey says is crucial Theres no exposed skin whatsoever he says All the different PPE systems used at Ebola wards include a coverall jumpsuit usually hooded gloves rubber boots a face mask and goggles What varies is the thickness of the gloves and suits and how much of the face is covered The World Health Organization is training Ebola workers in Monrovia to use a simpler PPE system in which goggles cover the eyes and a surgical mask covers the nose and mouth  but some skin on the neck and sides of the face remains exposed The fact that theres a glimmer of skin is still reasonable says Dr Srinivas Murthy who is leading a WHO training session for Ebola workers in Monrovia The eyes nose mouth fingers are well protected From our experience and from the WHOs expertise in managing these wards we are okay with that small glimmer of space knowing the risks and benefits of covering it up The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is not okay with any glimmers of space It recently revised its guidelines on the proper personal protective equipment for treating Ebola at US hospitals saying that all skin should be covered Murthy points out that no set of PPE offers  percent protection He emphasizes that training on how to remove a potentially Ebolacontaminated suit for example is far more important than the hoods or the masks We dont want to teach them to wear  gloves and  hoods We want to teach them to know why youre wearing what youre wearing and what the risks associated with Ebola transmission are he says So if you feel youre unsafe then you leave  if theres a huge spill if you get something on your goggles that sort of thing That knowledge is more important than the equipment itself Murthy says the WHOs PPE costs less  than some other versions  not an insignificant issue when youre looking to outfit thousands of healthcare workers across West Africa MSFs equipment takes longer to put on and take off than the WHOs protective gear With a thick rubber apron its also heavier and heats up quickly in the West African tropics The suits get so hot and sweaty that workers are only able to stay on an Ebola ward for between  minutes and an hour The lighter WHO gear on the other hand allows nurses and doctors to stay in the wards for up to four hours Theres still debate about which is better But with so many health care workers getting infected during this outbreak  roughly  at last count  the trend is to rely on more protective gear rather than less
