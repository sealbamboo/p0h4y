Dear Salt I recently joined President Obama on his trip through Africa and I brought a mystery home with me I wonder if you can help me solve it I was supposed to take my antimalaria pills in the morning with heavy or fatty food That meant a lot of eggs for breakfast all across Africa In Senegal and South Africa everything seemed normal Then we arrived at the final stop of the trip in Tanzania When I picked up my vegetable omelet from the breakfast buffet at my hotel in Dar es Salaam one glance suggested theyd accidentally made an egg white omelet No big deal I ate it without a second thought The next day President Obama flew home and I went to a remote island called   for  hours of RR My first morning at the rustic lodge I ordered scrambled eggs They too were white Could this chef have left out the yolks too Impossible The next day determined to get to the bottom of this I ordered my eggs sunnysideup Not my favorite but a sacrifice I was willing to make in the name of scientific research Sure enough the runny yolks were ghostly pale I asked the lodge manager whod lived in South Africa and England why the yolks looked more like whites Oh those eggs you get in the US are only yellow because theyre pumped full of hormones he said But I know thats not true I buy my eggs from my neighborhood farmers market and the yolks are the color of a setting sun Could the color of the yolks have something to do with what the chickens are eating or with the breed of chicken that lays them I know that some chickens produce eggshells in shades of blue pink yellow or brown Maybe the yolk color varies just as widely But does that explain why the eggs were pale in both a Dar es Salaam chain hotel and a remote Mafia lodge Can you help me unscramble this puzzle     Yours Ari
