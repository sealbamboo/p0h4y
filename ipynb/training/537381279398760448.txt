The Ebola outbreak started in rural areas but by June it had reached Liberias capital Monrovia By August the number of people contracting the Ebola virus in the country was doubling every week The Liberian government and aid workers begged for help Enter the US military who along with other US agencies had a clear plan in midSeptember to build more Ebola treatment units or ETUs At least one would be built in the major town of each of Liberias  counties That way sick patients in those counties wouldnt bring more Ebola to the capital But its taken a long time to build these ETUs most wont be done until the end of the year And now the spread of Ebola changing  clusters are popping up in remote rural areas So building a huge treatment center in each countys main town may no longer make sense Two hours outside the capital   just finished erecting an ETU last week Lt Abraham Richardson shows me around first giving me a tour of the triage building where all patients will arrive Then he leads me to four giant white tents inside what health workers call the hot zone Thats where all the confirmed cases will be Richardson says Each tent will house about  patients This is what the military is good at landing in a place theyve never been and building stuff But some say the size of the ETUs is a problem Because its taken so long to build the centers their relatively large size is no longer useful says Dr Darin Portnoy whos with Doctors Without Borders Hes just finished caring for two sick children at one of the organizations original ETUs back in Monrovia ETUs are not needed right now at the same level he says Right now the construction should be scaled down  fewer beds Take the amazing capacity that has been brought to bear and direct it elsewhere he adds By elsewhere Portnoy means remote rural areas where sometimes the only way to reach people is by walking for hours or taking a canoe He says big international donors should support socalled rapid response teams that go out find those hardtoreach people and set up small treatment centers where they actually live Just because you have a plan  doesnt mean you have to continue on that plan he says The US has started to scale down its plan building only  ETUs instead of the  originally planned Some ETUs will now have  beds instead of  And instead of sending  troops to West Africa to build facilities and train health workers the military says that number will now be closer to  The military is also helping to locate Ebola cases in remote areas Just last week says   who commands the US forces in Liberia the military gave a team of epidemiologists a ride in a helicopter to a remote village north of the capital to find Ebola victims But Volesky says he wants to know the military has an exit plan and that someone else will take over the jobs that the US troops have been doing A few hours north of the capital at one of the busiest ETUs in Liberia custodian John Jameson shows us the burial ground full of fresh mounds of dirt Three four five burials a day he says The ones buried here were those who could make it to the ETU Health officials say many more people are getting sick and dying in remote rural areas which means Ebola will keep spreading
