The headlines on the press releases that started showing up yesterday here at The Salt certainly got our attention Just one sample   New Study Links Genetically Engineered Food to Tumors The reason for all the excitement was a   published this week in the wellrespected journal   The French scientists who conducted the study basically concluded that rats fed a diet of genetically modified corn and small amounts of herbicides got sicker faster than their counterparts eating regular corn and no herbicides Based on the study several antiGMO groups are calling for a ban and the French government is calling for more investigation but many scientists met the research with a   of skepticism The study describes an experiment in which scientists fed  different groups of rats ten rats in each group various concentrations of a genetically engineered kind of corn andor small amounts of the herbicide Roundup Roundup is widely used in combination with genetically engineered Roundup Ready crops Two control groups got a diet of nonmodified corn and no Roundup The experiment went on for two years an unusually long time Most experiments with rats that attempt to measure the toxic effects of chemicals last only  days On average the rats that ate GM corn or drank water laced with Roundup did worse than the control group Tumors showed up earlier at least in some of the groups and more rats died than in the control groups The contrast was most stark among female rats So is this solid evidence that GM corn or other crops are bad for you The author of the paper   who has been campaigning against GM crops since  says yes Definitely yes  say absolutely not Some of their complaints about the study are aimed at the studys methods Critics point out that the type of experimental rats used in this study are particularly prone to tumors So if you divide up  of them into twenty groups as this study did you are likely to get very high tumor rates in some of the groups And the fact that such clusters of tumors didnt show up in the two small control groups could easily be due to random chance One particularly irreverent   Michael Grayer a medical statistician pointed out that the study included  groups of rats that were exposed to GMOs or Roundup nine each for male and female rats compared to only two control groups The potential for cherrypicking the nice positive results here from a sea of boring null ones is immense he wrote on his blog Not saying they did it of course but its certainly a concern Also if this experiment truly showed a link between genetically engineered food and tumors one might expect the rats that ate more of the GM corn to develop more tumors In fact the opposite happened The rats eating a diet of  percent GMO corn stayed healthier than animals eating food with a GMO concentration of just  percent Seralini for his part says that this simply shows that GMOs are toxic in a different way They merely need to rise above a certain threshold level to have harmful effects increasing the concentration doesnt increase the harm Some scientists were inclined to dismiss the study simply based on Seralinis history of antiGMO claims I know this guy He has published a lot of rubbish says   a Dutch scientist who used to be in charge of the European Commissions   on the safety of genetically modified foods That program sponsored many previous studies including animal feeding studies which came to less alarming conclusions and got much less attention than Seralinis In fact Kuiper and many of his colleagues   that animal feeding studies are a very good tool for studying the safety of GM foods If there was a harmful chemical hidden in GM corn they say such studies wouldnt be likely to catch it because rats cant eat enough corn for them to get a harmful dose of the toxic or cancercausing substance But apart from methodological concerns and personal animosity theres a deeper reason why scientists like Kuiper give little credence to Seralinis studies Theres a saying in science Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence For most of the scientists who have been studying the safety of GMOs its an extraordinary claim at this point to assert that the current generation of genetically modified crops are harmful to human health Theres no apparent reason why that should be true No one has found new toxic substances in these crops And the giant feeding experiment thats been going on for the past fifteen years  hundreds of millions of Americans consuming GMO ingredients  hasnt produced evidence of harm either It would take a lot more evidence that the results of this study to change their minds
