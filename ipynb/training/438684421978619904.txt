Another reason not to like openplan offices they could be making people sick A   published in the journal Ergonomics found that workers who share open spaces with multiple colleagues are more likely to take shortterm sick leaves than those who enjoy the privacy of their own office Researcher and architect Christina Bodin Danielsson and three colleagues at Stockholm University studied  employees working in seven different types of offices in Sweden The layouts ranged from private offices to rooms housing two to three people to open plan layouts with more than  people They also looked at employees working in what they dub   where there are no assigned workstations Workers were asked to report the number of short sick leave spells  defined as a week or less  theyd taken over the past year as well as the number of long spells or periods longer than a week The study found a significant association with office type when it came to the short sick leave spells workers in small medium and large open office layouts had elevated risks as compared to those who had private offices
