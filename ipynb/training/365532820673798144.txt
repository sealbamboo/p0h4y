Wouldnt it be grand and delicious if we could boost our brain power with a daily dose of chocolate At first blush a   published in the journal   this week appears to offer tantalizing evidence that this may be the case at least when it comes to seniors In the study older adults average age  who drank two cups of cocoa daily for one month showed improvements in how quickly they completed a set of cognitive tests Brain imaging showed these patients also experienced better blood flow to the brain the authors reported Dozens of media outlets jumped on the news with headlines blaring that cocoa   Sounds like a good excuse to down a cup of hot chocolate right Not so fast says Catherine KwikUribe Shes the director of research and development for   a unit of the candymaking giant that studies flavanols a type of antioxidant in cocoa beans As she notes theres a solid   showing that cocoa flavanols can help control   and generally improve cardiovascular health Plenty of evidence has linked cardiovascular health to cognition and more recently researchers have been asking whether cocoa flavanols can also boost brain health Our knowledge is just beginning to emerge says KwikUribe But you cant conclude much from the  study she adds The researchers in the study she notes didnt find a difference between those who drank cocoa with high levels of flavanols and those with very low levels The authors also failed to keep track of what else the participants were eating that might have influenced their improved cognitive test scores In fact cocoas impact on the brain wasnt really the main point of the study anyway as study author   a neurologist at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston points out She and her colleagues were mostly interested in investigating the link between poorer performance on thinking and memory tests and lower blood flow to the brain The chocolate bit was really more of an aside I do not recommend that people add chocolate or cocoa to their diet at this point Sorond told The Salt via email Our results are preliminary and adding the extra calories sugar and fat that comes with chocolate and cocoa carries additional health hazards which may offset any possible brain benefits But dont fret just yet chocoholics While this study may not tell us all that much other research on cocoa flavanols and brain health while preliminary is more promising Scientists have homed in on one particular flavanol epicatechin its pronounced minus epicatechin as the likely source of the brain benefits seen from cocoa For example studies have found that   had better spatial memory and formed more new blood vessels than mice that werent given the compound And research in   has found the slimy crawlers were able to remember a trained task for at least a day when given the flavanol compared to less than three hours without it As for humans KwikUribe and her colleagues published a   last year that looked at  elderly patients with mild memory problems Those who drank cocoa with medium levels  mg to high levels  mg of flavanols daily for eight weeks showed major improvements on tests that measured factors such as attention verbal fluency and working memory compared to those whose cocoa had low flavanol levels  mg So how do cocoa flavanols confer their brain benefits Researchers dont know for sure though there are plenty of ideas It might be that flavanols promote better brain blood flow and help generate new blood vessels the more oxygen your noggin gets the better it performs Or maybe flavanols encourage the expression of proteins that protect the brain and promote neuron connections Cocoa flavanols also help control blood sugar which might be protecting the brain from   The data says KwikUribe is still emerging You have to stay tuned
