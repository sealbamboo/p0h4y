Further some data suggest that longterm exposure to certain active ingredients used in antibacterial products  for example triclosan liquid soaps and triclocarban bar soaps  could pose health risks such as bacterial resistance or hormonal effects About  individual products contain these products health officials said  Our goal is if a company is making a claim that something is antibacterial and in this case promoting the concept that consumers who use these products can prevent the spread of germs then there ought to be data behind that said Dr Sandra Kweder deputy director of the Office of New Drugs in FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research We think that companies ought to have data before they make these claims Studies in rats have shown a decrease in thyroid hormones with longterm exposure she said Collecting data from humans is very difficult because the studies look at a long time period  Before the proposed rule is finalized companies will need to provide data to support their claims or  if they do not  the products will need to be reformulated or relabeled to remain on the market This is a good first step toward getting unsafe triclosan off the market said Mae Wu an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council FDA is finally taking concerns about triclosan seriously Washing your hands with soap containing triclosan doesnt make them cleaner than using regular soap and water and can carry potential health risks The FDA first proposed removing triclosan from certain products in  the council said but because the agency took no final action triclosan has been found in more and more soaps  In  the council said it sued FDA to force it to issue a final rule The new proposed rule stems from a settlement in that suit according to the NRDC The rule is available for public comment for  days with a concurrent oneyear period for companies to submit new data and information followed by a day period for rebuttal comments according to the FDA The target deadline is June  for the public comment period then companies will have until December  to submit data and studies The FDA wants to finalize the rule and determine whether these products are generally recognized as safe and effective by September   Antibacterial soaps and body washes are used widely and frequently by consumers in everyday home work school and public settings where the risk of infection is relatively low said Dr Janet Woodcock director of the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research  Due to consumers extensive exposure to the ingredients in antibacterial soaps we believe there should be a clearly demonstrated benefit from using antibacterial soap to balance any potential risk The action is part of FDAs ongoing review of antibacterial active ingredients the agency said Hand sanitizers wipes and antibacterial products used in health care settings are not affected  Most hand sanitizers have  alcohol or ethanol and are generally recognized as safe when water isnt available Kweder said However health officials still believe washing hands with soap and water is the best method
