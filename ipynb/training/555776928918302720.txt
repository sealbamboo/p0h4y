Children who are overweight in kindergarten have four times the risk of becoming obese by eighth grade researchers reported Wednesday  in just one of the ways they said that the risk of becoming overweight or obese could start even before birth Put another way Half of childhood obesity occurred among children who had become overweight during the preschool years the scientists wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine And as kids got older their chances of becoming obese fell The researchers set out to track not the prevalence but the incidence of childhood obesity about which they said little is known That is they wanted to know the rate at which new cases of obesity occurred in children ages  to  in an effort to get at effective interventions Emerging from the finding that a substantial component of childhood obesity is established by the age of  years are questions about how early the trajectory to obesity begins and about the relative roles of earlylife home and preschool environments intrauterine factors and genetic predisposition the researchers wrote In an accompanying editorial Steven Gortmaker of the Harvard School of Public Health Â and Elsie Taveras of Massachusetts General Hospital wrote that the study should lead to some ideas about interventions to prevent obesity with evidence pointing to ideas that focus on childrens environments and that aim to alter early life systems as probably the most effective The researchers from Emory University looked at  children who went to kindergarten in  and were studied over the years through the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study The results they said were consistent with other national studies When they started kindergarten  of the children were obese an additional  were overweight At eighth grade  were obese  overweight The annual incidence of obesity decreased from  in kindergarten to  from fifth through eighth grade the study showed Measured using body mass index  the weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters  children at the   percentile at age  had a  probability of being obese by age  That probability rose to  for yearolds at the   percentile and to  at the   percentileThe prevalence of obesity increased to  by eighth grade about  years The researchers found no significant increases from ages  to  They looked at some characteristics of the children who were overweight or obese as well Though they found no difference between children with a low birth weight and those with a normal birth weight they found that babies born with a high birth weight more than  grams or about  pounds had a significantly higher prevalence of obesity Wealthy children  those from the wealthiest  of families  had a lower prevalence of obesity in kindergarten than the other children The highest prevalence was among the children in the secondpoorest   with nearly  of them becoming obese by eighth grade Among all the children the highest increase in the prevalence of obesity was in first to third grades from  to  Prevalence was higher among Latino children and starting in third grade among African American children But although the prevalence of obesity rose with age the incidence declined the researchers wrote From fall to spring of kindergarten it was  and fell to  among girls and  among boys per year at fifth grade Twitter
