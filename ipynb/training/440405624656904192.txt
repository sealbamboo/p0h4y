Colorado opened its first pot stores in January and adults in Washington state will be able to walk into a store and buy marijuana this summer But this legalization of recreational marijuana is taking place without much information on the possible health effects We should have been doing a lot more research to find out just how useful it is how it affects the brain et cetera et cetera according to   a Columbia University psychiatrist and drug abuse researcher But he says its been hard to study the effects of   the plant that produces marijuana A large part of the reason marijuana research has lagged is that its been very hard to get federal approval for such projects as well as access to federally sanctioned supplies of the drug Kleber hopes that the push to legalize the drug will stimulate longdelayed research Meanwhile he thinks its a bad idea I dont think we know what were getting into Hes not the only person who would like to see more science on marijuana and health But not all think the drug poses big health risks or at least not big enough risks to keep it illegal Most cannabis users are moderate users says   a professor of public policy at the University of California Los Angeles who studies drug policy They use a joint a week or less Jacquelene Cohen the yearold director of publicity for a Seattle publisher is a typical user  indulging once or twice a month she says Its just like a small pleasure she says like pouring a nice bourbon for a friend or passing a pipe with marijuana in it Its just something nice to do when youre sitting around conversationally While Kleiman doesnt see enough health risks from marijuana to override the push toward legalization he does worry about users who get hooked on the stuff He says if the price of marijuana falls too much it could result in more dependence especially among adolescents and lowincome users The main risk of cannabis he says is becoming habituated to cannabis and spending your whole life stoned About  percent of marijuana users fit the definition of dependence  that is their habit interferes with their life and theyve been unable to cut back Thats   the dependence number for heroin and other opioids  percent cocaine  percent cigarettes or alcohol  percent or nicotine  percent Heavy users arent hard to find I have friends that Ive never seen   stoned Cohen says It doesnt seem that its that harmful My friends that smoke a lot of marijuana are productive and creative and sociable and they form strong relationships and they make good life choices The National Institute on Drug Abuse   that while marijuana dependence is similar to that for other drugs the longterm clinical outcomes may be less severe Surveys show that  million Americans use marijuana at least once a month and  million of those meet the criteria for dependence Kleiman says thats not alarmingly high Its not a very high risk he says but its a high risk if its you or your child or your parent or your sibling So people who say Oh cannabis isnt abusable cannabis isnt addictive it seems to me just arent looking at the data The addiction potential is higher among those who start using marijuana at younger ages And the higher potency of marijuana these days may increase the risk of dependency although data are lacking on that point Psychological treatment to wean marijuana users from dependency works about  percent of the time according to Kleber the Columbia University researcher Theres promising research indicating treatment can be improved with medication  in particular a combination of synthetic THC the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana plus a longacting drug for high blood pressure only available in Europe When it comes to other adverse health effects the evidence is unclear Marijuana smoke contains many of the same   as cigarette smoke But even heavy marijuana smokers dont seem to have more lung cancer or emphysema Oddly enough Kleiman says the epidemiology has not come in to support the microbiology The obvious speculation is that theres something else in cannabis thats actually a tumorsuppressing agent and people are looking hard at that now Many worry that marijuana might increase the risk of   Authorities say theres enough evidence to warn against marijuana use for anybody whos had a psychotic episode or a family history of schizophrenia Still as millions of people have used marijuana in recent years the incidence of schizophrenia has   at around  percent of the population And then theres driving under the influence Kleiman says one study allowed heavy marijuana users to smoke as much as they wanted before testing them on a driving simulator Even when the subjects were as stoned as they want to be he says they were about as impaired as people who just meet the drunkendriving threshold Thats not entirely reassuring But it suggests that marijuana might not be as dangerous as alcohol when it comes to driving But heres an important point Kleiman says theres some evidence that marijuana users may be drivingimpaired for hours after they think their high has worn off Thats where a real public health campaign could make a difference Kleiman says saying if you smoke cannabis do not drive for something like six hours after  wed have to do the research Thats a lot longer than the subjective high lasts But its probably what you need to get people actually safe Kleiman adds one more key point Cannabis is much more dangerous when it accompanies even a little bit of   So he thinks the bloodalcohol limit for drivers with any level of cannabis in their blood should be zero Of the states considering legalization most   legalizing recreational marijuana  states or decriminalizing possession of small amounts  states and the District of Columbia Twenty states plus Washington DC allow marijuana sale for medical use although in some places the medical pretext is slim
