The ADHD Explosion Myths Medication Money and Todays Push for Performance released this week by Oxford University Press chronicles the steep increase in ADHD diagnoses in the United States over the last two decades The new book offers provocative evidence that economic pressures and government policies  not just concern for childrens welfare  are behind the increase in diagnoses of the psychiatric disorder marked by hyperactivity disorganization impulsiveness inattention and poor academic performance beginning in childhood The authors of the  psychology professor   and health economist   both of UC Berkeley are hardly ADHD deniers They acknowledge ADHD to be a disorder that can hobble the lives of those who have it and they cite abundant evidence that the prescription stimulant medication used to tame ADHDs symptoms can bring about remarkable improvement in those with the disorder Their research is underwritten by the   a respected public health philanthropy But the line that separates the merely scattered and energetic child from one who fits the disorders full clinical criteria is not sharp And Hinshaw and Scheffler argue that our shifting expectations of our kids and our own economic and academic performance have tilted the balance in favor of diagnosing an underachieving child and of medicating him or her with the stimulant drugs used to blunt the disorders symptoms Following is a QA with the books authors conducted and edited by Los Angeles Times staff writer Melissa Healy  It looks pretty clear around the world that in any country with compulsory education the prevalence of ADHD is remarkably similararound  of schoolkids Thats roughly how frequently you see ADHD diagnosed in Brazil China Europe and elsewhere But the ADHD diagnosis rate in the US is quite high compared to that of other highly developed countries If you believe the most current data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the latest figure is that  of all kids  to  have at some point gotten an ADHD diagnosis from a professional And after first grade its  of all boys and about  of all girls If you believe those data which appear to be accurate we have gone too far Thats higher than the diagnostic rate should be There are too many diagnoses made in children on the basis of maybe a  to minute visit to a pediatricians office where theres no corroborating information from the childs school no ratings from his or her parents no thorough history taken of the kid And at the end of such a brief office visit a prescription for stimulant medication is often written Now thats a formula for overdiagnosis since the symptoms of ADHD are also the symptoms of some learning disabilities of depression of having been mistreated or of a chaotic classroom ADHD too often can be a convenient label to describe problems that have other origins But the same very cursory process can lead to underdiagnosis of ADHD The physician says Well I didnt see her tearing up the waiting room or his parents say he can play video games for six hours straight so it cant be ADHD In these instances the physician doesnt have a sense of the child in the classroom or at home or on the soccer field And the result can be that the diagnosis is missed leaving a child struggling Its problematic either way Professional groupsthe American Academy of Pediatrics the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry the American Psychiatric Assnhave all published very clear guidelines as to what a thorough assessment for ADHD requires But theres no enforcement of those guidelines And theres usually no insurance reimbursement to physicians for making such a thorough assessment  Over and underdiagnosis comes in part from the clinical reality of how the ADHD diagnosis is made There is no blood test no brain scan no Xray you can point to and say There it is So it can be a matter of judgment from the parents clinicians even the children themselves Theres some fuzziness around the edges of this diagnosis In the absence of clear physical basis for a diagnosis our changing societal expectations and economic conditions can play a role in how willing people are to diagnose and medicate a child for ADHD After all this is a disorder whose hallmarks are impulsive disruptive and inattentive behavior and academic underperformance So part of the explosion we have seen in ADHD diagnoses comes from escalating academic pressure that teachers and parents have placed on their children to perform better at school to get into a better college to get a good job  Theres been a recent history of trying to get our schools to perform better Fifteen or  years ago the philosophy was to get class sizes down and to fund schools better In efforts to improve education the focus was on inputs Then with the federal No Child Left Behind lawand a wide range of state educational accountability measures that came before itthe focus of improving education shifted to output better test scores higher graduation rates etc This enormous push for performance unleashed a whole new focus on testing and on generating positive test results The movement tied school and school district  budgets teachers salaries and principals promotions to these test scores But lets look at the incentives this creates for diagnosing ADHD in children who might be bringing down their schools average test scores or who may be disruptive forces in their classrooms First of course theres this belief that diagnosing and medicating kids with ADHD will help them do better But it goes beyond that Once a child is diagnosed with ADHD the school is also allowed to make accommodations in his or her testing for instance which can help him or her get better test scores And sometimes diagnosing a child with ADHD allowed the school to exempt that childs scores from the measures by which the school and its administrators are evaluated and either rewarded or punished In some sense we can see the societal pressure pushing everyone to diagnose These state and eventually federal policies incentivized schools to do that A fairly clever natural experiment  helped us to measure this effect One by one in the s  states passed these kinds of accountability laws incentivizing test scores and achievement Those states were mostly in the US South And sure enough through the late s and in the first years of the new century those states saw dramatically increased rates of ADHD diagnoses Then in  along came the No Child Left Behind law which made these performancebased standards for education the law of the land The day it takes effect in  the law brings  states into this new pushforperformance scheme And its targeting public schools and especially public schools in lowincome communitiesschools that received a lot of funding for free and reducedprice lunch programs  Now the law takes effect in  And as luck would have it  is when the CDC conducts  the first national survey that asks a representative sample of parents whether their child had ever been diagnosed with ADHD by a professional And then four years later they ask the same question in another representative survey By  those states that first got accountability under No Child Left Behind in the  school year saw a  increase in ADHD diagnoses among their poorest kids but under  in  kids from middle and upper income families in those states Meanwhile there was no comparable rise in private schools in those states which were not subject to the new rules of No Child Left Behind And in the states that already had accountability laws before Everybody  poor and wealthy  rose about  during that period consistent with the overall national rate of increase So when you make accountability count the rates of diagnoses of the poorest kids go up shockingly Short of designing a randomized control trial to determine whether these policies are driving up diagnoses thats our clearest evidence And the evidence is especially strong for schools with a lot of poor kids in them  And there were other factors at work as well The diagnosis and treatment of ADHD started to become more popular because we passed child health insurance programs back in the s So if they were diagnosed they were covered and could get treatment Most state Medicaid programs started to pay for them as well making it easier for poor kids to get diagnosed and treated After years of seeing far higher ADHD diagnosis rates in wealthier kids we found that the differential in diagnoses between wealthier kids and poor kids disappeared  When I was in graduate school  years ago hyperactivity was a white middleclass male phenomenon ADD the new name in  was about the disruptive boyDennis the Menace It was the Tom Sawyer syndrome And the field said girls cant get hyperactivity We used to think the same things about autisma wealthy white boy thingand eating disorders which only happened to uppermiddleclass girls This of course was referral bias Those were the kids whose parents had the wherewithal to bring them to the specialized clinics that diagnosed these conditions Once the field started looking more broadly  and with changes in health insurance and specialeducation laws in the s  we began to see that all of these conditions are equalopportunity conditions In ADHD there is a large genetic undercurrent But there are also some risk factors that are concentrated more in lowincome families than in higherincome ones Kids born preterm or at low birth weight are at higher risk of ADHD as are those whose mothers smoke or drink alcohol during pregnancy Today the rate of diagnosis among African American kids is about the same as that for white kids  Among Hispanics however the rate of ADHD diagnosis remains quite low compared to that of nonHispanic white kids and African American kids Thats despite the fact that diagnosis rates among ethnic groups should be pretty much the same Certainly their access to care appears to be lower and that could help explain it But culture clearly matters too and in ways we dont totally understand It may be that in Hispanic culture the behavior of boys who act out and dont conform may be seen in a different light than in other cultures Recently however in California Hispanic rates of diagnosis have been growing fast  So if this is a smart pill and it helps people who can afford it why not Part of me says yes But I ask myself what are potential side effects This class of drugs is probably one of the safest psychiatric drugs used so why wouldnt we put it in water supply Because some people will have a bad reaction  And the economist in me says OK suppose side effects are small and insignificant Who should pay for it Is it something that your insurance company should pay for under Obamacare if you dont have a diagnosis but youd like to have the medication It may be something that society as a whole doesnt want to pay for And finally suppose it did work the question is is it fair Its like steroids and sports Most of us think its not Its not a fair way to play the game and we dont want that I think society is not very favorably disposed to enhancing peoples performance through medication unless they have a clinical reason for it Its not only the cost and who pays for it but whether its the right thing I think its not Should we accept neuroenhancement as the wave of the future I long thought maybe its a personal choice After all we   a productive society theres a high demand for productivity But as this book went to bed I began seeing some new research and have been changing my thinking on this We know that pretty much anyone who takes a stimulant will stay alert longer But the question has always been whether for people who dont really have ADHD does the medication really improve cognitive performance The worlds first really good study came out in January  published in the journal   Researchers from University of Pennsylvania recruited  college students and put them in a rigorous experimental trial of stimulants vs placebo across seven weeks There were  rigorous measures of cognitive performance How many of these measures did these college kids show improvement on Zero But there was a th measure The researchers also asked the subjects How much did the drug improve your performance on the tests The medication led to a decided improvement on how well the subjects thought they did So it would seem that medication bolsters a false sense of confidence You feel more alert you thought you aced it But you didnt Theres no doubt that stimulants help everyone stay alert But in light of this research theres much more doubt now that they really improve your cognitive performance and thinking if you dont have ADHD or your symptoms dont position you pretty close to an ADHD diagnosis And meanwhile one crucial side effect isnt often mentioned If youve got ADHD and your treatment is well monitored the odds that youll get addicted to stimulant medications is extremely low by all published accounts But if youre a normal college student and you start taking this medication theres up to a  likelihood that youll get addicted to the pills youre taking and it encourages other pillpopping as well Plus its illegal
