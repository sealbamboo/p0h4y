When I consider what happened to an esteemed friend and colleague I fume at the mayhem that ovarian cancer wreaks and at the deficient care she received at a university hospital in another town  Do instances of medical negligence sometimes go unnoticed because patients are so debilitated that they cannot testify  especially if they are still in treatment  After diagnosis surgery and a round of chemotherapy my friend had developed a habit of talking with me on the phone every Sunday night  Because of her bounteous insight and candor it was a great pleasure for me even though we often discussed her depression  As the months passed she began suffering from abdominal pain constipation and rectal bleeding and her anxieties grew  A CT confirmed growing malignancies In The Ultimate Guide to Ovarian Cancer Dr Benedict B Benigno explains that when a patient develops a recurrence she has an overwhelming chance of developing yet another recurrence Its no wonder that with little hope of putting cancer in the past tense my friend was dismayed  The plight of this younger woman fills me with a loathing of cancer which has blighted my life  You think you were depressed before the disease sneers like an abusive parent Ill give you something more to get depressed about   Getting mad at cancer is pointless but now I have another target for my anger  the negligent care my friend received  Despite the abdominal pain constipation and rectal bleeding the gynecologic oncologist did not arrange a personal consultation until  days after the CT  When the meeting finally occurred the oncologist sketched three miserable options  chemotherapy with only a  percent chance of arresting the tumors a trial at a distant hospital for which in any event she might be ineligible or no treatment except palliative care     Back at home deliberating on these alternatives my friend happened to have an attack of vertigo unrelated to the cancer which landed her in the emergency room  Only because of this coincidence did a doctor there decide that she had to be hospitalized  Twentyfour hours later another doctor ordered an Xray that showed she had a bowel obstruction  Without surgery she would have died one or two days later from a perforated bowel     Horror enough surely but other calamities followed  After she had an emergency colostomy her husband was unable to find anyone in the hospital to help with the persistent problem of rectal bleeding  One doctor proposed taking her off heparin an anticoagulant routinely prescribed after surgery to stop clot formations  A nurse pointed out two problems  Through a dangerous oversight heparin had not actually been administered after the emergency operation  and it could not have caused the bleeding which had started before surgery Eventually the same doctor who had diagnosed the bowel obstruction decided the best course was to control the bleeding with localized radiation  As my colleagues husband a medical researcher put it in an email to me This is a good plan but the process by which the gynecological oncology team made the decision resembles brain surgery performed by middle school children If we cannot destroy cancer at least we should be able to put a stop to this sort of negligence  The word negligence derives from the Old French word for sloth or the Latin word for carelessness In tort law it signifies a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances  Not intentional harm just sloppy incompetence and inexcusable inattention  I cannot help wondering if such carelessness is a particular problem for people with metastatic disease and especially for women with gynecological cancers  These malignancies infest the abdomen and then the bowels not easy matters to discuss publicly  There is no detection tool and no treatment that saves the majority of those with these cancers from death  Do some doctors disengage when a disease is assumed to be incurable  when people need more not less assistance    Because I am all too aware of the diabolic tenacity of ovarian cancer I realize that it remains the villain in my friends case  Yet all the careless care  the day delay the oncologist missing clear signs of a bowel obstruction the mixup on the heparin  jeopardized her life and undoubtedly contributed to her deepening depression  Negligence cannot be said to have caused the harm that cancer wrought but it certainly compounded it     I pray that my friend will find a treatment that will allow her to continue living a comfortable life as long as possible Though I fear hospitalizations and medical interventions as she does this is the provisional decision I have made after three recurrences  But I am blessed with an oncologist who would never make me wait  days for an appointment   After I went on the web to order flowers in celebration of my friends going home from the hospital I was about to finalize the transaction when I noticed an error in the Send to box  The address I had typed was correct but the name of the recipient was my own
