    has often been associated with virility in the strictest sense of the word the ability to procreate And while you may not think of diet as a contributor to virility theres growing evidence that a fatty diet can hamper sperm production Researchers at Rigshospitalet Copenhagen University National Hospital found a link between a diet high in    found in foods like cheeses and    and shrinking sperm counts Between  and  the researchers collected selfreported diet information and semen samples from  Danish men all roughly  years old who were receiving military checkups Among the Danes in the study who consumed the most saturated fat there was a  percent   and compared to those who ate less saturated fat those who ate highfat diets had sperm counts that were  percent lower Additionally test subjects were broken down into four groups based on calorie intake from saturated fats and individual sperm production The findings published in   showed that sperm concentration and sperm counts dropped as fat intake increased Among men who got just over  percent of their calories from saturated fats sperm concentration was  million per milliliter of semen with a sperm count of  million thats compared to  million sperm per milliliter of semen and a sperm count of  million in those who had consumed  percent of calories from saturated fat The   says that a normal sperm concentration per milliliter of semen is anything above  million Of the Danish men who ate the least saturated fat  percent were below the WHO standard and among those who ate the most saturated fat  percent fell short We cannot say that it has a causal effect but I think other studies have shown that saturated fat intake has a connection to other problems and now also for sperm count Tina Jensen MD PhD lead study author from Rigshospitalets Department of Growth and Reproduction told   A healthy diet has previously been associated with improved sperm production and quality In    discovered a link between eating more whole grains and increased sperm concentration and motility and a link between eating more fruit and elevated sperm speed and agility Smoking and   are also key players in optimal sperm production Kick the nicotine to the curb and make sure to exercise regularly to maintain the goods And dont forget to   in general as they have also been linked to heart disease cancer and other conditions
