Not once in the years I cared for my mother did any of her physicians ask me how I was doing When was the last time I saw my own physician  Was I eating properly Sleeping enough Depressed  What did I do for fun  Frankly I didnt notice their apparent lack of concern nor had I considered it since  until hearing a recent talk by Dr Ronald D Adelman the cochief of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City  The subject was caregiver burden and how physicians ought to be attending to the invisible patient the one supporting an elderly family member with dementia or a heart condition or diabetes  or all of the above Given that there are currently  million people providing this kind of support to adults ages  and older and that without them the longterm care system would collapse youd think the proposition that somebody ought to be paying attention to them would be a nobrainer  Sad to say physicians often look right past caregivers Earlier this year Dr Adelman published   along with recommendations for addressing the burdens of this group   Among the risk factors for caregiver burden that should trigger assessment according to Dr Adelman are these The last two Dr Adelman noted are usually in evidence when one spouse must take responsibility for the other despite her own vulnerabilities In the JAMA article Dr Adelman cited the case of an yearold woman caring for her yearold husband who shot herself three times in an unsuccessful suicide attempt The most telling part of the incident was not the suicide attempt Dr Adelman said but the womans expressed relief at not being responsible for her husband while she was in the hospital He had refused nonfamily home care and two nearby daughters either failed to see what was going on or were steered away by their mother because she didnt want to be a burden to them  The womans caregiver burden would likely have been mitigated Dr Adelman said had she received adequate support from health professionals and not felt abandoned and unrecognized There should be no invisible patients in the caregiving dyad and if there are he added its the clinicians responsibility Among the sidebars in his JAMA article are a list of questions doctors should be asking as simple as How are you feeling and as complex as If anything should happen to you have you made arrangements for someone to take care of name patient here Dr Adelmans article also suggests using a tool kit to assess caregiver wellbeing long recommended by the    What left me scratching my head was how Dr Adelman could envision declining numbers of geriatricians taking on this enormous responsibility Members of this overworked specialty grow fewer every year We do have a crisis I recognize that he said in a telephone interview In a large teaching hospital like Weill Cornell there are social workers who assess caregivers run support groups for them and guide them through the maze of community resources and entitlements Dr Adelman has a geriatric psychiatrist on staff a specialty even rarer than his own  He also is able to leverage expertise among medical students and residents Even if they dont choose to become geriatricians all residents must spend a monthlong rotation on the inpatient geriatric floor learning the interdisciplinary skills and community resources this population needs  Even medical students are taught how to evaluate patients who come to appointments accompanied by an adult child a spouse an aide  or perhaps several extra people Those crowded appointments must be choreographed Dr Adelman said The doctor must spend time with the group and also with each person alone A caregiver needs privacy to say how desperate she has become These same medical students are taught how to manage discharge planning he said and interestingly to always take a call from a visiting nurse because it might be the most important call you get that day Doctors in private practice he said are accustomed to making referrals to medical specialists Now in our aging society they also must develop a network of nonmedical referrals community agencies visiting nurse services geriatric care managers elder care lawyers and the like Its harder but thats what you have to do and its all about who you know he said And what about hospitals without resources like Weill Cornells What are they supposed to do with desperate caregivers Hospitals with an abundance of avoidable and costly readmissions will be penalized under new federal regulations he noted That alone may be sufficient to persuade them to begin seeing invisible patients  Financial motivation is better than no motivation at all he said
