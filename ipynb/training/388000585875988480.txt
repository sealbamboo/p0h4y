I was visiting an assisted living facility recently with my sister whose disability made that a prudent choice when the marketing manager handed us a brochure It asked Did you know a life insurance policy can pay for longterm care expenses We did not know actually except that some policies have cash value But this was a different model A company called    and there are others  was offering to buy her insurance policy if she qualified pay the premiums to keep it in force and give her a chunk of the face value She would have money now to help pay the daunting  a month that assisted living costs in this part of New Jersey the company would make its profit later by collecting on the policy after her death In the interim when she applied for Medicaid her life insurance wouldnt be considered an asset she had to turn over nor would Medicaid try to collect the proceeds following her death as part of its asset recovery effort The policy wouldnt be her asset any more  it would belong to the company that bought it from her The life settlement industry as it calls itself points out that older people who bought life insurance policies decades earlier often allow them to lapse People get to a liquidity crunch and paying the premiums doesnt make sense so they just walk away said   a finance professor at Harvard Business School who has written about life settlement The problem with that This asset is valuable Mr Cohen said Youve paid for it  Except by dying its hard to unlock that value Some policies have no cash surrender value When they do it can be a small amount compared to the face value This is a more sensible solution Mr Cohen said How much your policy can fetch depends on a calculation  based on your age your medical history and your policy  of how long youre likely to live and therefore how much the company can eventually pocket Life Care Funding said Chris Orestis the chief executive pays older adults an average  to  percent of a policys face value At   a rival company a yearold with a couple of chronic conditions will probably get  to  percent said the chief executive Scott Page But conversion values are all over the map and could be somewhat higher or much lower The form of payment varies too Most life settlement companies just send a check to use for any purpose But Life Care Funding puts the money in an FDICinsured account used to send monthly payments directly to a longterm care provider a nursing home or assisted living facility an adult day program a home care agency a hospice an individual hired privately for home care You can switch from one provider to another as your needs change but you cant use the money for a vacation or blow it at a casino Is this a good move for seniors holding onto life insurance insurance policies The life settlement industry is still so tiny Life Care Funding converted roughly  policies last year and the Lifeline Program  to  that the usual consumer watchdogs dont seem to have a fix on it yet Its a niche product said Ryan Wilson senior strategic policy adviser at AARP We have more questions than answers at this point Settlement companies talk as though seniors abandon their life insurance in droves but data from   a research company shows that young people are much more likely to drop policies Among those over age  the annual lapse rate is  percent for whole life and  percent for universal life policies some of which results from people switching to different policies Over the years small percentages will add up but the idea that most seniors walk away from their policies emptyhanded appears exaggerated Meanwhile Texas has enacted legislation to protect consumers similar laws have been introduced in several other states Among other things Texas requires settlement companies to pay a  funeral benefit to the former policyholders family And if the company is still directly paying a longterm care provider when an individual dies the remainder of the converted amount will be paid to a designated beneficiary But with life settlement companies involved in drafting these laws its hard to feel entirely reassured For now whether to pursue this option depends on the situation An older person who needs to provide for a spouse or a dependent child after his death will want to hold onto a policy if at all possible Someone in very poor health who probably only needs a few months of longterm care might strike an arrangement with family members They scrape together enough for a few months care then get the full face value of the policy after the elders death It may make more sense to borrow the cash value rather than let the policy lapse Alternatively if a senior cant afford the premiums maybe family members will pay them for a year or two thus protecting their death benefits  Meanwhile insurance companies are busily inventing new products that might allow future buyers to access some death benefits while theyre alive rather like reverse mortgages It probably wont hurt to apply no charge and find out what a couple of life settlement companies will pay for your policy but then you have to get beyond the hype and look at your needs and goals said the LIMRA spokeswoman Catherine Theroux My sister doesnt need to decide yet Life settlements are meant for people in immediate financial need she can afford to hold off for a few years Its good to know that she has the option to convert her two policies to cash if she needs it Its hard at this point to know if she should
