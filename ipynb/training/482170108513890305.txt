In his  book The Emperor of All Maladies Dr Siddhartha Mukherjee lamented the gap between the new science going on in research laboratories and the old medicine most cancer patients receive Yet for almost two years I have benefited from the new medicine derived from the new science much to my surprise Every month I travel to the  in Indianapolis and return the empty packets of four weeks worth of experimental drugs along with a diary recording the dates and times I took them Periodic blood tests determine whether my body is tolerating the drug and whether the cancer has remained dormant  When I signed up for this clinical trial of a medication never before used on human beings I was informed that Phase  studies do not extend life They are designed to test dosage and toxicity Since August  however the pills as yet unnamed have been keeping my recurrent ovarian cancer at bay Because I have suffered through numerous chemotherapies I can testify to the relative benefits of these new targeted therapies The four pills I swallow every morning are immeasurably easier to accept than chemicals infused through the veins Taking an oral medicine at home is a lark compared to receiving chemotherapy intravenously in the hospital And the side effects are much milder Yes I have very little hair and I am fatigued but I dont have to travel  miles roundtrip to spend hours in an infusion room hooked up to toxins that zapped my brain my spirits and my feet which to this day remain numb and frozen Trained in the humanities I do not comprehend the genomics that make such a trial possible The meaning of the words associated with new research eludes me proteomics metabolomics DNA sequencing molecular modeling But my reading suggests that therapies aimed at specific gene mutations will  make treatments of the future more individual and less frightful than they have been As scientists locate the mutations that propel malignancies they have found and continue to search for mutation inhibitors that will reduce or kill off cancer without destroying healthy cells Are we witnessing a paradigm shift In fascinating detail Dr Mukherjee tells the story of two beneficial drug inventions Herceptin which shuts down the oncogene HER has significantly increased survival for women with an aggressive type of breast cancer Gleevec which inactivates the oncogene BcrAbl has become a lifesaver for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and for people dealing with gastrointestinal stromal tumors  We read about immunotherapy in the news daily A patients own immune cells T cells are removed genetically modified and reprogrammed to destroy tumors or a combination of drugs activates the immune system to attack tumors These experimental protocols have been successful with the most common form of cancer in children  acute lymphoblastic leukemia  and   with other types of cancer Like many people I am concerned that only a small percentage of trials results in protocols more effective than what is already available And the prices of newly marketed therapies seem outrageous Some new drugs blight the end of life with their miserable side effects or cause secondary cancers Even when catastrophic consequences do not occur hideously ingenious malignancies can and often do become resistant to sophisticated interventions  Given all these apprehensions imagine my growing astonishment as the experimental drug in my trial continues to keep me in remission The type of drug I am taking called a   has been so successful that my Phase  study led rapidly to a Phase  study that will include women with metastatic breast cancer and men with prostate cancer Nor is my trial unique The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing olaparib another oral PARP inhibitor for ovarian cancer patients Although the FDA has not approved a new ovarian cancer drug for decades I find myself hoping that we are on the brink of a breakthrough especially if progressionfree survival disease control remission  not just overall survival longevity   can be taken into account  When recorded in a scientific study the months of extended life may seem trivial but the new pills offer me the gift of more time that I am well enough to relish I count the joys I have experienced since I started the trial one daughters wedding the birth of a grandson a family reunion the return to town of a stepdaughter and the writing of this blog  With no illusions about a cure I nevertheless marvel that I have the strength to make the bed without collapsing between the top and bottom sheets With a targeted therapy I can delight daily in a cherished husband whose caregiving burdens have not lifted but have lightened considerably And then regardless of my qualms I am sustained by the hope that my participation in research might mean that future patients could live longer and dare I say it happier lives with cancer
