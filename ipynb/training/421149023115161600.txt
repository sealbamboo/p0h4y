Being a successful shorttrack speedskater is no easy feat Members of the United States team follow a grueling schedule that involves up to eight hours of training six days a week  They lift weights they run and they cycle And they practice racing around a rink at  miles an hour on two razorsharp blades We asked Eddy Alvarez who will be competing in his first Olympics in Sochi Russia in February to take us through a speedskaters workout  Nicknamed Eddy the Jet Mr Alvarez  started rollerskating as a child while growing up in Miami then transitioned to ice He has won national and World Cup medals in speedskating But his career was nearly derailed two years ago by devastating knee injuries which required surgery that left him bedridden for a month His doctor told him he might never skate again But Mr Alvarez bounced back and he is now considered a top prospect heading into the Olympics Recently we caught up with him at the Olympic Oval training facility in Salt Lake City to talk about how he trains six to eight hours a day to prepare for a second race how a dino disc helps prevent injuries and why he is superstitious about what he eats before a competition Here is an edited version of our conversation How long have you been skating  Ive been skating since I was  I used to speedskate on inline skates when I was little down in South Beach I was kind of a sidestreet attraction I was even sponsored by a skate shop in Miami I would wear their logo and jump over boxes and skate around on the streets of South Beach  How did you get into speedskating on ice Ice was introduced to me at the age of  I still remember the first time I tried it I cant tell you exactly where it was but I remember the feeling It was quite a rush for me as a yearold gliding and going fast  What are some of the physical demands of the sport The positions that were in on the ice are honestly excruciating We basically skate in a squat position but what we try to do is become a compact ball If you watch us skate youll that see our backs are curved When people ask me how it feels the best way I can describe it is to say go and do a wallsit for  minutes and then stand up Thats how it feels  What is a typical day like Im in two places every day Im either at the Oval training or Im at my house sleeping I know itll be worth it in the end but I really hope I dont miss my fun years  What are some of your greatest achievements in skating so far Its been a very long road But the biggest accomplishment that Ive had would be coming back from my injury It was the hardest thing Ive ever had to face  Can you tell us about your injury comeback I always had knee issues growing up We thought it was because I grew very fast very late But during the  season it got to a point where I couldnt finish workouts I would come home and cry But I would tell myself to push through it because it was the Olympic season and I had nothing to lose So I overdid it I fell short of the  Games and didnt make the team and then I finally went to get my knees checked I got an ultrasound and it turned out that I had torn the patella tendons in my knees I had a total of  tears in both knees The doctor was impressed that I was even able to be in skating condition because my patella tendons were like strings  dangling strings basically  Can you tell us about the physical preparation that goes into the sport  We put in a lot of hours We train six to eight hours a day to go race for  seconds The reason we train this much is so our bodies can recover in between rounds of racing In competitions we usually skate six or eight rounds in a day and its usually  to  minutes of rest and then youre back at it again It takes a toll on our bodies Honestly I always get sick after a competition Thats how much I put my body through Unorthodox is the best word to describe our training and our sport  Does it require some muscles more than others Our sport is very lowerbody dominant The less weight you carry in your upper body the easier it is Unfortunately I carry a little more than everyone else because I have a baseball background The muscles in my upper body are a little different than the typical short tracker  It sounds like injuries are a big concern Injuries are huge for us We are hitting speeds of roughly  miles per hour and theres falls and crashes The training takes a toll on our knees our backs and our hamstrings At the stage at which we compete I dont think theres an athlete thats going to be  percent physically with no injuries We train our bodies every day and its just something that we have to accept  Are there exercises you do to address these issues We do extra training on the side to strengthen our weaknesses I like to do exercises on something that we call a dino disc Its a little rubber disc that has air in it and when you step on it its like a balance tool I work a lot with that to strengthen all the little muscles that we dont have the opportunity to strengthen and activate while we skate We also do a lot of rubberband exercises at the beginning of the season to strengthen the knees and the muscles around them Then we pray that it holds up throughout the season  What are some of your favorite land exercises We do a lot of jumping exercises and we do things to develop our accuracy and our foot speed Were trying to simulate what we do on the ice So youll find us doing exercises like dry skating which is basically just straightaway pushes on land to simulate the lactic acid that we build in our legs And we do something called turnbelt exercises where they strap a long belt around your waist that looks like a seatbelt and then you have someone else holding the belt as youre simulating the lean that we have on the ice What about cardio We do a lot of cycling and running We run or bike for  minutes to an hour two to three days a week and during the summer we do fourhour bike rides twice a week We ride all the mountains out here in Salt Lake City What is your approach to diet I try to cook and eat at home as much as possible so I can control the amount and type of oils I eat One thing I like to use is coconut oil Im also a big fan of juicing vegetables I absolutely hate eating them So I stick them in a juicer with some fruit like an apple to sweeten it up and I chug it  Some days we just have to eat and eat and eat to be able to perform We dont want to sell ourselves short by not eating enough We slice through body fat and we have to fuel our bodies Youre not going to find me at McDonalds or Wendys But I like to eat pasta and bread and carbs  Are there certain foods you like to eat before a race or training I have a superstition I dont like to eat red meat before a competition When I was little I was always told that red meat is hard to process and sits in your stomach So during competitions I only eat chicken I have this thought that the red meat will just sit in my stomach and make me heavier So I eat chicken during competitions and some white rice and pasta  What will it mean to you to compete in Sochi I dream about standing on that podium winning a medal It would be such an accomplishment for me because of everything I had to go through After my surgery I went through depression I wasnt on the ice for  months Its been a long road for me and it would mean a lot for my family Theyve been there every step of the way I owe it all to them and if I succeed the satisfaction of them being happy is the most important thing in the world to me
