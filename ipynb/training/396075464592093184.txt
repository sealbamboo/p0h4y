Trying to quantify your aerobic fitness is a daunting task It usually requires access to an exercisephysiology lab But researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim have developed a remarkably lowtech means of precisely assessing aerobic fitness and estimating your fitness age or how well your body functions physically relative to how well it should work given your age The researchers evaluated almost  Norwegians between the ages of  and  using mobile labs They took about a dozen measurements including height body mass index resting heart rate HDL and total cholesterol levels Each person also filled out a lengthy lifestyle questionnaire Finally each volunteer ran to the point of exhaustion on a treadmill to pinpoint his or her peak oxygen intake VO max or how well the body delivers oxygen to its cells VO max has been shown in largescale studies to closely correlate with significantly augmented life spans even among the elderly or overweight In other words VO max can indicate fitness age In order to figure out how to estimate VO max without a treadmill the scientists combed through the results to determine which of the data points were most useful You might expect that the most taxing physical tests would yield the most reliable results Instead the researchers found that putting just five measurements  waist circumference resting heart rate frequency and intensity of exercise age and sex  into an algorithm allowed them to predict a persons VO max with noteworthy accuracy according to their study   The researchers used the data set to tabulate the typical desirable VO max for a healthy person at every age from  to  creating specific parameters for fitness age The concept is simple enough explains Ulrik Wisloff the director of the K G Jebsen Center of Exercise in Medicine at the Norwegian University and the senior author of the study A yearold man or woman who has the peak oxygen uptake of a yearold has a fitness age of  he says He has seen just this combination during his research The researchers have used all of this data to create an   that allows people to determine their VO max without going to a lab Youll need your waist measurement and your resting heart rate To determine it sit quietly for  minutes and check your pulse count for  seconds double the number and you have your resting heart rate Plug these numbers along with your age sex and frequency and intensity of exercise into the calculator and youll learn your fitness age The results can be sobering A yearold man for instance who exercises moderately a few times a week sports a inch waist and a resting heart rate of   not atypical values for healthy middleaged men  will have a fitness age of  Thankfully unwanted fitness years unlike the chronological kind can be erased Dr Wisloff says Exercise more frequently or more intensely Then replug your numbers and exult as your age declines A youthful fitness age Dr Wisloff says is the single best predictor of current and future health
