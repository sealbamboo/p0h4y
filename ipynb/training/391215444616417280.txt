The good news is that after two decades of breast cancer being on the rise numbers have been declining in recent years Still women in the United States have a   chance of developing breast cancer in their lifetime according to the ACS so its not surprising experts are searching for more ways to keep them alive   Not all oncologists embrace the link between nutrition and longevity citing insufficient evidence But doctors who specialize in nutrition say there are certain foods women can include in an overall healthy diet to increase their chance of survival  Dr Barry Boyd creator of the integrative medicine program at Greenwich HospitalYale Health Systems and director of nutritional oncology says women should no longer be afraid to consume soy   It was feared that components of soy had estrogenlike properties that influenced the growth of breast cancer cells Boyd said Science has not only proved an absence of risk theres also a possible benefit  Boyd points to   in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition that explored soy intake in the United States and China among  women after breast cancer diagnosis The consumption of isoflavones commonly found in soybeans produced a statistically significant reduced risk of recurrence among breast cancer survivors diagnosed with invasive breast cancer according to researchers      by the Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention produced similar results In this analysis more than  breast cancer patients were studied   Researchers concluded that eating soy after diagnosis was associated with a reduced mortality risk and fewer recurrences of the disease  The American Cancer Society is more cautious in its   noting that while soy is good source of alternative protein women with breast cancer should take in only moderate amounts and not ingest soycontaining pills powders or supplements containing high amounts of isoflavones       Eating foods rich in carotenoids has been linked to a reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence Carotenoids are the natural pigments found in yellow and orange foods such as carrots sweet potatoes and squash and dark leafy greens such as kale spinach and Swiss chard   In a   published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers  Prevention increased consumption of carotenoids was associated with greater likelihood of breast cancerfree survival The report based its findings in part on the Womens Healthy Eating and Living Study a National Institutes of Healthfunded investigation   To increase the consumption of carotenoids Dr Mitchell Gaynor advises his breast cancer patients to eat more cruciferous vegetables Gaynor founder of Gaynor Integrative Oncology says his reasoning is simple We understand cancer quite differently today than we did when President Nixon declared a war on cancer in the s We know now that certain foods make your body inhospitable for cancer cells to thrive The goal is to keep cancer cells dormant and what you eat makes a difference    Examples of cruciferous vegetables include broccoli kale cabbage and cauliflower   Eating fish high in omega fatty acids has also been linked to an improved breast cancer prognosis Fish in this category include salmon haddock cod halibut and sardines A   showed that the consumption of EPA and DHA fatty acids from fish inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells and reduces the progression of breast tumors  Women who were diagnosed and treated for early stage breast cancer  and given higher levels of EPA and DHA  had an approximate  reduced risk of recurrence  Its important to note that the benefit corresponded only to the consumption of fish not fish oil supplements  Gaynor says that eating fish rich in omega fatty acids is also healthful because it supports proper immune function and lowers a womans risk of heart disease and diabetes  The American Cancer Society warns against eating too many of these fatty foods Diets high in fat tend to be high in calories and may contribute to obesity which in turn is linked with an increased risk of several types of cancer  Women who consume a highfiber diet probably boost their life expectancy    A highfiber diet is associated with lower overall mortality in breast cancer patients said Dr Keith Block medicalscientific director at the Block Center for Integrative Cancer Treatment in Skokie Illinois    Block says fiber is beneficial because it can help women control their appetite and may decrease the number of calories they consume Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight particularly after menopause is widely viewed as one factor that influences survival   Which is why Estabrook at the Comprehensive Breast Center is offering that nutrition class in the first place   When you look at cancers most are caused by weight gain she said  The fatter you are the more estrogen circulates in your body and when theres more estrogen the risk of breast disease increases   But cancer survival is not just about eating one kind of fruit or vegetable  Its about making the right lifestyle choices including exercise  Diet is one part of a larger picture
