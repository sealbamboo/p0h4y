Oops Someone dropped lime sherbet on the desert  and its melting Whos going to clean this up Nobody Because this  believe it or not  is a plant It may look like a glob of goo but its not at all gooey Its solid to the touch  so solid that a man can lie on top of it and not sink in not even a little What kind of plant is this In Spanish its called   and its a member of the   family which makes it a cousin to parsley carrots and fennel But being a desert plant high up in Chiles extraordinarily dry Atacama it grows very very slowly  a little over a centimeter a year Think about that If you asked one of these plants What did you do during the th century it would answer I grew a meter bigger At that rate plants rising to shoulder height covering yards of ground lump after lump must be really really old In fact some of them are older than the   of California older than towering   In Chile many of them go back  years  well before the   They look like green giftwrapping One imagines that they are moldlike wrapping themselves around boulders But thats wrong The truth is much weirder That hard surface is actually a dense collection of tens of thousands of flowering buds at the ends of long stems so densely packed they create a compact surface The plant is very very dry and makes for great kindling As the Bolivian guide explains in the video below the plant can be found throughout the Andes llareta is such good fuel that even though its very ancient people regularly use it to start campfires and even back in the day to run locomotives Thats  to  years of captured sunshine thrown into a steam engine for a quick ride  Im trying not to think about that Its also good for muscle pain The best thing about llareta is what it looks like Its like nothing else You climb  to  feet up into the Andes there are boulders loose rocks jagged edges all about and suddenly you come upon this softlooking round thing that resembles a limegreen beach ball and you think What   this When artistphotographer   saw her first llareta she apparently did a little happy dance As she writes in   Every once in a while you see something so ludicrously beautiful that all you can do is laugh Me too
