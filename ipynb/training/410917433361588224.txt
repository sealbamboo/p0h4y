Concussions have deservedly gotten most of the attention in efforts to reduce the risk of head injuries in sports But scientists increasingly think that hits too small to cause  also affect the brain and that those effects add up And it looks like some athletes may be more vulnerable than others Maybe we should be asking a different question says   chair of the department of psychiatry at the Indiana University School of Medicine Not Is hitting your head bad but for whom its bad To figure that out McAllister and colleagues put sensors in the helmets of varsity football and hockey players at Dartmouth University to measure when and how hard they got hit over the course of a season They also had the athletes take cognitive tests at the beginning and end of the season along with athletes in noncontact sports like Nordic skiing and track and field They didnt find the dramatic differences in brain performance at the end of the season that they were expecting in the contactsport players But when they looked at the athletes who didnt do well on the cognitive tests at the end of the season more of them were playing contact sports All told  percent of the  football and ice hockey players scored  standard deviations lower than would be expected compared to  percent of the  athletes in noncontact sports That group of contactsport athletes also had more changes in their brains white matter in MRI scansThe more often they got hit and the more intense the hits the more the white matter changed The study was published online Wednesday in the journal   White matter is the brains communications network and changes in white matter are a hallmark of brain injury But the changes seen here were subtle and the study cant prove that those changes came as a result of hits This may even end up being good news for contact sports players McAllister speculates because at the beginning of the season their brains were looking pretty good And thats in people who had been playing these sports for years Its sort of reassuring he told Shots But we dont know if these kinds of changes are longlasting and progressive or whether its just a subset of people who might be vulnerable to these repetitive impacts If that turns out to be true and if researchers could figure out a way to identify people whose brains are more vulnerable then perhaps that could be factored in when children choose sports
