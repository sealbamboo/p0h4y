Most women know all too well the pain and discomfort of a urinary tract infection They also know theyll probably have to trek to the doctor for a urine analysis so they can get a prescription for antibiotics Surely theres got to be a better way The first step for women with a history of   may be skipping a standard test isnt that good at spotting bladder infections anyway Fewer tests should be done says   a professor of medicine at The University of Maryland School of Medicine who wasnt involved in the study Its even a poorer test than we thought Urinary tract infections lead to  million doctor visits a year according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention That adds up to plenty of expense and inconvenience that in many cases may not be worth the trouble Doctors have two choices for urine tests the dipstick test which gives nearinstant results and is useful for ruling out infection and the urine culture That is done in a lab and takes one to three days The urine culture formally called a midstream urine culture accurately identified most women who had bladder infections with   bacteria which cause at least threequarters of infections the study found But the test missed women who had infections with other bacteria or had low levels of   that were still enough to make the women sick Many labs ignore those lowlevel tests says   a professor at the University of Miami School of Medicine who led the study If doctors are going to do urine cultures they should at least insist that labs look for low levels of   Hooten says He told Shots that he would say Look guys low colony counts of   are meaningful dont discard those results The   in the   The study involved  women aged  to  and got samples both from the midstream test and by putting a catheter in the bladder When comparing those samples something strange showed up surprising the doctors About onequarter of the women had no bacteria at all in the bladder even though they had   And quite a few of those women did have lots of bacteria in their midstream test We would have assumed that the reason you had high numbers in the midstream culture is because they had high numbers in the bladder says Donnenberg who wrote an   accompanying the study Maybe those women have an infection of the urethra rather than the bladder Donnenberg told Shots or maybe theres something else going on that the doctors werent aware of The doctors really dont know I dont know if theyre benefiting from treatment because they really have bacterial urethritis or if theyre being exposed unnecessarily to antibiotics Donnenberg says OK this is all very interesting but how is it going to help a woman who thinks she probably has a UTI Like uh right now Unfortunately doctors dont have a more accurate test to replace the urine culture As a result doctors have become increasingly comfortable with prescribing antibiotics without doing a urine culture Donnenberg says and this study supports doing that for healthy female patients If their physician doesnt do cultures that should not make them uneasy Going for a urine culture is often a good idea the first time a woman has UTI symptoms Donnenberg says to make sure the symptoms arent caused by the sexually transmitted diseases   or   instead But once a woman knows its a UTI because shes had a few calling up the doctor and saying I have another one can I have a prescription is fine
