Labor Day seemed as good a day as any to track a step walk I didnt want to accumulate steps all day instead I wanted to see where  steps would take me So sunscreen applied Fitbit attached to my pants iPhone and notebook in hand to document my journey I set out My Los Angeles is an urban and diverse section of MidCity I drive and jog and walk the streets daily but one of the revelations of my step project was how much I could learn and how much charmed me anew when I was paying attention I walked north on my street to Pico Boulevard where the auto body shops are being slightly edged out by new businesses and where marijuana emporiums can feel like modernday momandpop shops I continued north to Olympic Boulevard where with  steps logged I turned east walking at the southern edge of some of the citys loveliest residential neighborhoods Its easy to spot bougainvillea all over Los Angeles but my walk revealed dozens of other varieties of flowers in frontyards I noticed lots of Beware of dog signs without hearing any barking Maybe the sign is enough I walked through the spray of a couple of sprinklers  excellent relief on a humid day Tagging is everywhere and not very pretty street art is less common and more amusing There were few people out on Olympic some teens waiting for a bus a couple of bikers I noticed the signs that charmed me as a new Angeleno the ones with the dolphin painted in blue that forbid dumping After I passed a series of small apartment buildings synagogues and the like I reached North La Brea Avenue  steps in The taco stand that often had long lines wasnt there but I learned from a sign that I was standing in Sycamore Square Who knew I wasnt sure how far I needed to go for a step stroll but the distance was less than I had imagined There was no chance that Id get to Koreatown which starts around Crenshaw Boulevard At Highland Avenue and Olympic Id already walked  steps It was there that I stopped to admire a family favorite an aluminumclad modern house on the northeastern corner A few blocks farther east I passed a huge fixer thats for sale It was a wreck even the pool had bougainvillea growing in it As I walked I was struck by the many ways people hide their homes  the fences shrubs trees twisted ivies concrete walls and other blockades on the other hand the spare beauty of a skyhigh palm against the clear blue sky was indelible Im in decent shape so this walk wasnt tough A route that includes a coffee shop bus benches or a friends home for a brief visit would make it doable for most people Halfway actually  steps turned out to be the intersection of Olympic and Rimpau boulevards where Los Angeles High Home of the Romans takes up a block On a school wall I spied a piece of street art with the slogan Youre never too young to dream big I noticed a few Title IX signs just at the time Diana Nyad was swimming to Florida and into the record books  she was never too old to dream big I walked south back to Pico to finish my square hitting  steps as I turned west again breezing by all the evidence needed to know this is a city of jumbled origins I passed amid upholsterers barbershops and pot stores the busy Western Glatt Kosher Market the Pico Maternity Clinic with the sign   Roscoes Chicken  Waffles with a long waiting line a Latin drumming studio and Wi Jammin Caribbean Cafe I hit  steps at Burnside Avenue and Pico five blocks from home When I finished my Fitbit said Id gone  miles A good Labor Day
