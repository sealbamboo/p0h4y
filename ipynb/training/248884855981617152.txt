Theres some big news out today about one of the most sensitive issues in medicine Whos next in line for a transplant The   or UNOS a nonprofit in charge of distributing organs wants to revamp the system for distributing the most soughtafter organ  kidneys  for the first time in  years Were now faced with very long waiting times for kidney transplants that are worse in certain areas of the country than others says   of Northwestern University who chaired the UNOS committee that developed the proposal The number of Americans waiting for organ transplants has risen dramatically More than  are now on the list including  who are waiting for kidneys Right now kidneys are given out mostly on a kind of firstcome firstserved basis  those who have been waiting the longest tend to get first dibs whenever a kidney becomes available But that can create problems Friedewald says We arent maximizing the life benefit from the existing kidney transplants that are available out there he says Thats because kidneys from young healthy people can end up in elderly frail people and vice versa relatively young otherwise healthy recipients get kidneys from sicker older donors We dont want to necessarily give a kidney that may last  years to someone who is expected to live five more years We think we can match people in a better way to maximize the outcome from each kidney Friedewald says So UNOS is proposing several significant changes One of the big ones is this The  percent of kidneys that would be expected to last the longest would go to the  percent of recipients expected to get the most years out of each organ This has several benefits Friedewald says No  is we realize many more life years lived with each kidney transplant As those people can live longer and longer with those transplants But also and probably more importantly we decrease the number of people who then have a kidney fail while they are still alive and need to return to the wait list That Friedewald says would make the kidneys that are available for transplantation end up saving a lot more lives The proposed changes are being welcomed by some transplant experts I think trying to favor Save the most lives save the most years of life makes good ethical sense says   a bioethicist at New York University It makes make good medical sense But not everyone agrees Some transplant specialists and bioethicists say the changes raise a lot of concerns One worry is the formulas the network would use to decide which organs and which recipients are in that  percent The score they use is going to be wrong upwards of  to  percent of the time which is pretty close to a coin flip says   a kidney transplant specialist at the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte NC Others fear the changes could end up discriminating against some patients Age is one major factor being used to determine who makes the cut for the  percent best kidneys That means older people even those just middleaged could lose out So its not just that the yearold needs a really great kidney So does the yearold So does the yearold right says   a bioethicist at the University of Chicago Maybe the yearold doesnt need a kidney thats going to go  years But you havent given an ethical justification for why youre going to create this top  percent Friedewald defends the new system saying the formulas have been tested extensively UNOS also plans to propose other changes that would make the system much more efficient and much fairer Whoevers right many experts say the debate over kidney transplants is a harbinger for other similar debates that are coming as the population ages and the pressure to restrain costs intensifies The questions about what to do with kidneys are not unique at all I think to the kidney situation says Caplan Its a canary in the cave of thinking about rationing challenges that are certainly coming down the road UNOS plans to take public comment on its proposal for three months before sending a final proposal to its board for approval The soonest the new system could go in effect is sometime next year
