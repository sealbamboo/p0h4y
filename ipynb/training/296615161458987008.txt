Why do we love muffins? Easy…they're yummy, easy to make, portable, and endlessly adaptable to taste and nutrition preferences. But watch out! Store-bought muffins (even healthy-sounding versions like Starbucks Zucchini Walnut Muffin) can pack more fat and calories than a cupcake! The solution: Make your own. These baked treats are all relatively low in fat and calories, and most are packed with fresh fruit, fiber, and good-for-you fats. So go ahead…indulge your muffin cravings, guilt-free!. Any recipe with quinoa is bound to be good for you. This humble grain is a complete protein, which means it contains all nine essential amino acids, the body's building blocks for everything from hormones to enzymes. The muffins themselves are rich and flavorful, with only 118 calories per serving..
