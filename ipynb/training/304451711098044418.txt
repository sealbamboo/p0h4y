Youre in a meeting at work driving or relaxing at home and you just think about yawning  the next thing you know your mouth is stretching wide youre inhaling deeply and you dont even really know why Has reading this made you yawn yet If the answers yes its not because this article is boring you we hope Scientists know that the simple act of thinking about yawning can trigger the part of the brain the hypothalamus that trips this involuntary response That much we know But exactly why adult humans babies even fetuses and most animals yawn is still a subject of much scientific debate According to University of Geneva researcher Adrian G Guggisberg MD who wrote a recent article about yawning in the journal   yawning has been a subject of speculation for centuries In the fourth century BC Hippocrates theorized that humans yawned to get rid of bad air and increase good air in the body  or as we would say now Hippocrates believed we yawn to increase the flow of oxygen to the brain But unfortunately for Hippocrates Guggisberg wrote most scientists agree that this idea hasnt held up under the weight of modern research For example you dont yawn more when you exercise than at any other time and if yawning existed to increase oxygen flow you would So what really causes yawning and makes it so infectious Below we rounded up a few of the top theories Just as theres no clear answer to the question of why we yawn theres no clear explanation for why yawns are contagious A University of Connecticut study found that   which is why we yawn when others do   seems to be a primal instinct that binds us together Molly Helt a doctoral student who conducted the study told Discovery News Yawning may be part of that According to Helts research children under age  appear to be immune to contagious yawning because their brains are simply not yet sophisticated enough to pick up on the social bonding cue though they still experience spontaneous yawning Similarly researchers found that children living with disorders on the autism spectrum were significantly less likely to catch contagious yawns than typically developing kids because autistic children arent picking on the social cues In Helts study children with the most severe cases of autism never yawned contagiously Because yawning is thought to be linked to our capacity for empathy you might think that yawns are only contagious for humans Not so say researchers at Kyoto University in Japan who found that chimpanzees and some baboons also experience contagious yawning
