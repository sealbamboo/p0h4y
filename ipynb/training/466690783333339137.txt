New requirements that Medicare start paying for lung cancer screening for heavy smokers will probably raise costs by about  a month for everybody enrolled in the program researchers projected in a new study The new analysis seeks to put a price tag on a program that cancer experts say could save lives by catching lung cancer at a stage when it would still be treatable Studies have only recently shown that new lowdose computed tomography CT scans can accurately detect early stage lung cancer If we can diagnose lung cancers at an earlier stage patients can be treated far more effectively and survival prognosis is much better said Joshua Roth of the Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center in Seattle who led the study If half the patients who are given the chance to get screening did so Roths calculations project that  million more people would be screened with  cases of lung cancer detected Currently only  percent of lung cancers are caught at the earliest stage before they have spread and when they can still be cured Under the projection  percent would be caught We assume that over five years  percent of highrisk patients would be offered screening each year Roth told reporters That would cost Medicare  billion over five years when the costs of screening and treating the patients are included Roth calculated in a study to be presented next month at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology It works out to an increase of  a month per Medicare beneficiary The US Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF   who are at least    to check for lung cancer The recommendation means that Medicare and health insurers must pay for the screening without charging patients The   which costs  may prevent as many as  percent of future deaths from lung cancer Lung cancer is so deadly because it doesnt start causing symptoms until its already spread It kills nearly  people a year according to the American Cancer Society An early study by a team at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center found that lung cancer screening could add  to  billion in yearly national health care spending The researchers calculated that the price of preventing one lung cancer death was
