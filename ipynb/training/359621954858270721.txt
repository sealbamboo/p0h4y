A pediatrician who spent years defending childhood vaccines against the likes of actressactivist Jenny McCarthy has launched an assault on megavitamins and dietary supplements If you take large quantities of vitamin A vtamin E beta carotene or selenium you increase your risk of   risk of heart disease and you could   says   a researcher at The Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia Many large studies in recent years have shown that vitamins and dietary supplements rarely help and often hurt Offit says Yet a huge number of people still believe that these products will improve their health So Offit says he decided to challenge the false beliefs of the church of vitamins and supplements Offit made the remarks during an appearance in Washington DC Monday to promote his latest     Offit an infectious disease specialist and the coinventor of a rotavirus vaccine is best known for publicly challenging groups that claim there is a link between childhood vaccines and autism That effort often pitted him against actress Jenny McCarthy who   for antivaccine groups One big problem with dietary supplements is a  law that   from the tighter scrutiny the FDA applies to its regulation of medicines Offit says So the makers of a garlic supplement can say that it supports cardiovascular health even though a government study found that garlic supplements didnt lower cholesterol Meanwhile Offit says patients clearly benefit from a range of FDAapproved statin drugs that actually do what garlic supplements claim to do Dietary supplements are often advertised as natural Offit says even though that term can be misleading For example almonds are a natural source of vitamin E But you would have to eat  pounds of almonds to get the amount of vitamin E in a single capsule sold by one supplement maker Offit says So how is this a natural thing to do Offit says doctors are partly to blame for the growing popularity of highdose vitamins and other dietary supplements Rather than pushing back against patients who want to take them he says doctors have acted like waiters at a restaurant simply asking What would you like Many hospitals also include unproved dietary supplements in their list of medicines available to patients Offit says But he says his own institution The Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia plans to remove nearly all supplements from its list later this month Offit says his attack on dietary supplements has generated a steady stream of hate mail But he says its not as harsh as the hate mail he used to get from people who believe vaccines cause autism This is more Im a liar and a shill for the pharmaceutical industry  he says not Youre going to hell  Offit has some strong defenders though including former President Jimmy Carter and Carters wife Rosalynn They sat in the front row at Offits appearance in DC And during a question and answer session the former president rose to tell Offit Youve been a hero around our house for a long time
