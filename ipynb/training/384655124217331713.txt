I dont have a neck I dont have a lap  I look like a swollen pig said Trotter now  years old He thought Why hasnt someone just slapped me with something heavy and said Youre going to die  you look awful   At first the father of five in Wisconsin felt overwhelmed with anger and shame He wanted his friend to take down the picture But when he cooled off he knew it was his own responsibility to make a change  Trotter the manager of payment operations for a regional health plan had made a career of managing processes policies and procedures His job involved thinking about how employees could do things better and more cost effectively based on data and measurable results   He decided to apply those management concepts to his weight loss He kept a journal tracking what worked for him and by the end of three years he had lost  pounds Midway through he began to chronicle his journey on the blog   and is currently trying to turn it into a book   Heres how Trotter lost the weight    As Trotter first started his weightloss quest he joined a program that provided protein shakes and premade meals but quickly realized I didnt have the money or the desire to eat out of a box my entire life He read psychological journals fitness blogs and books about weight loss to learn the underlying causes of obesity and proven strategies that worked for other people One book was Fit to Lead which looks at the connection between fitness and productivity   Learning how depression and obesity may affect each other made Trotter serious about losing weight and getting help Counseling helped him confront past disappointments make peace with the fact that he hadnt fulfilled his dream of becoming an opera singer and find healthier things to do when he felt stressed or upset  I really didnt like who I had become I had to learn how to fall in love with that person again he said I wrote down all the things I didnt like about myself and I wrote all the things I liked  I had to learn how to like that person and want to do things to stop abusing that person   That picture from New Years Eve that made him sick He put it up all over his house laid a copy on the passenger seat of his car and made it the home screen on his phone He showed the photo to anyone who would listen as a way of keeping himself accountable as he lost weight  I looked for opportunities to talk about it to share my story with other people Thats my reminder all the time Thats me  thats who I was  and I dont ever want to go back there  Trotter who spends a lot of time on the road realized that hed be more mindful about his food purchases if he stopped using plastic He put himself on daily cash rations   for breakfast and lunch  and found he was a lot more likely to buy food that was truly fuel instead of junk   After a hunting trip with some buddies it dawned on him that snow pants boots and warm socks made it a lot more enjoyable to stay outside even in the cold Wisconsin winter When he got home he took the family shopping for sweaters warm gloves and other gear so they could spend more time outside and less time watching movie marathons and eating popcorn  I knew we were finally doing it right when someone asked me about a popular TV show and I had no idea what they were talking about      Trotter initially was too embarrassed about his body to go to the gym and when he did he found his stomach was so large that it physically hurt to use the machines But there were lots of exercises he could do at home Stair pushups jumping jacks deep knee bends situps and other sweatbreaking routines Now that hes thinner he uses the gym at his office about three times a week but still does calisthenics every day at home  He only ate while sitting at the table had a salad before each meal and chewed each bite at least  times Trotter learned another trick to curb his cravings Brushing his teeth right afterward when he was most likely to long for a honey bun  his Achilles heel  Trust me when I tell you honey buns and Colgate dont mix he said    After several months of avoiding all the foods that were bad for him Trotter said he realized he was obsessed about honey buns cheese puffs and all the willpowerbusting snacks he couldnt have Once he allowed himself cheat days the cravings went away He is careful about what he eats most of the time and in fact he earned the nickname Temple because he was always talking about treating his body like a temple  Still he allows himself one special meal a week He also practices restraint by putting cheese puffs in a tea cup for portion control or eating half a candy bar and wrapping up the rest for another time  Trotters openness about his journey has inspired a lot of people in his life including his boss Tami Renz who hired him when he was halfway through his weight loss She herself has battled the bulge and lost  pounds  Weve talked about recipes that eliminate fat or spices that you can add that arent salt Renz said I have a tendency to beat myself up if I stepped backwards and he says Its a new day   Trotters friend Jeremy Swanson who posted that New Years Eve picture on Facebook says he never thought of Trotter as obese But hes not surprised that Trotter succeeded in his transformation  Hes definitely faced many challenges in his life since Ive known him Ive watched him own his own business and the challenge that presents  having that many mouths to feed on a daily basis having to pay all those bills and he makes it happen Swanson said I knew there would be results Theres no doubt that he would conquer it Since his initial pound weight loss Trotter says he put on about  pounds of muscle Now at  feet tall and  pounds with a inch waist he knows he still has some work to do but is much happier about how he looks and feels He knew he had turned a corner when he wrote in his journal a year ago  pm Really craving a honey bun   pm Honey buns are overrated  He hasnt had a honey bun since For more of Trotters tips
