Minnesota is expected to pick a new lead technology contractor for its health insurance marketplace in the coming weeks The state has been working hard to improve its website but in its first few months   made it difficult if not impossible to use Tom Baden the states lead information technology expert remembers when the fear hit him It was the end of July only two months before the exchange called MNsure had to go up Baden and his team were still waiting for a key piece of software from a vendor It being so close to Oct  and looking at our ability to get it in get it installed test it and go live  if there was a moment where I didnt sleep a wink that night that was my night he recalls On Oct  MNsure did go live but many consumers   the site would throw them off or lock up Becky Fink was trained to help others enroll on MNsure But because of bureaucratic delays she didnt receive MNsures permission to sign people up until December So the first day she could she made appointments with five people It never worked for me she says I tried many times many times After trying for about  hours four of them still couldnt sign up It was hard to know that I had done my best and gone through the training and always read what I was supposed to read and not be very competent she says Finks experience was common But the full extent of MNsures problems was hidden from the public for months Three weeks into the websites bumpy rollout April ToddMalmlov MNsures executive director declared all was well At this stage I think the website is doing a very good job she said to Minnesota Public Radio Does that mean it has everything in it that we ultimately wanted to have No Our goal is to continuously improve it over time But an independent review in January found that ToddMalmlov and other MNsure leaders were   after Oct  The site was buckling under the onslaught of traffic consumers flooded the call center and hourlong waits were the norm April ToddMalmlov   in December What Minnesotans did not know is they were testing the site There   for consumer testing before the site went live Michael Krigsman a consultant who specializes in diagnosing and preventing IT project failures says testing is key That is so screwed up You can quote me on that he says This is one of these things thats so foundational Its like why do we need to breathe the air But the lack of consumer testing is just one reason why MNsure sputtered The state had trouble deciding on a lead contractor to build MNsure which burned up valuable testing time And in early  the state had to make a major adjustment after the federal government said exchanges had to meet   On top of it all Minnesota had adopted one of the nations most ambitious plans for its marketplace in the first place Dannette Coleman who runs the individual and family business lines for Medica health plans sees another problem People with expertise in health policy not IT largely directed the project Incredibly dedicated and committed people who really believed strongly in the work Coleman says But they didnt really have the background to understand what it was going to take to get this project done on time on budget In hindsight MNsures   say they should have demanded more information from ToddMalmlov They were comfortable with her only delivering reports orally before the board MNsures board chair chairman Brian Beutner now regrets the agency wasnt more forthcoming about the system I think if I could point to one of the largest failures of MNsure its been a communication failure he says  Its been managing the expectations of what was actually being built when it was going to be delivered and what was that functionality Meanwhile the MNsure site limped along and sucked up thousands of staff hours fixing problems and developing workarounds On New Years Eve the last day to sign up for coverage that would take effect the next day Becky Fink called in the four people she had tried and failed to enroll through the MNsure website They all came in and I gave them all coffee and we made copies of the paper applications and we got them all done and we faxed them in she says The state has spent about  million so far on creating its exchange State officials had expected MNsure to enroll up to  million people for insurance by  but a recent review by consulting firm Optum found MNsure is   MNSure leaders will decide soon whether to build a new website or try to improve on the current site But officials say it is stable enough now to handle an expected increase in traffic in the next few weeks The deadline to sign up for health insurance this year is March
