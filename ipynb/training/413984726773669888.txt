With just a handful of prescriptions to his name psychiatrist Ernest Bagner III was barely a blip in Medicares vast drug program in  But the next year he churned them out at a furious rate  not just psychiatric drugs but expensive pills for asthma cholesterol heartburn and blood clots By the end of  Medicare had paid  million for Bagners drugs  one of the highest tallies in the country He added another   records analyzed by ProPublica show Bagner  says theres just one problem with this accounting The prescriptions arent his All of that stuff you have is false he said By his telling someone stole his identity while he worked at a stripmall clinic in Hollywood then forged his signature on prescriptions for hundreds of Medicare patients Whoever did it he was told likely resold the drugs These people make more money off my name than I do said Bagner Today credit card companies routinely flag or block suspicious charges as they happen Yet under Medicare a convoluted and poorly managed system for catching fraud allows scams to flourish an investigation by ProPublica found Frustrated investigators for law enforcement insurers and pharmacy chains say they dont see evidence that Medicare officials are doing much to stop it Its kind of a black hole said   director of investigations for WellPoint which provides drug coverage to about  million seniors in the program known as Part D Lavelle said her team routinely refers cases to the contractor Medicare hires to review them Oftentimes we never hear back positive or negative she said Since it started in  Part D has been lauded for its success in getting needed medications to more than  million seniors and disabled enrollees But ProPublica scrutinized Medicares own data to identify scores of doctors whose prescription patterns bore the hallmarks of fraud The cost of their prescribing spiked dramatically from one year to the next  in some cases by millions of dollars  as they shifted to brandname drugs that scammers can easily resell Sometimes the doctors claimed they were victims of identity theft In other cases they were paid for writing bogus or inappropriate prescriptions Bagners case shows how fast a single doctor can be used to run up a staggering tab Part D costs taxpayers  billion a year Bagners flood of prescriptions had drawn the attention of law enforcement insurers and Medicare as early as mid In an interview Bagner said he was working at a clinic then when investigators showed up with a stack of prescription and medical records The prescriptions bore a fake signature that closely resembled his he said I wrote my signature I showed them he said They saw the difference Over time more investigators from law enforcement and insurance companies contacted him he said Still Medicare never blocked his national provider ID which is used to fill prescriptions said Bagner who has been told he is considered a victim The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services which runs Part D declined to answer specific questions A spokesman provided a statement saying the agency actively works to detect and prevent provider fraud and refers cases to law enforcement if appropriate Unlike other parts of Medicare Part D is run by private insurance companies When these insurers notice spikes in a doctors prescribing and suspect fraud Medicare encourages but doesnt require them to notify an outside contractor it pays to investigate fraud Insurers arent allowed to block a doctors prescriptions however Nor can the contractor directly access patient medical charts to assess whether the patient actually saw the doctor or had a condition that warranted the medication It must go back to the insurers which then request the records from doctors or pharmacies Most cases die at this level Law enforcement investigators and insurers say an increase in tips and complaints suggests Part D fraud is rising But pursuit of the cases sometimes falls to local agencies such as the Los Angeles County Health Authority Law Enforcement Task Force Sheriffs Sgt Steve Opferman who heads it said Medicare is of scant help to local agencies trying to combat Part D fraud It can take months or years he said to get basic information such as a physicians prescribing or billing data for the program Opferman called Part D icing on the cake for crooks Why he asked is the government so reluctant to stop this
