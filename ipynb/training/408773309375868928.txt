The NHS in England appears to be rationing access to vital nonemergency hospital care a review suggests The analysis by the Dr Foster research group looked at three key procedures  knee hip and cataract operations For much of the past decade patient numbers have been rising as would be expected with an ageing population But since  the numbers have levelled off  with just one in eight areas now doing more hips and knees and one in five seeing rises in cataracts It comes amid mounting pressures on the health service The challenges facing AE units have been well documented but reports have also been emerging that nonemergency care is being squeezed too These findings  to be published on Monday in Dr Fosters annual hospital guide  provide perhaps the most comprehensive picture yet of what is happening The health care analysts looked at the number of operations being carried out for the three types of procedures  among the most lifeenhancing done by the NHS  for the past decade It found virtually no change in the overall numbers over the past two years with the total numbers hovering around the  mark each year Hip replacements were the only treatment out of the three that were still going up  although the rate of increase has slowed  Meanwhile the number of cataract operations is at its lowest level for five years and  saw the first fall in knee replacements for a decade The review also provided details of what local areas were up to by looking at the individual figures for the plus clinical commissioning groups which are now in charge of local health budgets The data showed that just   areas saw a significant rise in knee replacements over the past two years   a rise for hip replacements and   a rise for cataracts Roger Taylor cofounder of Dr Foster said the findings suggested the squeeze on spending was having an impact on these highly effective treatments There has been a sharp slowdown in activity We are seeing some operations fall when normally we see them increasing by   or  a year The review will also highlight other areas of concern Dr Foster analysed data on what it called ineffective operations These include procedures such as tonsillectomies and knee washouts where the benefits are marginal While overall the numbers being done had fallen by  in the past five years there are still  areas where their use has increased since  Mr Taylor added Money is being wasted on care that is of no benefit Colin Howie vice president of the British Orthopaedic Association said the findings were very concerning By trying to save money in the short term it will cost the NHS and society in the long term These are highly effective operations because they restore mobility and reduce disability What is more the research shows it is the most vulnerable in society  the elderly and poor  who are most likely to miss out A spokesman for NHS England said While the data raises important questions we should be wary of leaping to the answers  Cataracts  knees and hip replacements are generally good but it is still the case that they can be overused   We do a very significant number of these operations all over the country and it should not be taken as a given that this figure should automatically increase
