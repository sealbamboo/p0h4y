In rich countries the biggest killers are strokes heart attacks and cancer accounting for   But for the poorer world people often assume that infectious diseases like diarrhea tuberculosis Aids malaria measles and tetanus are the biggest killers That is no longer true While they are still substantial threats broader availability of medication and vaccines along with higher living standards has caused such communicable diseases to drop dramatically to   For the first time more people in the developing world now die from strokes and heart attacks than infectious diseases Combined the diseases that are not infectious  the socalled noncommunicable diseases or NCDs  cause almost twothirds of all deaths in the developing world   In short the poor are dying more and more like the rich The good news is that there are tremendous ways to help which could avoid up to five million deaths each year Because the NCDs generally have received less attention the solutions are often very effective and very cheap This is the argument made in a new paper written by   of the University of Washington Hers is one of a series commissioned by my thinktank   from over  teams of top economists The idea is to be able to compare the costs and benefits of a wide range of proposed targets to help the global community set the best targets In the year  the worlds governments made a historic commitment to a set of ambitious year targets under the umbrella of  While much has been achieved there is still more to be done Thats why  national governments are now debating hundreds of proposed targets for the next  years In September the world will agree to a list of targets to help build a better life for the worlds poorest people Our economic analyses show the worlds leaders where they can help the most for each dollar spent Professor Nugent looks at a range of targets that collectively could cut almost a third of all premature deaths from NDCs by  This is a demanding target because premature death rates are already quite low in the developed world and most of the deaths below age  occur in poorer countries And the problem is accelerating The number of people affected by these diseases is set to increase by  over the next  years and by  in   A clear illustration of the problem is in Mexico where deaths from NCDs went from just under half to threequarters of total deaths between  and  Tobacco the single biggest killer will cause   Just in China onethird of all male deaths will be caused by tobacco by then but very few female deaths since   As the rich countries have shown the most effective way to cut smoking is to dramatically increase taxes A tax in low and middleincome countries to increase the cost of cigarettes by  would still leave cigarettes cheaper than in the west Even considering that smuggling would increase it would likely cut consumption in half  Administration of this tax costs bn annually but it would save  million premature deaths every year Every dollar spent would give benefits valued at  About a billion people on the planet   causing  million deaths This is not just a disease of the rich world  it affects  of African adults The cost of diagnosis and cheap hypertension medication would be  per year per capita so helping the higherrisk patients would cost m but avoid  premature deaths each year Every dollar invested would do  of good One of the simplest ways to reduce high blood pressure is to lower the salt intake Gradual reduction of the salt content in bread and other processed foods has been very successful in a number of countries with very little sign of consumer resistance Reducing salt intake by  is reckoned to avoid  premature deaths more than double this if deaths over  are also counted It would also be a great use of resources paying back  for every dollar spent Finally there are about  million people below  surviving their first stroke or heart attack or otherwise at high risk of dying from heart disease Providing them with a multidrug regimen including aspirin blood pressure lowering drugs and cholesterollowering drugs can considerably prolong their lives The cost is substantial at  but will save almost a million lives Every dollar will provide a benefit of   The choice that the global community is faced with when agreeing the set of post goals is not an easy one but it is vital that the targets included can do the most good and provide good value for money Based on this analysis reducing deaths from noncommunicable diseases deserves very serious consideration
