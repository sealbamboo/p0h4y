With a key deadline approaching, new numbers from a NBC/WSJ poll show that President Barack Obama's health care law remains unpopular with the American public. Per the poll, 44 percent call it a bad idea, while 31 percent believe it’s a good idea, which is virtually unchanged from July’s survey. What’s more, by a 45 percent to 23 percent margin, Americans say the law will have a negative impact on the country's health care system rather than a positive one. And 30 percent of respondents think it will have a negative impact on their families. Just 12 percent say it will be positive, and a majority -- 53 percent -- don't believe it will have an impact one way or another. . See results of the poll . .
