Ten months after that Mitchell was dead He was   The VA Medical Center in Dallas tells CNN that Mitchells day wait to have the cancer taken out of his body meets the standard of care at the VA  That has a lot of people worried  I really dont think its appropriate that our vets have to wait for months said Dr Karl Bilimoria who worked at three VA medical centers and is now a cancer surgeon at Northwestern University Thats just the way the VA works and its sort of been this way for years In  Bilimoria and his colleagues published the results from their study on wait times for eight common cancers at Veterans Administration medical centers  The researchers found that waits from cancer diagnosis to surgery were longer at VA centers for all cancer types when compared with waits for the same cancers at community hospitals For liver and colon cancers specifically the VA surgery wait times were more than twice as long  In a statement the VA told CNN No Veteran should ever have to wait to receive the care they have earned through their service and sacrifice We must work together to fix the unacceptable systemic problems in accessing VA healthcare  For three years Bilimoria and his team shared their results with leaders at the VA Though many were outraged about the long waits nothing seemed to change  We clearly havent seen any major initiatives Bilimoria said  In October one of Bilimorias colleagues at Northwestern wrote an email directly to the head of oncology for the VA nationwide Dr Michael Kelley wrote back quickly saying in part Timeliness of care is of interest but would not be at the top of my list Kelley added that even if there are delays at the VA it does not appear to result in worse survival for veterans  In a statement to CNN Kelley wrote No Veteran should have to wait for needed cancer care It is not appropriate or acceptable for a Veteran to wait for months for cancer surgery I strongly believe that timeliness in the delivery of care is a top priority which is why Ive been actively engaged in the improvement of VAs quality and timeliness of care  A VA official said that what Kelley meant in his email to Bilimorias colleagues is that he didnt think the Northwestern research was the highest priority and he questioned those researchers findings  The official added that in  the VA established a quality improvement program called Cancer Care Collaboratives The official said the program made demonstrable improvement in quality metrics including timeliness but declined to be specific about those improvements  The question burning in Vicki Mitchells mind is this Would her husband have lived if hed had his surgery earlier Its almost impossible to answer  The VA says it commissioned an independent review of cancer care that showed in nearly all respects the quality of VA care equaled or exceeded that of nonVA care  But other studies have disagreed One showed for example that the mortality rate at the VA after pancreatic cancer surgery is  times higher than the mortality rate at large academic health centers The complication rate was  higher among VA patients  Mitchell who still lives in Sherman Texas knows shell never have an answer But she sensed confusion at the VA as her husband was treated for a rare sarcoma a cancer that develops from soft tissues like fat muscle and deep skin tissues  For example the VA sent him to an outside specialist for a surgery that turned out to be the wrong procedure for him so he was sent back to the VA losing precious time She remembers leaving desperate phone messages at the VA that were never returned although the VA says that all calls were answered in a timely manner Mitchell says the confusion continued even after her husbands death Just a few months ago the VA called asking to make an appointment for the veteran  She politely told them he was dead  The lady said I guess I really need to update my computer  Mitchell remembered I said yes you really do
