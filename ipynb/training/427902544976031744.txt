People of a certain age and we know who we are dont spend much leisure time reviewing the research into cognitive performance and aging The story is grim for one thing Memorys speed and accuracy begin to slip around age  and keep on slipping The story is familiar too for anyone who is over  and having finally learned to live fully in the moment discovers its a senior moment The finding that the brain slows with age is one of the strongest in all of psychology Over the years some scientists have questioned this dotage curve But these challenges have had an orneryoldperson slant that the tests were biased toward the young for example Or that older people have learned not to care about clearly trivial things like memory tests Or that an older mind must organize information differently from one attached to some yearold who records his every Ultimate Frisbee move on Instagram Now comes a new kind of challenge to the evidence of a cognitive decline from a decidedly digital quarter data mining based on theories of information processing   published in Topics in Cognitive Science a team of linguistic researchers from the University of Tbingen in Germany used advanced learning models to search enormous databases of words and phrases Since educated older people generally know more words than younger people simply by virtue of having been around longer the experiment simulates what an older brain has to do to retrieve a word And when the researchers incorporated that difference into the models the aging deficits largely disappeared What shocked me to be honest is that for the first half of the time we were doing this project I totally bought into the idea of agerelated cognitive decline in healthy adults the lead author   said by email But the simulations he added fit so well to human data that it slowly forced me to entertain this idea that I didnt need to invoke decline at all Can it be Digital tools have confounded predigital generations now here they are coming to the rescue Or is it that younger scientists are simply pretesting excuses they can use in the future to cover their own goldenyears lapses In fact the new study is not likely to overturn  years of research cognitive scientists say Neuroscientists have some reason to believe that neural processing speed like many reflexes slows over the years anatomical studies suggest that the brain also undergoes subtle structural changes that could affect memory Still the new report will very likely add to a growing skepticism about how steep agerelated decline really is It goes without saying that many people remain disarmingly razorwitted well into their s yet doubts about the average extent of the decline are rooted not in individual differences but in study methodology Many studies comparing older and younger people for instance did not take into account the effects of presymptomatic Alzheimers disease said   a psychologist at Stanford University Dr Carstensen and others have found too that with age people become biased in their memory toward words and associations that have a positive connotation  the   as its known This bias very likely applies when older people perform socalled pairedassociate tests a common measure that involves memorizing random word pairs like ostrich and house Given that most cognitive research asks participants to engage with neutral and in emotion studies negative stimuli the traditional research paradigm may put older people at a disadvantage Dr Carstensen said by email The new datamining analysis also raises questions about many of the measures scientists use Dr Ramscar and his colleagues applied leading learning models to an estimated pool of words and phrases that an educated yearold would have seen and another pool suitable for an educated yearold Their model accounted for more than  percent of the difference in scores between older and younger adults on items in a pairedassociate test he said That is to say the larger the library you have in your head the longer it usually takes to find a particular word or pair Scientists who study thinking and memory often make a broad distinction between fluid and crystallized intelligence The former includes shortterm memory like holding a phone number in mind analytical reasoning and the ability to tune out distractions like ambient conversation The latter is accumulated knowledge vocabulary and expertise In essence what Ramscars group is arguing is that an increase in crystallized intelligence can account for a decrease in fluid intelligence said   a psychologist at Michigan State University In a variety of experiments Dr Hambrick and Timothy A Salthouse of the University of Virginia have shown that crystallized knowledge as measured by New York Times crosswords for example climbs sharply between ages  and  and then plateaus even as the fluid kind like analytical reasoning is dropping steadily  by more than  percent between ages  and  in some studies To know for sure whether the one affects the other ideally wed need to see it in human studies over time Dr Hambrick said Dr Ramscars report was a simulation and included no tested subjects though he said he does have several memory studies with normal subjects on the way For the time being this new digitalera challenge to cognitive decline can serve as a readymade explanation for blank moments whether senior or otherwise Its not that youre slow Its that you know so much
