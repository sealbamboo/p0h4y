In Southeast Asia the battle against malaria is growing even more complicated And its all because of monkeys who carry a form of malaria that until a few years ago wasnt a problem for people According to the textbooks there are only four species of    that cause malaria in humans says   the director of the Malaria Research Center at the University of Malaysia in Sarawak Now a fifth malaria parasite called   has become the leading cause of malaria hospitalizations in Malaysian Borneo At some hospitals in Malaysian Borneo Singh says Up to  percent even  percent of the cases are actually this monkey malaria The   parasite used to be found only in monkeys But as farmers have cleared more land for palm oil plantations and new hydroelectric dams are built the areas   are being squeezed out of their original habitats So the monkeys end up living closer to people And the mosquitoes that transmit the parasite are now biting and infecting humans Its a tough malaria to deal with The mosquito that carries monkey malaria   feeds mainly at night and outdoors So the traditional antimalaria campaigns which hand out bed nets and spray homes with insecticides wont help Whats more lab technicians in Malaysia often misidentify this new parasite as the more benign   The milder form can be treated with pills monkey malaria often requires hospitalization and a regimen of intravenous drugs Thats because of its aggressive nature The   parasite reproduces every  hours in the patients blood while the milder   takes  days to replicate So monkey malaria comes on fast and can quickly make a person terribly sick It also has the potential to kill as do some other strains of malaria But   does not The fact that the   parasite resides in monkeys also makes it difficult to stop the spread of the disease In the other forms of malaria wiping out the parasite in humans can bring transmission in an area to a halt With monkey malaria this isnt possible because of the large number of longtailed macaques in the Malaysian jungle Singh notes that theyre a protected species so any temptation to attack the disease by reducing the monkey population probably isnt feasible Singh predicts that the number of cases of monkey malaria will only go up as human development pushes further into the habitat of the longtailed macaque The parasite doesnt make the macaques sick so the parasite and the monkeys get along peacefully The problems arise when the people are linked to the monkey malaria chain
