Studies have shown that male infertility is associated with a slightly increased risk for various types of cancer including testicular cancer possibly because of shared genetic factors About one in six infertile men have azoospermia or no viable sperm in their ejaculate and these men may be at the highest cancer risk a new study shows For the study published   researchers evaluated  men average age  at a fertility clinic in Texas  had azoospermia They found  cases of cancer during an average followup of almost seven years  Over all those in the infertile group were  times as likely as the general population in Texas to develop some form of cancer But the risk more than tripled for those with azoospermia While the increase in relative risk is substantial the authors write the absolute risk of cancer in this population remains low  The main message here is to continue followup after a fertility workup said the lead author Dr Michael L Eisenberg an assistant professor of urology at Stanford This is not a screen for health but it may be a warning sign of other things
