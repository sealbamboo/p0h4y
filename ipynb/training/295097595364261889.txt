 The editor of my Web site   told me that the most frequent questions coming in by far were about depression That surprised me and then I began looking at the statistics on depression in our country I was really shocked to find that one in  Americans is now on an antidepressant drug that the rates are going up and that the use of psychiatric drugs among children is so high And I began thinking about my own history of   in my earlier life and ways that I had overcome that and it just seemed to me that theres an awful lot of information thats not out there Last year my colleagues and I held the first national conference on integrative mental health in which we really argued for a new paradigm of mental health thats not entirely rooted in biomedicine I feel very strongly about that I think its time to look at depression and other emotional disorders from a much broader perspective Also Im fascinated as to why were experiencing an epidemic of depression in our society I think one reason is the completely unrealistic expectations of happiness that we are led to believe we should have I think thats something really peculiar to our culture at the moment thats really destructive So I wanted to talk about what I think is a realistic mental health goal I certainly dont think its constant happiness I wanted to look at the limitations of the biomedical approach and give people practical information about ways to optimize    I think most people think that happiness comes from something outside from getting something that you dont have I really wanted to emphasize that happiness comes from within that you can open yourself to the possibility of happiness Its analogous to what I wrote about healing some years ago I wanted to draw attention to the fact that healing really comes from within from the bodys own regulations  its not what you put into someone from outside Its an important distinction In my experience most people think theyll have   if they now have something they dont have  Well I think you might feel a temporary lift from that but it doesnt last I think a much better goal is contentment a quality that comes from within that allows you to maintain a constant positive state no matter what happens I cited in the book a lot of research that people in less affluent societies seem to be much more content than we are In the few huntergatherer societies left on the planet you cant find many cases of depression So I think thats interesting that the more people have the less content they seem to be  Perhaps but I also think that maybe the things that affluence brings really undermine emotional wellness in a lot of ways the conveniences of modern living enable us to live really insolated lives We can create our own cocoon with media centers and virtual realities and I think that its really lessened social connectedness  I think its normal to have ebbs and flows and there is even some thinking that mild to moderate depression can be useful that it may be a state that favors solving problems We might even be evolutionarily selected to experience that occasionally  It was especially in my twenties thirties early forties Id been diagnosed with dysthymic disorder Its a clinical term for mild to moderate depression I was never incapacitated by it but there were many days when I woke up feeling blue and didnt want deal with people didnt want to deal with any of it I dealt with it in different ways I never took antidepressants I took them for a few days and they didnt agree with me but I was forced to find ways of managing The things that Ive had the most success with over the years have been exercise meditation and dietOver time its become less and less Its a rare experience for me these days and I wanted to talk in the book about all the things that have helped  Well theres an accumulating body of research that shows that SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors a type of antidepressant medication may not work any better than placebos even for severe depression and that maybe only in very very severe depression is there in an advantage One expert says that it may not matter what you do as long as you do something and it doesnt matter WHAT you do  it could be going into therapy taking antidepressants making a lifestyle change  just doing something that shifts that mental energy It changes your mood and thats what really produces a benefit  And they should never stop it suddenly With   its important to have a schedule of weaning off and have other measures before you even attempt that But I do think that a great many people on these drugs can get by on lower doses or can get by without them as long as theyre doing other things  Yes its very interesting steroids cold medicines including a lot of things that are sold over the counter Its very important to have an expert check everything and see what might be contributing  Very important And also look at useage of alcohol caffeine and other recreational drugs  All of this is changing brain function We dont know exactly how or the consequences yet and it may have some benefits For example I bet many kids growing up now will have better handeye coordination But I worry about what this is doing It clearly has shortened attention spans it is favoring multitasking which is a bad thing  it prevents you from staying in the present My general feeling is that its very important that people make rules for themselves to limit this otherwise theres a tendency for it to take over your life and undermine emotional health  You know theres a term thats come into literature called nature deficit disorder I really believe in that I think for both physical and mental wellness its important for us to spend time outdoors to experience natural cycles of light and darkness to hear natural sounds A lot of aspects of modern life insulate us from that You know were creatures of nature we do best when weve spent some time in nature If youre in a city that could mean going to a park You could even bring some pieces of nature into your living spaces whether thats a plant or minerals something I think humans need to have    Well yes theres an interesting piece of research about soil organisms that might have an antidepressant effect All of this ties into the hygiene hypothesis that living in an overly clean environment might actually undermine health expose us to allergies and all that  It includes the physical level really developing a program of physical activity making sure youre following a healthy diet and taking supplemental fish oil and vitamin B attending to rest and sleep There are a lot of suggestions about working on your mind using Western techniques such as cognitive therapy and Eastern techniques like forms of meditation and concentration and visualization And then I address a lot of spiritual needs Theres compelling evidence for simple things like expressing gratitude keeping a gratitude journal for even a week can produce a very positive powerful lift in mood  Right I think this is all doable A lot of it is new information not what the average person who goes to the doctor for anxiety or depression gets This is not to deny the importance of brain chemistry or the fact that some people need medication but theres so much that people can do to improve common emotional problems and deal with things on a daily basis  Its interesting you know I think the world has always been teetering on the edge of disaster A couple summers ago I watched the whole WWII documentary by Ken Burns My parents lived through that I was born during that and my parents lived through the Great Depression and yet mental health and emotional health were generally better than they are today And so I dont think that everything can be pinned on the current financial situation This is part of why I say people should strive for contentment and resilience rather than happiness If you work in those directions whatever extenuating circumstances youre dealing with its possible to be relatively in balance and not suffer extremes of despair  I think it was a result of the practices that Ive been doing over the years those that I put in the book  Regular physical activity taking supplemental fish oil and I would say feeling and expressing gratitude These three are very strongly backed by scientific evidence Those are my top three suggestions Interested in more information on Dr Weil and   go to    Early Show   CBS Evening News
