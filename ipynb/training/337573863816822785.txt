Frequent heartburn increases the risk for throat cancer a new study has found and overthecounter antacids may provide protection Researchers studied heartburn incidence and medication use in  patients with squamous cell cancers of the throat and vocal cords who were not heavy smokers or drinkers matching them with  healthy controls The   After controlling for age sex race smoking alcohol consumption HPV  infection education and body mass index they found that people who had reported a history of frequent heartburn were  percent more likely to have cancer than those who did not Those with frequent heartburn who took antacids reduced their risk for cancer by  percent compared with those whose heartburn was untreated We have confirmed that heartburn is an independent risk factor and standard antacid treatment of heartburn may reduce the risk of throat cancer said the lead author Scott M Langevin an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Cincinnati There was no reduced risk among those taking proton pump inhibitors Prilosec and others or histamine H receptor antagonists Zantac for example  but this may be because people taking such drugs are likely to have the most severe cases of acid reflux and not because those drugs are ineffective the researchers said
