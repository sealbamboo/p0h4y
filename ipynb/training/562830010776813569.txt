There has been a big increase in the number of people being referred to GP surgeries and AE departments analysis of the NHS  urgent care line in England shows The figures were produced by the doctors union the BMA which has had longstanding concerns over NHS   Doctors leaders say increased referrals mean more pressure on already overstretched GPs and hospitals  NHS England says the  service is meeting increasing demand A spokesman said the proportion of referrals to GPs and emergency services had remained steady despite a surge in calls But the BMA is concerned that the service is not delivering appropriate advice to some patients and this means some are being incorrectly directed to busy hospitals and GP surgeries The BMA looked at the outcomes of calls to NHS  which was rolled out in March  to replace the old NHS Direct service In its final full year of operation in  NHS Direct received  million calls from patients  In comparison calls to NHS  increased yearonyear and in  up to November it received and responded to more than  million calls Referrals from NHS  to AE increased from just under  calls in  to over a million in   Similarly referrals to GPs went up from just under  million to  million between  and  Dr Charlotte Jones BMAs GP lead on NHS  is concerned that the service is not delivering appropriate advice for patients There is no doubt that if a patient needs any form of medical care they should be referred through to an appropriate doctor or nurse but there are serious doubts as to whether this huge increase in workload is clinically necessary Anecdotally GPs have reported to the BMA that patients have been referred to them with colds sore thumbs or other conditions that could have been treated safely by sensible advice over the phone advising a patient on how to selfcare such as picking up medication from a local pharmacist And Dr Mark Porter of the BMA says there is an issue with staff who have little or no medical knowledge A fundamental problem with NHS  is that it employs nonclinically trained staff who follow a formulaic script rather than using clinical judgement to assess how calls are dealt with  Understandably this is likely to lead the call handlers with limited experience of medicine to be cautious and refer patients to the NHS when a trained professional could have encouraged them to effectively selfcare Key NHS services cannot afford to be taking on unnecessary work when they are struggling to treat the number of patients who do need genuine care  It is also an enormous waste of patients time if they are sent to a GP or AE when they could have had their issue dealt with during a few minutes on the phone An NHS England spokesman said the statistics show there is a massive demand from the public for the  service   To date it has coped impressively with this pressure with the proportion of referrals to GPs and emergency services remaining steady despite the surge in demand  Given this popularity however we are continuing to look at ways to make the service even more robust including asking GPs to help support call centres and provide patients with the ability to get high quality medical advice as quickly as possible Janette Turner a research fellow for the emergency and immediate care group at the University of Sheffield said We must remember NHS  is not the same as NHS Direct and of course call volumes are much higher because  has not only replaced NHS Direct but also GP out of hours services  Todays BMA statements are anecdotal and what isnt known is if there was no  how many of those people would have actually gone in to their GP AE or WalkIn Centres
