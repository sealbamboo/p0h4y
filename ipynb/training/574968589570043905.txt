Two promising approaches to finding effective weight loss drugs have been presented at the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society Animals given one experimental drug showed dramatic weight loss according to scientists In another early study in men the love hormone oxytocin appeared to help reduce appetite Experts said a weight loss pill would be like finding the Holy Grail but they also raised concerns about safety Much more work is needed to check these approaches will be safe to use in humans they told the conference in San Diego  First a team at Houston Methodist Research Institute used a drug that manipulates the amount of energy burned by mimicking hormones produced by the thyroid It raised metabolic rate and lead to dramatic weight loss said lead researcher Dr Kevin Phillips The chemical GC worked by converting white fat which is just an energy store into brown fat This type of fat helps keep weight off by burning calories and turning them into heat It is more common in babies In mice experiments heat production kicked in and raised the animals temperature by four degrees In the space of two weeks obese mice became thin as they lost half their body fat Dr Phillips added Our data demonstrate that GC is a novel fatbrowning agent that may have use in the treatment of obesity and metabolic disease It is too early to know if the chemical could be used safely in people  Raising the internal body temperature too much could be deadly There are also concerns that a drug that has such a dramatic impact on fat would be dangerous elsewhere in the body Dr Jason Wexler an endocrinologist in Washington DC commented This is the Holy Grail  can you take a pill to lose weight This area is obviously very exciting I would continue to highlight the safety issues and off target effects that really needs to be hurdled before therapeutic conversion of white fat to brown fat is going to be realised Meanwhile an early set of human trials on oxytocin was presented by a team at Harvard Medical School This hormone is normally released during childbirth and helps a mother bond with her baby A single dose of the hormone delivered by nasal spray before breakfast seemed to reduce appetite and the number of calories consumed in a test on  men The men consumed  fewer calories at breakfast after using the nasal spray If this effect was sustained over three meals a day for a whole year it could lead to kg of weight loss the researchers calculate Previous animal tests suggest there could be a longerterm effect from multiple doses but this is still untested in people Researcher Dr Elizabeth Lawson told the BBC News website It is absolutely early work and to me it is incredibly exciting because were now translating what was found in animals to humans I think it certainly has potential in the treatment of obesity but we really cant extrapolate to say what would happen over time those studies need to be done
