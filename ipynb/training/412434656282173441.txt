Selfharm is a serious issue for women in prison who make up only  of the prison population but account for half of all selfharm incidents say Oxford University researchers  According to   nearly a quarter of female prisoners cut scratch or poison themselves Selfharm was also found to be a strong risk factor for suicide in prison particularly among men Experts say more should be done to reduce selfharm rates in prisons The Oxford research team looked at selfharm incidents in all prisons in England and Wales between  and  It found that  to  of male prisoners and  to  of female prisoners deliberately harmed themselves every year resulting in  to  incidents per year This compared with a  rate among the UKs general population Repeated selfharming was common the study said and a small group of  women inmates selfharmed more than  times a year Cutting and scratching were the most frequent methods of selfharming in men and women followed by poisoning and overdosing The study also examined those at greatest risk of selfharm In female prisoners being younger than  years old white in a mixed local prison or serving a life sentence were major factors In male prisoners those at risk tended to be young white in a highsecurity prison and with a life sentence or unsentenced Prisoners who selfharmed were found to be at substantially greater risk of suicide than other inmates particularly among men Older male prisoners aged  to  with a history of serious selfharm were most at risk Dr Seena Fazel joint study author from the department of psychiatry at the University of Oxford said all prisoners who are selfharming should be regarded as a risk Now we know the extent to which the risk of subsequent suicide in prisoners who selfharm is greater than the general population suicide prevention initiatives should be changed to include a focus on prisoners who are selfharming especially repeatedly  Dr Andrew Forrester from Kings College London and Dr Karen Slade from Nottingham Trent University call for more research to address how the selfharm rate in prisons in England and Wales can be reduced The available evidence indicates a key role for multiagency collaboration in which suicide is everyones concern rather than being the sole preserve of healthcare staff We need to invest in the wide inclusion of all people who on the ground can listen to prisoners who are experiencing distress mobilise concern and help to deliver joined up care Andy Bell deputy chief executive at the   said it was well known that women in prison were more likely to have depression anxiety and borderline personality disorder which in turn can make them extremely vulnerable He added it was important to be aware of those at risk at an early stage Women should have access to mental health support and advice at every police station It should start when they are arrested particularly if there are signs of selfharming or poor mental health We have to intervene early to stop the journey
