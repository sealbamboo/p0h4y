Abortion isnt usually a   in presidential campaigns But this year is different Both President Obama and former Massachusetts Gov Mitt Romney are putting the issue front and center including official campaignproduced ads Thats a big change from many of the previous presidential races where the campaigns normally let surrogates do the talking about one of the most contentious issues in politics Thats because in both cases candidates wanted to secure their base voters  those who support abortion rights in the case of Democrats and those who oppose them for Republicans  without antagonizing the minorities in each party who hold the other view This fall however GOP challenger Romney has been walking an interesting tightrope  appearing to   on the one hand while maintaining a strict antiabortion stance on the other Perhaps even more curious is the fact that those very ardent antiabortion Republicans  some of the same ones who worried that Romney   during the primaries  dont seem to be that worried right now Im confident that the Romney administration is going to stand for the principles of protecting life of protecting conscience that have been the mainstay of what their campaign has been saying all along said Anna Franzonello staff counsel for   Yet they seem to have been ignoring the fact that some of his surrogates have been trying to convince more moderate voters that Romney really wouldnt be such a threat to abortion rights During the Republican National Convention in September Romneys sister   that a ban on abortion is never going to happen with her brother in the White House And just last week former Sen Norm Coleman RMinn told a group of   that they should not fear an overturn of   the landmark Supreme Court decision should Romney become president President Bush  had two Supreme Court picks and   wasnt reversed Coleman said So what explains all this Ed Kilgore thinks he knows Kilgore is a senior fellow at the Democratic centrist think tank the Progressive Policy Institute and author of the  s   He says that Colemans claim notwithstanding antiabortion forces know they are now within striking distance of achieving that ultimate goal  overturning Roe According to just about every court watcher thanks to two appointments to the court by George W Bush there are almost certainly four justices on the court right now that are prepared to either reverse or significantly modify Roe Kilgore said And with four justices   its considered highly likely that the next president will have at least one chance to appoint that pivotal fifth vote But Kilgore says theres another reason reproductive rights are so front and center this year   the issue first Republicans decided near the end of the primary season actually that they had a big opening to go after the Catholic vote based on the administrations contraception coverage mandate  which Republicans and some cultural conservatives treated as an invitation to mandatory coverage of abortion pills he said Republicans also went strongly after   something Franzonello of Americans United for Life defends Theyre trying to paint Mitt Romney as being the one whos so extreme when he says Were going to cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood  she said What weve seen from the Obama administration is the extreme on the other end too  that where states have wanted to cut their ties with the abortion industry the Obama administration has injected itself and said No you cant do that  The administration has in fact moved to block both   and   from cutting off funds to Planned Parenthood citing federal law that requires that women be allowed to choose their own providers of family planning and other federally covered services But Kilgore says that while in previous campaigns Republicans may have had the upper hand by focusing on the least popular and most controversial abortions Republicans take on more popular issues like contraception at their peril Its reminded people that these arent folks that just want to maybe ban a tiny percentage of outrageoussounding abortions  lateterm or abortions for reasons that people dont acknowledge as legitimate  but rather a fullscale assault on all legalized abortion and on forms of contraception he said The dirty little secret of the righttolife movement is that an awful lot of them think that practices that nearly all Americans consider contraception  everything from Plan B to intrauterine devices to the pill  they regard those as abortion devices not as contraceptives And anything that draws attention to the radicalism of conservatives on contraceptives is really bad news for Republicans Franzonello however says its President Obama whos been the radical It really has been an extreme four years she said citing White House action on issues like   and   for health care workers Complicating the debate this year has been a series of missteps by Republican House and Senate candidates starting with Missouri Rep Todd Akins now infamous claim last summer that women who are the subject of   can somehow prevent pregnancy Indiana Senate hopeful Richard Mourdock is now   after he said that   is something God intended to happen And before walking the statement back Illinois Rep Joe Walsh said that   to save a womans life thanks to modern technology and science As long as you have Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock and Joe Walsh and others reminding people that this is an argument within a coalition that wants to ban abortions generally over whether to exempt a handful or an even tinier handful it doesnt work very well for Republicans Kilgore said In the end though as always it depends on which side is able to turn out its voters And that wont be known until the votes are counted
