The rate of suicides in the UK increased in  with the level among males its highest since  and middleaged men most at risk according to the latest data  Figures released by the   ONS show that  suicides of people over the age of  were registered in   more than in  which represents a  increase The UK suicide rate was  deaths per  people The northeast had the highest rate in England at  deaths

suicide rate between  and  but since then there has been a steady increase  This was the first year that men aged  to  showed the highest suicide rate  per  overtaking those aged  to  who had previously recorded the highest rate from  to  The rate among older men aged  also rose significantly from its  level to  per   The rate among younger men aged  was the only group to show a decrease Suicide remains the leading cause of death for men between  and  in England and Wales representing  of all deaths in  and for men aged  at  of deaths  The highest rate by age group for women was also

Appleby the chair of the National Suicide Prevention Advisory Group in England said Men are more at risk of suicide because they are more likely to drink heavily use selfharm methods that are more often fatal and are reluctant to seek help  Fifteen years ago the rates among men under  were brought down sharply by tackling these problems and we need to use this success to address the problems of the new highest risk group middleaged men  We need to make it easier for men to find help without shame or stigma Samaritans executive director of policy Joe Ferns said the increase was sadly not surprising to us given the context of a challenging economic environment and the social impact that brings We need to see a greater focus at local and regional levels on the coordination and prioritisation of suicide prevention activity especially in areas with high socioeconomic deprivation  The excessive risk of suicide in men and midlife continued to be a concern The rate for this group has now reached its highest level for more than  years  These figured cannot be ignored In England the rate was  deaths per   compared with  in Wales  But the ONS said the higher rate in Wales in  may partly be owing to deaths being registered more quickly while in England delays in registration have increased The ONS said the figures were also potentially affected by an increase over time in the use of narrative verdicts by coroners Ferns said it was important to understand that about a third of local authorities do not collect information about suicide and do not have a suicide prevention action plan or a multiagency suicide prevention group This is an issue which needs to be urgently addressed in the context of rising data he said  The ONS said a report in  by experts including Ben Barr from the National Institute for Health Research suggested that the UKs recent recession could be an influencing factor in the increase of suicides The report found that regions with greater rises in unemployment had also experienced higher rises in male suicides the ONS said  This was the first year that hanging strangulation and suffocation was the most common method of death used by women as previously it had been poisoning For both men and women the proportion of deaths from poisoning has fallen over the past  years The Royal College of Nursing RCN and the Mental Health Foundation MHF have called for better mental health provision in the community   they have joined his family in calling for better support for GPs to enable them to work more closely with communitybased mental health staff The family believe there should be a lower threshold for coordinated care plans for those at risk with risk factors to include age gender drug use and major trauma  Dr Peter Carter the RCNs chief executive and general secretary said Suicide is a complex issue and it is difficult to say with certainty that individual deaths can be prevented but we must listen to families like the Strains who have spoken so eloquently about their sons experience and the gaps in the provision of care  Better support for people experiencing mental health problems would help prevent suicides and enable many people to lead full and fulfilling lives with distressing but manageable conditions Without the expert support of nurses and other staff many people are growing increasingly desperate while waiting for care Jenny Edwards the MHFs chief executive said Ultimately we need excellent care but we also need to step back and ask what reasonable steps can be taken to prevent people from having to reach mental health crises Early intervention is the key   This footnote was appended on  february  An earlier version of this article referred to the numbers of suicides in the first paragraph and then went on to say that Figures released by the Office for National Statistics ONS show  people over the age of  killed themselves in  To clarify the Office for National Statistics figures show that  suicides were registered in  but many of the deaths occurred before  because of the time it takes to register a suicide In England  of the deaths occurred before  in Wales  in Northern Ireland  and in Scotland  because of much shorter registration delays
