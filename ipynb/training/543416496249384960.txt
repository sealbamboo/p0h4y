When I lived in France I used to love watching people discover rillettes a rustic pt that is traditionally made by cooking pork belly or shoulder slowly in abundant fat allowing it to cool in the fat then raking the mixture into a spreadable paste I myself was a vegetarian or nearvegetarian at the time so my pleasure was vicarious I have never been much of a fan of fatty meat dishes even now when I eat more meat than I did then which is still not much but that is a question of personal taste I really got what they loved about the rillettes  the flavor and texture are luxurious  Rillettes are also made with other meats  most often game birds or rabbit and also with fish particularly fatty fish like salmon mackerel sardines anchovies and tuna which are high in omegas The fish isnt slowcooked in fat the way meat is but it is mixed with fat  in France that would be softened butter  and shredded in the same way The key is a smooth richtasting spreadable mixture which is easy to achieve with a number of types of seafood On my last trip to Paris I saw fish rillettes on menus all over town They were usually served from crocks or wide canning jars the way meat rillettes are traditionally stored to be eaten with bread But at Buvette a little restaurant in the th Arrondissment also in New Yorks Greenwich Village a rich mound of smoked trout rillettes topped a warm plate of lentils to great effect Inspired I zeroed in on fish rillettes for this weeks Recipes for Health I didnt make them as rich as authentic rillettes  a tablespoon or two of butter or crme frache here and there but instead used mostly olive oil and Greek yogurt as the fish itself has plenty of rich texture If you let the pts come to or near to room temperature before you serve them they will be plenty smooth I worked with smoked trout and salmon smoked sardines and tuna and couldnt resist crab meat as well as it breaks down so nicely You can serve the rillettes with bread or crackers but also as a delicious accompaniment to lentils or on top of endive leaves or inside mini peppers or cherry tomatoes Think Christmas and New Years parties these make great healthy hors doeuvres If you are trying to figure out how to get more highomega  seafood into your life look no further
