Doing the night shift throws the body into chaos and could cause longterm damage warn researchers  Shift work has been linked to higher rates of type  diabetes heart attacks and cancer Now scientists at the Sleep Research Centre in Surrey have uncovered the disruption shift work causes at the deepest molecular level Experts said the scale speed and severity of damage caused by being awake at night was a surprise The human body has its own natural rhythm or body clock tuned to sleep at night and be active during the day It has profound effects on the body altering everything from hormones and body temperature to athletic ability mood and brain function The study   followed  people as their body was shifted from a normal pattern to that of a nightshift worker  Blood tests showed that normally  of genes  the instructions contained in DNA  were precisely timed to be more or less active at specific times of the day  Once the volunteers were working through the night that genetic finetuning was lost  Over  of rhythmic genes become out of sync with mistimed sleep and this really explains why we feel so bad during jet lag or if we have to work irregular shifts said Dr Simon Archer one of the researchers at the University of Surrey Fellow researcher Prof DerkJan Dijk said every tissue in the body had its own daily rhythm but with shifts that was lost with the heart running to a different time to the kidneys running to a different time to the brain He told the BBC Its chronochaos Its like living in a house Theres a clock in every room in the house and in all of those rooms those clocks are now disrupted which of course leads to chaos in the household Studies have shown that shift workers getting too little sleep at the wrong time of day may be   Others analyses suggest   Prof Dijk added We of course know that shift work and jet lag is associated with negative side effects and health consequences  They show up after several years of shift work We believe these changes in rhythmic patterns of gene expression are likely to be related to some of those longterm health consequences Prof Hugh Piggins a bodyclock researcher from the University of Manchester told the BBC The study indicated that the acute effects are quite severe It is surprising how large an effect was noticed so quickly its perhaps a larger disruption than might have been appreciated He cautioned that it was a shortterm study so any lasting changes are uncertain but you could imagine this would lead to a lot of healthrelated problems
