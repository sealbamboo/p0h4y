Making music  and not just listening to it  while exercising makes the exercise easier a remarkable new experiment finds suggesting that the human love of music may have evolved in part to ease physical effort Researchers and exercisers have long known of course that listening to music alters the experience of exercising   for instance that briskly paced music tends to inspire equally briskly paced workouts and that music also can distract and calm nervous competitors before a race or other highpressure situation improving their subsequent performance  But to date no one had thought to investigate whether creating  and not merely hearing  music might have an effect on workouts let alone whether the impact would be qualitatively different than when exercisers passively listen to music pumped through gym speakers or their ear buds   So for the new study which was   researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognition and Brain Sciences in Leipzig Germany and other institutions began by inventing an electronic kit that could be integrated into the internal workings of weighttraining machines transforming them into oversize boom boxes Once installed the kit would produce a range of propulsive electronicstyle music with a variety of sound levels and rhythms depending on how the machines weight bar or other mechanisms were manipulated during workouts  The researchers installed the kits into three different workout machines one a stairstepper the other two weight machines with bars that could be raised or pulled down to stimulate various muscles  They then recruited a group of  healthy men and women and divided them into groups each of which was assigned to use one of the musically equipped machines during a strenuous though brief sixminute exercise session As the volunteers strained their machines chirped and pinged with a thumping  beats per minute the sound level rising or falling with each individuals effort and twining with the rhythms created by the other two exercisers Participants could express themselves on the machines by for instance modulating rhythms and creating melodies said Thomas Hans Fritz a researcher at the Max Planck Institute who led the study  The groups were in effect DJing their workouts creating sounds that echoed their physical efforts  During a separate exercise session each group used the same machines but minus the musical addons while elsewhere in the gym other volunteers sweated at the musically equipped machines meaning that one group was passively listening to sounds created by another  Throughout each workout the researchers monitored the force their volunteers generated while using the machines as well as whether the weight lifters movements tended to stutter or flow and how much oxygen the volunteers consumed a reliable measure of physical effort Afterward the scientists asked the volunteers to rate the tolerability or unpleasantness of the session on a scale from  to   Tabulated afterward the results showed that most of the volunteers had generated significantly greater muscular force while working at the musically equipped machines than the unmodified ones They also had used less oxygen to generate that force and reported that their exertions had felt less strenuous Their movements were also more smooth in general resulting in a steadier flow of music  Creating their own rhythms and melodies had lowered the physiological cost of exercise and greatly increased its subjective allure compared with when the exercisers passively listened to virtually the same music Dr Fritz said  A similar dynamic may have motivated early humans to whistle or hum while they hunted or tilled and later to raise their voices in song during barn raisings and other intense physical labor he said But why orchestrating your own soundtrack should have more physical benefit than merely hearing similar music in the background is not altogether clear  We think that the observed effects are most probably due to a greater degree of emotional motor control when you actively engage in making music Dr Fritz said  Emotional motor control as opposed to the more workaday deliberate type that normally guides our muscular movements he said operates almost below consciousness Your body responds to it with little volition and you move he said with reduced effort and increased joy This is musical ecstasy Dr Fritz said and it seems to have permeated to some degree the gym where the exercisers composed music while sweating Unfortunately the musical kits that Dr Fritz and his colleagues have developed are not available commercially although they may be in the future For now he said you may need to content yourself with purposely ignoring the supplied soundtrack at your local gym and instead singing to yourself Perhaps harmonize no matter how tunelessly with a workout partner Disdain naysayers and music lovers You will be in the felicitous phrasing of Dr Fritz jymming thats like jamming but with a y from gym
