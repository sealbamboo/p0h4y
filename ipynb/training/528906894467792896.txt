More women than ever are using donor eggs as they keep delaying childbearing until long past the age when their own eggs are healthy This has helped fuel an increase in firsttime mothers over  whose numbers have   in the past  years But as the practice becomes more widespread a recent study finds women are no longer trying to hide the fact that their babies come from donor eggs by working hard to find donors who are physically or genetically similar to them Instead the researchers say recipients tend to look for other qualities such as intelligence and athletic ability that they hope to pass on to their children The    archly titled Beauty Brains or Health  was conducted by physicians at the Mt Sinai School of Medicine and the fertility clinic Reproductive Medical Associates of New York It found that women today are not as focused anymore on a donors hair and eye color The editorinchief of the   which published the study sees this as an indication that using egg donors has become more socially acceptable Recipients are no longer working hard to try to make a baby who looks like their own biological child so they can keep the babys origins something of a family secret The shift in what recipients are looking for in egg donors indicates that theyve become more sophisticated in their choices according to Dr Susan Kornstein the editor But is it really more sophisticated to go shopping for an egg donor as though shopping for shoes hoping that traits like intelligence or athletic ability will actually be present in the egg cells DNA The researchers led by Dr Homero Flores of Reproductive Medical Associates looked at the choices made by  potential egg recipients aged  to  over the past five years Between  and  the percentage of women who said they wanted an egg donor from a similar gene pool declined from  percent to  percent At the same time looking for a baby with a similar appearance was relatively rare and held roughly steady with  percent of women in  saying it was important to them and  percent saying so in  The most important thing that recipients cared about was the same thing mothers have cared about since time immemorial  the babys health Nearly threequarters of the women in the Mt Sinai study said the health of the egg donor was a crucial factor in making their decision But other factors were also important and became more so during the five years of the study From  to  the percent of women who cared about a donors intelligence increased from  percent to  percent and the percent who cared about athletic ability increased from  percent to  percent Flores and his coauthors saw this as a good thing a sign that recipients became more focused on practical traits that would serve their offsprings overall quality of life This assumes of course that practical traits can be passed along this easily  that being good at math or at throwing a ball not only enhances ones quality of life but also is inherited The preference for egg donors who are not only healthy but also smart and skilled has also been a trend among women looking for sperm donors with sperm banks becoming almost as personalityoriented as online dating sites Indeed one dating site  called Beautiful People  created its own   a few years ago to match gamete donors and wouldbe recipients Hidden in the Mt Sinai study is the fact that  percent of the potential egg recipients were over the age of  And at least one of them was  years old This means that there are a lot of women out there in their s and even s s who think they still have the option to become pregnant An argument could be made  a topic for another day  that by the time you pass  or so you should perhaps be thinking about other ways to satisfy your maternal cravings
