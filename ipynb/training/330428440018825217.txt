On Thursday we   to puzzle their way through the case of a yearold woman who started out with what seemed like her usual migraine but who then became more and more ill By the time the diagnosis was made she had double vision and she was shaking and confused And despite the right diagnosis there was worse to come  But first the correct diagnosis is Nearly  readers offered their thoughts on what was wrong with this patient The first person to come up with the right diagnosis was Dr Matthew Bevers a neurology resident at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston  Dr Bevers studied with Dr Josep O Dalmau the neurologist who published the first case series describing this rare disease He also saw a case just like this one last year he told me As in that case the patient  a young woman  had come from another hospital where the most common diseases had been considered and ruled out pushing the new team to consider more unusual diagnoses
