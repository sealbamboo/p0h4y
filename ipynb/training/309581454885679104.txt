Theres a kind of rice growing in some test plots in the Philippines thats unlike any rice ever seen before Its yellow Its   call it   Its been genetically modified so that it contains betacarotene the source of vitamin A Millions of people in Asia and Africa dont get enough of this vital nutrient so this rice has become the symbol of an idea that genetically engineered crops can be a tool to improve the lives of the poor Its a statement that rouses emotions and sets off fierce arguments Theres a raging global debate about such crops But before we get to that debate and the role that golden rice plays in it lets travel back in time to golden rices origins It began with a conversation in  The science of biotechnology was in its infancy at this point There were no genetically engineered crops yet Scientists were just figuring out how to find genes and move them between different organisms Some people at the   thought that these techniques might be useful for giving farmers in poor countries a bigger harvest So they set up a meeting at the   IRRI in the Philippines to talk about this  who was in charge of the foundations biotechnology program at the time says that a lot of people at this meeting were very skeptical about biotechnology They were plant breeders masters of the traditional way to improve crops One evening after the formal sessions a group of these breeders were sitting around at the guesthouse at IRRI having a beer or two says Toenniessen After listening to their skepticism for a while Toenniessen spoke up If this technology did actually pan out he said and you could put any gene you wanted into rice which one would you pick Whats your favorite gene They went around the room Breeders talked about genes for resisting disease or surviving droughts They came to a breeder named   a legendary figure in these circles Hed created perhaps the most famous variety of rice in history called   which launched the socalled Green Revolution in ricegrowing countries of Asia in the s Yellow endosperm said Jennings The endosperm of a grain of rice or wheat is the main part thats eaten That kind of took everybody by surprise It certainly took me by surprise So I said Why  Toenniessen recalls Jennings explained that the color yellow signals the presence of betacarotene  the source of vitamin A Yellow kinds of corn or sorghum exist naturally and for years Jennings said he had been looking for similar varieties of rice Regular white rice doesnt provide this vital nutrient and its a big problem When children are weaned theyre often weaned on a rice gruel And if they dont get any betacarotene or vitamin A during that period they can be harmed for the rest of their lives says Toenniessen Toenniessen was persuaded and the Rockefeller Foundation started a program aimed at creating through technology what Jennings had not been able to find in nature A global network of scientists at nonprofit research institutes started working on the problem The first real breakthrough came in    in Switzerland inserted two genes into rice that switched on production of betacarotene A few years later other researchers created an even   A single bowl of this new golden rice can    percent of a childs daily requirement of vitamin A Its a great product And its beautiful It looks just like saffron rice says Toenniessen whos now a managing director at the Rockefeller Foundation Others though dont find it beautiful at all For instance consider what happened just a few months ago Some USfunded researchers published the results of a nutritional   showing that peoples bodies easily absorb the betacarotene in golden rice Theyd carried out that study among children in China The result seemed like great news But the environmental group Greenpeace immediately called it a   People are angry really furious about these tests using Chinese children as guinea pigs says Wang Jing a campaigner for Greenpeace in China The Chinese government   quickly It punished three Chinese coauthors of the study removing them from their jobs In a   on the case Chinese authorities say that the researchers didnt get all the approvals they needed before carrying out the study Also the researchers told the children and their parents that this was a special kind of rice high in betacarotene but they didnt always say it was genetically modified They actually hid the fact that golden rice is a genetically modified crop says Wang For some people this makes all the difference in the world This is where golden rice gets caught up in the bigger argument over genetically engineered crops  specifically the argument over who benefits from them  who works in the Philippines for the   an advocate on behalf of small farmers says the main purpose of genetically modifying crops has not been to help people its been driven by profit A handful of corporations in developing countries has reaped billions in profits selling genetically modified seeds and proprietary herbicides she says Yet those companies have always claimed that this technology would benefit the poor The poor have always been at the center of each and every assertion about the importance of genetically modified organisms to mankind So this is the real significance of golden rice she says It gives biotech companies a chance to say See biotechnology   good for the poor Some proponents are already announcing that the debate is over that the golden rice product is the clincher Dont misunderstand me Dao says Golden rice is not purely public relations It is indeed supposed to help malnourished people  although she doesnt think its a very good way to help She thinks it will be more expensive and less effective than traditional nutrition programs This rice is mainly going to help the image of biotechnology she says This mixture of motives  helping people and promoting biotechnology  also shows up in the biography of the man whos now leading the golden rice effort  a native of Ireland spent more than  years in St Louis working for Monsanto the company that pioneered genetically engineered crops Hes listed as first inventor on some of Monsantos most valuable   He found the gene that made crops immune to the weedkiller Roundup That gene is now in soybeans corn and cotton grown on hundreds of millions of acres But along the way Barry also got interested in rice It was very exciting It was probably my favorite crop to work on he says Because you got to meet really passionate people Rice is something thats vital to large numbers of people I mean a couple of billion people eat it Ten years ago Barry left the corporate world and moved to the nonprofit International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines  the place where the idea of golden rice was born His job is now to shepherd it down the home stretch to the finish line Part of the job involves oldfashioned plant breeding to transfer the betacarotene genes into rice varieties that farmers like to grow But before farmers can get their hands on golden rice government regulators in each country need to agree that its safe Later this year the network of golden rice researchers will apply for approval in the Philippines After that theyll do the same in Bangladesh Yet thats only the first step Theyll have to roll out a marketing campaign on behalf of golden rice and the campaign has to reach the poorest people in the most remote villages Golden rice will be good for everybody but some people need it more Barry says Our job is to make sure that those people have access to it understand the value of it and ask for it This will be the final test of that yearold brainstorm  the idea that genetically altered rice actually could be a cheap selfmultiplying source of this vital nutrient
