Overweight or obese people are indeed more likely to die prematurely than people of normal weight say researchers whove analyzed the data Their conclusion throws cold water on recent studies that have found some excess weight isnt so bad Earlier this year researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   that overweight people actually live a bit longer than their skinnier peers But the   says that overweight people who already have high blood pressure high cholesterol or insulin resistance dont live longer and are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease Same goes for overweight people without those issues it turns out The CDC study didnt look at those factors which are considered major health risks and when lumped together are called   Sometimes the message changes when you look closer says Dr Caroline Kramer an endocrinologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto who led the study Its not OK to be overweight Its not OK to be obese even though you might not have metabolic abnormalities The notion of healthy obesity is appealing to patients and doctors If both states could really coexist it would mean that some of the  percent of Americans who are   might not have to lose lots of pounds to get or stay healthy Doctors wouldnt have to badger patients to lose weight And the health care system wouldnt have to invest lots of time and money in weightloss programs and bariatric surgery But figuring out who those healthy obese people are or even if they exist has turned out to be a challenge The CDC study compared peoples   or BMI to their longevity It found that obese people died earlier but that overweight people had a slightly lower risk of death than normalweight people  about  percent But that study which was published in February was heavily criticized because it didnt look at the health of the people studied You can be thin because youre dying of cancer The new study tried to make up for some of those shortcomings by looking not just at peoples BMI and age at death but at their metabolic status and whether or not they had cardiovascular disease The findings were published Monday in   The researchers conducted whats called a   that evaluated eight previously published studies of  people They found that people of any weight who had metabolic abnormalities were more likely to die earlier from all causes They also were more likely to have cardiovascular disease And the risk increased as the amount of excess weight increased And the more risk factors someone had the higher the likelihood of early death and disease People who were obese without having metabolic syndrome also had a higher risk of death so they werent protected by being healthier Thats because being obese affects many other things including hormones and growth factors Kramer says and not just commonly used measures like blood pressure But when the metaanalysis looked at overweight people it found that those who had normal metabolic profiles had no increased risk of death Still Kramer says theyre not off the hook The overweight people also had slightly elevated metabolic markers In other words their blood pressure was on the high end of normal Over time Kramer says their risks will increase especially if they keep gaining weight Increased death risks didnt show up until people had been observed for  years or more About onethird of Americans are   This study has its shortcomings too of course The data used didnt reveal peoples health behaviors and didnt track weight changes over time Clearly this isnt the last word on this contentious topic But it is further ammunition for the argument that as an accompanying   wrote No level of obesity is healthy
