Doctors treated Sacra with this plasma on at least two occasions Doctors believe Brantly has antibodies that Sacra lacks but his immune system needs to help him fight the deadly virus They are so similar it didnt surprise me that they were the same blood type said his Sacras spouse Debbie Sacra Sacras doctors at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha said their patient is improving every day    We were down to the last shot and it worked out great  said at a press conference Thursday about finding a blood match We were hoping to jump start his immunity At this point doctors dont feel like Sacra will relapse but theyve been cautious about predicting success Doctors in Africa told them there is typically a honeymoon period for patients after which they often get dramatically worse   Sacra however has gotten better daily   said his condition has been moved up to good from stable In addition to the blood transfusion doctors are giving Sacra aggressive supportive care to help his immune system fight the virus including electrolytes and IV fluids  The Nebraska doctors have also given Sacra an experimental drug that they will not name  He has received it every day and his doctors say they believe it is helping The American patients at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta  Brantly and Nancy Writebol    which was developed by the biotech firm     The drug had shown promise in small experiments with monkeys but had not been given to humans until doctors tried it in the Emory patients  Doctors there credit the drug with playing a role in their patients successful recoveries but the company has said there are no more doses of the drug available Its possible Sacra has received another   thats in production called TKMEbola Nebraska doctors think the current treatment has helped Sacras condition significantly  The first day Smith said was pretty rocky  Sacras spouse said he had to be sedated on the flight over On the second day of treatment he was already showing signs of improvement even with some abnormalities in his organ systems On the third day Smith told his colleagues that he liked the way this is going His doctors still want Sacra to eat more Debbie Sacra said he is still weak On Wednesday the hospital put an exercise bike in his room that he rode for  minutes before tiring out    Sacra used to ride  to  miles in one day at least a few times a week  Because doctors still know so little about how to defeat the Ebola virus Smith said Sacra as a physician has been a particularly helpful patient  He has been able to give detailed reports about his symptoms  Debbie Sacra said the CDC has told her that they are still trying to find out how her husband got sick in the first place He was in Liberia treating patients in an obstetrics clinic in Monrovia not working directly with Ebola patients  The CDC believe it happened during an emergency at the hospital Sacra said   So far no one else at Sacras clinic has gotten sick Sacra has done missionary health work for the past  years  He had flown to Monrovia in August after learning his colleagues from SIM had gotten sick Sacra worried Ebola would cause a domino effect on the already vulnerable Liberian health care system and that people with common ailments wouldnt get help When Sacra arrived in Monrovia thats exactly what he found  His spouse said there wasnt a single pair of latex gloves to buy in the entire city   Without protective equipment medical clinics shut down She says Sacra drove from hardware store to hardware store looking for boots to protect his staff When he was finally able to open the clinic for some it was too late She says dozens of pregnant women who needed Cesarean sections turned up at the clinic after having failed to find help anywhere else in the city   By the time these women arrived at Sacras clinic only the mothers lives could be saved Thankful for the support but also a little embarrassed by the all the attention Sacra and his spouse asked that Americans remember people are struggling with Ebola in Africa too He wants you to share his burden for the people of Liberia and West Africa Debbie Sacra said Every day and every week that we dont do what we can to stop Ebola in West Africa we are risking the possibility that it will not stay in West Africa
