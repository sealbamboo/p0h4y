They call themselves the Butterflies And thats not just wishful thinking When Gloria Amparo Maritza Asprilla Cruz and Mery Medina sweep into NPRs bureau in central London they are indeed as beautiful as butterflies bright clothing big beaming smiles They look around in wonder at the newsroom spread out before them laughing and joking as I make them a cup of tea Yet these are women whove led tough lives  born into Colombian society where violence and abuse are commonplace In  they started a group they call    Butterflies with New Wings Building a Future Their goal is to support women who are victims of abuse educating them about their rights and helping them report sexual crimes to the police Now they have been recognized for their activism In Geneva last week the Nansen Refugee Award  honoring humanitarian efforts for refugees and displaced people  was presented to the Butterflies These women are doing extraordinary work in the most challenging of contexts said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres   Their bravery goes beyond words The Butterflies are based in Buenaventura the countrys main Pacific port home to about  people Although the port is an important part of Colombian industry  percent of its population lives below the poverty line Of those  percent live in extreme poverty Social services are either scarce or nonexistent Violence is part of the daily scene Illegal armed groups battle against each other Since  turf wars between gangs throughout Colombia have forced  million people to flee their homes Eighty percent of the displaced are women The group is run entirely by volunteers led by Amparo Cruz and Medina There are  Butterflies throughout the citys urban and rural areas All of them are part of Buenaventuras AfroColombian population  those of African descent So far theyve helped more than  women and their families In some cases vulnerable women are sheltered in a Butterflys own home As is all too common in conflict zones women and children are the targets of armed gangs who recruit children as members and who also murder torture and kidnap More than half of all displaced women have experienced a sexual or genderrelated crime with rape often by several men the most common In the first half of   women were killed as a result of gang activity They were all found dismembered Amparo is one of the Butterflies founding members Through an interpreter she told me how the group was born In  the state issued a law she says A law tackling violence against women This law inspired Amparo and other activists to work together Nine groups joined forces to found Butterflies bringing over  volunteers and  coordinators together The organization works on camaraderie Amparo tells me The spirit of solidarity runs very deep Theres a strong sense of looking out for one another I ask Medina what life is like for the women of Buenaventura Not easy she says with a heavy sigh There are very few opportunities for women and the culture is that women should stay at home Despite attracting negative attention from the armed gangs Butterflies march through the citys streets and speak publicly for womens rights They organize meetings between politicians victims and activists pressing for more government action on womens rights They travel by foot bike or bus through dangerous neighborhoods helping women whose cases have come to their attention And they can reach into just about any neighborhood Theres a Butterfly flying in every area Medina tells me proudly That way the group has an idea of whats happening across the city The women tell me about a recent case a young woman in a rural area a victim of abuse raped on a daily basis Amparo called on her network to help this woman escape to the safety of a Butterflys home Luz is another case study Forced from her village by fighting she settled in Buenaventura where she became a community leader Gangs threatened to rape her yearold daughter When Luz intervened the men gangraped her instead She is still traumatized and told the Butterflies You never forget that moment the rape and what happened Ive never felt the same again My big smile has gone The Butterflies helped Luz report her rape to the authorities She now works with them sharing her advice and support with other rape survivors The Nansen Refuge award means a lot to the Butterflies Its a big opportunity to show the world the situation of AfroColombian women and victims of violence in Colombia Amparo says So where do they go from here Now is the time to build up says Cruz The Butterflies want to create a permanent safe house for victims of violence and sexual abuse They want to add education to their agenda too Its important to change the mentality of the young people Amparo tells me If you educate the young children you will have happy men and happy women who respect each others rights The  prize that comes with their award will doubtless help with this dream Will there ever be a time when the Butterflies wont be needed I ask She smiles and says This would be a glorious moment There would be peace for everybody She concedes Were not confident that the armed conflict and violence will end soon But in a peaceful world we can still work for the women because there will still be a lot to do There will still be Butterflies around
