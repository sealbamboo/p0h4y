Theres a widely held belief that women experience moodiness and fuzzy thinking because of the drop in estrogen during menopause And women have looked to hormone replacement therapy for relief But researchers increasingly think theres not much of a link between declining levels of estrogen during menopause and cognition Scientists at Stanford University tested the memory and overall mental sharpness of  healthy postmenopausal women They then measured the womens natural hormone levels They were particularly interested in a type of estrogen called   which typically drops after menopause The scientists also divided the women into two groups those who had gone into menopause within the last six years and those who were more than  years past menopause Thats because its been thought that taking supplemental estrogen shortly after menopause helps women stay sharp more than if they start later But in both younger and older postmenopausal women higher estradiol levels didnt seem to affect cognition The findings were   in the   The findings imply that for younger women who are considering   theres no need to rush into it because of the belief that its going to improve memory   a neurologist and the studys lead researcher told Shots Henderson says the issue of   during and post menopause has stumped researchers for years While its clear that some women experience haziness during the menopausal transition research is less clear on whether menopause causes any longterm cognitive changes Though a few studies do suggest that menopause could be linked to a small amount of cognitive impairment most recent research Henderson says havent found any link Hendersons study could get us one step close to solving the puzzle Still its no means the last word I dont think the finding is surprising says Dr   a researcher at Harvard and Brigham and Womens Hospital But she tells Shots the results have to be interpreted cautiously Manson is a principal investigator with Womens Health Initiative a long term national health study   in  that hormone replacement therapy didnt protect women from heart attacks and stroke after menopause That research prompted many women to stop taking supplemental estrogen But women still worry that not taking HRT means their brains arent working so well While this new finding about estrogen and cognition seems to make sense Mason says this sort of observational study can only look at how hormone levels are associated with womens ability to think It cant prove for sure that estrogen has no effect on the brain Another issue is that the study only looked at womens natural hormone levels More research needs to be done before we can know for sure how supplemental estrogen affects womens mood and memory  Henderson says he has already started looking at the effects of hormone supplements on the same group of women And he also wants to find out if higher levels of the hormone progesterone could be associated with better memory and thinking This study suggests that it is at least in younger women That was an unexpected finding Henderson says and one thats worth looking into some more
