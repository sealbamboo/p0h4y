A Merck & Co. drug shrank tumors in about 18.5% of women with an aggressive form of breast cancer in a small clinical trial, an early sign of the potential of immunotherapy to treat breast tumors.. The Merck drug, Keytruda, was approved by U.S. regulators in September to treat a deadly form of skin cancer, melanoma. Studies have shown the potential of Keytruda and similar drugs developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Roche Holding AG to treat several other types of tumors including lung cancer.
