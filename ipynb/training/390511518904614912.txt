Word on the street has it that despite how clean your hands feel after using a hand sanitizer theyre actually still dirty  and using sanitizers might actually lower your resistance to disease Is it true When it comes to safety and effectiveness the main concern with hand sanitizers is triclosan which is the main antibacterial ingredient in nonalcoholic hand sanitizers  Theres no good evidence that triclosancontaining products have a benefit says Allison Aiello associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan In Europe and the United States hospitals wont even use them she notes its thought that they dont reduce infections or illness  Dr Anna Bowen a medical epidemiologist at The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says Triclosancontaining products dont provide any disease protection beyond what you get from washing with soap and water Research has shown that triclosan can disrupt the endocrine system amplifying testosterone In animal studies it reduced muscle strength It may also harm the immune system Whether these findings add up to human toxicity isnt established yet but the FDA is currently reviewing the issue  A more established concern When you expose bacteria to triclosan it can elicit antibiotic resistance says Aiello Once the resistance is transferred pathogenic bacteria can become resistant to many types of antibiotics Quaternary ammonium another antibacterial found in nonalcoholic hand sanitizers has also been shown to elicit antibiotic resistance she says The main concern with triclosan however is that it doesnt protect against viruses or fungi  Colds are caused by viruses not bacteria Aiello points out  Skip it  Alcoholbased sanitizers on the other hand are fairly effective and safe Hand sanitizers that are  alcohol are good at killing bacterial pathogens says Bowen  They can also kill some viruses but not all of them  such as the noroviruses that can cause cruiseship outbreaks  Theyre not a panacea but if you cant wash your hands a squirt of an alcoholbased hand gel is a good idea she says  Adds Aiello If you cant get to a sink quickly an alcoholbased sanitizer is a good alternative to washing with soap and water  One caveat They dont work on visibly dirty hands  the alcohol cant get past the dirt And that brings us back to soap and water  which is both safe and effective Try to suds up after you use the toilet and before you prepare food studies show that doing so can drastically reduce the risk of diarrhea  Handwashing campaigns reduce absenteeism in schools says Bowen and that means parents miss fewer days of work too To see these effects though you have to wash your hands correctly  You need to wash for about  seconds to remove the bacteria and viruses from your hands says Aiello Most people dont wash their hands properly You need to cover all parts of your hands including under your nails  and then dry your hands well How long is  seconds About as long as it takes to sing the Happy Birthday song two times through So feel free to do that as you suds up
