A few months ago my yearold daughter Paulina was suffering from a bad headache right before bedtime She went to lie down and I sat beside her stroking her head After a few minutes she looked up at me and said Everything in the room looks really small And I suddenly remembered When I was young I too would see things far away as I once described it to my mother  as if everything in the room were at the wrong end of a telescope The episodes could last anywhere from a few minutes to an hour but they eventually faded as I grew older I asked Paulina if this was the first time she had experienced such a thing She shook her head and said it happened every now and then When I was a little girl I told her it would happen to me when I had a fever or was nervous I told her not to worry and that it would go away on its own Soon she fell asleep and I ran straight to my computer Within minutes I discovered that there was an actual name for what turns out to be a very rare affliction  Alice in Wonderland syndrome Episodes usually include micropsia objects appear small or macropsia objects appear large Some sufferers perceive their own body parts to be larger or smaller For me and Paulina furniture a few feet away seemed small enough to fit inside a dollhouse Dr John Todd a British psychiatrist gave the disorder its name in a  paper noting that the misperceptions resemble Lewis Carrolls descriptions of what happened to Alice Its also known as Todds syndrome Having had it myself I had a sense it wasnt dangerous But I wanted to know more I contacted several neurologists whose work with the syndrome I found online and learned more about its possible triggers infections migraine stress and drugs particularly some cough medicines Epilepsy and stroke were sometimes linked as well the researchers said Some even believe that Lewis Carroll who described his migraines in his journal may have suffered from it Alice in Wonderland Syndrome is not an optical problem or a hallucination Instead it is most likely caused by a change in a portion of the brain likely the parietal lobe that processes perceptions of the environment Some specialists consider it a type of aura a sensory warning preceding a migraine And the doctors confirmed that it usually goes away by adulthood Several neurologists have done MRIs on patients with the condition though once the bout has passed theres usually no sign of unusual brain activity Dr Sheena Aurora a Stanford neurologist and migraine specialist was the first to scan the brain of someone  a yearold girl  in the middle of an episode According to Dr Auroras  report electrical activity caused abnormal blood flow in the parts of the brain that control vision and process texture shape and size The brain of someone with Alice in Wonderland syndrome is just a little bit different from those with other auras she said Dr Aurora hopes to develop a database of patients with other doctors so they can study the condition and other migrainerelated auras Out of the  patients she has worked with I was only the third person she had ever spoken to with the syndrome She asked for a family tree denoting which relatives had experienced it so she could perform genetic testing to search for a link Sometimes she said one single case can change the way we understand things I soon discovered my yearold son Dean had had episodes for years  though he had never mentioned it to me until I brought it up He recently began suffering from migraines I learned that my mother experienced the syndrome as a girl her symptoms were so bad that sometimes she couldnt walk My sister a migraine sufferer had experienced it as a child as had my brother who remembered having it during a bout of mononucleosis which is sometimes caused by EpsteinBarr virus another known syndrome trigger My first cousin Jamie said she had it into her s at a time of great stress in her life Dr Aurora was fascinated to learn of so many people in one family being affected the condition is considered so rare that there have been few studies of it Dr Grant Liu a pediatric neuroopthalmologist at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia said his research into the syndrome shows that even small changes to the brain can yield dramatic effects When those areas involved in determining size shape and distance malfunction he said the resulting visual experience can be extraordinary Dr Liu recently   all of them who had the syndrome as children between  and  Thirtythree percent of the cases were traced to some sort of infection  percent to migraine and another  percent to head trauma In about half of the cases however no cause was found A quarter of the subjects with no migraine history eventually developed migraines Dr Liu also found In addition  percent were still experiencing symptoms Dr Liu said it took time for family members of those studied to admit that they too had the syndrome which leads him to believe that it may be more widespread than people think A lot of family members didnt own up to it on the first goround said Dr Liu They were almost too embarrassed People want to be told that theyre not crazy
