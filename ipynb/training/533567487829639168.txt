Tori Tomalia a mother of three young children from Ann Arbor Michigan was diagnosed last year with stage IV lung cancer She was only  I actually thought it was impossible for a nonsmoker to get lung cancer at my age she told NBC News Emily Bennett Taylor a healthy athlete from Los Angeles California was even younger when she got her diagnosis at  Her doctors were also surprised and brushed off her   as asthma Lung cancer is the top   and some medical experts say that they are seeing more patients in their s and s many of them nonsmokers But because lung cancer carries the stigma of smoking experts say it is often overlooked in nonsmoking patients  and doesnt get the kind of funding or support given to breast cancer and other big killers One of the big problems is there is such a big association in the publics mind between smoking and lung cancer said Dr Lecia Sequist a medical oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston No one deserves to get lung cancer Sequist added But we are seeing a lot of patients who never smoked or smoked years ago or only in small amounts We just dont know why Of the estimated  new lung cancer diagnoses among women each year in the United States a shocking  will die according to the   The disease takes more lives than breast prostate colon and pancreatic cancers combined and its survival rate is only  percent Besides smoking exposure to secondhand smoke asbestos radon or having a family history can put a woman at risk Doctors and and their patients say its the stigma associated with smoking that is hurting them most impeding research and compromising good patient care According to the Washington DCbased Lung Cancer Alliance for every person who dies of breast cancer  is spent on research funds yet less than  is allocated for those who die of   Activist Arielle Densen lost her mother a nonsmoker to lung cancer and is on a mission to bring awareness to the issue during November   The statistics on lung cancer are so staggering and so many young nonsmoking individuals are dying from this disease and no one is really talking about it Densen said If you factor in private donations the funding gap widens incredibly she said   alone raised  million in  whereas the largest lung cancer groups bring in about  to  million a year Emily Bennett Taylor said her lung cancer diagnosis came in  when she was seemingly in top physical shape I played volleyball in college and still played a couple of times a week she said For all intents and purposes I was healthy She had just done a mile mountain hike when she said she noticed a cough and wheezing that got worse and worse and a pain in her right shoulder blade They thought maybe I had allergies or had developed asthma late in life said Taylor She was given an inhaler and had to wait months before seeing a pulmonologist My doctor said Nobody your age and healthy ever got lung cancer  dont worry she said But Taylor kept thinking about a   a UC Berkeley student and captain of the crew team who had been diagnosed with lung cancer at  I pushed for an Xray she said Doctors found a stage IV tumor in her right lung Taylors cancer had metastasized outside of the lung so the standard of care was palliative but she fought for unconventional treatment She moved to New York City and persuaded a top surgeon at Mt Sinai Hospital to shrink the tumor through chemotherapy and then remove her lung She has since had followup radiation and  months later is now cancer free Taylor said she hopes no other nonsmoking women will face the stigma she experienced We dont look at any other cancer this way she said People think you did it to yourself or made a poor choice Its time we started realizing it isnt just an old smokers disease Taylor now volunteers with the   which this year launched the firstever Genomics of Young Lung Cancer study for women under  The study is looking for a unique cancer subtype that might be treated differently Genomic testing shows great promise in the treatment of cancer in young women according to Dr Deborah Morosini is vice president of clinical development for Foundation Medicine Inc in Cambridge Massachusetts which is doing the genetic testing for the study What has been an enormously lethal disease with lack of pharma has been really turned around with the radical advent of target therapies she told NBC News This is something that can actually move the field forward Morosini a pathologist who worked in biotech was propelled into advocacy after the death of her sister actress   wife of actor Christopher Reeve She too was a nonsmoker and died of lung cancer in  at age  My life was fragmented and I wanted everything to be guided by Dana and Chris memory she said Morosini said her sister might have benefitted from new therapies that pinpoint the genetic makeup of a tumor and target its driver We can uncover note  genes and you can find whatever the driver is for the tumor about  percent of the time she said Tailored drugs can give a patient more time  months and sometimes a few years she said but the tumor eventually become resistant Thats where the magic in genomics comes in said Morosini We can look at the tumor again and see what else we can target  who is now  has benefited from this therapy For  months she has been on the new drug Xalkori which has fewer side effects than chemotherapy and is cautiously optimistic about her future She urges young women who have a persistent cough to ask their doctor for a lung scanFor months everyone told me I had asthma a cold bronchitis said Tomalia Dont let your doctor exclude the possibility of lung cancer she said There might be something else going on Dont let them write it off if youre a nonsmoker  its possible
