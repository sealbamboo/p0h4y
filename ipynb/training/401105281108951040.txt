Oregon might be seen as a complete failure or a surprising success when it comes to its health insurance exchange One the one hand the states website has yet to allow a single person to enroll Thats a big problem for the folks who are hoping to qualify for subsidies and buy insurance that will start Jan  But for the states poorest residents a workaround has helped  people secure coverage in Oregons version of Medicaid The state is one of   to adults who havent previously qualified One of them is Kyle Thompson who lives in the farming community of Jefferson Since his work as a tile cutter ended during the recession he hasnt been able to afford health care But his two children qualified for Medicaid the Oregon Health Plan and the state had all the familys income and other details on file So when the state sent out about  applications to families like the Thompsons  with incomes less than  percent of the federal poverty level  to enroll them in Medicaid they jumped on the opportunity I filled it out I sent it off Me and my wife are really excited in having the health care coming up because its not something thats been an option for us he said Oregon Health Plan spokeswoman Patty Wentz says the letters were so successful another batch will go out any day now Theres already been a big response People will call and ask if its real she says Can I really get health care coverage When they hear that they can theyre so grateful One call center staff told me that the person she was talking to said please tell everyone there thank you thank you Heres why the Medicaid side of this is working for Oregon When the state set up its exchange website it paid more than  million to software specialist Oracle to make a onestop shop for health insurance for everyone in the state including people buying private policies with or without subsidies children qualifying for the Oregon Health Kids Plan as well as the Oregon Health Plan Medicaid I guess one could argue in retrospect we bit off more than other states Gov John Kitzhaber recently said But he added it was an intentional decision Weve got a single portal for Medicaid and for the people who are coming in that are not Medicaid eligible And once we work out these difficulties I think the people in Oregon will be ahead of the pack Officials with the website says theyre cautiously optimistic insurance agents and navigators will be able to help customers determine their eligibility for a tax subsidy and choose a health plan by Dec  But the public wont have access for a while because of problems with the website Instead a series of application fairs have been arranged so that everyone can use oldfashioned paper to apply in time to get covered starting in  Meanwhile in Texas the getouttothepeople approach hasnt had much success Only about  Texans have signed up for private insurance and the state isnt expanding its Medicaid program Navigator Alysia Greer has been trying to encourage signups from a folding table in the lobby of a medical building in northwest Houston As people walk by she offers them brochures and asks Does everyone in your household have health insurance Most walk right by but Dorothy Green who already has Medicaid grabs a packet for a neighbor who doesnt drive Greer helps Green but her hands are a bit tied A Texas law doesnt restrict navigators yet but it gives state regulators that option Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott says hes still   and has asked the   to regulate the navigators He thinks they might misuse confidential information they gather while helping people sign up for health plans We need to have better training for these people who are  may be completely unversed in how to deal with someones private information he says Alysia Greer takes issue with Abbott calling her unprepared She says patient privacy and security were a big part of her navigator training which lasted over  hours and involved several tests She adds that Abbott may be unnecessarily frightening uninsured people I do think it will scare some people away Because there are a lot of people who are very influenced of course by what the attorney general and other people of political status say she says Greer says when she assists people while using a computer she turns the screen towards them and away from herself and never even sees Social Security numbers or income information In any case the Affordable Care Act prohibits disclosure of personal information and imposes a  fine for doing so And navigators who did steal information would also face  years in prison under federal identity theft law Nevertheless the Texas Department of Insurance is currently working on more rules for the navigators in Texas
