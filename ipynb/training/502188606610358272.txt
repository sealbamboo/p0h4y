A riot broke out in Liberias West Point slum Wednesday after residents woke up to learn their neighborhood had been completely sealed off by the government People shouted and hurled rocks at security forces who retaliated by shooting into the crowd Tension had been mounting for some time in Liberia where there are now more than  reported cases of Ebola Late last night in a bid to curb the outbreak Liberias president announced a  pm curfew in the capital Monrovia That order also included the quarantine of West Point one of the citys poorest neighborhoods and home to some  people The announcement came just days after West Point residents raided an Ebola holding center that had been set up in their community for people suspected of harboring the virus On Saturday the centers  patients were dragged out of the facility along with mattresses and other items contaminated with blood NPRs Nurith Aizenman and Nicole Beemsterboer were in West Point when the riot erupted With shots ringing out around them they raced to their vehicle Speaking to NPRs   from Monrovia Aizenman told Robert Siegel that the violence began as police were attempting to escort the family of a government minister out of the neighborhood Below is an edited excerpt of the interview Well what you heard there was producer Nicole Beemsterboer and myself trying to extricate ourselves from the riot But let me take you back We had gotten permission to go into West Point And we had made our way past several blockades that security forces had set up sealing off the neighborhood And we were walking along one of two very narrow roads in West Point To paint the picture this is an extremely poor denselypacked neighborhood The area consists of a small finger of land jutting out from central Monrovia into the Atlantic Ocean So as we were walking up that road we saw the group of police escorting a local official and her family including several children out And right on their heels was a throng of very angry people They were shouting and they started throwing chunks of concrete and smaller rocks Things escalated almost immediately Everyone started rushing toward us Security forces started firing shots in rapid succession At least one person was shot  a young teenager He looked about  Resentment had been building for some time now One of the most recent grievances was that the government had opened a holding facility for people with symptoms of Ebola right in the heart of the neighborhood People were upset because the government hadnt explained what the purpose of the facility was Officials were also bringing in suspected Ebola cases from other neighborhoods and the facility wasnt providing care It was just there to isolate people It had essentially become a dumping ground for people with Ebola People were dying there Then over the weekend a crowd stormed that facility They carried off supplies including mattresses covered in blood which may have been highly infectious Ebola is spread by contact with an infected persons bodily fluids including blood And now these residents of West Point were being put under complete quarantine  no one in no one out for at least three weeks Theyre essentially being told You have a deadly and contagious disease running through your neighborhood and you cant leave So this place was a pressure cooker I met with one of the top officials of Liberias national police just a short while ago and he tells me that he has had meetings with elders and other community leaders from West Point since the riot And he says theyre working on a plan to make the quarantine less onerous Thats going to include beefing up the police presence to keep the peace in the neighborhood and also providing food and other supplies But its worth noting that this is a community of tens of thousands of people and so far its unclear when or frankly even whether the first food delivery is going to occur Were obviously taking every precaution that we can while still making every effort to find out whats going on and tell our listeners the story What were doing is making sure that we avoid contact with any persons You really dont want to touch anyone or anything So we walk around with big thick rubber boots and were very very careful about not entering homes and not touching anyone But you know its a challenging story to cover Thats for sure
