People who watch television for three hours a day or more are twice as likely to die in the next few years as people who watch little or no TV a new study has found Its the latest in a  that show sitting still   But this one has a few twists TV watching seemed deadlier than sitting at a desk or driving a car all day  and the effect was seen in relatively young healthy affluent people So it doesnt appear that people were watching TV because they didnt feel well Our findings suggest adults may consider increasing their physical activity avoid long sedentary periods and reduce television watching to no longer than one to two hours each day said Dr MartinezGonzalez of the University of Navarra in Pamplona Spain MartinezGonzalez and colleagues used an ongoing study of  people with an average age of  They watched less TV on average than most Americans   hours a day compared to an average of  hours a day for working Americans measured by the US  The Spanish volunteers spent an average of two hours a day on the computer and just about an hour a day driving They were followed for just over eight years Participants reporting three or more hours a day of television viewing had a twofold higher risk of mortality than those reporting less than one hour a day MartinezGonzalez and colleagues wrote in the Journal of the American Heart Association The volunteers in the study seemed healthier than the average comparable Spaniard  over the eight years only  died while  people of similar age sex income and so on would have been expected to Of those who died  died from heart disease or stroke  died from cancer and  died of something else For every   over and above one hour a day the volunteers were  percent more likely to die from heart disease or stroke  percent more likely to die of cancer and  percent more likely to die from something else and thats taking in account their age sex whether they smoked whether they were obese and whether they ate a healthy Mediterranean diet This fits in with other recent research that shows for every two hours spent sitting in front of the computer or television the average American  of colon cancer by  percent of endometrial cancer by  percent and of lung cancer by  percent Why would that be No one yet knows the answer but if youre the type of person who has a lot of time but spends it sitting in front of the television you also have other sedentary behaviors like not going outside too much or engaging in physical activity said Dr Nieca Goldberg a cardiologist at New York University who was not involved in the study MartinezGonzalez thought it might be because people tend to binge on junk food when watching TV but even when they took that into account TV watching seemed especially deadly Animal studies suggest that activities like watching TV might affect how the body manages cholesterol or carbohydrates or it might raise inflammation  which is linked with cancer and heart disease Compared to driving a car or doing work on a computer television is a very passive activity Goldberg said Other studies have suggested that watching television lowers the metabolism than even sitting and doing nothing Theres an easy fix however  less TV and more exercise There are lots of ways you can put physical activity into your daily life like taking stairs instead of the elevator walking to work Goldberg said Because I live in New York City I walk to work she added Many people cant do that but I suggest if youre driving to work park further away in a parking lot so you end up walking a longer distance to the entrance Some other studies suggest that    total time sitting can cause obesity and other disease even if people hit the gym but breaking up the day would help Goldberg said During lunch hour why not take a walk around the block The American Heart Association recommends at least  minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity she said Walk to the store spend time walking around the mall Take stairs instead of the elevator Go outside and get a walking group together
