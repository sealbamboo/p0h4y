As I discussed in a   sex therapist David Schnarch writes about the difference between a persons genital prime and his or her sexual prime  For most of us the genital prime happens during adolescence and our s when the body is in its best shape However the mind may not be as welldeveloped sexually Schnarch says that a persons sexual prime is actually well beyond what most of us think of as the hotandheavy sex years  more like middle age than high school So is senior sex actually something you should be looking forward to Does it get better with age  According to a   in the November  issue of Psychological Science marital satisfaction may actually improve once your kids leave the nest and this higher satisfaction level extends to the bedroom  In fact many of my colleagues in the world of sex therapy claim that emptynesters tend to have more disposable income and more opportunity to enjoy quality time with their partner Not only that but as we age we benefit from accepting ourselves as we are knowing what we like and not being afraid to ask for it  The New England Journal of Medicine in  published a   of  to yearolds in the United States  The survey involved twohour facetoface interviews with  men and women around the country  Researchers also took blood saliva and other samples so as to learn more about hormone levels sexrelated infections and other health issues They even tested how well seniors could see taste hear and smell  things that affect being able to have and enjoy sex  Among survey respondents  of those aged  to   of those aged  to  and  of people  to  reported having sex with a partner in the previous year  Of those who were active most said they did it two to three times a month or more Not only that more than half of those aged  to  said they still gave or received oral sex as did about a third of  to yearolds  Of course not everything in your sexual future is rainbows and multiple orgasms Sexual issues may arise at any age But in the case of this study half of the sexually active respondents reported having at least one sexual issue to contend with The most common issue for men was erection trouble  As for women they experienced low desire  vaginal dryness  and inability to have an orgasm  In addition one out of seven men used Viagra or other substances to improve sex  Still these issues dont deter them Just last year   published in the British Medical Journal showed that  of  to yearolds were sexually active   Take that Miley
