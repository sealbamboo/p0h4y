Fat can be breathed out as well as burned off as you lose weight biochemists who have studied metabolism at a microscopic level say But they warn that people still need to huff and puff with exercise to keep slim  hyperventilating on its own will not do the trick The Australian team traced the route of fat out of the body as atoms  Their findings are published in the Christmas edition of the British Medical Journal When fat is broken down to its constituent parts a couple of things happen Chemical bonds are broken a process which releases heat and fuel to power muscles But the atoms  the stuff fat is made of  remain and much of these leave the body via the lungs as carbon dioxide say the scientists  Fat from food is stored in the body in cells called adipocytes It is stored as a compound called triglyceride  Triglyceride consists of three kinds of atoms carbon hydrogen and oxygen and this means that when it is broken down around a fifth of it forms water HO and fourfifths becomes carbon dioxide CO The water formed may be excreted in the urine faeces sweat breath tears or other bodily fluids and is readily replenished by drinking water But the exhaled carbon in CO can only be replaced by eating food or consuming beverages such as fruit juice  The study authors Ruben Meerman and Andrew Brown from The University of New South Wales said None of this biochemistry is new but for unknown reasons it seems nobody has thought of performing these calculations before  These results show that the lungs are the primary excretory organ for weight loss They estimate that an average person loses at least g of carbon every day and roughly a third of that occurs as we sleep Replacing one hour of rest with moderate intensity exercise such as jogging removes an additional g of carbon from the body raising the total by about a fifth to g  So to keep weight off you need to balance what you eat against what you burn off and exhale  Losing weight requires unlocking the carbon stored in fat cells thus reinforcing that oftenheard refrain of eat less move more say the researchers Duane Mellor of the British Dietetics Association likened fat metabolism to burning petrol in a car  it makes heat and drives movement but also creates and releases waste The atoms left after breaking down fat for energy are like the exhaust fumes he said Dr Tom Barber associate professor of endocrinology at Warwick University and University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire said the work was interesting and novel and busted the misperception that fat is simply burned off as energy  something that even many doctors think But it does not change the health message that we need to do exercise to keep fat off he said
