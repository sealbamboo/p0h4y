In theory or in a more perfect universe our family members wouldnt have a hard time deciding what to do when we were near death However painful the task the decisions would be clear We would have prepared a written document an advance directive stating what we wanted doctors to do or not do and our abouttobe survivors would follow our instructions Simple But most people havent taken that step or if they have their family members dont know where the advance directives are or their doctors dont know that they exist or whats in them It turns out theyre only part of the puzzle for all kinds of reasons said Dr Alexia Torke an assistant professor of medicine at Indiana University and a bioethics researcher at the Regenstrief Institute a nonprofit organization specializing in health care research How do surrogates actually make decisions for relatives who can no longer direct their own care Its hardly a hypothetical question a British study published in The Lancet in  found that about   lacked the mental capacity to make decisions because they were unconscious delirious demented or otherwise cognitively impaired Dr Torke and her colleagues talked to  surrogates who had made major decisions  about lifesustaining treatments surgery or other procedures or about where the patient would go when discharged  on behalf of incapacitated seniors admitted to two Indianapolis hospitals These were not legally designated health care proxies for the most part because most patients had no advance directive and hadnt chosen a decision maker The surrogates were simply the family members  mostly daughters  to whom the doctors turned for guidance What these relatives disclosed in faceto face interviews lasting an average of  minutes mirrored   Surrogates   on considerations other than what the patients want The researchers who published their findings recently in The Journal of Clinical Ethics analyzed these surrogates decision making and identified two basic approaches which they labeled patientcentered or surrogatecentered Patientcentered decisions focused on the sick persons wishes and interests If they couldnt rely on documents the relatives might recall past conversations to infer what the person wanted More often it was based on a general knowledge of the person Dr Torke said They knew Mom was a fighter or they knew she wouldnt want to suffer  They also tried to reach decisions based on what they deemed the patients best interests sometimes seeking the advice of a physician or other professional This is how ethicists say we should proceed If you dont have instructions from the patient you go with whats called substituted judgment If the patient were sitting in the room with you what would she want And if you dont know that you opt for beneficence  that is for what appears to be in her best interests Those tactics can still be problematic The surrogates often found it stressful to make such big decisions without more information they said and of course they could have interpreted a patients interests differently than the patient would have or guessed the patients preferences incorrectly But at least they were trying to do what they thought their loved one would want Decision making that is surrogatecentered involved a different set of factors the researchers found For instance family members might proceed based on what they would want in a similar situation consistent with the concept of the golden rule Dr Torke said They might also be guided by their own spiritual or religious beliefs Several surrogates explained that they had followed Gods plan though they had differing views on what that might be The majority of study participants were Protestant but we found rationales that were both accepting of death or fighting against it Dr Torke said Surrogates also drew other family members into the decision seeking consensus Regardless of what happens to the patient families have to live with each other Dr Torke said Its a way to share the responsibility and perhaps to avoid guilt All of which is understandable and maybe this is what some people have in mind when they select or dont select a family member to make decisions if they are incapacitated They want someone who cares about them to weigh all the issues and then do whatever she and other family members think best But many readers here have made known   their desire to have their lives end in just the way they have determined If thats you then this small study points to potential pitfalls It underscores the importance of having an advance directive and distributing copies to anyone who might be involved including your doctors A   form may work better for people who are chronically ill and near the end of their lives Beyond that its a call for having conversations with your family members about what you want Dr Torke said  thats conversations plural Your ideas and your health can change over time and your surrogate needs to understand your current thinking And crucially you will want to choose a surrogate whose values and beliefs are close to yours if you want him to follow your plan rather than try to divine the Almightys You cant write down all the possibilities Dr Torke said Find someone you trust
