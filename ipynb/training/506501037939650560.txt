Weve   a lot this year about how theres a major rethinking of fat happening in the US Turns out eating foods with fat  everything from avocados and nuts to    doesnt make us fat But eating too many carbohydrates  particularly the heavily refined starches found in bagels white pasta and crackers  does our collective waistlines no favors A new study   in the   adds to the body of evidence that cutting back on carbs not fat can lead to more weight loss Researchers at Tulane University tracked two groups of dieters for one year The participants ranged in age from their early s to their mids and included a mix of AfricanAmericans and Caucasians The lowcarb group which reduced their carb consumption to about  percent of their daily calories lost almost three times as much weight as the lowfat dieters who got about  to  percent of their calories from carbs The lowfat group lost about  pounds whereas the lowcarb groups average weight loss was almost  pounds Participants in the two groups were eating about the same amount of calories  one of the study authors and an associate professor of epidemiology at Tulane says she had anticipated some difference in weight loss between the two groups But the size of the effect  the nearly pound difference in weight loss  was surprising she says So what kinds of meals were the lowcarb dieters eating Typically in the morning they were eating eggs says Bazzano Other breakfast items included small portions of highprotein highfiber bread with either butter or other kinds of oily spread As for lunch and dinner the lowcarb dieters ate lots of vegetables salads and protein including fish chicken and some red meat They had generous portions of healthy fats such as olive oils canola and other plantbased oils Fat accounted for a sizable part of their diet from  percent to  percent of their total daily calories including about  percent from saturated fat Bazzano says with so many people still abiding by lowfat recommendations a diet so high in fat might not sound like a good weightloss strategy Its not the general perception she says But in fact there are a spate of studies that have come to the same conclusion about the benefits of swapping a lowfat highcarb strategy for a pattern of eating that emphasizes healthy fats and lower carbohydrate consumption Its not just waistlines that respond The lowcarb healthy fats approach has been shown to cut the risk of heart disease One big   published in the   found that a Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes by  percent compared to a lowfat diet Research   last year in the   which compared a lowglycemicindex diet  which minimizes refined starches  with a more traditional lowfat diet also documented advantages We saw improvements in triglycerides good cholesterol and the possibility of lower chronic inflammation among the lower carb group   study author   of Harvard Medical School and Boston Childrens Hospital told us Heres the fascinating part Ludwig also found that when people stopped eating so many refined carbohydrates they burned off about  more calories per day compared to those eating a higher carb lower fat diet Too much refined carbohydrates  white bread white rice potato products  all the foods that crept into our diets as weve followed the lowfat craze has undermined our metabolism says Ludwig In other words the highcarb lowfat pattern of eating caused us to become hungrier and burn off fewer calories he says Whats happening in the body when we follow this pattern of eating is still the subject of much research but Ludwig says the thinking goes like this Eating too many carbs can overstimulate the release of insulin and direct more calories into storage in the fat cells Its a doublewhammy for weight gain Ludwig says Weve been told for decades that if you dont want fat on your body dont put fat into your body Its a very appealing notion but the problem is its wrong
