In the mountains of western North Carolina Julia Buckner spends hours driving around what she calls Gods country Buckner is a health navigator Her job  and her passion  is to help the rural residents of some of the poorest counties in North Carolina sign up for coverage through the Affordable Care Act But for  out of  people she talks with it seems as if theres nothing she can do Theyre too poor to qualify for affordable health insurance in North Carolina because theyre in whats called the   They dont earn enough to qualify for a subsidy under the health law and they cant get Medicaid because North Carolina is one of the   that decided not to expand the program under the health law The expansion in other places covers childless lowincome adults who previously didnt get qualify for Medicaid I take someone whos working poor I ask them to come see me and then I find out that not only are they poor but theyre too poor for me to help says Buckner who grew up in the area Its almost as if I wished I hadnt seen them So now the name of the game is finding inventive ways that lowincome consumers can earn enough to reach the poverty line in order to qualify for a subsidy Sometimes Buckner says people havent thought of all the various things they can count as income like a woman she spoke with who cleans houses for a living We went through a bunch of questions like what else could you consider income And theres this light that goes off Oh Can I use the ginseng And I said sure she explains The woman can earn money selling wild ginseng from her yard plus some extra money from a few new cleaning clients That additional income pushes her over the poverty line She was able to sign up for coverage on the exchange with a hefty subsidy Other people may be able to pick up a extra hours at work or count on extra money from odd jobs  taking care of an aging neighbor or babysitting for example Folks are trying to use every source of income whether its selling tomatoes from their garden or perhaps theyve never actually sold the hay off of their field theyve just always let their nephew cut it for free explains Buckner Or they might be able to get coverage under other provisions of the law About  minutes away from Graham County the local courthouse in Swain County lets Buckner set up shop in their small claims court when its not in session Wandering around town she spots a young man with a thick red beard and a flannel shirt playing banjo in front of the bank She waits for a break in his playing and approaches Do you have health insurance she asks I do not replies John Martin who adds that he used to have coverage through his moms plan but lost it when he turned  Now he works for the railroad but during the offseason hes unemployed And he earns less than  which is  percent of the federal poverty level for a single adult But it turns out that hes only  Bingo The law allows people under  to stay on a parents plan And it worked Martin was able to get coverage through his mom and is now insured Even for those a little older there might still be options At a church in nearby Franklin Chuck Cantley stopped by a presentation about the health law after receiving a letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield explaining that the plan he was getting for  per month would soon cost him  Well I cant do that said Cantley Ive got to find another option Either that or I wont have insurance Cantley  is retired but was waiting to collect Social Security until he was  hoping to get a higher monthly rate But he needs health coverage now So he applied for Social Security early which pushed him and his wife up to the poverty level He qualified for a big subsidy and signed up for coverage on the health insurance exchange Stories like Cantleys and Martins are in the minority but they give Buckner hope The folks that have been able to sign up they are ecstatic she says And as long as we keep hearing success stories that energy and excitement are going to grow
