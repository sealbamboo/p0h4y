Americans crave information about diets even as our national weight keeps rising New studies are highlighting that there is still a lot that we dont know A   published Monday in the   is contributing to water cooler chatter about the benefits of a lowcarbohydrate diet compared with one low in fat The study was a clinical trial in which scientists randomly assigned participants to a lowcarbohydrate diet or a lowfat diet and determined the diets effect on weight and cardiovascular risk factors They enrolled  middleaged obese participants People assigned to the lowcarbohydrate group were told to maintain a diet of total carbohydrate minus total fiber of less than  grams a day which is quite restrictive For comparison the   for someone on a calorie diet is  grams A single slice of white bread for example has about  grams of carbohydrates The other group was instructed to keep calories from total fat below  percent of daily intake The subjects were also told to keep calories from saturated fat below  percent The findings produced a win for the lowcarbohydrate diet which resulted in about  more pounds of weight loss at one year Participants in the lowcarbohydrate group also had more favorable changes in their blood lipid levels such as cholesterol Meanwhile   published in  the journal of the American Medical Association surveyed prior studies of popular diets and found that the differences between diets like Atkins Ornish Zone and Weight Watchers were quite small and not enough to distinguish one from another Perhaps the most amazing thing in all this is that there is such scant scientific information available about the actual effects of diets Thats why the randomized trial involving  people became big news this week The  survey of studies went back as far as  and found fewer than  blinded trials All told they included fewer than  people The studies were generally small most had fewer than  people and they typically lasted for only  weeks Finally these trials werent able to determine whether a particular diet actually lowered the risk of disease Our diets may be exerting powerful effects on our health but we lack studies that assess health events We commonly expect this kind of study for drugs and other health care interventions And yet dietary recommendations are made all the time and different diets may have different effects on health risk We have mostly built recommendations based on observational studies the kind that watch what happens to people who eat different diets But these studies are limited because people who eat different diets often have different lifestyles Vegans and burgerlovers may vary when it comes to other habits that may also influence health making it difficult to isolate the effects of the diet The diet industry generates billions of dollars annually but it is built on razorthin evidence about what is best for any individual And it is likely that one size doesnt fit all A diet that is best for one person may not be so for another Ultimately our recommendations need to be personalized Which diet reduces the risk of heart attacks and cancer The risk factors alone dont tell you They provide an indication but there are many instances where an intervention that decreased cardiovascular risk factors didnt lower the likelihood of heart disease To determine which diets reduce risk for which people we need larger studies with longer followup For many people it will be enough to know whether a lowcarbohydrate diet is better for weight loss Even then we need additional confirmatory studies that are larger and more definitive But for other people the issue is health and the desire to lower risk along with weight loss People will have to wait for the answer to the question about which diet is better for their health lowcarbohydrate or lowfat Truth is we need answers about the health effects of all the different types of diets that are being promoted Its time to do the studies
