And so, another working week is about to draw to a close. Not a moment too soon, yes? This is, as you know, our treasured signal to daydream about weekend plans. As usual, our agenda is rather modest. We plan to escort Mrs. Pharmalot to a rent party, hang with one or more short people and engage interesting sources over cups of stimulation. But what about you? This is a fine time of year to hunt for apples and pumpkins (this may bubble to the top of our own list). You could boost the economy by purchasing winter wear or reach out to special someone. Or maybe do something completely different? Well, whatever you do, have a grand time. But be safe. See you soon…. U.S. health officials want some patients to forgo potentially life-saving Ebola treatments when they’re being tested so researchers can compare their responses to those who get the medicines; Bill Ackman accused the Allergan board of misleading investors to fend off a hostile takeover bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and the FDA is finally preparing to launch the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality, a new effort to focus on the quality of drug products.
