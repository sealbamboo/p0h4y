The   continues to strike people in the Democratic Republic of Congo Since May the World Health Organization    confirmed probable or suspected cases and  deaths As usual a disproportionate share of those cases are health care workers   of them almost a third Thats because despite elaborate protective garb and other precautions its very hard for doctors nurses and health aides to avoid virusladen bodily fluids of Ebola patients or accidental needle sticks Thats especially true at the beginning of an outbreak when Ebola symptoms might be mistaken for malaria or something else The repeating story is always that heres incredible incidence among health care workers says   of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases an expert on Ebola and similarly lethal viruses Its usually the medical staff that bears the brunt of it Apart from the tragedy of caregiver deaths this has a ripple effect that helps keep an outbreak going Dr   of   says thats because when health workers don moon suits and avoid all unnecessary contact with Ebola victims that reinforces the community perception that the hospital is just the place people go to die If you dont hang IV lines and do things that look medical if you just put people in beds and walk around in protective gear and dont touch anybody well why would they want to come there Sprecher said in an interview with   from the Doctors Without Borders operations center in Brussels The perception is only fueled when people see health care workers die of Ebola in hospitals We have a horrible time marketing our treatment unit because patients are not seeing a benefit to come in when we dont produce a lot of survivors Sprecher says And if infected people stay away from hospitals that just allows the virus to spread out in the community But the grim truth is doctors cant do anything for Ebola patients except give them fluids and other supportive care Whats needed Sprecher says is an effective treatment If you had something in the refrigerator on standby it might make it easier for the health care staff to engage with the patients he says if they knew there was something that might help them in the event of something awful happening That might become possible Fifty leading experts on Ebola and similar deadly viruses are gathering Wednesday and Thursday at the National Institutes of Health outside Washington DC to assess several promising treatments for these diseases This is really the first time weve ever all gotten together and addressed this problem says Jahrling who is running the meeting Meanwhile the Food and Drug Administration has   to one company for two of its experimental drugs for Ebola and Marburg viruses Jahrling says this weeks workshop will hash out what it would take to move one or more of the advanced treatments to the point where it could be tried in humans exposed to Ebola or its cousin Marburg virus One big challenge is to get the treatment  a   a   or an    to where it would be needed Thats possible when the exposed person is a US laboratory worker who has an accidental needle stick during a monkey experiment But its a different story when Ebola pops up in a remote corner of Africa and no one can be sure when someone got exposed Animal experiments suggest that the Ebola antidotes will need to be given within  to  hours of exposure to the virus before symptoms appear Another hurdle Officials in the affected country would have to be convinced that giving a drug never used before in people was a safe and ethical experiment These are the kinds of things that are going to come out in our workshop discussion Jahrling says whether youre going to treat one occupational exposure or a village The goal is to see if the groundwork can be laid for trying an experimental treatment for Ebola before  the next outbreak  or the one after that
