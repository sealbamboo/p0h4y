For this series weve been thinking a lot about the iconic tools that some of us remember using  if only for a short time  in our early schooling Things like the   and protractor recorder and Bunsen burner Mere mention of todays tool sends shivers up the spines of entire generations  the tool long used to measure physical fitness the Presidential Physical Fitness Test For many myself included the nowretired test evokes dread Vsits Pullups The mile run I can still remember lacing up my sneakers in the school locker room just one of many hoping the fitness test had been postponed Or canceled Abbe Tanenbaum one of my classmates from our elementary school days in Erie Pa remembers the constant fear and anxiety When the weather would get nice I would dread each day knowing wed have to run the mile she says I prayed for rain Brian Gallagher grew up outside Philadelphia and remembers doing well at the pullups and the mile  but was embarrassed by the Vsit   Gallagher recently opened a fitness studio in New York made to resemble an elementary school gym Its record board is aptly called the Presidential Physical Fitness Test In the s research showed Americans were out of shape and in poor health compared with their counterparts in Europe In response President Eisenhower formed the Presidents Council on Youth Fitness  to investigate the findings and mount a national response When President Kennedy took office he made improving the nations fitness a top priority of his administration In  he wrote an oped in Sports Illustrated declaring in a very real and immediate sense our growing softness our increasing lack of physical fitness is a menace to our security The remedy  or the attempt at a remedy  came in  with the Presidential Physical Fitness Award The original test was designed to encourage and prepare young Americans for the physical demands of military service It included a softball throw  said to mimic throwing a grenade a broad jump  later renamed the long jump a shuttle run  to test agility and pullups  designed to imitate a sailor climbing a ladder To receive the award a student needed to place in the top th percentile based on national standards In say  that meant an yearold girl had to run a mile in under  minutes do three pullups and complete  curlups in  seconds The test was totally backwards says physical education teacher Joanna Faerber We knew who was going to be last and we were embarrassing them We were pointing out their weakness Faerber has taught physical education at the Louisiana State University Lab School for more than  years and she remembers participating in the presidents challenge in grade school The pullup she says prevented her from getting the award By the mids Faerber says the physical fitness education community began talking about the negative impact of the test a debate that spanned multiple presidential administrations The council had that conversation over and over again during my tenure says Sandra Perlmutter the executive director of the Presidents Council on Fitness Sports and Nutrition under President Clinton Perlmutter doesnt have fond memories of the test either and was hoping to make changes when she took the post in  But change was hard she says because there were so many players involved Eventually though change came Current elementary school students no longer have to live in fear In  the Presidential Physical Fitness Test was replaced by the Presidential Youth Fitness Program The new program is more than just a fitness test Its a teaching tool to help students understand fitness and develop habits they can use to get healthier There is an assessment component Called the FitnessGram it maintains elements of the original test with an updated methodology based on current physical education research The largest shift is its endgame which changed from beating other students to being personally active and healthy Students no longer run a timed mile instead they do a PACER test an assessment that measures how long a student can keep a run pace This shift allows slower runners to finish first not last The new assessment also adjusts the way curlups aka situps are done The FitnessGram  to be filled out online  generates student reports and allows teachers and students to establish short and longterm fitness goals The thinking is totally changed says Faerber who helps train physical education teachers under the new program Now you want to get into the healthy fit zone instead of being the person who can throw the softball the farthest Despite training sessions and ample online curricular materials its been a tough transition for many teachers The year legacy of the Presidential Physical Fitness Test is hard to shake One school in Texas still has posters hanging in its gym spotlighting the school record for curlups And Baton Rouge La still hosts a multischool fitness meet using the old standards But the relatively new FitnessGram is slowly changing the culture of inschool physical fitness In Lauren Hortons physical education class at Capital City Public Charter School in Washington DC students do a PACER run instead of the timed mile Instead of the curlup they do crunches And before theyre finally tested kids get lots of practice When I visited this fall they were running a halfmile  though they didnt know it Horton only tells them the number of laps around the field because she says theyd freak out if they knew it was a halfmile Indeed many of the students moan and protest not only before the run but also during and after Timed or not running is running and praying for rain in PE is a rite of passage
