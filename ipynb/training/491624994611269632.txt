Ever wondered how much your local hospital pays for incontinence pads medical wipes or surgical gloves  I guess its not the sort of thing you want to think about for too long if at all   But it matters to everyone as taxpayers because potentially m of public money is being wasted every year That at least is the governments message  Ministers argue that by better procurement hospital managements could save money and reallocate it to frontline services  The Department of Health has published data supplied by trust managements in England for the costs of  everyday items used in hospitals  Major variations have been revealed To give a couple of examples  Each trust carries out its own procurement using an NHS catalogue of approved suppliers   What these figures reveal is that some are trying a lot harder than others to strike a hard bargain with those suppliers  If all of them forced down their prices even to the lowest quartile of the survey results the savings would be at that m level  Ministers hope that by naming and shaming trusts the worst offenders will feel the pressure and start shopping around or playing hardball with suppliers   The Department of Health intends to repeat the exercise later in the year with prices paid for  products and services including energy But should the trusts take all the blame Isnt the most potent purchasing power in the heart of Whitehall and in the corridors of the Department of Health   Big is beautiful with the economics of procurement  The public sector has been notoriously bad over the years at using its immense buying power to get the best deals for the taxpayer   Retail boss Sir Philip Green was brought in to advise central government on procurement a few years ago  It is not clear what benefits his intervention achieved If NHS England or the Department of Health negotiated on behalf of all parts of the health service for their purchasing requirements they would be able to hammer down suppliers more effectively One deal for all might yield much better results   The Department says its considering central procurement on a trial basis for  items This sounds bureaucratic but it is important  With the NHS spending of about bn a year  savings can make a difference  especially if they appear easy to achieve just by getting smarter with procurement
