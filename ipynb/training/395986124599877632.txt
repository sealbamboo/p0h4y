The   by researchers at the Department of Plastic Surgery at Case Western Reserve University looked at  sets of twins between the ages of  and  at the annual August gathering of twins in Twinsburg Ohio Each person had his or her picture taken by a professional photographer The photos were divided into two categories The first group was  sets of twins in which one smoked and the other didnt The other group was made up of smokers but in each set one twin had smoked at least five years longer than the other  Two doctors and a medical student studied photographs of the twins and assigned scores to their facial features In the case of the first group the judges said the smoking twin appeared older  of the time  For the second set the longersmoking twin looked older more than  of the time meaning the aging differences could set in after just five years This study confirms some of what was believed in the most scientific way possible said Dr Bahman Guyuron who led the research With longer followup we believe that every smoking twin might have exhibited a difference in aging The study looked at other aging factors  alcohol consumption stress and sunscreen use for instance  and found they were similar in these sets of twins It didnt address changes in the twins living environment or diet  Smoking reduces the collagen formation results in collagen degradation and reduces the skin circulation Guyuron said Additionally nicotine reduces the skin thickness All of these reduce skin elasticity and cause premature aging The study was published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery
