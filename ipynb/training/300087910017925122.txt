 Overall cancer death rates continue to fall for both men and women and across major ethnic and racial groups according to the annual Status of Cancer report Cancer incidence also decreased overall in men and stabilized in women according to Ahmedin Jemal DVM PhD of the American Cancer Society in Atlanta and colleagues involved in the yearly update But Jemal and colleagues reported that the burden of cancers associated with human papillomavirus HPV continues to rise with marked disparities by socioeconomic and racialethnic status The Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer  appears online in the   The report is prepared by researchers from the American Cancer Society the CDC the National Cancer Institute and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries From  through  overall cancer mortality fell by  percent a year among men  percent annually among women and  percent a year among children under  the researchers found During that decade death rates among men fell for  of the  most common cancers  lung prostate colorectal leukemia nonHodgkin lymphoma NHL kidney stomach myeloma oral cavity and pharynx and larynx However death rates increased for melanoma of the skin and cancers of the pancreas and liver At the same time mortality among women declined for  of the  most common cancers  lung breast colorectal ovary leukemia NHL brainnervous system myeloma kidney stomach cervix bladder esophagus oral cavity and pharynx and   But it rose for cancers of the pancreas liver and uterus Overall cancer incidence fell by just  percent a year among men was stable among women and increased by  percent a year among children under  the authors reported During that time incidence among men dropped for five of the  most common cancers  prostate lung colorectal stomach and larynx  but increased for kidney pancreas liver and thyroid cancers as well as for melanoma of the skin and myeloma Among women incidence fell for seven of the  most common cancers  lung colorectal bladder cervix oral cavity and pharynx ovary and stomach  while rising for seven others thyroid melanoma of the skin kidney pancreas leukemia liver and uterus Incidence was stable for the remaining top cancers including breast cancer in women and NHL in men and women HPVassociated cancers accounted for  percent of all cancers among women in  and  percent of those among men Jemal and colleagues reported From  to  incidence of HPVassociated cancer of the oropharynx rose among white men and women as did the rate of anal cancer among whites and blacks of both sexes and cancer of the vulva among white and black women On the other hand cervical cancer incidence over that period fell for women in all racial and ethnic groups except American Indians and Alaskan natives The incidence of vaginal cancer fell but only among black women while rates of penile cancer remained unchanged among men in all racial and ethnic groups the researchers found A snapshot of incidence rates in  through  showed that incidence rates for HPVassociated oropharyngeal cancers were highest among white and black men at  and  per  respectively Among women whites and blacks also led but at rates of  and  per  respectively Incidence rates for anal  per  and vulvar cancer  per  were highest among white women Among men blacks had the highest rate of anal cancer at  per  Incidence rates for vaginal cancer were highest among black women at  per  Finally incidence rates for cervical cancer were highest among Hispanic women at  per  followed by blacks at  per  Jemal and colleagues also found that cervical cancer rates were elevated among women living in poor areas compared with those in betteroff neighborhoods with similar disparities seen for men with HPVassociated anal cancers In   percent of girls ages  to  had been given three doses of the HPV vaccine and coverage was statistically significantly lower among the uninsured and in some Southern states such as Alabama  percent The findings concerning HPVassociated cancers are strikingly different from the overall trend with increasing incidence and marked disparities across social and economic classes and racial and ethnic groups commented Marc Brisson PhD of the Hpital SaintSacrement in Qubec city and colleagues The differences are important given the tremendous promise of reducing the overall burden of HPVrelated diseases and inequalities offered by recently approved vaccines they argued in an accompanying editorial An important implication of the findings is the need to find ways of reaching vulnerable populations with HPV vaccines Brisson and colleagues wrote To fulfill the full potential of HPV vaccines they argued vaccination coverage must be high not only at the populationlevel but also within the populations with the greatest need Source
