The plumber in my apartment was having the kind of bad day I recognize well although my sympathies were absent for the moment Summoned to address a cranky toilet he had set off a chain of events that culminated in a cry of alarm deep within the bedroom closet followed by the unmistakable sound of gushing water The plumbing is old and the valve as the plumber later pointed out would have broken eventually He just happened to have been attached to the hand that made that last fateful turn Although he owns the hand he is in no way responsible for the age of the valve and so he cannot be considered in any way responsible for the incident or for the two weeks of damp repairs I too own a hand that occasionally gets into trouble In my case it is deployed to sign prescriptions for medications whose ingestion can cause problems sometimes disasters These are seldom disasters of my own making  only once have I confused brand names and written the wrong drug and that error was quickly caught and injured no one Rather my hand is mixed up in problems caused by the drugs themselves or by the allergies and idiosyncratic plumbing of the recipients That headtotoe red rash cannot really be connected to me I did all the right things prescribed exactly the right antibiotic but there it was I am now feeling quite ambivalent about the plumber dubious about his capabilities and not eager to see him ever again I might feel differently had he offered a few words of apology and regret but I will doubtless be waiting all eternity for those just as I fear a few patients out there may be growing gray awaiting similar language from me In health care as in plumbing apologies are powerful primal symbols In health care though unlike plumbing to the best of my information apologies are a hot topic the subject of much research dozens of new laws and an increasing amount of instruction time for trainees These activities focus on what are known as preventable medical errors those with a relatively clear chain of culpability and often the prospect of an expensive legal settlement Studies over the past decade have suggested a linear relationship between the quantity of apology offered for these errors and the quantity of cash saved by deflecting subsequent lawsuits Needless to say the dollar signs have prompted action According to the American Medical Association all but  states have enacted legislation intended to encourage health care providers to apologize to patients by limiting the admissibility of these words in court Whether these laws have had their intended effect is still unclear Some researchers say   others   Still the apology industry churns on with consultants now guiding institutional apology policy Just as fires in the workplace have a RACE mnemonic so might apologies Rescue the patient by correcting the mistake Acknowledge and Apologize for the event Contain the damage with frank and open dialogue and optimally End it all amicably Nobody however has much to say about medical errors that are not preventable  not errors but badluck badvalve events where the riskbenefit balance that attends every medical moment is suddenly all too visible A bad rash from a great drug a joint replacement that leaves lingering pain better than before the operation but still there a treatment plan that saves lives in  percent of cases but not the case of your mother What does the doctor say then Will it be what you want to hear Probably not Our language is sadly deficient for such purposes defaulting to the limp word sorry with its innate ambiguity that is the bane of apology theorists The word carries such strong implications of guilt that we instinctively avoid it doctors and plumbers alike even though with ornament and cushioning Im sorry for what happened it implies empathy rather than fault Its imprecision may actually not be a bad reflection of what goes on in the brain during the process of apology and forgiveness Researchers are just beginning to probe that   when an apology is in process and forgiveness in the offing a storm of electrical activity unleashed by one little word Me I am always sorry for whatever happened When I dont say so its not for fear of litigation but from the press of other concerns panting like mad bulls at my heels But I will send out a thankyou note to that sorry plumber for reminding me that all variations on the valve wouldve blown anyway are reliably infuriating and that even the blandest Hallmark phrases of care and concern are not out of place when water gushes from the wall
