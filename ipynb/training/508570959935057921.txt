Drinkers the world over have been thrilled by the notion that resveratrol a chemical found in red wine might be some kind of antiaging powerhouse The supposed wonder substance can make perilously chubby lab rats live as long as their slim counterparts protect them from cancers and reduce their risk of dying from a highcalorie diet It can lengthen the life of certain fish while warding off brain decay and improving the creatures swimming chops Which may sound very alluring for those of us whod like to think that sipping Pinot Noir while relaxing on a couch counts as doing something healthful But does what goes for mice and fish go for people too Well nobody yet has divided us into two groups given one group resveratrol the other a placebo then checked several decades later to see how long we all lived But results from a few small human trials show a lot of potential A study of  obese men for instance found that administering  milligrams of resveratrol a day for  days mimicked the effects of calorie restriction which has been shown to increase life span Another study of  patients whod had heart attacks demonstrated improved cardiac function after participants took  milligrams of resveratrol a day for three months Still more research has shown that people who took the substance in varying amounts were better able to control their blood sugar But heres the catch To get the doses of resveratrol used in these studies youd have to drink between two and  bottles of wine a day I definitely dont recommend that says Dr Jill Crandall director of the Diabetes Clinical Trial Unit at Albert Einstein College of Medicine Shes not a fan of resveratrol supplements either The reliability of suppliers and purity of preparations is not very regulated she says Still studies do show that a glass or so of red wine a day may be good for the heart which is why people started looking at the qualities of its ingredients to begin with There are many things in red wine that are beneficial to health says Joseph Baur assistant professor of physiology at the University of Pennsylvania The tricky part he says is figuring out how much credit each substance is due and how it does what it does In the meantime raise your glass  in moderation of course
