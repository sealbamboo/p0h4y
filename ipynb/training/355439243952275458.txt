For centuries the act of refusing food has turned human bodies into effective political bargaining chips And so its no surprise that the prisoners desperate to leave Guantanamo after in some cases nearly a dozen years there have turned to hunger strikes on and off since  to try to win their release For years the Pentagon officials who run the detention camp have responded by   prisoners Currently some  of the  hungerstriking captives are receiving the procedure as many people learned this week when a graphic video featuring Yasiin Bey the rapper and actor formerly known as Mos Def went viral While Beys performance may be part publicity stunt doctors say it does help expose the unethical treatment and some of the pain of the Gitmo detainees subjected to forcefeeding In the   released by the British human rights organization Reprieve on the night before the start of Ramadan Bey is strapped down while a feeding tube is shoved up his nose down his esophagus and into his stomach He resists whimpers and writhes and eventually calls for it to stop breaking down into tears According to Reprieve Beys forcefeeding followed the Pentagons Standard Operating Procedure used on the actual detainees The Pentagon calls forcefeeding a medical response to Guantanamo detainees who hunger strike according to a   detailing the procedure obtained by Al Jazeera And President Obama   he supports forcefeeding because he does not want to see anyone die But the practice is actually at odds with international medical policy on prisoners right to refuse nourishment In  the World Medical Association an organization that represents physicians around the world and promotes the highest possible standards of medical ethics issued the   which states The American Medical Association has also   that the practice violates core ethical values of the medical profession  senior medical adviser for Physicians for Human Rights tells The Salt that forcefeeding the Guantanamo prisoners is particularly degrading and inhumane These hunger strikes represent the protest of people indefinitely detained and not charged says Iacopino who has examined prisoners at Guantanamo Many have been cleared for repatriation More than half of the  prisoners at Guantanamo have been cleared for release but for a variety of reasons theres been no way to transfer them Iacopino notes that in other medical contexts  where for example patients need feeding tubes because they cant swallow and they also dont resist  it would not be a particularly awful or painful procedure But many of the hungerstriking detainees he says have ongoing hopelessness over indefinite detention In this context he says I think the pain of breaking their will with forcefeeding would be extraordinary Its outrageous that there hasnt been more response from the medical community Cori Crider a civil rights lawyer for Reprieve which represents  prisoners at Guantanamo Bay says she sees forcefeeding as a more general violation of their rights When the military forcefeeds these people  I see it as suppressing what these people have to say she says and withdrawing from them the kind of fundamental thing that makes them human which is choice Some of the hunger strikers lawyers including those representing Jihad Dhiab a Syrian who was cleared for release in  but remains in captivity have petitioned the court to stop the forcefeeding particularly during Ramadan While US District Judge Gladys Kessler said Monday in a   that forcefeedings are a painful humiliating and degrading process she dismissed Dhiabs petition because she said her court lacks jurisdiction over Guantanamo and therefore does not have the authority to grant the relief According to the   the Pentagon   that during the monthlong Ramadan fast medical personnel will only feed hunger strikers after sunset and before dawn
