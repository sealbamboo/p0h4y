he National   Service has been judged the best health system in the world Its certainly the issue which matters most to voters the opinion polls tell us But what will the NHS look like in the years to come How will it cope in the face of an ageing population and unprecedented funding pressures With NHS Englands own estimates suggesting there will be a cash shortfall of up to bn a year by  making the   fit for the future is an urgent priority In advance of the general election politicians from the Conservatives Liberal Democrats and Labour set out their competing visions for the health service at the Guardians health hustings debate The event sponsored by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry ABPI saw some heated debate  but there was agreement from the panel on the scale of the task ahead  The system as a whole will crash unless we confront the issues said Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb the minister for care and support We get a very very good deal from the NHS but it wont survive another five years if we carry on as we are There should be a nonpartisan commission established after the election We want all parties to commit to it and we want the public to engage with it as there are some really tough choices to be made  Shadow care minister Liz Kendall said the values of the NHS of fairness and solidarity in pooling resources and risks were ones the British public held dear We need strong leadership into the next decade if those values and principles are to remain and I dont think we are getting that at the moment she said We need to reset our health and care services so they are fit for the st century Over the past five years the government has squandered the opportunity  Lamb and Kendall both pledged their parties would invest more in the NHS through higher taxes and the mansion tax respectively But junior health minister Dr Dan Poulter MP who still works as a hospital doctor parttime suggested that although there was broad consensus about the challenge the way forward was to ensure better joinedup care and more efficiency savings We have managed to free up an extra bn during this Parliament every single year he said We need to make sure we continue to improve efficiency to free up more for frontline patient care  The need for integration between health and social care and to bring more care into the community rather than keeping it in acute hospitals were big themes of the debate According to Poulter it will be important in the years to come to build on the Better Care Fund the bn initiative to pool resources across health and social care being introduced this year We need to do that to support more joinedup care and to break down those silos that are sometimes in the way of delivering care he said  Lamb said it was inspiring to see the way resources were now being brought together This government is the first government actually doing something practical to join up health and social care he said  But Kendall warned that the rug was being pulled from under the NHSs future by cuts to local government social care funding No wonder more people are ending up in hospital and stuck in hospital she said We need a big change  not to backroom services but to the way services are delivered and a fundamental shift from hospitals to community provision She flagged up the fact that delayed discharges often because of a lack of support in the community for people leaving hospital are now costing almost m a year money that Labour estimates could pay for a year of home visits for  older and disabled people It doesnt make sense to make huge cuts to local council care budgets that pile further pressure on the health service she added  But if better integration between health and social care is widely recognised as crucial to supporting an older population and those with longterm conditions there is no such agreement about the involvement of private sector providers in the NHS Poulter claimed the proportion of NHS spend going to the private sector had only increased from  to  under the current government which he claimed was hardly evidence of swingeing privatisation But that view was challenged by some in the audience who asked whether the new wave of contracts such as the ongoing bidding for bn of cancer and endoflife services in Staffordshire heralded the privatisation of the NHS According to one consultant in the audience there was a hidden agenda of privatisation that was extremely wasteful and demoralising for those working in the NHS  Lamb said it would be a mistake for the NHS to turn its back on any challenge to existing provision We have to be open to other providers he said He particularly stressed the value of social enterprises and mutuals in service provision where engaged staff with a stake in their organisation could drive better quality care Kendall said there was a role for different providers but putting every single service out to tender was wrong Millions of pounds were being spent by NHS trusts on tendering services and dealing with the competition now enshrined in the NHS she claimed The idea that there is reduced bureaucracy in the NHS is laughable she said  But what other ideas do our politicians have for improving the NHS in the years ahead Better use of technology is one key area Lamb said he had been inspired by a project in the US where a Seattle clinic is now carrying out up to a quarter of its consultations by secure email Poulter agreed that embracing technology could help deliver better care particularly important in general practice where as questions from the audience suggested pressures on the NHS are being keenly felt  We have  more GPs now and we have said we need another  by  We have workforce plans in place to make that happen he said Part of it is about making general practice a sustainable and attractive career It is a very well remunerated career but thats not everything We need to encourage a better working environment Technology can improve the quality of life for GPs and reduce their workload  Training was also highlighted as a way of both boosting the recruitment and retention of GPs and improving the quality of primary care The potential to enhance the role of other professionals in the health field and beyond was also addressed in response to a question about pharmacists the panel highlighted the important part they could play in supporting healthy communities The role of the community pharmacy is underrecognised and undervalued said Lamb As we design much more joinedup integrated outofhospital support the pharmacy has to be central to that He added that employers can also play a role A healthy happy workforce is in everyones interests  But central to the future of the NHS the debate heard is the need for a big cultural shift Lamb saw it as the need to move away from change being directed from Whitehall We need to give powers to local leaders and clinicians to deliver as they see fit he said He also stressed the need to focus on prevention and on outcomes The system is often too paternalistic and we need to move to one thats personal he said We need to ensure we incentivise outcomes  at the moment the system is designed to incentivise activity in acute hospitals  Kendall stressed the need to identify and implement the drivers for change that patients want to see I believe fundamentally that its about putting power in peoples hands And in Poulters view the key challenge will be to transform services to empower people to take greater control of their healthcare  In the runup to the election there will be much more debate over the parties approaches to ensuring the health service is sustainable in the years to come But one thing is certain steering the NHS over the next few years will not be easy As the debate heard it will be a massive challenge for whoever is in power come May  Health correspondent the Guardian  Under
