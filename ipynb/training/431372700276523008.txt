Days before she ended her pregnancy Joselin Linder pictured above was thrilled to imagine herself as a parent She was  newlymarried and though her babytobe wasnt planned it was soon deeply desired Maybe its that I played with dolls until I was so old I had to play with them in my closet she says But it seemed inevitable that I would one day be a mother Linder is not a mother today more than a year later because she had an abortion at  weeks She still wanted the childwanted to call it George perhapsbut she feared she would pass along the disease that killed her father in midlife practically fusing his organs and ballooning his body She and her sister Hilary inherited the same unnamed illness but as with most of the thousands of inheritable diseases known to science there is no cureexcept for stopping the affected bloodline Its an agonizing form of prevention the Linder sisters have turned to four times combined Theyve had three abortions and in  Hilary and her husband paid  out of pocket for a round of in vitro fertilization aimed at creating an unaffected embryo The gene has killed five people in the Linder family and it now threatens the sisters themselves But if they have their way it will die out in their generation I think thats a big deal says Joselin who lives in Brooklyn NY I think weve done something amazing with this particular gene The Linders story is personal of course but its also a public milestone Its the first known example of genetic medicine not only identifying a deadly new mutationakin to the next Huntingtons or Cystic Fibrosisbut of a family banding together to stop a disease before it cuts a path through society itself It illustrates the promise of genomic medicine which may one day stop disease as we know it but also the soultroubling questions that arise when people have a hand in their own evolution America is experiencing a boom in biological fortunetelling Doctors can now scan the genes of a fetus using only a drop of the mothers blood testing for hundreds of known mutations including Down syndrome Soon theyll be able to detect a growing list of rare mutationsalmost none of them treatableand predict an embryos risk of more common ailments like diabetes cancer and heart disease By that point millions of pregnant women will be offered a Godlike view of their childtobe and a decision much like the Linders a decision as miraculous as it is unnerving When is a life worth living The family gene as Joselin   surfaced in the late s when her father William came home from a family trip complaining of swollen legs and strange fatigue He waved it off as jet lag but the swelling spread and the fatigue deepened He was  vibrant and fit a busy doctor in Columbus Ohio But within a couple years he was forced into semiretirement hardly able to take the stairs Im very very sick he told Joselin who was then  and surprised to see her father start to cry In the years that followed his body filled with a creamy white fluid which doctors pumped out by the liter He got rounder but lighter his muscles withering even as something in his belly grew He moved into Brigham and Womens Hospital a Harvardaffiliated facility in Boston where he confounded some of the countrys best doctors In his records which Joselin shared with NBC News a series of gobsmacked specialists noted puzzling resultsan occult malignancysomething brewing None could come up with a diagnosis however let alone a cure William Linder died a medical mystery in September of  his autopsy revealing a body both starved and bloated The cause of death was officially unknown His daughters visited him often right to the end shuffling ICU visits into their college schedules They never suspected that they were getting a preview of their own genetic destiny But during their fathers decline one relative managed to track down some files from the National Institutes of Health the charts of another person who died as their father did his uncle That got the family talking and thinking remembering how past generations had died At the same time amid the procession of white coats a more regular presence appeared Dr Christine Seidman a Harvard professor of genetics Call me Kricket she told the Linders Dr Seidmans specialty is the heart the only organ that makes music as she likes to say and she wanted to look at William Linders heart murmur Shes director of the Cardiovascular Genetics Center at Brigham and Womens Hospital and she thought the murmur might be traced to a gene mutation By identifying it she hoped to discover something new about the dance between different bodily systemsand she did The Seidman Lab which helped identify the gene that causes sudden death heart attacks in young athletes found a lightning strike in the Linders genes as well Its the equivalent of a oneletter typo in the Bible a singlegene error that seemed to cause the heart murmur as well as the creamy fluid and a grim litany of other symptoms Some of William Linders veins were squeezed nearly shut by swelling Others took on the extra blood stretched to the edge of bursting At first Dr Seidman assumed there would be other cases like this one out there She combed through the medical literature She called Dr Victor McKusick the late founding author and editor of Mendelian Inheritance in Man an encyclopedia of heritable diseases Nothing matched No one has ever recognized a disease quite like this one she realized It could truly be one in a million one in a billion With cooperation from farflung members of the Linder family who flew to Boston to give blood samples Dr Seidman and colleagues charted all the carriers and tracked the mutation back to a founder Joselins greatgrandmother Mae She seems to have developed the mutation spontaneously at the moment of her own conception and died of the disease at age  Its possible that Mae inherited the disease from her mother Esther who according to family lore developed swollen legs after hanging laundry one winter on a rooftop in Brooklyn But either way the discovery of such a recent founder was profound Ancestors double every generation Some scientists believe that everyone on Earth had a common ancestor as recently as  years ago A genetic disease can spread very quickly in other words A young genetic disease is one thats  or  generations old The Linder mutation was at most five generations old The discovery gave the Linder family an unusual opportunity If they were the only family with the disease and they knew who carried it they had the chance to attempt a forever fix They could stamp out a genetic killer before it spread in the gene pool It points to the future says Dr Seidman The genome defines us as a species shapes us as individuals and through its idiosyncrasiesthe random deletions additions and mutations in each of our cellsexerts a profound influence on the way we live and die Knowing this geneticists have begun to look back in time to find the origin of the genes that cause much of the worlds disease Theyve traced a heightened risk for breast cancer back to a woman in th century Iceland found the same for colon cancer in a man in th century England and walked sickle cell anemia back to th century Africa The tantalizing question is what if science could have been there at the founding What if the first carriers of every disease knew it and chose not to pass it on Would we have Cystic Fibrosis or Huntingtons Would we even have disease as we know it And given what we know now will science one day be able to eradicate all but a baseline of genetic illness Its a very cool very scifi theoretically correct idea says Dr Robert C Green a Harvard University geneticist not involved with the Linders case Were learning things about our biology that are going to give us the power to make intentional and serious changes to our species adds Hank Greely director of the Center of Law and the Biosciences at Stanford University Its going to be fascinating and more than a bit scary to see what we do with that power Its already becoming a controversy Since Roe v Wade people have assumed that women can have an abortion for any reason prior to viability but the courts have never directly addressed the issue according to Jaime S King a professor of law at the University of California Hastings As she put it in a recent essay the question of whether a womans reason matters is upon us Americans United for Life perhaps the most powerful righttolife legal organization in the country calls abortions on the basis of genetic testing a chilling slide toward eugenics and its activists hope to halt that slide at the state level Last fall they succeeded in North Dakota which became the first state to ban abortions on the basis of any defect disease or disorder that is inherited genetically Now the fight is spreading Missouri Indiana and Colorado have recently debated similar bans And Virginia nearly succeeding in becoming the first state to bar Medicaid from covering abortions based on genetic illness AULs goal for children with genetic diseases is the same as our goal for all other children Ovid M Lamontagne general counsel at Americans United for Life wrote in an email We celebrate the value innate in all human life These laws wholly disrespect the doctorpatient relationship Julie Rikelman litigation director for the prochoice Center for Reproductive Rigths countered in an email Last summer on behalf of the only abortion clinic in North Dakota Rikelmans organization sued to block the North Dakota law calling it an unconstitutional license to question womens private thoughts The clinic later asked CRR to drop the case however and shift its focus to North Dakotas more sweeping ban on abortions as early as six weeks Today as a result any doctor who helps a local family like the Linders faces up to a year in prison The Linder sisters are sharing their story for the first time because they hope to spread awareness of genetic disease in general and draw attention to their own deepening sickness in particular But at a time when religious conservatives technoskeptics and old guard righttolifers have launched a new effort to stem the spread of genetic science they also see the need to speak up for the technologies that have gotten them this far Its genetics not eugenics says Joselin pushing back against the eworld favored by critics Hilary the older sister married first and used money from her fathers estate to pay for preimplantation genetic diagnosis a form of IVF where embryos can be tested for disease and only the healthy ones implanted PGD is almost three decades old widely offered and for years its been generally accepted The result for Hilary was twins now five years old But opposition to PGD is growing as well Few people would fault a couple for using PGD to guard against miscarriage or to prevent a fatal childhood disease and only the hardest of hardliners still fight the destruction of embryos that often results when life is created in a petri dish But many more people balk at selecting out nonlethal diseases like deafness Or the mere risk of disease like breast cancer Or adultonset diseases like the Linder mutation In Scientific American last fall Osagie K Obasogie a fellow at the Center for Genetics and Society called the doctors who facilitate such tweaks the new eugenicists and he warned that as scientists uncover more about genetic destiny parents could feel pressured to upgrade their genome along with their smart phones Hank Greely the director of the center of Law and Biosciences at Stanford University shared a similar albeit less critical view in an interview anticipating the end of sex in America Its going to happen he predicted In  years or maybe  years most babies in the United States could be conceived using invitro with genetic selection so parents could choose the embryo with the genes they most want to see Joselin recalls confronting this slipperyslope scenario herself on a visit to Dr Seidmans office around the time of her sisters PGD So well cure it she said Well weed it out from humanity and cure it The doctor who says she merely informs her patients of their options rather than advise them of a particular path was quiet for a moment Why stop there she said finally Youre full of bad genes Which other ones shall we weed out Acne Freckles The Linders for their part are sympathetic to some of the criticism I dont think its right to select for handsome blueeyed babies says Hilary But if you can save a life How wonderful that is Joselin wholeheartedly agrees She is firmly prochoice even as she recognizes the complications that come with being so free to choose She regrets her own abortion She wishes she had taken a chance with the baby She didnt even get to find out if she had lost the genetic cointoss Her offsprings genetic test was scheduled for the same week that Superstorm Sandy pushed the East River into her hospital closing it indefinitely and throwing Joselin into a state of emotional triage The pregnancy was highrisk Doctors had given Joselin a oneinfour chance of surviving childbirth because of complications related to the family gene At the same time there was talk of a surgery she could have a procedure that might open up a key vein relieving pressure elsewhere and making childbearing safer for her Meanwhile as she mulled these variables along with a storm that felt like a middle finger from the universe the fetus was getting bigger and she felt she needed to act Six months later the surgery failed and her condition worsened Neither of the Linder sisters look sick but their bodies have begun to bewilder doctors much as their fathers did Theyve both been told they have a ticking time bomb inside them They both have swelling and the overtaxed veins that result The nights are the worst Hilary says a time when the risk of a burst is greatest Though her kids just turned  shes already taught them how to dial  It wasnt supposed to be this way As female carriers of an Xlinked disease the sisters expected to get a relatively light version with their second X chromosome balancing the defective one Their grandmother passed the gene to two sons both of whom died but she is now  and for decades she has told the girls not to worry youll be as sick as I am Instead the gene confounded expectations again Im scared to death that I wont be able to see my kids grow up Hilary says by phone from her home in Columbus Ohio Its a slow painful death adds Joselin sitting at a picnic table in Brooklyns Prospect Park a binder of gruesome family medical documents at her side Theyre hoping they can head it off by going public Theyre hoping another family will come forward surprising them with the same mutation and perhaps inspiring an idea for treatment Dr Seidman is currently looking for ways she might be able to intervene if not correcting the mutation then at least muting its effects And if not Well the sisters will keep hoping says Joselin Maybe Ill hope a little bit for the discovery of that alien planet where my specific genetic mutation helps me to digest ice cream like brussels sprouts she jokes Its got to be out there After all the universe like the human body is vast and completely out of our realm of understanding
