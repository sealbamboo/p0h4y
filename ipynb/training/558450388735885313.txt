A vegetarian diet may help lower blood pressure researchers who reviewed data from  previous studies said Monday The researchers suggested that a vegetarian diet could be an alternative to drugs for people whose blood pressure is too high  a condition known as hypertension and one that is a risk factor for heart disease and other problems Â About a third of Americans have high blood pressure Seven clinical trials with  participants and  observational studies including  people were analyzed by researchers from Japan and the Physicans Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington which advocates for plantbased diets Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure over diastolic pressure and is measured in millimeters of mercury For most people a reading of  or less is considered normal In the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn Internal Medicine the analysis indicated a systolic difference of  mm of mercury lower for vegetarians than for omnivores in the clinical or controlled trials and  mm in the observational studies  in which people chose their diets For the the diastolic measure the difference was  mm and  mm respectively Those differences are similar to those often seen with such modifications as changing to a lowsalt diet or losing about  pounds the researchers said And they added theyre about half the difference found with medications The study didnt point to specific aspects of the vegetarian diet that could be at work But vegetarians typically have a lower body mass index than omnivores and their diets often are lower in saturated fatty acids and higher in potassium the researchers said They said additional studies would be needed to sort out which vegetarian diets work best One of the researchers Dr Neal Barnard of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine said he was not surprised at the findings Some people still may need medications and blood pressure is affected by other factors including genetics he said But people need specific dietary advice and doctors need to help issue it A vegetarian diet is a very good step but its not the only step to take he said Twothirds of American adults are heavier than they should be Barnard said Its time for us to stop playing around as if this doesnt matter Twitter
