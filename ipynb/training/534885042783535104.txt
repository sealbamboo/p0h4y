No pain no gain People who gladly underwent electric shocks for cash in an experiment were more willing to sacrifice money to reduce others pain than they were to reduce their own The findings published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences tested the limits of peoples willingness to inflict pain on others for their own benefit  and reveals human behavior to be at least in this case surprisingly altruistic Research into prosocial behavior  that is behavior thats intentionally meant to help others  leads to different conclusions depending on the experiment Studies show that people do put a value on other peoples monetary outcomes  that is theyre willing to donate money to total strangers  but they care far less about others financial gain than they care about their own Other research indicates that people empathize with others pain but value it no higher than their own So how altruistic are people really To get at that question scientists at University College London set up two experiments involving more than  participants in anonymous pairs randomly assigned the ominoussounding roles of decider and receiver The decider would get to choose between more money and more electric shocks or less money and fewer electric shocks  say seven shocks for  British pounds  or ten shocks for   But even though the decider always got the money there was a twist half the time the decider would get the shocks the other half the receiver would get the shocks The researchers found that people were hyperaltruistic  that is the deciders were less likely to harm the receivers for a little more cash than they were to harm themselves While they were willing to take a few more shocks themselves to earn a higher payoff they were less likely to raise the number of shocks for those extra bucks if it was the receiver getting zapped instead The situation worked in the inverse too the deciders were more willing to pay money to decrease the shocks to the receiver than they were to pay money to decrease the shocks to themselves Was it simply that the deciders assumed that they were better able to handle the pain than the other person Perhaps a little  the researchers found that deciders did indeed think they were a little better equipped to handle the shocks  but it didnt account for the whole difference The more prosocial deciders also took longer to choose in cases where the extra shocks would hurt the receiver and not themselves Those with subclinical psychopathic traits however were more likely to inflict harm on others as well as themselves for a bigger payout Those with stronger prosocial preferences may be faster in rewarding contexts but slower in aversive contexts the study authors wrote This account gels with past studies showing that people who help others quickly are judged more positively than those who hesitate but people who harm others quickly are judged more negatively than those who hesitate The findings the scientists say could potentially be useful in understanding how we navigate the moral and ethical quandaries that come with the many medical legal and political decisions that involve tradeoffs between financial profits and possible human suffering How much of this is learned behavior and how much of it is innate Thats unclear And its also unclear whether the same pattern would hold if the stakes were higher  more money more pain For obvious ethical reasons theres a limit to the amount of pain that can be administered in a laboratory setting Social interactions are fraught with uncertainty because try as we might we can never truly know what it is like to occupy someone elses shoes the study authors wrote Instead we must rely on our best estimates of others beliefs and preferences to guide social decision making and tread carefully when their fate rests in our hands
