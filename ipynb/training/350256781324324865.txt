Efforts to reduce medically unnecessary cesarean sections in the United States may be paying off From  through  the rate of cesarean deliveries has been stable at  percent after rising nearly  percent over the previous  years according to a National Center for Health Statistics report released Thursday The report analyzed singleton births multiple births are nearly  times more likely to be delivered by cesarean I think this data is very significant because it isnt just one year Its three years of flattening of the cesarean delivery rate says Dr George Macones chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine I think most people in obstetrics think that is a good thing A cesarean delivery where the baby is born through a cut in the mothers belly and uterus comes with increased maternal risk of infection and bleeding and a longer recovery time than a vaginal birth Its invasive abdominal surgery says Michelle Osterman a health statistician and an author of the report  In  the most recent low point  percent of singleton births were delivered through cesarean section according to the new report The rate climbed to  percent in  where it has remained  Macones says multiple factors contributed to the earlier surge in cesareans including physicians who have a lower threshold for performing the surgery hospitals that refuse to allow vaginal births once a woman has had a cesarean and patients who pressure their doctors to schedule delivery If you induce labor the risk of a cesarean section is higher says Macones  Inducing labor before  weeks of gestation can also mean extra days in the hospital for babies says Macones who may have transient problems with breathing feeding regulating body temperature and regulating bilirubin levels in the blood Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment produced when the body removes older blood cells Large amounts of bilirubin in the blood can lead to jaundice For several years the March of Dimes and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have been working to reduce medically unnecessary cesareans and elective labor prior to  weeks through education programs and written guidelines  Those efforts may account for what appears to be a shift of cesarean deliveries to later in pregnancy While the overall rate of cesarean deliveries has remained unchanged since  the cesarean delivery rate at  weeks of gestation declined  percent and the rate at  weeks increased  percent I tried to highlight the contrast between the two weeks Its very specific says Osterman I think that is really great news says Macones
