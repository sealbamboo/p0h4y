For people with celiac disease eating glutenfree can be a struggle But its even harder for those who arent always sure where their next meal will come from Two grassroots organizations   in Massachusetts and the  in Denver are working to help those people who are trapped between celiac disease and hunger Theyre reaching out to food pantries to help them better serve their glutenfree clients by supplying more options and teaching pantries to identify and sort the glutenfree donations that they already have Though both organizations are focused on serving their local communities they hope that more people around the country soon recognize the importance of meeting the needs of this population Of course no one really knows how many people with Celiac need food assistance because no one is collecting the data But with the abundance of glutenfree foods these days and new FDA   that should make glutenfree food easier to identify they say solving this problem is primarily a matter of education Gail Sawyer of Acton Mass is one of the estimated   Americans afflicted with celiac disease She receives   and says she regularly has to supplement these SNAP benefits with food from a pantry For a long time she had difficulty finding enough food there she could actually eat Youd walk away with two potatoes maybe a tomato a couple of carrots if you were lucky you could find a canned chicken she says It got to the point where it was almost not worth going to the food pantry because at that point there was nothing that I could have Part of the problem is that many packaged foods  like soups and salad dressings that dont contain wheat  can contain starches or flavorings that have gluten And other cheap staples like oats can often be contaminated with gluten because of where theyre manufactured Gluten really is in a lot of things  a lot of things you wouldnt think it was in Sawyer says Pierces Pantry now supplies glutenfree staples like breads pastas and cereals to the   where Sawyer goes Now I can walk away with a grocery bag or two of food she says Tracy Keegan who manages Pierces Pantry says that she gets calls all the time from people who have celiac disease and cant find the food they need at pantries Because there are so few people out there doing this right now I actually hear from people from across the country says Keegan They email from Chicago from California from Florida from Texas asking Hi Im hungry where do I get help  Currently Pierces Pantry only serves food pantries in Massachusetts Keegan says she would love to expand the model nationally but it is challenging given the inherently local nature of food distribution So she and her son Pierce have created an   on how to start a glutenfree food bank  to help people meet the needs of their own communities  who started the National GlutenFree Food Bank Movement in Denver in  says she also receives calls from people from across the country At least once a month I get a request from an individual or food bank who needs glutenfree food and the food bank doesnt know how to deal with it says Valdez According to Valdez the problem isnt necessarily a lack of glutenfree options coming into pantries but a lack of awareness and organization When food gets donated to a large food bank or to a local pantry most people dont have anything in place to sort or store it she says Glutenfree food gets mixed in with everything else and isnt distributed to people who really need it When a pantry calls asking for help she says the first thing she does is teach the workers how to read labels and pick out which foods would be suitable for clients with celiac disease Glutenfree food is two to three times more expensive she says so it is a pretty big loss when it doesnt go to the right family  a spokesman for Feeding America a national organization that provides food to pantries and soup kitchens says that while it is working to bring more healthful naturally glutenfree foods to pantries it has not received many requests to address the issue of gluten or allergenfree food on a national level They are aware that some pantries are addressing it on a casebycase basis This is in line with Sawyers experience Sometimes she goes to a different pantry that does not have a dedicated glutenfree section And while pantry workers are happy to set glutenfree things aside for her she says it is still a process of education Ill go Hey thats glutenfree and theyll look at it and say Oh thats another thing for us to start checking for  says Sawyer So its kind of like were teaching them  as celiacs were teaching the pantry that this is glutenfree
