Despite visions of quaint coops happy birds and cheap eggs the growing trend of raising backyard chickens in urban settings is backfiring critics say as disillusioned city dwellers dump unwanted fowl on animal shelters and sanctuaries  Hundreds of chickens sometimes dozens at a time are being abandoned each year at the nations shelters from California to New York as some hipster farmers discover that hens lay eggs for two years but can live for a good decade longer and that actually raising the birds can be noisy messy laborintensive and expensive  Many areas with legalized henkeeping are experiencing more and more of these birds coming in when theyre no longer wanted said Paul Shapiro spokesman for the Humane Society of the United States You get some chicks and theyre very cute but its not as though you can throw them out in the yard and not care for them That accusation is disputed by advocates of homegrown chickens who say that a few negative incidents shouldnt give a bad name to a practice that encourages both selfsufficiency and the consumption of sustainable food grown in a humane manner  Weve experienced smell noise pests etc way more from improperly cared for dogs and cats than we have from backyard chickens said Rob Ludlow owner of the fastgrowing website   which started with  members in  and now boasts  members He is the author of three books including Raising Chickens for Dummies  Hundreds of thousands of people are realizing the wonderful benefits of raising a small flock of backyard chickens the pets that make you breakfast he said noting that cities nationwide have agreed passing ordinances making it legal to keep small flocks of urban chickens  However at the   headquartered in Watkins Glen NY  which operates three shelters on two coasts  some  former backyard chickens are waiting now for new homes said National Shelter Director Susie Coston Theyre among at least  to  abandoned chickens that show up every year including many suffering from maltreatment or illness  Theyre put on Craigslist all the time when they dont lay any more said Coston  Theyre dumped all the time  Its the same scenario at the   in Minneapolis Minn where owner Mary Britton Clouse has tracked a steady climb in surrendered birds from fewer than  in  to nearly  in   She traces that rise to the socalled locavore movement which spiked in popularity in  as advocates urged people to eat more food grown and processed close to home  Its the stupid foodies said Britton Clouse  who admits she speaks frankly Were just sick to death of it People entranced by a misplaced rural nostalgia are buying chickens from the same hatcheries that supply the nations largest poultry producers and rearing them without proper space food or veterinary care she said  The most commonly available hens have been bred to be good egg layers At the same time backyard farmers often use enhanced feed light or other tools to prompt hens to lay constantly After keeping up that pace for  months to two years however hens often develop reproductive problems including oviduct diseases that can kill them veterinarians say However healthy hens can live for years longer up to a decade after they stop laying  Because chickens are notoriously hard to sex some backyard farmers wind up with roosters which are often culled and killed because they can be noisy aggressive and illegal and of course they dont lay eggs at all  In addition to the noise many urban farmers are surprised that chickens attract pests like rats and predators including foxes raccoons hawks and even neighborhood dogs   When they get sick or hurt they need care that can run into the hundreds of dollars boosting the price of that homegrown egg far beyond even the most expensive grocery store brand  Enthusiasts who start out with good intentions frequently wind up posting messages like this one delivered to BrittonClouse last month  People dont know what theyre doing Britton Clouse said And youve got this whole culture of people who dont know what the hell theyre doing teaching every other idiot out there But Ludlow the backyard chicken enthusiast said that its very rare that people make such mistakes or underestimate how difficult it is to raise chickens While we definitely want to see more education around the lifespan and laying lifespan of chickens we find that most people become so attached to their hens as pets that even though they planned to eat or cull their hens at the end of their laying life they decide to keep their girls around even without laying eggs he said Coston the Farm Sanctuary shelter director said she wished that were true Most people dont realize that chickens are funny with quirky habits and affectionate personalities as distinct as any other pets  Oh my god theyre amazing said Coston who frequently cuddles her chickens We have some of the sweetest ones here They just sit beside you and they let you pet them And theyre big and dumpy She hopes the enthusiasm for raising backyard chickens will fade and that consumers will take a second look at their appetite for eggs and poultry  To go back in time sounds wonderful she said But there is not enough land on this earth to sustain the amount of meat dairy and milk that people want
