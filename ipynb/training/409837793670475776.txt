Some patients taken by ambulance to AE departments are waiting in the vehicle for much longer than the recommended  minutes with one case involving a sixhour delay figures show Data for ambulance services in England Scotland and Wales obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act suggest Wales had the longest waits Another ambulance in eastern England waited for more than five hours NHS England said waiting times were improving The Welsh government said the figures were unacceptable but that most people were waiting for an average of  minutes  Paramedics can only hand patients over to hospitals when staff there are ready to take charge of them This process is supposed to take no longer than  minutes and delays of more than  minutes can lead to fines for hospitals in England The BBC asked all UK ambulance services for their longest waits for each of the  weeks from early August to the end of October  No service saw its longest wait dip under an hour with many around the twohour mark the figures revealed The longest waits were seen in Wales where one ambulance was left queuing for six hours  minutes Each weekly maximum wait in Wales for the period was above three hours In England one service in the east had the longest single wait at five hours  minutes although the average is around the minute mark Scotland had the best record in the UK with none of the weekly maximums exceeding two hours Northern Ireland and the Isle of Wight failed to provide data Dr Clifford Mann president of the College of Emergency Medicine described the figures as alarming Theres always going to be a small number of patients whose transfer is delayed but not to the extent of these figures  which are approaching three four  sometimes six hours he said And remember these figures relate to the three months up till October They dont include the really pressured time of the winter and so its unlikely these figures are going to improve  and that must be a cause for concern A Welsh government spokesman said Lengthy patient handover delays are clearly unacceptable But he added the long delays were the exception to the rule as the average waiting times were around the minute mark Barbara Hakin of NHS England said It is essential ambulances are back on the road as soon as possible after taking patients to AE But she said that while there were pressures on the system the number of delays that were over  minutes was currently running at almost  a week  down on last years figure Roger Goss from campaign group Patient Concern said I appreciate that hospitals have all these targets  and you need targets to incentivise people  but if you arent meeting them you have to find out why and do something about it The findings have been revealed amid mounting pressure on the NHS as winter gets under way  To help keep track of what is happening the BBC has launched a special  It includes access to weekly information on how each major AE in England is coping   The latest data suggests the health service is already beginning to feel the strain While the fourhour AE waiting time target is being met nationally there are many individual hospitals falling short More than half of the major AE units  known as type   are already in breach of it The number of nonemergency operations being cancelled and the delays being seen in discharging patients are also higher than they were this time last year
