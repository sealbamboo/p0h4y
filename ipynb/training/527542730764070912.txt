When scientists tested people for a genetic mutation that increases the risk for colon cancer they thought that telling people of their increased risk would encourage them to get the recommended screening They were wrong Researchers studied  people older than  the age when screening is recommended for everyone who were not getting it at the start of the study Twothirds of them received advice about colon cancer screening a session of genetic counseling and a blood test that could tell them whether they were at average or increased risk for colon cancer The other third received only the advice about the advantages of screening The study   found that over the next six months  percent of the usual care group were screened compared with  percent of the tested group a statistically insignificant difference Even within the tested group there was no significant difference in screening rates between those told they were at average risk and those told their risk was elevated We thought that this sort of genetic testing telling people about their personalized risk would be a powerful motivator said the lead author Dr David S Weinberg chairman of medicine at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia But knowledge of modest risk elevations may not be enough to push people to do what we all think they should do
