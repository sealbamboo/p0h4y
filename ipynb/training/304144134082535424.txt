Sticking to a diet is a challenge for many people but starting next year Americans may have an even bigger financial incentive to keep their weight in check The new health care law includes a provision that would allow employers with more than  employees to require overweight workers who do not exercise to pay more to cover their insurance costs Some employers inspired in part by the success of shows like   are already designing weightloss programs that use money to succeed where willpower has failed For Peggy Renzi and her colleagues at   in Bowie Md the war against weight is waged in the emergency room where they work The nurses say most of their patients are either overweight or obese They sometimes require extralarge stretchers or ambulances as well as extra nurses to haul all that extra girth Renzi says And this is not just an issue for patients The nurses grapple with their own weight and say they face their own temptations Nyuma Harrison points to a long countertop Sometimes on a shift this whole table is cake and cookies and chips And when theres nothing on it we kind of feel like theres something missing in the world  Its nice its sociable but the longterm effects are not that great the nurse says So last month Renzi Harrison and three other coworkers entered a national weightloss contest sponsored by   The company sponsors its own contests and also works with employers to set up similar challenges for their workers Over three months the nurses hope to shed at least  percent of their weight and win  After two weeks the Divas  thats their team moniker  had lost  pounds The team relies heavily on their mobile phones and social networking sites to track progress and keep tabs on each other Harrison urges the Divas to call for help when facing temptation She calls these man down calls Its like a  call It doesnt matter where we are  in the bed asleep at work  all of a sudden the phones are going off Everyones like drink some water have some lemon take the bottle away from her  she says Their path isnt an easy one The vast majority of weight loss attempts fail Studies show monetary rewards are effective in helping people who want to quit smoking or taking illegal drugs says economist   of Cornell University But food is different People need to eat and going back to old eating habits is a lifelong challenge Cawleys research shows threequarters of people give up on diets even if they stand to gain a lot of money Employers and health insurance companies are experimenting with ways to structure financial incentives  as well as disincentives  to encourage weight loss King County in Washington state for example   it saved  million between  and  in part by offering incentives to some  county employees to lose at least  percent of their body weight Cawley says the overall objective of pushing employees to become healthier makes a lot of financial sense All of us are paying the consequences of these unhealthy behaviors so it actually does make sense to set up incentive programs to force people making these choices to take into account the costs that theyre imposing on society he says But the structure of the incentive matters he says Cawley worries that some programs may create perverse incentives to lose weight quickly but not sustainably And giving money away may not be the best answer Cawleys work shows that people fight harder to shed weight if they stand to lose money Take Chester Demel Peer pressure and encouragement didnt help him stick to diets But hate Hate motivates Last year Demel pledged on a website called   to shed a pound every week  And if he failed he agreed to fork over  to a cause he dislikes The selection of anticharities spans the political spectrum Demel chose the National Rifle Association When he thinks about them my blood boils I get really angry he says Instead of thinking of doughnuts Demel started hearing the theme from   Fancying himself a lean and hungry Rocky Balboa he would scramble up five floors to his New York City apartment He shed  pounds in a year The punitive thing works for me Demel says Harrison the nurse says neither money nor punishment alone would work for her or her teammates I think the money is a bonus but were really not worried about the money she says not because we have a lot of money but because if we dont win the challenge well still really be in a good place So there really is nothing to lose  except some pounds And anyway there are other financial incentives that have nothing to do with prizes I do notice that I spend more in the grocery store she says but I always tell myself its a lot cheaper than dialysis
