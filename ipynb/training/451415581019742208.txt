Perhaps your mother told you Or your doctor Maybe you learned it in gym class For me it was all three Once a month do a breast selfexam they all said Use your fingertips in a circular motion to feel for lumps My mom a nurse even brought home a fake breast that I could practice on So I was stunned when a physician in Glasgow Scotland criticized a campaign aimed at getting women to do their own   Teaching women to examine their breasts regularly has been shown not to reduce deaths and actually increases the chances of a benign biopsy result general practitioner Margaret McCartney of Glasgow   Tuesday in a letter to   McCartney was prompted to pen the commentary because of a promotion in the   tabloid called   It calls for women to  um  cop a feel of their boobs and then post pictures on Facebook and Twitter  all in the name of cancer prevention The risque campaign replaces the photos of topless women that are a staple of the tabloids Page  McCartney worries the campaign will do more harm than good It will make women think theyre reducing their risk of dying from cancer when theres no evidence to back up that claim She cites a large   in  with more than  Chinese women The scientists didnt find any difference in mortality rates from breast cancer between the women who were taught selfexamination and those who werent But the former did find more benign lumps The US Preventive Task Forces Services agrees with McCartney and   teaching breast selfexamination But oncologist   at the Duke Cancer Center says its too early to throw out selfexams altogether Theyre too important for finding fastgrowing cancers she says that other types of screening miss Its the way were doing these checkups that needs revamping she says I run a highfalutin fancy researchbased early detection facility with very expensive MRIs Seewaldt says But we often turn to simple selfexams because with these very aggressive forms of cancer women can find lumps But forget about using your fingertips Seewaldt says When you go over the breast with your fingertips you feel all the structures inside the breast she says You get too much information Women often get freaked out  When I did my first breast exam I felt like I found  cancers Instead Seewaldt and her team tell women to give your breast a highfive Use the back of your hand to feel for lumps Or get a gentleman or potential partner to help Theyre good at finding lumps too she says And dont overthink it When women find a breast lump they say I was putting my bra on and something caught Or I reached to wash myself and there was lump  Sweewaldt says Going in with the idea that were doing a cancerfinding expedition is really not a good idea Seewaldt is quick to point out that she doesnt know if the highfive or getting a partner to help works better than the traditional fingertip circles for finding the lumps But shes ready to see clinicians go figure out whats best The door for testing the efficacy of selfexamination shut after the  study in China she says That was the final word No one was going to do more studies That was it But that   Seewaldt thinks isnt applicable to women in the US today Breast cancer was a rare illness in China then and the women were very young Seewaldt says So it was like studying breast cancer in men in the US And the therapies available to the women in the study were limited compared with what American women have today You can find all the breast cancer you want But if you do a lousy job of treating it youre going to die of it So the jury is still out on selfexams But theres something both doctors agree on See your doctor if you find a lump And be persistent Seewaldt says Yearly exams arent a bad idea either she adds If you are at high risk we recommend two exams a year
