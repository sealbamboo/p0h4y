This has been a nasty winter for those of us afraid of falling Recently having left my dog alone far longer than expected the call of nature required I take him out immediately on returning home  after yet another March snow He is big I am small and in his urgency he yanked me down the unshoveled and unsalted porch steps That was fall No   Later after Id cleared the steps and the plows had come through I took him for a real walk not just a pit stop But streets that looked clean and dry were patchy with black ice tricky to navigate even in my trusty Uggs Fall No  was a doozy no leashyanking this time merely my feet flying out from under me Even the dog was scared staying by my side and licking my face When you fall at age  the ground is much farther away than it was when you were say  and not just because youre taller The time it took to hit the pavement then seemed less than a nanosecond Mind empty youd bounce back up and off youd go  Now the time from when I lose balance until I hit the ground seems an eternity long enough to play though every possible bonebreaking scenario and recall every bit of terrifying advice Ive picked up over the years  There must be lots of people my age with brittle bones who know none of this But even for them time slows down midfall You have no idea how far away the ground is and whats going to happen when you get there and the fear doesnt end when you land You lie very still mentally surveying your body with the precision of a laboratory bone scan  A bruise feels like so like   but a break feels entirely different Until the headtotoe inventory is complete panic is not permitted because if you discover youre hurt badly you wont be able to deal with the next step and hyperventilate at the same time Only when its clear youre mostly OK is it safe to react Sometimes for me it feels like an instant cold sweat like the back end of a bad hot flash if memory serves Sometimes I cry in relief  I get up very slowly no matter how much the bruises hurt and sometimes they hurt a lot This winters weather has left me with many For hours afterward and sometimes days I feel vulnerable like a champagne flute that has miraculously bounced off a quarry tile and a little more vulnerable each time it happens Recently Dr Harley A Rotbart a professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado wrote a post here not as a physician but as an adult child of   Dr Rotbart cited the vast literature about how to prevent falls all of it valuable but none able to eradicate this bane of the andover set What surprised me in Dr Rotbarts post  and oddly comforted me since it made me feel typical rather than neurotic  was the assertion that for many seniors the real risk and potential complications of falls can be exceeded by the morbid fear associated with going to ground And its a circular problem  studies have shown the fear of falling actually increases the risk of falling Once people develop this fear even absent injury they may limit their activities which leads to reduced mobility and loss of physical fitness and in turn increases their actual risk of falling  So I ask myself am I limiting my activities And if I am are the limits prudent or costing me the protection that physical fitness especially weightbearing exercise brings to those of us with fragile bones  The answer to the first question is yes I long ago stopped climbing doubleheight ladders to clean the leaves out of my gutters More recently I stopped replacing burnedout track lights in the kitchen or highhats in the living room ceiling instead I wait until somebody happens by and does me the favor of changing them Two hands off the ladder to twist the bulb may pose a small risk sure but one with enormous consequences if I lose the bet The answer to the second question is more ambiguous Is fear compromising my fitness I shovel my own snow an activity both aerobic and requiring strength I hike but not when the ground is icy or the terrain uneven or tree roots invisible beneath snow in the woods I swim yearround and have tested my endurance by crossing the Hudson River though only one way after encountering the swirling rip tides in the shipping channel  I practice yoga although less than I ought to I stopped running long ago to spare my knees the pounding not because of fear Bicycles terrify me since I suffered a concussion while wearing a helmet and two neighbors were killed by cars I also live in a house built in the s with very steep stairs that I dash up and down so many times a day I ought to get a pedometer Ive fallen down them once while wearing socks which all the hownottofall literature identifies as a dumb thing to do No broken bones but some nasty carpet burns So its bare feet for me from now on plus a light downstairs to guide my way at night And hands off the banister Better to bump my way down inelegantly than tear my rotator cuff
