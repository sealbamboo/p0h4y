A malaria vaccine studied in more than  African children has been found to reduce the number of cases of disease by  to  percent Thats only modest efficacy compared to most accepted vaccines But this would be the first antimalarial immunization on the market and its developers emphasize that it still prevents a lot of cases Its main sponsor   says its good enough to justify seeking regulatory approval in  Specifically for every  toddlers who had the threedose vaccination there were  fewer cases of malaria over the following  months Those who didnt get the vaccine had  cases per  children  a rate reflecting the fact that most of them suffer more than one case a year Preventing  cases for every  young children vaccinated suggests that it has potential for a pretty big public health impact says   of the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative one of the studys sponsors Those are some pretty big numbers of cases averted The new data   Tuesday at a malaria vaccine conference in Durban South Africa extends results   last November which gave the first indication that this vaccine called RTSS has limited effectiveness But   chief of vaccine development at GlaxoSmithKline says even a vaccine of modest effectiveness can have a big impact because malaria is such a monumental problem in Africa Malaria in subSaharan Africa kills around  children every year which is an enormous number Slaoui tells Shots Hes been working on the RTSS vaccine for nearly  years The African study which involves  sites in seven countries couldnt demonstrate the vaccines impact on malaria deaths Thats because children in the study all got the very best treatment so very few died of the disease But those who got the vaccine were  percent less likely than those who didnt to get severe malaria which often results in death for many victims Still malaria specialists acknowledge that its not going to be easy to decide how to use the   vaccine The new data show that  months after vaccination its  percent effective in preventing illness in children immunized between  months and  months of age For infants younger than that it was only  percent effective Those efficacy rates are somewhat lower than shorterterm results presented last year indicating that the protection falls off a bit over time Work is underway to see if a booster shot can strengthen that protection Theres no question that everybody would want a higher efficacy on this vaccine says   of Albert Einstein College of Medicine Standard vaccines against other diseases have over  percent sometimes  percent efficacy she says But malaria has always been such a challenge And we may not ever get those levels Even when people actually catch malaria  the most effective though undesirable form of immunization  protection against future infection is far from complete Its hard to improve upon nature Daily says So perhaps  a more efficacious vaccine is unlikely and therefore RTSS would be the thing to go with About two dozen   are in the pipeline Some target more than one protein on the malaria parasites surface and some aim to protect at more than one stage in the parasites complex life cycle But its going to be awhile before anyone knows if these other candidate vaccines are more effective than RTSS Meanwhile if the World Health Organization gives the green light to the Glaxo vaccine its going to have to compete for scarce public health funds with other malariaprevention measures such as insecticidetreated bed nets to keep malariainfected mosquitoes away from sleeping children Figuring out the vaccines role in malaria prevention is going to be a very tough question Daily says Each country is going to have a pot of money and is going to have to decide how to spend it she says Should it go to vaccine Should it go to bed nets Should it go to diagnosis Should it go to community health workers Each Minister of Health can decide if this is something they want to put their money toward Glaxo has pledged to keep the cost of the vaccine low  no more than the cost of production plus a  percent profit that the company says it will devote to developing other vaccines against neglected diseases Slaoui says RTSS wont be pennies per dose Most likely itll be a few dollars
