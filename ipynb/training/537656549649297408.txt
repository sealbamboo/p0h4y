When a man drives by the strip at Lumley Beach in downtown Freetown at night hell probably hear a sharp hiss Thats not an unusual sound in Sierra Leone People hiss instead of whistling  to get your attention to call for the bill at a restaurant to buy a bottle of water on the street But the hissing along a stretch of beachfront road at Lumley Beach has a different purpose Its the sound prostitutes make and theyve perfected the hiss Thats why theyre called serpents Transactional sex isnt unusual in Sierra Leone Economic opportunities are slim and slimmer I wanted to find out how these sex workers were faring in a country where Ebola is still surging I was nervous as my friend and fixer Umaru Fofana and I walked down from our hotel around  at night last week fearing that the women or the men who stand nearby as pimps or protectors would be hostile  is probably the most prominent journalist in the country He publishes a twiceaweek newspaper called   and files for the BBC and others He knows this place like nobody else All day long as we run into cops or gas station attendants or politicians or nurses or poor folk in the street they smile and greet him Fofana Fofana was uncertain whether the hookers would talk with us As we approached a couple summoned us with hisses and comeons They flocked to us wondering if we wanted sex I explained that we are journalists we didnt want to pay for sex and couldnt offer handouts I told them I wanted to hear their stories They wondered if my little Marantz audio recorder shot video No They hedged At first some wouldnt admit that they were prostitutes at all They were friendly but they didnt understand why Id want to know what they thought Ebola is bad agreed two of them dressed in tight black tops and colored miniskirts Ebola is real Times are harder than ever This Ebola thing is really causing big problems in this country one woman told me She had been a waitress and made money doing cleaning jobs up until spring but those jobs dried up She turned to the streets She said more girls were out on the street now than before the outbreak Customers are hard to find a slightly chubby something in a lowcut red tank top told me because the men fear catching Ebola from the prostitutes HIV is a problem yes but not supercommon in Freetown The girls know to use condoms she said She walked down the street to open up her moms snack shop and came back with a couple of tall Carlson beers A gaggle of women and men argued loudly a few feet away One skinny middleaged woman kept insisting Ebola was bad and could I help her with  and she doesnt like prostitution We moved along  feet Two women leaning against a white sedan just down the beach looked up Dolled up and gorgeous How you doing baby one cooed I told her about the journalism thing and she looked bummed but started to chat She said her name is Fatima With clanking big bracelets and pink hot pants she seemed uncomfortable talking about Ebola at first but started to open up She was upset that the men arent around as much because they fear Ebola She agreed business is way down Life is not easy for us because of this Ebola She told me that some men are offering small money  knowing how tight things are theyre looking to take advantage of the situation Earlier in the day she said a couple of Lebanese guys wanted sex for  leones each The exchange rate is about  leones to the dollar Thats  Fatima refused Shes concerned about catching Ebola What do you do to protect yourself against that I asked When I go home we wash We drop chlorine in the water and then we wash before we go to bed She uses condoms for protection for pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases and she hopes the condoms will stop Ebola too None of this of course will protect her if she sleeps with an Ebolainfected person I think she knows this Her friend a hairdresser by day said they can spot a sick person and avoid him I dunno she said Maybe people who are ill would feel too crappy to want sex Fatima said she has a lot of problems to solve or she wouldnt be on the street I have to take care of my baby My family is poor right now My mother depends on me Fatima has a monthold daughter her mom takes care of the baby Fatima is the only one in the house with any income Some days no one will hire her In that case she said she goes home and prays Maybe next day God will provide a customer Another streetwalker Zaina followed us as we headed back to the hotel I explained what we were doing and asked if shed talk with us about working the strip She was so kind  disappointed that we werent prospects but like pretty much everybody Ive met in this country smiling and generous with her time The normal price for sex before the outbreak would have been  leones for a black man  and for a white man from  to  for a short time she said Now Zaina expects to get only  for sex with a black man and  from a white Thats  to  per trick According to the US Department of State  percent of Sierra Leoneans live on less than  a day So I guess this is good money Hard to fathom I asked Zaina if she could show me how the hiss thing works  for my recorder She was confused The thing you do to call guys over  the hissing sound  what do you call that We call it call men she said Can you show me Hisssssssss Flashing a smile she turned toward the beach Im going Back to work
