Researchers say theyve developed a drug that may help heal a damaged spine  the first time anything like a drug has been shown to help The drug works on nerve cells that are cut sending connections across the break and it helped injured rats move their back legs again and also gave them back control of their bladders This recovery is unprecedented said Jerry Silver a neuroscience professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio who led the study Right now theres no good way to heal a broken spine Sometimes people grow nerve cells back but usually not All the cures that are in the works require invasive surgery whether its injections of    or   But Silvers team came up with a compound that is injected It doesnt require surgery There are currently no drug therapies available that improve the very limited natural recovery from spinal cord injuries that patients experience said Lyn Jakeman a program director at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke part of the   which helped pay for the study This is a great step toward identifying a novel agent for helping people recover Were very excited at the possibility that millions of people could one day regain movements lost during spinal cord injuries Silver added One of the problems with repairing a crushed spine is scar tissue The body grows a lot of it and even if nerve cells try to send out little growths called axons across the breach they get bogged down by the scar tissue The culprits are molecules called proteoglycans They are covered with sugars and like anything sugary they are sticky and grab the delicate axons that nerve cells grow to connect to other nerves What we found is that when nerve fibers are damaged they have a receptor that can see those proteoglycan molecules and stick tightly to it They stick so tightly they cant move Its like flypaper Silver told NBC News Graduate students Bradley Lang and Jared Cregg came up with the idea to design a compound that would stop the nerve cells from seeing the sticky proteoglycans They made one that fits into the nerve cell receptor a kind of molecular docking port so that it couldnt stick to the proteoglycan I told them it would never work Silver said It seemed to me farfetched at best He didnt think that injecting a compound under the skin would help nerves elsewhere in the body But it did Theyve named it intracellular sigma peptide or ISP for short Injected daily into rats whose spines were crushed it helped  out of  of them to regain either some movement or bladder control or both the team reports in the journal Nature Our animals are not just walking a little bit better When they respond they walk a lot better Silver said Bladder control is a big issue for people with spinal cord injuries They are often incontinent or even lose the ability to urinate at all forcing them to live with a permanent catheter Most paralyzed patients can cope with the loss of movement in the legs but find the loss of genitourinary function the dysfunction of the genital and urinary organs severely debilitating and demoralizing said Dr Elizabeth Bradbury of Kings College London who was not involved with the study Consequently recovery of bladder bowel and sexual function is almost always ranked higher in priority than the ability to walk again by spinal injured patients is rare For any spinal cordinjured patient today it would be considered extraordinary to regain even one of these functions especially bladder function Silver said He also thinks ISP may help in other diseases that cause scarring such as heart attack or multiple sclerosis Silver cautions that the approach has only been tested in newly injured animals People are going to want to know if they can get out of their wheelchairs now he said Thats a question the team has not answered And before the approach can be tested in people theyll have to try it on a larger animal such as a pig Silver said Another caveat  the compound is injected and travels through the entire body The team did not see any obvious side effects in the rats but they will watch for that If you used it longterm you could see side effects but its only going to be used for a short amount of time Silver said
