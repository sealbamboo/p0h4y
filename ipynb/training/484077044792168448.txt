We all know that a healthy lifestyle can keep heart disease at bay But if like many of us you spent your s scarfing down pizza throwing back a few too many beers and aggressively avoiding the gym dont despair People who drop bad habits in their late s and s can reduce their risk of developing coronary artery disease according to a   published Tuesday in the journal   And by the same token if you get to adulthood with a healthy lifestyle that doesnt mean youre home free says   director of the Center for Behavior and Health at Northwestern University and the lead author of the study Those who pick up unhealthy behaviors in middle age up their risk of developing heart disease the study found The researchers looked at data from  participants in the larger Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults   study They evaluated the participants bodymass index and diet checked how much they exercised and whether they smoked or drank excessively To gauge heart health the researchers also measured calcium buildup in peoples arteries and the thickness of inner artery walls  both early signs that heart disease may be on its way The participants were first assessed when they were between  and  years old and then again  years later Forty percent picked up bad habits as they aged But  percent made hearthealthy lifestyle changes And thats great news Spring tells Shots These changes were not that dramatic Spring says Even slight increases in physical activity or slight adjustments in diet had an effect These are the kinds of things mere mortals can do she says In other words theres no need to suddenly take up CrossFit or go vegan This also doesnt mean that somethings should give up on exercise and start on an allbacon diet To be continuously having a healthy lifestyle is the best Spring says But the problem is almost nobody does Only  percent of young adults in this study were healthy by all five measures the researchers evaluated Too often Spring notes medical professionals think that by middle age the damage has already been done That kind of perfectionism can be very demoralizing she says We wanted to give a more encouraging message
