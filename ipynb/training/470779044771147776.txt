My Tshirt tells me things My heart rate for instance  beats a minute And my breathing  breaths a minute Unless I drink too many cappuccinos or a deadline looms Then my Tshirt tells me my that heart rate has jumped to the high s my breathing to  My Tshirt is connected to me and also to the Internet So along with an iPhone app it can remind me to take a breath relax chill Seriously The Tshirt Im wearing was made by OMsignal of Montreal It has sensors that are supposed to pick up all sorts of data about me  the aforementioned vital signs plus how many calories I burn and even how stressed I am OMsignal is a part of a new breed of young companies focusing on wearable technology Were not talking about Google Glass here These are products made out of biometric materials or smart textiles And yes these products are starting to hit the market Their fans say they could represent the future of wearable computing Lots of people wear fitness bands that can monitor their health Whether those products deliver all they promise is questionable But why wear a wristband when youre already wearing clothes Weave some sensors into the fabric and you have one accessory fewer to worry about Smart clothing is easy because its the only wearable medium youve already been wearing your whole life said Stphane Marceau cofounder of OMsignal In a decade every piece of apparel you buy will have some sort of biofeedback sensors built in it Many challenges must be overcome first not the least of which is price OMsignal shirts start at  but they also need a module which powers the shirt and talks to its sensors that costs  But the shirt is machine washable The leap that you have to make from a prototype or smalllot sizes of these wearables to an affordable massmarket product is pretty significant said Jonathan Gaw research manager for IDC Research The price is going to have to come way down before it becomes a product for most consumers Mr Gaw said that wearable apparel would be used first for fitness wellness and medical applications by a select group of consumers He warned that it could be slow going for most people In terms of these being mainstream and something that people will use on a daily basis youre getting into Buck Rogers territory there he said But Mr Marceau of OMsignal said consumers were getting to a point where they want more information about themselves The first cars were completely blind Then you had a gas gauge Then a speedometer Now you cant imagine a car without these things he said Smart clothing is starting to do the same thing for the human body Most smart textile products use conductive yarns that can transmit electrical signals The sensors woven into these materials are either so small you cant see them or so flexible you dont notice them While many of these garments require a battery pack of sorts some are experimenting with applications in which a smartphone can transmit power and Internet access to sensors and screens that are attached to the clothing This type of fabric until now was a laboratory experiment and no companies were able to develop something that would be a massscale product said Eliane Fiolet cofounder of   the technology website Now you have companies that are claiming to figure out a manufacturing process that is viable to introduce these garments at scale Ms Fiolet said incorporating sensors into clothing rather than wristbands made sense Clothing after all covers more of the body These sorts of devices are already emerging out of labs Cityzen Sciences based in Lyon France makes Tshirts that have microsensors embedded in the fabric These sensors can monitor a persons temperature heart rate and location The company won the award for the most innovative new product at this years International CES Sensilk based in San Francisco is making a smart bra with sensors to track a wearers fitness And the   has funded a number of projects to make wearable computerized clothing for soldiers Researchers at the   have developed a product called WearArm which is a computing platform like iOS or Android but one specifically for smart clothing The possibilities dont end there A number of universities and research labs have experimented with wearable technology that can help blind people navigate city streets such as gloves that vibrate when a user needs to make a turn And then there is Studio Roosegaarde a design lab in the Netherlands It has developed a dress called Intimacy  with an opaque fabric that becomes transparent when its wearer is aroused  bringing TMI to a whole new level
