When a team from Tulane University sent a batch of protective clothing and equipment to help workers fighting an outbreak of Ebola virus in Sierra Leone last month they were fairly confident the  or so packs would be enough for a good start They couldnt have predicted what they would be up against The World Health Organization says  were reported in Sierra Leone between May th and June  WHO counts  cases with  deaths but Sierra Leones health ministry says it has a total of  confirmed and suspected cases This is worse than expected I am fearful that it could get much worse said Robert Garry a virologist and specialist in viral hemorrhagic fevers at Tulane University Garry flew to Kenema Government Hospital last month with as much personal protective equipment PPE as he could carry but he says they are running out fast We have to ration them he said is treating  patients with Ebola all being kept in isolation Six more have died With each worker needing a complete change of gown mask gloves goggle and other protective gear with each visit that means supplies go fast At least  labconfirmed Ebola cases have been traced to a traditional healer whose grieving patients apparently handled her body at her funeral and became infected themselves Garry says The healer had treated patients just over the border in neighboring Guinea This crossborder outbreak is worrying health officials because its spreading in an area where people cross from one country into another casually passing through large cities on their travels Ebola is one of the deadliest viruses known It kills quickly taking anywhere between  percent and  percent of victims depending on the strain The good news is it doesnt spread terribly easily  it requires direct contact with bodily fluids But caregivers and health care workers can become infected while caring for patients and funeral rituals such as washing a body can expose more people And if people dont know theyve been exposed they can travel sometimes long distances to spreads the virus to others when they themselves become ill WHO says experts are trying to track down  people now Community resistance is hindering the identification and followup of contacts WHO says They are just scattering Garry confirmed Its very hard to track them down Garrys working with local and international experts to identify cases distribute protective gear train workers and test samples Unfortunately these numbers will rise dramatically as cases from the Koindu and Daru regions are tallied Reports from the field for villages surrounding Koindu and Daru are grim The outbreak   earlier this year the first time Ebola had been seen in West Africa WHO says at least  people died and  new cases of suspected Ebola were recorded in Guinea between May  and June  taking Guineas total to  With more than  deaths so far the West African outbreak is one of the worst on record Ebola first arose in Zaire now the Democratic Republic of Congo in  In that outbreak  people were sickened and  died with a mortality rate of  percent The biggest outbreak affected  people in Uganda in  killing  of them Education is the key to fighting it Garry says many people in affected regions dont understand its a virus and often dont believe advisories about how its spread His team is educating health care workers so they can protect themselves and teach others They pay attention once they hear how its spread Garry said The idea is to train these people here to go back and disseminate the main instructions about the disease An Ebola infection often looks like malaria at first so people may not suspect they have it It later progresses to the   of a hemorrhagic fever with vomiting diarrhea high fever and both internal and external bleeding With so many bodily fluids pouring from a patient it is easy to see how caregivers could become infected Ebola is a disease that scares people and that is perceived as mysterious but people can overcome it says MarieChristine Ferir emergency coordinator for the group Medecins Sans Frontieres or Doctors Without Borders Earning peoples trust is essential in efforts to fight the epidemic WHO says six experts and  sets of protective equipment have been sent to Sierra Leone by various groups Garry says his team is building on years of groundwork Hes been working with the Kenema hospital for a decade to build its capacity to fight another viral hemorrhagic fever Lassa Lassa fever is a serious problem in West Africa making between  to  people sick every year and causing  deaths It can also cause hemorrhagic symptoms although it is far less deadly than Ebola killing  percent of patients sick enough to be hospitalized and  percent of patients overall Protective measures for health care workers treating patients with Lassa fever or Ebola are the same We tell them to wear gloves and to protect their eyes Garry said speaking by telephone from the hospital And weve shown people how to do a traditional burial only wearing gloves And you can allow the body to be washed briefly Workers have been attentive to the traditions allowing the body to be wrapped without exposing people to the virus Genetic analysis of the virus causing the current outbreaks  from the virus seen in east Africa This suggests it may be from a local source No ones sure just where Ebola cames from It can affect great apes but fruit bats are a prime suspect Garry who was only scheduled to stay for a couple of weeks now says he is not sure when he can leave I dont think its going to be soon he said
