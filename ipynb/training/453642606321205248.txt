Francis Csedrik who is  and lives in Washington DC remembers a lot of events from when he was  or just a bit younger There was the time he fell headfirst on a marble floor and got a concussion the day someone stole the family car my dad had to chase it down the block or the morning he found a black bat the furry kind in the house But Francis looks puzzled when his mom Joanne Csedrik asks him about a family trip to the Philippines when he was  It was to celebrate someones birthday she tells him We took a long plane ride two boat trips she adds Francis says he doesnt remember Thats a classic example of a phenomenon known as   Most adults do not have memories of their lives for the first  to   years says   a professor of psychology at Emory University Scientists have known about childhood amnesia for more than a century But its only in the past decade that they have begun to figure out when childhood memories start to fade which early memories are most likely to survive and how we create a complete autobiography without direct memories of our earliest years For a long time scientists thought childhood amnesia occurred because the brains of young children simply couldnt form lasting memories of specific events Then in the s Bauer and other researchers began testing the memories of children as young as  months old in some cases using gestures and objects instead of words What we   was that even as young as the second year of life children had very robust memories for these specific past events Bauer says So she wondered Why is it that as adults we have difficulty remembering that period of our lives More studies provided evidence that at some point in childhood people lose access to their early memories So several years ago Bauer and her colleague   decided to study a group of children to see what happened to their memories over time At age  the children were all recorded speaking with a parent about recent events like visiting an amusement park or a visit from a relative Then as the kids got older the researchers checked to see how much they remembered And they found that children as old as  could still recall more than  percent of those early events while children who were  or  recalled less than  percent What we observed was actually the onset of childhood amnesia Bauer says Its still not entirely clear why early memories are so fragile But it probably has to do with the structures and circuits in the brain that store events for future recall Bauer says When a child is younger than  those brain systems are still quite immature Bauer says It doesnt mean theyre not working at all she says But theyre not working as efficiently  and therefore not as effectively  as theyre going to be working in later childhood and certainly in adulthood Some early memories are more likely than others to survive childhood amnesia says   at Memorial University of Newfoundland One example she says is a memory that carries a lot of emotion Peterson showed this in a   of children whod been to a hospital emergency room when they were as young as  for injuries such as a broken bone or a cut serious enough to require stitches These were very emotional very significant events Peterson says And what we have found is that even  years later children have enormously good memory of that Eightyearold Francis Csedrik certainly remembers the events that led to his emergency room visit He was at school when a friend said I want to carry you down the stairs Francis says I didnt want him to but he didnt listen He did it And I fell headfirst on a marble floor That memory is from when Francis was  But a child in one of Petersons studies recalled an event from when he was just  months old It was the day his mother went to the hospital to give birth to a sibling He remembers crying on the floor of the kitchen and he remembers how upset he was Peterson says And he can remember the pattern of his teardrops on the linoleum Findings like that are persuading courts to allow more eyewitness testimony from children Peterson says In the past she says courts thought children couldnt tell the difference between fact and fantasy But studies have shown that they can and that the amount they remember is staggering The key to using children as witnesses is to make sure they are questioned in a noncoercive way Peterson says They want to be cooperative she says so you have to be very careful not to put words in their mouth Another powerful determinant of whether an early memory sticks is whether a child fashions it into a good story with a time and place and a coherent sequence of events Peterson says Those are the kinds of memories that are going to last she says And it turns out parents play a big role in what a child remembers Peterson says   shows that when a parent helps a child give shape and structure and context to a memory its less likely to fade away Thats something Joanne Csedrik has worked on with Francis ever since his concussion At first he just talked about it with her But more recently hes described the incident in school writing assignments I just like writing that story because I just dont want to forget it Francis says Because it reminds you to be careful his mother says Right You dont want to have that happen again I think thats a day Ill always remember Francis says Its not hard to see an evolutionary reason for memories like this Kids who recall stories about danger or injuries are probably more likely to survive to become adults And stories become important for a different reason in adolescence Peterson says Thats when people usually begin knitting together all of these smaller stories into a larger life story in order to explain why you are the kind of person you are she says Interestingly a persons life story usually includes events that should have been lost to childhood amnesia Thats because when our own memories start to fail Peterson says we rely on family members photo albums and videos to restore them
