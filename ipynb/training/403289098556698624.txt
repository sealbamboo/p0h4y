Earlier this fall Seattle Seahawks fans at CenturyLink Field   with a skullsplitting  decibels  That volume as the   hits the scale somewhere between serious hearing damage and eardrum rupture Just weeks later Kansas City Chiefs fans at Arrowhead Stadium topped that number with  screaming decibels of their own   The measuring method used for the Guinness World Record has an edge of gimmickry That Aweighted peak measurement reached for a split second near the measuring device displays the highest possible readout  For a vulnerable ear however gameday noise isnt just harmless fun With peaks and troughs the decibel level of noise reaching a typical spectator averages in the mids but for a longer time  Such noise is enough to cause permanent damage and to increase the likelihood of future damage  The extent to which hearingrelated issues get so little attention is amazing and troubling said M Charles Liberman a professor of otology at Harvard Medical School and director of a hearing research lab at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary  Many people are damaging their ears with repeated noise exposure such that their hearing abilities will significantly diminish as they age much more so than if they were more careful he said  Ears are deceptive Even if they seem to recover from the muffling ringing and fullness after a rousing game they dont really recover Its not just the tiny sensory cells in the cochlea that are damaged by noise Dr Liberman said but also the nerve fibers between the ears and the brain that degrade over time  Too much noise causes not just partial deafness which usually starts with trouble hearing in background noise but an assortment of poorlyunderstood auditory abnormalities These include tinnitus or ringing in the ear and hyperacusis a sensitivity or intolerance to sound sometimes with ear pain  People who complain of hyperacusis often point to a specific overexposure to noise as being the thing that initially put them over the edge Dr Liberman said In some cases hyperacusis patients cannot even have a normalvoicelevel conversation with their family because that can create pain lasting for days at a time said Bryan Pollard president of the nonprofit group   Noiseinduced pain creates an extreme loss of quality of life  Damage from noise is cumulative it is tough to separate the effects of a lifetime of recreational environmental and workplace noise Assessing noise risk is complicated too with an unpredictable interplay of volume duration and susceptibility which varies enormously across the population   A sensory loss is hard to detect because people dont know what they are not hearing Over time hearing only becomes worse  never better  Some people with tinnitus report more than just a ringing or buzzing  they suffer from swirling oscillating multitonal noises in their head sometimes accompanied by sensations of pressure There is no treatment beyond coping strategies  According to the   around two million Americans are so debilitated by tinnitus that they cannot function on a daytoday basis  Unlike awareness of other pernicious health hazards such as smoking and suntanning awareness of harmful noise is minimal Everyone has their own benefitrisk equation but this is an area where education is lacking said Jennifer Tufts an associate professor of audiology at the University of Connecticut who is president of the    At a loud event  assuming someone has no preexisting ear problems  ear damage is largely preventible with   The   got wind of the record attempt at CenturyLink Field and seized on a teachable moment Volunteers for Operation Earplugs distributed  pairs of earplugs donated by M The company also donated  pairs in Kansas City when the fan group Terrorhead Returns organized its record attempt Some fans reported taking the earplugs but not using them    can take practice In a pinch sticking your fingers in your ear canals will do Earplugs however might not be sufficient for people with alreadyinjured ears Got tinnitus and hyperacusis and it got worse after attending a game despite wearing earplugs one fan wrote on Facebook I dont think most people are aware of the consequences Another wrote Ive learned to live with the tinnitus but if it gets worse Ill go crazy Harvards Dr Liberman compares the increasing knowledge about those disabling consequences with the rising consciousness about repeated concussions and brain damage in football players which may lead to dementia at an early age  You dont notice it right way he said You shake it off and you think you have recovered so you do it again Changes in brain function add up slowly
