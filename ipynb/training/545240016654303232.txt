This was the first outbreak of the debilitating disease in the Western Hemisphere health officials said All countries in Central America have now reported local transmission of Chikungunya pronounced chikunGOONya and the United States had  confirmed cases of local infection this year as of December  all in Florida There also have been  imported cases across the United States in returning travelers It wasnt until  that unfortunately a traveler resulted in local transmission of Chikungunya said Erin Staples of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC referring to the people infected in Saint Martin  Those infected carry the virus in their bloodstream it can then be picked up by mosquitoes as they bite making them carriers The virus has since spread rapidly and shows no signs of leaving as ecological conditions are perfect for the disease to flourish We knew it would spread said Staples a medical epidemiologist  The big question perplexing officials Why now Two mosquito species primed to the temperatures of Central and South America carry Chikungunya The species  Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus  also carry the virus behind Dengue fever  Given the level of Dengue in the region we knew there could be the same levels of Chikungunya Staples said Both diseases can cause joint pain and inflammation headaches rashes and fever and can lead to death in rare cases  But this tropical disease with an exotic name which originates from the African Makonde dialect causes more intense joint pain and inflammation For some people the pain can last for months or years resulting in additional psychological strain  The lack of immunity among people living in the Americas provided a blank canvas for Chikungunya to spread throughout the population this year As of December  more than  million people have been infected in addition to the  who died according to the PanAmerican Health Organization PAHO Almost all of the fatalities occurred in the Caribbean island countries of Guadeloupe and Martinique Where we saw the biggest jump was after it reached the Spanishspeaking countries in the region said Staples referring to the weakened infrastructures and health systems of countries such as the Dominican Republic which has reported more than  cases  more than half of the overall outbreak and  of the island countrys population As South American countries approach their summer numbers are expected to rise there as the mosquitoes flourish in the heat  Brazil Peru Paraguay are coming into their summer months and reporting their first local transmission Staples said Already more than  people have been infected in Brazil Because infection with Chikungunya is rarely fatal the issue of most concern to officials is the burden on health services and the impact of the debilitating symptoms on the economy The high number of cases can overload health services says Dr Pilar RamonPardo regional adviser for PAHO the regional office of the World Health Organization Until recently monitoring for Chikungunya was not part of routine surveillance in the region  Clinicians have to be ready to diagnose she said About  to  of cases are expected to become chronic with symptoms such as arthritis and other rheumatic manifestations leading to physical disabilities RamonPardo said Further longterm effects are psychological as people become more depressed and tired All of this can result in missed work and lower school attendance she said hurting local economies The warm climate of the region offers potential for Chikungunya levels to be maintained for years to come just like Dengue fever But areas of most concern are the tropics  The areas which have yearround favorable climate for the mosquito are at the greatest risk says Dr Laith Yakob of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine which is monitoring the spread of the outbreak  While the climate and mosquitos have long been present RamonPardo said we dont know why this is happening now She said globalization is likely to blame with increased population movement from one country to another This offers more opportunities for local mosquitos to bite infected humans The CDCs Staples said she is temporarily at ease regarding numbers in the US Were moving into fall and winter periods which should see activity decrease she said Cold temperatures reduce mosquito survival rates  The rapid spread of Chikungunya this year also could help minimize future infections Chikungunya will go through a region quite rapidly and create a level of population immunity which helps mitigate large outbreaks of the disease Staples said Unlike Dengue infection with Chikungunya results in lifelong immunity Like many other infections Chikungunya could however remain in the background through animals capable of carrying the virus in their bloodstream and acting as socalled reservoirs of the disease  In Asia and Africa there is a transmission cycle in small mammals and monkeys RamonPardo said meaning these animals keep the virus present within the population In the Americas  we dont know yet Those words   we dont know  resonate throughout the community of scientists and government officials trying to control the outbreak  The future risk of spread levels of future immunity risk from animal reservoirs why this is only happening now and the total economic impact are all unknown Mathematical models are under construction by numerous research groups around the world to improve confidence over projections of future spread said Yakob whose team is modeling the disease  As they work control efforts continue When it comes to controlling Chikungunya there are two main strategies  reduce the likelihood of bites and remove the everbiting mosquito Prevention is the priority Unlike the mosquitoes behind malaria which bite at night the species behind Chikungunya bite any time day or night Those living in affected areas are asked to use repellent sleep under bed nets and wear long clothing to avoid getting bitten The air conditioned and indoor environments of people living in the US mean numbers are likely to stay low there But mosquito control is at the heart of it all Mass spraying of insecticides and removal of any sources of shallow water in which mosquitoes can breed are taking place across the continents According to the CDCs Staples Florida has been highly aggressive with its approach to control Were only at  cases due to such proactive measures Staples said For now prevention is all they have as officials wait and see how the outbreak pans out There is no vaccine currently and no good antivirals so we are trying to control the spread of the disease Staples said There are a lot of questions and only time will tell what well see for Chikungunya in the future
