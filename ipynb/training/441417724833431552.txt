Guidelines out for consultation this month are calling for millions more people to be put on cholesterollowering statin drugs But some fear such a move would do more harm than good  The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says the scope for offering statin treatment should be widened to save more lives The pills protect against heart attacks and strokes Opponents argue that for lowrisk groups the overall harm caused by taking statins would actually outweigh the benefits Cardiovascular disease remains the leading UK killer It claims about  lives a year Currently doctors are meant to offer statin tablets to the estimated seven million people who have a oneinfive chance of developing cardiovascular disease over  years based on risk factors such as their age and whether they smoke  This includes people who have had a heart attack in the past And experts agree that in highrisk populations the benefits of statins clearly outweigh the risks NICE is now suggesting that people with as low as a onein risk should be offered statins  This could include someone who is in their s and otherwise fit and healthy but has high cholesterol as well as practically anyone over the age of  since age is a big risk factor  Some doctors say targeting these people is misguided and will ultimately do more harm than good  A recent survey of  GPs by the magazine Pulse revealed only half would personally take a statin or recommend them to a family member based on the new lower risk score  Former GP and deputy chairman of the British Medical Association Dr Kailash Chand has firsthand experience of the side effects of statins  A few years ago I started taking statins knowing that it has all the benefits and after perhaps a few weeks I started having muscle aches sleep disturbance He says much of the data that the new NICE recommendations are based on comes from pharmaceutical companies that make statins which arguably have a vested interest in the drugs success  He says there is not enough evidence that wider use would be wise and that the benefits have been hyped up He is also concerned that it will give people false assurance that they are protected for life and can ignore other risk factors such as poor diet and smoking  Then there are the side effects to consider Common   affecting between one in  and one in  people include headache nausea and insomnia  For between one in  and one in  people they can cause inflammation of the liver blurred vision and weakness  Severe side effects such as memory problems jaundice and damage to nerves and muscles are rare affecting fewer than one in  people  Each person will need to weigh these risks against any potential gains and some may decide that its not worth taking statins preventatively It is estimated that statins save  lives a year in the UK NICE says extending their use would save thousands more lives and in the long run would save the NHS money  But it is estimated one in every  people who takes statins will experience a potentially dangerous side effect  that to save one life or avoid a non fatal heart attack or stroke you would need to treat  highrisk patients for  years  To save a life or avoid cardiovascular morbidity among lowrisk patients the number you need to treat increases to   But different studies have looked at different types of patients and have yielded different results so it is difficult to know if this pans out   that for every  people without known heart disease who take statins for five years  would see no benefit and only one or two would avoid a heart attack that they might not have otherwise NICE guidelines are not compulsory so even if the recommendations of treating lowrisk people go ahead some may not do this Prof Peter Weissberg of the British Heart Foundation says that ultimately it will be up to patients and their doctors to decide  Lifethreatening side effects are thankfully extraordinarily rare But troublesome side effects are relatively common although thats true of any drug
