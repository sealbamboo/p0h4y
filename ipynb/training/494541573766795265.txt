Weak handshakes are often frowned upon but they may be healthier than firm ones A fist bump though may be an even healthier choice British researchers did a simple experiment After dipping a gloved hand into a dense culture of Escherichia coli a bacterium commonly found in human intestines an experimenter shook hands bumped fists or highfived with a person wearing a sterile glove They repeated the tests several times and analyzed the gloves for transmission of germs The results were published in the   About twice as many bacteria were transferred to the clean glove with a handshake as with a highfive and the fist bump consistently produced the lowest transmission of all They then did the fist bump and highfive tests with three more seconds of contact and tested various pressures and durations for the handshake Prolonging the highfive had little effect but making the fist bump three seconds longer significantly increased the transfer of bacteria A strong handshake as measured with a dynamometer was especially effective moving germs hand to hand in almost twice the quantities of a moderate handshake  Hand hygiene is a serious problem in hospitals and   suggested that handshakes in health care facilities should be banned If someone extends a hand of course you shake said the lead author Sara Mela a PhD candidate at Aberystwyth University in Wales but in certain environments  hospitals in particular where are there a large number of diseasecausing organisms and many people at risk  you ought to think about whats happening when you have direct contact
