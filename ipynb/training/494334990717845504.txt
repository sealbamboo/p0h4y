Running for as little as five minutes a day could significantly lower a persons risk of dying prematurely according to a largescale new study of exercise and mortality The findings suggest that the benefits of even small amounts of vigorous exercise may be much greater than experts had assumed  In recent years moderate exercise such as brisk walking has been the focus of a great deal of exercise science and most exercise recommendations The governments formal  exercise guidelines for instance suggest that  people should engage in about  minutes of moderate exercise on most days of the week Almost as an afterthought the recommendations point out that half as much or about  minutes a day of vigorous exercise should be equally beneficial  But the science to support that number had been relatively paltry with few substantial studies having carefully tracked how much vigorous exercise is needed to reduce disease risk and increase lifespan Even fewer studies had looked at how small an amount of vigorous exercise might achieve that same result  So for the new study published  Monday in     researchers from Iowa State University the University of South Carolina the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge La and other institutions turned to a huge database maintained at the Cooper Clinic and Cooper Institute in Dallas  For decades researchers there have been collecting information about the health of tens of thousands of men and women visiting the clinic for a checkup These adults after completing extensive medical and fitness examinations have filled out questionnaires about their exercise habits including whether how often and how speedily they ran  From this database the researchers chose the records of  healthy men and women ages  to  who had visited the clinic at least  years before the start of the study Of this group  percent identified themselves as runners although their typical mileage and pace varied widely The researchers then checked death records for these adults In the intervening  or so years almost  had died many from heart disease But the runners were much less susceptible than the nonrunners The runners risk of dying from any cause was  percent lower than that for the nonrunners and their risk of dying from heart disease was   percent lower than for nonrunners even when the researchers adjusted for being overweight or for smoking although not many of the runners smoked And even overweight smokers who ran were less likely to die prematurely than people who did not run whatever their weight or smoking habits  As a group runners gained about three extra years of life compared with those adults who never ran   Remarkably these benefits were about the same no matter how much or little people ran Those who hit the paths for  minutes or more a week or who were particularly speedy clipping off sixminute miles or better lived longer than those who didnt run But they didnt live significantly longer those who ran the least including people running as little as five or  minutes a day at a leisurely pace of  minutes a mile or slower  We think this is really encouraging news said Timothy Church a professor at the Pennington Institute who holds the John S McIlHenny Endowed Chair in Health Wisdom and coauthored the study Were not talking about training for a marathon he said or even for a kilometer mile race Most people can fit in five minutes a day of running he said no matter how busy they are and the benefits in terms of mortality are remarkable  The study did not directly examine  how and why running affected the risk of premature death he said or whether running was the only exercise that provided such benefits The researchers did find that in general runners had less risk of dying than people who engaged in more moderate activities such as walking  But theres not necessarily something magical about running per se Dr Church said Instead its likely that exercise intensity is the key to improving longevity he said adding Running just happens to be the most convenient way for most people to exercise intensely  Anyone who has never run in the past or has health issues should of course consult a doctor before starting a running program Dr Church said And if after trying for a solid five minutes youre just not enjoying running switch activities he added Jump rope Vigorously pedal a stationary bike Or choose any other strenuous activity Five minutes of taxing effort might add years to your life
