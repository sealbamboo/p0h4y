If youve applied for the Aid and Attendance benefit from Department of Veterans Affairs  which can provide as much as  monthly for a veteran and spouse for caregiving expenses  then you are all too familiar with some of the reasons for the typical tomonth delays in getting an answer from the VA As The Times reported on Sunday the VA is under    more than  in all But the VA and its overseers say there is a special contributor to the backlog of AA claims the need to deter socalled pension poachers The system is being clogged by pension poachers who are preying on veterans who are submitting thousands of applications for people for whom this benefit was not intended Senator Ron Wyden Democrat of Oregon said in an email Along with Senator Richard Burr Republican of North Carolina and a ranking member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Mr Wyden introduced a bill last month aiming to help cap bogus claims  So who are these pension poachers According to the Federal Trade Commission and according to the findings of   hundreds of financial and estateplanning professionals claim to help veterans obtain the AA benefit In fact they mostly charge fees as much as    Why To hide a veterans assets so that he or she may qualify for the benefit The money can be used to pay for assisted living sometimes potential residents are referred to these services by assisted living facilities But heres the catch Technically it does not violate VA rules to transfer assets into annuities or trusts  even the day before you apply for AA Medicaid will look back at assets for  months to see who qualifies for its nursing home aid but the VA does not have such a policy The bill by Mr Wyden and Mr Burr  The sooner legislation is enacted to discourage these abuses the sooner the application backlog can be eliminated said Mr Wyden in an email    Schemes for transferring and hiding assets can backfire If the AA application is denied as so many are the vet may not be able to touch the money he has put into annuities and trusts for decades without huge penalties  Further such transfers of assets   which tracks assets and transfers for the previous five years And given the high cost of nursing homes and assisted living Medicaid may be the only way for many with limited resources to pay for longterm care  Then there is the matter of ethics Though it may be technically legal to move assets to hide savings the AA benefit was not created to enable veterans to save money for heirs It exists for veterans and their families who are unable to pay for the care they need now  Some believe the department helped create the poaching problem itself by being silent for so long about the AA benefit And the VA may be perpetuating it by prohibiting veterans from paying for legitimate expert help to begin the application process When you leave people who are in crisis to get care in the dark so that the only people with info have a hidden agenda you set up the perfect storm for these people to come in and sell you whatever said Patty Servaes founder of   who helps clients determine eligibility for the AA benefit Bottom line If you are looking for help in applying for or appealing a decision on the AA benefit avoid people who start talking about annuities and trusts instead of looking at your real income and expenses and assets to see if you legitimately qualify The VAs prohibition against paying for expert help dates back to the Civil War and ostensibly began to protect the veterans from ambulancechasing lawyers who would make the application process adversarial But those restrictions may have produced the opposite results It can make the VA itself seem the adversary rather than an organization created to help veterans
