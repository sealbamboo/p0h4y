For the first time since the early days of the AIDS epidemic gay and bisexual men will be permitted to donate blood under rules set for release next year by the Food and Drug Administration Officials at the federal agency said Tuesday that they would relax their longstanding ban on donations from men who have had sex with another man at least once since  Instead these men will be allowed to roll up their sleeves if they are free of HIV and have not engaged in homosexual activity for at least one year Though less visible than the struggle to allow gays to serve openly in the military or the effort to legalize samesex marriage the campaign to end the year ban on blood donation has become an important cause for those who see it as homophobic and unfair The FDA was caught between the civil rights of prospective gay donors and its mandate to protect public health The FDAs decision came a few weeks after a panel of independent experts concluded that imposing a waiting period or deferral of one year on those donors would not endanger the safety of the nations supply of donated blood That panel relied heavily on the experience of Australia which in  adopted a oneyear deferral policy for men who have had sex with men Sweden Britain and Japan have also altered their lifetime bans on such donors and adopted a oneyear deferral policy Dr Peter W Marks deputy director of the FDAs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said a variety of epidemiological data and statistical modeling gave the agency confidence that the relaxed strictures would not increase the risk that blood supplies would be tainted with HIV or other viruses transmitted through sex including syphilis and hepatitis B and C he said Once implemented the new rules will make about half of the men who are now turned away from blood donation centers because of a history of gay sex eligible to donate for the first time since  With the new rules the FDA aims to treat men who have had sex with men the same way as members of other groups that are at increased risk of having HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases Currently people who have had sex with an HIVinfected partner an intravenous drug user or a sex worker may donate blood only if a year has passed since their last encounter Visitors to certain parts of Africa are also deferred as blood donors for at least a year after returning to the United States Gay rights activists greeted the FDA announcement with a mix of praise and criticism This is a huge step in the right direction and we embrace this initial change said Ryan James Yezak founder and executive director of the National Gay Blood Drive in Los Angeles It does not go far enough but we support it Michael Weinstein president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles said the updated policy was well intentioned but that improved screening techniques should make it possible for the FDA to focus on individual risk factors and not simply target an entire category or population of people for exclusion or restriction from the donor pool The foundation said the policy would continue to stigmatize gay men and other men who have sex with men by reinforcing the idea that HIV is a gay disease And for many men the strictures of the new policy will in essence  function as a de facto lifetime ban Criticism also came from the Family Research Council which had argued to the FDA scientific advisory panel that the ban should remain in place Peter Sprigg a senior fellow for policy studies at the Washingtonbased group accused the agency of ignoring panel members who were clearly reluctant to approve changes and rushing to the politically correct decision demanded by homosexual activist groups Research presented to the committee confirmed the dramatically elevated risk of HIV infection among men who have sex with men Sprigg said This risk certainly justifies the highest level of vigilance and political and social concerns must not be allowed to trump the public health The advisory panels report noted that although men who have sex with men make up an estimated  of the population in  they accounted for  of the newly diagnosed cases of HIV Marks said the FDA planned to issue draft guidance on the matter early in  invite public comment for several months and issue a final rule as expeditiously as possible This wont be an immediate change he cautioned Currently about  million donors give blood  million times each year in the United States and  million patients receive the resulting blood products annually A  study published by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law estimated that a month deferral policy for men who have had sex with men would result in more than  additional people adding nearly  pints of blood to the nations supply each year The FDA regulates how blood donations are collected and how blood is transfused and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducts investigations and surveillance to assure the safety of donated blood The FDA said Tuesday that the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute had also begun to implement a blood surveillance system to make sure the nations blood supply remains safe after the rules are relaxed Marks cited Red Cross data showing that each year about  in  million units of blood screened for contamination is found to carry HIV That oversight is most likely the result of donors who have contracted HIV within the preceding three months too recent for their viral load to register on screening tests If a prospective blood donor is asked to wait a minimum of one year after his last sexual encounter with another male the deferral period might be as much as four times longer than necessary In Australia that has already prompted officials to propose a shorter waiting period of six months Groups in the US such as the National Gay Blood Drive expressed hope that the FDA in its future assessments of the policy would follow suit We dont want to take away from how huge this recommendation is but we encourage the FDA to continue this effort Yezak said But Marks said any further change would have to wait for more research At this time the scientific evidence for a deferral period shorter than one year is not compelling he said Marks acknowledged that the FDA had considered a shorter waiting period for gay men in committed relationships but ultimately rejected such a change Prospective blood donors may say theyre in a monogamous relationship Marks said but they cant necessarily guarantee the monogamous behavior of a partner That possibility makes selfreported monogamy as an indicator of HIV risk unreliable he said
