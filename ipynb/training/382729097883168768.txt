Premiums in the health insurance exchanges set to open next week will be lower than anticipated the Obama administration announced Wednesday According to a   released by the Department of Health and Human Services premiums nationwide will  be around  percent lower than originally expected and  percent of uninsured people live in a state with average premiums that are lower than expected But while the premium   that many predicted may not be materializing there may be other things about the new health plans that consumers may not like that much Until now the only premium information thats been released publicly about the Obamacare exchanges has been for states running their own and in many the rates have been   Now however the administration has released information for the  states where the federal government will operate the new exchanges in full or in part Six in  Americans who currently lack insurance will be able to find coverage that costs less than  a month HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters in a conference call And in some cases available tax credits can make health insurance really inexpensive For example said Sebelius Dallas families earning  a year will be able to buy quality coverage for as little as  a month One reason for the lowerthanexpected premiums is higherthanexpected participation by insurance companies All year it seemed that many   at least for this first year of the program A few states and some counties within states will only have spotty competition But administration officials say people in the  states where the feds are in charge will have an average of  different plans to choose from offered by multiple insurance companies And competition is key to those lower rates Parts of the country that have a number of insurers participating and competing for business are coming in with lower premiums says Larry Levitt a senior vice president at the   whos been studying the development of the exchanges So the market appears to be working But it seems that another reason that the rates are lower  at least some of them  is that insurance companies have limited the size of their doctor and hospital networks in some of the cheaper plans The lowestcost plans are coming in a lot lower than people were predicting because the networks are coming in with a lot fewer doctors and hospitals than people were predicting says Robert Laszewski Hes an   and longtime observer of the health care system Because the law requires all insurers to basically offer   varying the size of the network was about the only tool they had left to try to create a less expensive plan For example in California the lowest cost Silver plan is one that has only about half the doctors and hospitals that particular health plan has in their standard employer network says Laszewski Silver is the   among bronze silver gold and platinum Laszewski says that for people who are currently uninsured these more limited network plans will probably be just fine But for people who have been buying their own insurance or if theyve had employerprovided insurance theyre likely used to having a freer choice of doctors and hospitals And theyre going to find that comes with a price Youre going to have to pay   a month more than that to be able to get access to those kinds of networks he said Administration officials however dispute the idea that consumers will rebel against the plans with the narrower networks Gary Cohen the official at HHS who is   told reporters that state insurance officials have a long history of regulating insurers  making sure that their networks have enough doctors and hospitals to provide adequate care They certainly dont want to get a bunch of phone calls from people who have health coverage but cant get health care he said Still the data released by the administration likely wont settle the premium fight once and for all The numbers are all averages The premium individual consumers will pay will depend on where they live how old they are number of family members household income and other variables
