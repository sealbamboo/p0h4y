In San Francisco theres a new program aimed at property owners who can resist the temptations of the skyhigh real estate development market and turn their vacant lots into agricultural oases instead Many sustainability advocates have applauded the creation of the tax incentive announced in August But critics say there is no room in San Francisco to devote space to corn beans and kale when homes cost millions and rent is at least  per bedroom in desirable areas Heres how the tax break works Property owners who are willing to turn uninhabited land into farms would get that land assessed at the going tax rate for the states irrigated farmland According to the US Department of Agriculture that was about   in  If accepted into the program the property owners annual dues to the city would drop from  or more to roughly  But the landowner would have to keep the land as an agricultural operation for at least five years or pay back the balance of the tax reduction plus interest To qualify the farm must also sell or donate produce to local residents offer school tours or some other educational benefit or serve as a communityrun garden space The city legislation requires that there be some sort of public interface says Eli Zigas an urban agriculture advocate with the San Franciscobased nonprofit   who helped develop the ordinance Zigas feels urban farms can to a small degree increase a regions food security But their primary value is to raise awareness among city slickers otherwise disconnected from food production systems Zigas says The city laws author David Chiu a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors tells The Salt there is currently nowhere near enough garden space in San Francisco to accommodate locals who want to grow their own food He says the waiting list for some city residents hoping to get their hands into the soil of local community gardens is as long as two years There is enormous demand for this in every single neighborhood Chiu says adding that nonetheless some public gardens have been lost to development projects So we want to create incentive for property owners to preserve their land by using it for farming San Franciscos ordinance follows passage of a state law   in  that gave cities and counties the authority to create tax incentives to start urban farms While San Francisco is out in front activists in Los Angeles Oakland San Jose Sacramento and Fresno have all discussed creating similar incentive programs that would foster urban farming and rid their cityscapes of blighted vacant lots according to Zigas Nationally too interest in urban farming is on the upswing and many states have passed   to promote city farms In New Jersey property used for urban agriculture is exempted from property taxes as long as a nonprofit organization runs the farm In Utah urban land may be zoned for agriculture if the lot is between two and five acres Missouri Hawaii Texas and other states have created their own urban farming support programs In  Cleveland updated its zoning code to permit agriculture on all vacant residentiallyzoned lots while creating a   for farmer coops and communitysupported agriculture In Maryland counties and the city of Baltimore may now offer tax credits for land used exclusively for farming Baltimore officials have drafted a   to take advantage of the state law Urban farming advocate Megan Wakefield with the Community Law Center in Baltimore says growing crops in the city is important because it revitalizes abandoned lots allows people to experience cultivation of food and helps foster a sense of community among neighbors From an environmental perspective Wakefield adds urban farming projects throughout the city help reduce the distance food has to travel to get to the consumer and provide pervious ground that helps reduce storm water runoff But in San Francisco at least not everyone likes the idea of using valuable real estate to grow food Its not like we have a food shortage in California  but we certainly have a housing shortage says David Sobel the executive director of the   a nonprofit that helps lowerto middleincome people find affordable housing Sobel says he would like to see initiatives that support rooftop farming or encourage residents to grow backyard gardens He says lowerincome neighborhoods especially could benefit from having access to such greenery That could help meet two needs at once without precluding people from living there he says Aaron Roland owns a twolot property in San Franciscos Potrero Hill neighborhood that has been used as a farm for years While he recognizes theres a housing shortage hed like to keep the property the way it is Thanks to the new tax break Roland will begin saving about  per year Roland is paying especially low taxes because he bought the property  years ago Is there  in value to the people of San Francisco in having this land used for agriculture I think there is says Roland He estimates he would reap about  million if he sold the land for development rather than use it as a garden Karen Heisler owner of the restaurant   sources some of her produce from a San Francisco urban farm She says she supported the state law passed in  Heisler says encouraging temporary gardens does not prevent a house from eventually taking its place on an undeveloped property it just encourages property owners to do something productive with their land while possibly making development plans For properties that are unsafe for building due to instability or erosion issues the citys tax break offers owners an alternative longterm use plan she says Assembly Bill  does nothing to impede the development of housing she writes in an email If a developer has a site and resources ready for development she or he will simply go forward and develop Sobel though expects any efforts to replace a beloved community garden with homes will meet with fierce resistance I think a temporary garden could easily become permanent he says I hope peoples expectations are shaped around the eventuality that these properties could eventually be developed
