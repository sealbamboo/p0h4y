Patients taking traditional blood thinners like warfarin must have tests every few weeks to ensure that blood levels of the drug are in an acceptable range But  brought a seemingly welcome alternative Pradaxa No regular testing was needed consumers were told and they would never have to tinker with the dose to get it just right Convenience was the main reason the Food and Drug Administration put the drug on a fast track for approval rushing it to market on the basis of a single large clinical trial Hundreds of thousands of Americans started taking the drug But it has been far from the boon everyone expected By the end of  thousands of serious   episodes linked to the drug had been reported to the FDA The manufacturer Boehringer Ingelheim agreed in May to pay   filed by patients taking Pradaxa Many claimed the drug caused uncontrolled bleeding But hundreds of thousands of consumers with   continue to take it and for them a new quandary has emerged Should they switch to another bloodthinner There are no easy answers said   a professor of medicine at University of California San Francisco and a coauthor of a   about Pradaxa in The BMJ With any new drug we dont really know the full extent of the risks and benefits and thats especially true for this one because it was approved on a fast track she said Critics say the companys own studies showed that continual monitoring and adjustments to the dosage on a patientbypatient basis could reduce the number of bleeding episodes without hampering the drugs ability to prevent strokes But that change in protocol could undermine Pradaxas main selling point its ease of use You could have had a much safer drug said Dr Deborah Cohen the investigations editor at The BMJ who wrote     last month critical of Pradaxas record By carefully monitoring drug levels in patients you could reduce major bleeds by  to  percent compared to wellcontrolled warfarin she said Officials at Boehringer Ingelheim denied the assertions Dr Cohen reviewed four of the companys internal analyses but representatives say the studies were preliminary assessments that did not stand up to further review We did simulations to try to improve on the benefitrisk profile of the drug and concluded that plasma monitoring was not going to add anything Dr John Smith senior vice president and country region medical director said in an interview last week He urged patients to talk to their doctors and to not quit taking the drug based on what they read in a newspaper as their risk of   may increase The clinical trial of Pradaxa found it as effective or even slightly better than warfarin at preventing strokes though questions arose about whether all major bleeding events were reported FDA officials also defended the drug Our   on Pradaxa from May  notes that we still consider Pradaxa to have a favorable benefittorisk profile and have made no changes to the current label or to the recommendations for use Sandy Walsh an agency spokeswoman said in an email All blood thinners carry a risk of causing uncontrollable internal bleeding and studies have found that warfarin causes onethird of all drug complicationrelated hospitalizations of older Americans Still Dr Redberg said she generally steers patients toward warfarin Although its a highmaintenance drug physicians are familiar with its risks and benefits It has been around for  years Its a choice between the devil we know and the devil we dont Dr Redberg said Patients on warfarin must go for frequent blood tests to measure their clotting time at specialized clinics Pharmacists adjust their medication to make sure its in a safe range Patients are supposed to avoid leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables like brussels sprouts because they contain vitamin K which facilitates blood clot formation But vitamin K also can counteract warfarins effect if a patient is bleeding profusely There is no similar countermeasure to Pradaxa though company officials say one is under development One of the plaintiffs in litigation against Boehringer Ingelheim was the family of a yearold Pennsylvania man who died after a car crash in  according to Dr Cohen Ken Barndt was taking Pradaxa as part of the clinical trial at the time Though he was conscious when taken to the hospital doctors were unable to stop his bleeding When they found out he was taking an experimental blood thinner they contacted Boehringer Ingelheim and were told there was no antidote Pradaxa is supposed to be easier to use than warfarin There is one standard dose patients can eat whatever they want and they dont need to come in for regular testing The person who is  who has a busy professional life with a lot of travel cant necessarily control their diet and actually likes to eat things like broccoli and kale  they feel liberated said Dr Patrick OGara the director of clinical cardiology at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston While only a single dose of Pradaxa was approved in the United States aside from a very lowdose pill for patients with kidney impairment European regulators approved two doses That gave choices to patients who may metabolize the drug more slowly like women and older adults A study published earlier this year by the companys researchers found plasma levels of the drug vary up to fivefold among patients Some who take Pradaxa may be at greater risk of bleeding  particularly older patients anyone with kidney problems those with a history of   or   and patients who take other drugs that increase bleeding like aspirin Women and thinner patients tend to have higher plasma concentrations of the drug and higher concentrations of the drug may also be associated with a higher risk of bleeding In approving Pradaxa European regulators insisted that a test to monitor blood levels be made available though they stopped short of requiring routine monitoring Even if they want to American patients cannot check their blood levels of Pradaxa The test has not been approved by the FDA Â
