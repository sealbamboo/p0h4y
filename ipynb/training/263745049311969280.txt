A thick and creamy shake sounds deliciously satisfying and adding that kind of mouth feel to lowfat foods has become a   business But are we really fooled   Some attempts to get people to eat less of some kinds of thick lowcalorie foods have backfired People actually   when their bodies realized that what appeared to be a highcalorie treat was not   So scientists have been trying to figure out just what it is that makes us feel satisfied Is it the thick The creamy Or just the calories Its complicated   Even a subtle increase in texture can do the trick according to new research out of the University of Sussex in England They found that volunteers were able to detect even slight differences in the thickness and creaminess of a yogurt drink with different levels of a thickener   Its derived from the pods of trees native to the Peruvian Andes and is added to ice cream and other foods to make them thicker and creamier   The volunteers said both thickness and creaminess made the drinks more filling But when it came to keeping people from getting hungry they said only the sensation of thickness matters   Confused We here at The Salt were too So we asked   the lead author of the study what it means   The experience of eating has two key stages she says  satiation and satiety   Satiation is that feeling of becoming full while eating until its time to say no more   Satiety on the other hand is how long to we wait to eat again and how much do we eat at the next meal McCrickerd says in an email They are she added two subtly different yet related experiences Only the drinks that seemed thick offered the sensation of satiety   People may be more sensitive to thickness she says because its less subtle than creaminess and we have more experience with filling up on thick foods Hello mashed potatoes Creaminess may not be a strong enough signal to convey that message alone The results were   in the journal     So eaters in search of satiety may want to consider thickness as a source of satisfaction   Wonder what other gums are thickening up your food NPRs Eliza Barclay gave   from alginates to Xanthan gum
