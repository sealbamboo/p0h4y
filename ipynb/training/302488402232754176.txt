Wouldnt it be great considering how many of us are overweight if carrying a few extra pounds meant wed live longer A recent analysis of nearly  published studies involving almost  million people found surprisingly that being a little overweight was associated with a lower risk of death than having a normal weight or being obese The sweet spot as it were appears to be a body mass index ranging from  to less than  The findings   in early January in   the  But is the finding real An   pointed to problems with BMI as tool for assessing obesity And it suggested that artifacts in the data might be another factor behind the results The lowest death rates in most studies have been seen for people with a BMI between  and  the editorial point out The authors suggested that the most important findings from the analysis were that death rates were higher for the obese BMI of  or more and people who were quite underweight BMI less than  As luck would have it   a demographer at Columbia Universitys Mailman School of Public Health has been looking into some of the same data that have been cited in support of the socalled obesity paradox I sort of gingerly came into this field and was blown away by the debate surrounding it he tells Shots Some of the theories advanced to explain the paradox include a beneficial metabolic effect from modest fat reserves for the elderly and cushioning in case of falls he says Masters decided to look at the data and he found problems in plain sight Some of the studies excluded people who lived in institutions like nursing homes skewing the results toward healthier people Frail people would be less likely to participate in surveys and studies too he says He also found a problem that he said reminded him of a report about falling cats in Manhattan Researchers found paradoxically that cats falling from windows on the highest floors of apartment buildings were more likely to survive than those who stumbled out of window on middle floors say the fifth or sixth floors The theory as explained in   of   is that the cats falling from high floors reached terminal velocity and had time to turn themselves and land feet first  something the cats falling from middle floors wouldnt have time to do But Masters says theres a better explanation A socalled selection effect that is biasing the data he says All the reports about the falling cats came from local vets who treated them The cats that fell from the high floors were far more likely to die on impact and never be taken to a vet Masters says but a few survived Those that fell from middle floors and were in bad shape had a chance at survival The vets saw more of these cats but many more died In the surveys of elderly people the overweight and obese are outliers like the cats that survived a fall from a high floor Theyre probably not representative of whats normal he says Theyre probably representative of the best The population were most interest in studying  the older aged obese population  is simply not there he says An analysis Masters and colleagues did challenges the paradox headon The risk of mortality from obesity compounds and grows stronger as you age he says Indeed their paper   by the  this month calls for a rejection of the paradox and a cleareyed assessment of the hazards the obesity epidemic poses to our aging population Our results caution against framing the obesity epidemic as a moral panic in which the harm administered stems more from illadvised hyperbole than from the reallife consequences of obesity Masters and his colleagues write In light of our findings we are on the contrary much more concerned about inappropriate denial of the epidemics consequences for US mortality Our results suggest that major public health consequences will track with the epidemic and that efforts to stem its growth are probably well worth the investment
