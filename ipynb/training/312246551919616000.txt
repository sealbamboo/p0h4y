Every day something like  hospitalized Americans suffer   Thats bad news Only about one in five will live to leave the hospital But for the lucky  a year who are resuscitated and survive the outlook is much better than expected authors of a   say A year later  percent of these survivors will still be alive the study finds  substantially more than most doctors probably think The vast majority wont have another cardiac arrest in that time and a third wont need to be hospitalized again Thats huge study author   a cardiologist at   in Kansas City Mo tells Shots That means the majority of patients are going to have at least reasonably meaningful quality of life for the first year According to Chan they have a  percent chance of living for three years We have worse odds with cancer Chan says and were aggressively treating that with all sorts of complicated chemotherapies He notes the odds of surviving cardiac arrest three years after hospital discharge are about the same as for patients with   on whom medical resources such as heartassist devices and intensive supportive care are lavished Chans juxtaposition of cardiac arrest with cancer and heart failure is deliberately provocative His point is that theres a big disconnect between the gloomy attitude most doctors have about the   of resuscitation attempts for patients with cardiac arrest versus their aggressive goallout stance toward even advanced cancers We know that patients with advanced cancer often want to live even if their expected survival from treatment is one or two months Chan says Doctors   attitude toward cardiac arrest he says strongly colors the attitudes of patients and their families who often opt for   orders when they have a reasonable chance of surviving a year or more with acceptable quality of life The new calculations of the longterm prospects for survivors of inhospital cardiac arrest are the first ever from a large national data base  a   of  such episodes from  hospitals The study is in this weeks   Asked if he thinks the new numbers might alter doctors and patients thinking about when to opt for a DNR order Chan says I think they ought to The implications  at a time when the medical community is trying to minimize futile care and channel resources where they will do the most good  are potentially vast But to understand the meaning of the newly calculated survival odds you need to look at the whole picture  from the cardiac arrest to the chances of being discharged from the hospital to the likelihood of being alive a year or two or three later A hospitalized person whose heart stops currently has a  percent chance of being successfully resuscitated and surviving to discharge Chan says Thats substantially better than the  percent it was about a decade ago but the stark fact is that nearly four out of five such patients dont make it Among those who do the new data suggest that  percent will die in the year after discharge and  percent will survive Bottom line For the person who suffers cardiac arrest in the hospital the odds of being among the oneyear survivors works out to about  percent or one in eight Twelve percent is not great odds Chan says but its not zero odds He says he didnt expect the odds to be as good as they are Before the study he thought oneyear survival among those who leave the hospital would be around  percent not  percent He was also surprised that survival was so good even among the oldest patients Even if youre  and older you have a  percent chance of living to one year if you make it to hospital discharge Chan says Not everybody has an equal chance though AfricanAmericans have lower survival and the Kansas City researchers are trying to figure out if thats because they dont get as good care before or after the leave the hospital Women do slightly better than men And neurologic status matters a lot  percent of those with mild or no brain damage are alive a year after discharge versus  percent of those with moderate damage  percent with severe damage and only  percent of those who were in coma after their cardiac arrest Chan says theres   from one hospital to another in the proportion of cardiac arrest patients who make it to discharge  only  percent for some hospitals versus  percent at others That suggests theres   for overall improvement if researchers can figure out how the top performers do it and replicate their best practices One further note All the survival numbers above pertain only to patients whose hearts stop while theyre in the hospital where resuscitation attempts are supposed to occur within one minute according to current guidelines Those whose arrest occurs at home or elsewhere in the community fare much worse Only about four percent of them even make it to the hospital
