Igor Davydenko is railthin with dark circles under his eyes He has a haunted look reinforced by black prison overalls with reflective tape on the shoulders and cuffs Davydenko could be labeled as a loser in many ways The yearold is a drug addict serving time for robbery and assault Hes serving his third stretch in a Siberian prison But Davydenko is about to become a winner in at least one way If all goes well he will soon be declared cured of one of the deadliest forms of tuberculosis In the last decade Russia has found itself contending with new strains of TB that are resistant to many drugs and hard to cure For years prisons were considered to be one of the most dangerous pockets of drugresistant TB in Russia and a source of the disease in the general community In  more than   had active TB infections and drugresistant forms were present in about  percent of chronic cases But the Russian prison system has been working to change that About a decade ago it got together with the nonprofit   and set up a clinic at a Siberian prison specifically aimed at treating tuberculosis among inmates The facility is called Medical and Penal Institution Number One And against long odds its making progress against   The rate of infection has dropped sevenfold and the death rate has fallen to single digits Alexander Leshchyov the deputy warden says Theres no hiding the fact that Medical and Penal Institution Number One is a prison Its surrounded by high brick walls coils of razor wire and watch towers But as penitentiaries go Medical and Penal Institution Number One isnt the worst Theres a bakery clean dormitories and a small cafe that serves as a visiting area Theres even a theater where inmate singers are practicing for a yearly talent show with some of the other nearby prisons In the yard a warden points out a basrelief mural sculpted by an inmate artist Inmate Davydenko first came here in  after he contracted TB in another prison I was losing weight had the sweats coughing  in short all the symptoms They found it was TB and they sent me here he says Prison officials say Davydenko had a typical strain of tuberculosis that responds to normal treatment and that he was cured by the time his sentence was up in  But Davydenko went back to a life of drugs and crime that quickly landed him back in jail When Davydenko came back here six years ago the doctors again found TB which he may have picked up in pretrial detention The strain was a little worse than the one he had the first time but it was still susceptible to the most commonly used antiTB drugs This time the treatment took a year and Davydenko was declared cured again but kept under observation as he served out his term But in  a routine scan found TB again This time it was drugresistant and Davydenko faced a longer more arduous treatment with fierce   The key to curing TB in prisonsers is getting each patient to take responsibility for his own health Warden Leshchyov says Thats not easy Its a very complicated moment that we call compliance he says It is such a simple thing but its incredibly difficult to acquire it Davydenkos history  his drug addiction his crimes his repeated stints in prison  read like a textbook example of why its so hard to get someone like him to take care of himself The experience of being treated for the disease can have a positive effect on an inmates rehabilitation Leshchyov says Davydenko is an absolutely creative person the warden says During the treatment there comes a turning point when the treatment changes not only the body but a persons soul Davydenko agrees that he has come to feel responsible for himself and others When you get ill the responsibility is on you so that other people dont get sick  your family and neighbors and so on he says Davidenko has been through  months of a month treatment and he says hes feeling better now Hes scheduled to get out of prison in about   But he seems hesitant to say hes on the path to rehabilitationYou see he says Im in here for the third time He wonders if anyone will believe hes changed Im already  he says I should think about what to do next I dont know Prison officials say they have hopes for Davydenko They say that inmate patients whove received the full spectrum of treatment have a much better chance not only of recovering their health but of recovering a productive place in society
