Measuring peoples sense of smell in later life could help doctors predict how likely they are to be alive in five years time a PLOS One study suggests  A survey of  adults found  with the poorest sense of smell were dead within five years  compared to just   who identified odours correctly Scientists say the loss of smell sense does not cause death directly but may be an early warning sign They say anyone with longlasting changes should seek medical advice  Researchers from the University of Chicago asked a representative sample of adults between the ages of  to take part in a quick smell test  The assessment involved identifying distinct odours encased on the tips of felttip pens The smells included peppermint fish orange rose and leather Five years later some  of adults who had the lowest scores  errors had passed away compared with  with moderate smell loss and just  with a healthy sense of smell  errors  And despite taking issues such as age nutrition smoking habits poverty and overall health into account researchers found those with the poorest sense of smell were still at greatest risk Lead scientist Prof Jayant Pinto said We think loss of the sense of smell is like the canary in the coal mine  It doesnt directly cause death but it is a harbinger an early warning system that shows damage may have been done  Our findings could provide a useful clinical test a quick inexpensive way to identify patients most at risk Exactly how smell loss contributes to lifespan remains unclear but the researchers put forward a number of possible reasons behind the link  They say a reduced ability to sniff out odours could signal less regeneration or repair of cells in the body overall as a healthy sense of smell depends partly on a continual turnover of cells that line the nose And a worsening sense of smell may serve as a mirror for a lifetimes exposure to pollution and bugs they say  They are now doing more research to understand the reasons behind the link  Prof Pinto added The sense of smell is a little underappreciated  it plays a very important part in everyday life  But we dont want people to panic A bad cold allergies and sinus problems can all affect your sense of smell  People shouldnt be too worried but if problems persist they should speak to their physicians And perhaps this study shows we need to start paying more attention to sensory health overall Prof Tim Jacob of Cardiff University who was not involved in the research said This wellconducted study suggests the sense of smell is intimately linked to health and wellbeing Smell lies at the interface between physiology and psychology which is a battlefield of reciprocal interactions  For example smell loss can result in depression and depression can result in changes in the ability to smell
