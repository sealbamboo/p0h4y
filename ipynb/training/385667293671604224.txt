Matt Haimovitz is  and a worldrenowned cellist He rushed into the classical music scene at age  after Itzhak Perlman the famed violinist heard him play By the time I was   years old I was on the road playing with Israel Philharmonic New York Philharmonic and some of the great orchestras So it was pretty meteoric   says I grew up with a lot of classical music in the household My mother is a pianist and took me to many concerts But nothing in his family history explains where Haimovitz got his extraordinary talent And thats typical   a psychology professor at Boston College who has studied prodigies tells NPRs David Greene People are fascinated by these children because they dont understand where it came from You will see parents who say I wasnt like this my husband wasnt like this It seems to sometimes just come out of the blue Winner says Its not clear whether a prodigys brain is any different from the brain of other children in part because there have been no studies comparing the brains of prodigies with those of average people But I believe that anything that shows up so early without training has got to be either a genetic or some other biological basis Winner says If a child suddenly at age  goes to the piano and picks out a tune and does it beautifully that has to be because that child has a different brain Children who are extremely gifted tend to be socially different too Winner says They feel like they cant find other kids like themselves so they feel kind of weird maybe even like a freak and feel like they dont have anybody to connect with Gifted children are more likely to be introverted Winner says and spend more time alone On the other hand they also long to connect with other kids and they cant find other kids like themselves For his part Haimovitz says he didnt have many friends as a child mainly because he was so focused on the music There was no time afterwards to party I would at the time practice four or five hours a day and Id have to get my homework done But I didnt feel like I was missing anything because this is what I wanted he says I chose it But certainly in terms of friendships theyve been few and intense As Haimovitz got older his friendship with his best friend  his music  began to change He became frustrated creatively He wanted to play other kinds of music but felt constricted by the image and the expectations of the boy prodigy who played classical music and filled concert halls When you start that early you suddenly start to grow up in public and I wanted to experiment Haimovitz says So he took his cello into punk rock clubs and coffeehouses He played Bach and Haydn and Hendrix My teacher Leonard Rose we never played any th century music He didnt like it But once I was exposed to Jimi Hendrix Miles Davis and others I couldnt really turn back I wanted to know more he says Bow in hand he even took a stab at Led Zeppelin What Haimovitz did may have been exceptional even for a prodigy Winner says as prodigies grow up they struggle to advance their talents The skill of being a child prodigy is the skill of mastering something thats already been invented  whether its Western math classical music or realistic drawing Winner says But adult creators actually do something in a new way Thats a very different skill and most prodigies do not make that leap Its also hard for prodigies to grow up and suddenly not be so special she says Haimovitz says hes been able to navigate all of this He has a very full life  a wife two children and music I rarely look back honestly because theres so much going on in the present and the future But those moments when I am in the car and I happen to hear an old broadcast or recording occasionally I am struck and say Wow I did some good things back then  he says Winner says that its often the adults in a prodigys childhood who determine how theyll fare when they grow up I think it all has to do with how many expectations were put on you as a child   That is really dangerous she says But if you say Youre terrifically musical and youre going to have a wonderfully musical life thats a very different kind of message to give to kids and a much more positive one
