Toward the end of the summer I was seeing a middleschool girl for a physical The notes from a clinic visit last spring said she was a good student but didnt talk enough in class So I asked her Is this still a problem for you  Im shy she said Im just shy Should I have turned to her mother and suggested  a counselor An academic evaluation Should I have probed further How do you feel in school do you have some friends is anybody bullying you Or should I have said Lots of people are shy Its one of the healthy normal styles of being human All of these responses together would have been correct A child who is being bullied or bothered may be anxious about drawing attention to herself a child who doesnt ever talk in class may be holding back because some learning problem is getting in the way making her selfconscious So you do need to listen  especially to a child who talks less rather than more  and find ways to ask questions Are you happy anxious afraid But shyness is also part of the great and glorious range of the human normal Two years ago Kathleen Merikangas a senior investigator at the National Institute of Mental Health and her colleagues published   We found that about half of kids in America describe themselves as shy she told me Common though it may be our schools  and our broader culture  do not always celebrate the reserved and retiring Children who are shy who dont raise their hand who dont talk in class are really penalized in this society Dr Merikangas said I have heard it said that temperament was invented by the first parent to have a second child  thats when parents realize that children come wired with many of the determinants of disposition and personality What worked with Baby  doesnt necessarily work with Baby  The analysis of temperament has been a topic of discussion in pediatrics and psychology for decades Temperament is the largely inborn set of behaviors that are the style with which a person functions not to be confused with their motivation or their developmental status and abilities said Dr William B Carey a clinical professor of pediatrics at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia and the author of Understanding Your Childs Temperament Shyness reflects a childs place on the temperamental continuum the part of it that involves dealing with new and unfamiliar circumstances And starting a new school year may be hard on those who find new situations more difficult and more full of anxiety What most children need is time to settle in support from parents and teachers and sometimes help making connections and participating in class If a child is not more comfortable after a month or so parents should look at whether more help is needed said Anne Marie Albano director of the Columbia University Clinic for Anxiety and Related Disorders Treatment usually involves cognitive behavioral strategies to help the child cope with anxiety All ranges of temperament have their uncomfortable or even pathological outer zones Just as there are children whose rambunctious eagerness to participate makes trouble for them in school or signals the presence of other problems there are children whose silence is a shout for help Im struck by the parallels between   and the ways   In both cases there is concern about the risk of pathologizing children who are well within the range of normal and worry that we are too likely to medicate outliers By this thinking children who would once have been considered shy and quiet too often get   just as children who would once have been considered lively and rambunctious too often get   medications But the most important question is whether children are in distress Dr Merikangass study distinguished between the common trait of shyness and the psychiatric diagnosis of social phobia Over all about  percent of the adolescents in the study were severely restricted by social anxiety they included some who described themselves as shy and some who did not The authors questioned whether the debate about the medicalization of shyness might be obscuring the detection of the distinct signs of   For parents who simply want to help a shy child cope with for example a brand new classroom full of brand new people consider rehearsing scripting encounters and interactions The best thing they can do is do a role play and behavioral rehearsal ahead of time said Steven Kurtz a senior clinician at the Child Mind Institute in Manhattan Parents should plan on rewarding the bravery But dont take over The danger point is rescuing too soon too often too much so the kids dont develop coping mechanisms said Dr Kurtz Cognitive behavioral therapy relies on successive approximations in which children slowly close in on the behaviors they are hoping to achieve In that spirit a parent might arrange to meet another parent on the way to school so a shy child can walk with another and bond A teacher might look for the right partner to pair up with a shy child for cooperative activities in the classroom Probably the worst thing to do is to say Dont be shy Dont be quietÂ  Dr Merikangas told me This is not about trying to change the childs temperament Its about respecting and honoring temperament and variation and helping children navigate the world with their own instruments
