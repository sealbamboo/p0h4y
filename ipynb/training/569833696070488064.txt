Five UK Ebola nurses and doctors are under investigation by regulators, Public Health England says. . They are looking into the screening of medics who flew back to England on 28 December after treating patients in Sierra Leone.. On this flight was Scottish nurse Pauline Cafferkey - who developed Ebola - and some of her colleagues. . Questions have arisen over the health assessments and protocols that were followed.. Media reports have suggested Ms Cafferkey may have had signs of Ebola before leaving Sierra Leone but regulators have not commented on this.. Public Health England said: "During our recent assessment of the screening of some returning healthcare workers at Heathrow on 28 December, information emerged which needed to be passed to the General Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Council. . "We are aware that the regulators are now considering the matter and it would be inappropriate for PHE to comment further at this time. . "The risk to the general public from Ebola remains very low.". Ms Cafferkey - who had volunteered with Save the Children at a treatment centre in Kerry Town, in Sierra Leone - was diagnosed with Ebola in December, after returning to Glasgow via London.. After having her temperature checked several times at Heathrow, she was allowed to board a connecting flight to Glasgow. . She has now recovered from the virus following treatment at the Royal Free Hospital in London. . The Nursing and Midwifery Council, which looks into whether healthcare workers are fit to practise, said: "Following information we received from Public Health England, we can confirm that we are investigating allegations about the conduct of three nurses.". Two doctors are also being checked by the medical regulator the General Medical Council.. A spokesperson said the enquiries were "at an early stage".
