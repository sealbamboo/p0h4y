Forms of gonorrhea that dont respond to the last line of antibiotics have rapidly spread in Great Britain expanding the reach of drugresistant disease The number of gonorrhea cases with decreased sensitivity to the frontline drug cefixime increased by nearly six times from  to  in England and Wales a team from the UKs Health Protection Agency   Tuesday in  Drugresistant gonorrhea is a growing trend worldwide with cases rising in Asia North America and Europe Japan has even documented a   strain of gonorrhea that can thwart all available drugs Sixty years ago doctors had a large arsenal against   including penicillin ampicillin tetracycline and doxycycline But one by one each of those antibiotics stopped working Now there are only two drugs left   which is taken orally and   which is injected into muscle Last summer evidence emerged that cefixime had stopped working against gonorrhea in the US The data were so worrisome that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   and issued new guidelines for treating the sexually transmitted disease Then in January Canada   the first case of cefiximeresistant gonorrhea Gonorrhea aka the clap is the secondmostcommon sexually transmitted disease in the US with more than  cases reported in  In the current study epidemiologists tested drug sensitivity for more than  gonorrhea cases in England and Wales Strains that showed signs of resisting cefixime steadily increased from  to  when  percent of cases didnt respond to normal doses of the medication This percentage then fell to  in  The gonorrhea cases that didnt respond well to cefixime also showed resistance to ceftriaxone These two drugs are in the same class of antibiotics So many scientists worry that once the bacterium conquers one of them it will eventually knock out the other too The world doesnt have any backup treatments for gonorrhea Once this class of antibiotics is gone weve got a big problem
