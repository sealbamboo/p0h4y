A report into sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile at Stoke Mandeville Hospital is to say staff were told of  complaints at the time the BBC understands  The independent investigation into Saviles behaviour at the hospital is due to be published at  GMT Lawyer Liz Dux representing  claimants of abuse at the hospital said it would be a disgrace if senior management escaped blame Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust says it will respond later Savile who died aged  in October  was a major fundraiser and regular visitor to Stoke Mandeville for more than  years He had a flat and office on the hospital site The Stoke Mandeville inquiry was led by independent investigator Dr Androulla Johnstone and overseen by a local oversight panel led by the hospital trusts nonexecutive director Keith Gilchrist The report was originally expected to have been completed by the end of  but has been repeatedly delayed Investigations into  other hospitals including Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor psychiatric hospital were published last June  One of the complaints of abuse is believed to have been made to a nurse a ward sister and a hospital manager Nine reports were made to nurses alone with one more also reaching a manager the report is believed to say It will also highlight that more than  people were abused by Jimmy Savile at Stoke Mandeville Hospital Victims included patients staff and visitors One victim is understood to have been as young as eight The BBC has spoken to one victim who has not been named to protect her identity She was  and a patient at the time She said Savile climbed through the window by her bed before sexually assaulting her She said It was absolutely disgusting its just the worst thing possible She said Savile seemed to know all about her reason for being at Stoke Mandeville I told the nurses what Savile had done the fact that he came in and had spoken to me How did he know these things about me They just said they know hes like that and ignore him ignore him They thought it was funny really I thought hed just done that to me I thought that was something I was just going to have to live with I had no idea he was doing things to other people Lawyer Ms Dux of Slater  Gordon who represents the majority of the victims said As an institution Stoke Mandeville in my opinion is actually the most blameworthy for Saviles crimes We have very young vulnerable people there who were there in a place to be looked after some of whom couldnt move some of them were in wheelchairs We even have a clear example of someone reporting the abuse to a senior nursing sister and being told to be quiet because of what he did for the institution It will be a disgrace if the report into Stoke Mandeville reaches the same findings as it did in Leeds  that there was no accountability or knowledge within the senior management of the hospital Investigators found that members of staff at Leeds General Hospital failed to pass on complaints of abuse to senior managers The BBC understands the report will also say Saviles reputation as a sex pest was an open secret Staff described him as creepy and a lecher who had access to the mortuary alone out of hours Stoke Mandevilles former director of nursing Chris McFarlane said reports of abuse by Savile never reached senior management ears  She said Savile was free to go anywhere in the hospital If  was no access and  was total access Jimmy had  access to the hospital to all parts If he knocked on a closed door and somebody opened the door Jimmy would be allowed in I dont believe I ever knew anybody even the ones who thought there was something funny about him anybody who would have said youre not allowed in here How could we have allowed him to sit with our patients in the spinal unit some of whom were tetraplegic so paralysed from the neck down others from the chest or waist down sit with them without anybody bothering to ask what he was doing Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust said it would not provide any comment before the report was published
