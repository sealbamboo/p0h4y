Browning meat in the oven grill or frying pan produces chemicals which may increase the risk of developing dementia US researchers suggest Advanced glycation end AGE products have been linked to diseases such as type diabetes Mice fed a highAGEs diet had a buildup of dangerous proteins in the brain and impaired cognitive function  Experts said the results were compelling but did not provide definitive answers AGEs are formed when proteins or fats react with sugar This can happen naturally and during the cooking process Researchers at the Icahn school of medicine at Mount Sinai in New York tested the effect of AGEs on mice and people The animal experiments   showed that a diet rich in AGEs affects the chemistry of the brain It leads to a buildup of defective beta amyloid protein  a hallmark of Alzheimers disease The mice eating a lowAGEs diet were able to prevent the production of damaged amyloid The mice performed less well in physical and thinking tasks after their AGEsrich diet  A shortterm analysis of people over  suggested a link between high levels of AGEs in the blood and cognitive decline  The study concluded We report that agerelated dementia may be causally linked to high levels of food advanced glycation end products Importantly reduction of foodderived AGEs is feasible and may provide an effective treatment strategy Derek Hill a professor of medical imaging sciences at University College London commented The results are compelling  Because cures for Alzheimers disease remain a distant hope efforts to prevent it are extremely important but this study should be seen as encouraging further work rather than as providing definitive answers  But it is grounds for optimism  this paper adds to the body of evidence suggesting that using preventative strategies might reduce the prevalence of Alzheimers disease and other dementias in society and that could have very positive impact on us all Dr Simon Ridley from the charity Alzheimers Research UK said Diabetes has previously been linked to an increased risk of dementia and this small study provides some new insight into some of the possible molecular processes that may link the two conditions  Its important to note that the people in this study did not have dementia This subject has so far not been well studied in people and we dont yet know whether the amount of AGEs in our diet might affect our risk of dementia
