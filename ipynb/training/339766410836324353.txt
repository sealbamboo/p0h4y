Deepak and Sanjiv Chopra both followed in their fathers footsteps and became physicians But while one chose Western medicine the other took a spiritual approach Now theyve teamed up for a memoir   host Michel Martin speaks with the Chopras about their new book   Deepak Chopra I like to say that Sanjiv took care of the body and I took care of the soul Sanjiv Chopra One of my favorite quotes is  To dare is to lose ones footing momentarily not to dare is to lose ones self I think Deepak found himself Deepak Chopra specialized in neuroendocrinology but he says he soon realized the connection between mind and body  We started this whole idea of that wherever a thought goes a molecule follows And the molecule is not just in your brain  its everywhere in your body There are receptors to these molecules in your immune system in your gut and in your heart So when you say I have a gut feeling or my heart is sad or I am bursting with joy youre not speaking metaphorically Youre speaking literally  Sanjiv Chopra still practices traditional Western medicine Today he specializes in hepatology and is a professor of medicine and faculty dean for continuing medical education at Harvard Medical School However he did learn the art of meditation and recommends the practice I tell my students and colleagues I say You should meditate once a day And if you dont have time to do that you should meditate twice a day Deepak Chopra If you want to do really important things in life and big things in life you cant do anything by yourself And your best teams are your friends and your siblings Sanjiv Chopra Happiest people on this planet the No  attribute is that they have a lot of good friends They have good family as well Sometimes your family are your best friends
