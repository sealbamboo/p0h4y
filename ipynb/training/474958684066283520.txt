Not many Broadway stars have to dodge punches on stage But for Andy Karl it is all in a nights work Mr Karl  plays the title character in the musical Rocky  a high adrenaline show based on the original  film written by and starring Sylvester Stallone To prepare for his role Mr Karl devoted himself to a grueling gym routine devised by a personal trainer But his workouts do not end at the gym The role requires the actor to go through the punishing training routine of a boxer every night along with four choreographed fights that include some fullcontact punches  For his efforts Mr Karl was nominated in April for a Tony award for best actor The winners will be announced on Sunday night  Recently we caught up with Mr Karl at a Crunch gym in Manhattan to learn about training to play the iconic boxer his exercise and diet strategy for achieving the Rocky look and why black eyes and bruises are part of the job Here are edited excerpts from our conversation Can you tell us about your physical preparation for the show What goals did you have in mind  Rocky is a fighter Hes in great physical shape and Sylvester Stallone has always been in great shape So I had someone to look up to and a movie to judge my own physical attributes The goals were basically to keep my stamina up and also to put on some more mass which is hard when youre doing eight shows a week under hot lights  Were you always a fit person I had always gone to the gym but never taken on a trainer I knew I had some goals to put on some mass so to do that I got a great trainer here at Crunch Justin Weddle He and I worked on intrinsic muscles  the ones underneath the big muscles that can actually build those larger muscles Just going to the gym and doing a couple of bicep curls and bench presses doesnt quite do it so my trainer and I worked on a lot of core and we worked on shoulders because a boxer has to have good shoulders  How did you build muscle  We do a mix of things We do many kinds of circuits to strengthen my core We use the   which allow you to use your body weight in different ways We do a lot of unique training with  so you can strengthtrain in ways that keep you limber And we also use weights  Do you train every day We try to find as many days as we can With the show theres a lot of press and theres an award season thats coming up But I know how important it is to get in here and work out It makes me feel much better to do the show after Ive worked out because things are pumping and things are good So I do get in here every day either by myself or with my trainer and maybe take one day off But when I do take a day off I feel guilty about it  How much time do you spend working out  I spend a good hour working out Its a pretty intense hour But working out in that condensed amount of time and hitting a lot of muscles pushes your stamina Its imperative for what I do every night and to understanding Rockys mentality Rocky gets the offer of a lifetime to fight the heavyweight champion of the world so he has to put the extra time into working out and getting mentally prepared and strong Are you taking a beating in this role Pain has become a part of my life but one that I actually like now Were doing fullcontact punching Im getting hit in the head a lot Rocky takes a lot of punches so Ive had black eyes Ive had bruises Ive had a sore neck But its taken me to another level and I feel great Can you tell us about the big fight scene at the end of the show Its the most epic part of our show I finish a song basically talking about how Ive got to push through and keep on standing and then the whole place lights up like its Madison Square Garden The ring comes down from the ceiling and out into the audience We have a huge Jumbotron come down we have screens we have all sorts of amazing things to make the audience feel like theyre watching a real live fight  Its a unique part of our show that our director came up with and it works every time I see all the faces out there in the audience because the entire place lights up I see everyone wideeyed and cheering  Had you ever boxed before this show I had been working with the show for about three years before it got to Broadway Id done some preliminary workshops and the producers made sure I got some boxing training so I knew my fundamentals I appreciate any fight I see now because you can tell that everyone has a different style Rocky fights low and slow and he hits to the body a lot But Apollo Rockys opponent hits to the head and gets a lot of points that way  We heard you got some tips from Stallone himself Yes One of the things he said to me was to make sure you throw your punches from your shoulders So I try to incorporate that into the choreography as much as I can I take a lot of pride in him offering this role to me because it came down to his decision Its a great honor and its a challenge I grew up watching the films and I want to honor the guy whos at the helm of the ship  Do you follow a special diet My biggest thing is trying to eat as clean as possible That helps me with my performance as well because the cleaner you eat the better your voice is going to sound If you eat a lot of cheese and dairy its going to affect your voice The other part is making sure that Im feeding the muscles to help with the weightlifting that Im doing I think Ive lost and gained about  pounds since I started rehearsals back in December Its just one of those things where youre going to sweat a lot youre going to work out a lot and so you have to eat And Im starving half the time  What does eating clean mean for you For me its keeping away from a lot of bread and milk and trying to eat chicken and vegetables and not a lot of extra products thrown on top of everything Right now I need all the help that I can get just getting through these workouts and the show
