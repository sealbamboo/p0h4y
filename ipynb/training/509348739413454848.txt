To recline or not to recline That is the question now being hotly debated among air travelers after three flights were forced to land after passengers on board began fighting about reclining seats But are passengers really the problem The real issue may be that most airline seats are not designed to fully accommodate the human body in its various shapes and sizes We are fighting each other but the seats are not designed right said   professor and head of the department of design housing and merchandising at Oklahoma State University The seats dont fit us Dr Robinette would know She is the lead author of a landmark anthropometric survey conducted by the Air Force with a consortium of  organizations and published in  It is widely used by seat makers and other designers The survey called the Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource project measured the bodies of  people in North America the Netherlands and Italy The survey collected a voluminous amount of data about its subjects ranging from height and weight to shoe and bra size Dr Robinette and her colleagues made D scans of their subjects allowing for detailed measurements in sitting and standing positions For seat designers the most relevant data came from measurements of people sitting which included distances from the buttock to the knee the breadth of the hips and the height of the knees The data gave an accurate view of the variations in the human form Dr Robinette said but the measurements have not been used correctly Seat designers often make the assumption that nearly everyone will be accommodated if they design a seat for a man in the th percentile of measurements meaning that they are larger than all but  percent of other men  and theoretically all women But even in that group there are big differences Take the buttocktoknee measurement of the largest men in the study In the North American group the average measurement was  inches but the Dutch men were larger measuring  inches Factor in the fact that nobody on an airplane sits upright with the knees bent at a  degree angle plus variations in calf length and thigh length The result is that the measurements dont really account for different body shapes and variations in the way people sitIn addition choosing the th percentile of men as a cutoff means at least  percent as many as  in  men on the plane will be using seats that are too small for them Thats about  people on every plane who are disaccommodated as well as all the people sitting next to them Dr Robinette said A big flaw in seat design however is that men in the th percentile are not necessarily larger than women particularly in the parts of the body that are resting on the seat In terms of hip width women are bigger than men In the study North American women in the th percentile had hip breadth measurements of  inches compared to  inches for North American men According to   which collects data on seat sizes from dozens of airlines the typical economy class airline seat ranges from  to  inches across This means that seats will be snug on many bodies for about  in  women the seat will be too small at the hips causing them to spill over into the adjacent seat Further the widest part of the body is actually the shoulders which is why so many of us end up knocking elbows and shoulders with the passengers next to us or leaning into the window or aisle to avoid pressing against our seat neighbor The issue goes beyond passenger comfort Dr Robinette notes that travelers who are squeezed together and touching continually are more likely to spread cold viruses or other illnesses to a fellow passenger People who are confined to tight seats and who cant move comfortably are at risk for painful hot spots  precursors to the bed sores that occur in nursing home patients who arent moved frequently Of greater concern is the risk of blood clots including a potentially deadly condition called   When sitting in a way so you cant move you start to get spots that are compression spots after maybe a halfhour or so Dr Robinette said Pain and discomfort is your body telling you something is wrong and on an airplane there is a risk of blood clots Its a serious problem that we are all discounting When it comes to reclining a seat the most important measure of comfort is seat pitch which is the distance from any point on one seat to the exact same point on the seat in front or behind it According to SeatGuru seat pitch is a good approximation of how much seat and leg room a passenger can expect The measurement on shorthaul flights averages about  inches on most flights ranging from a tight  inches on some airlines to a roomy  to  inches on a few Seat pitch is what most fliers are concerned about said Jami Counter senior director of SeatGuru and TripAdvisor When you are talking about  inches as the standard thats pretty tight  inches is incredibly tight Airlines are feeling really crowded and really cramped Officials at Recaro Aircraft Seating a German seat manufacturer said that seat design had to take into account safety requirements weight passenger comfort and airplane space needs and have enough flexibility that seats can be used in various aircraft layouts Recaro has introduced a new seat with a slimmer back rest giving the passenger behind the seat more space for knees and shins The designers also moved the seat pocket above the tray table to allow for more knee room Recaro has received orders for more than  of the seats since introducing the model in late  Of course it is possible to install seats in an aircraft at a more comfortable distance from each other so that everybody has sufficient knee and leg space Rene Dankwerth the vice president of research and development at Recaro said in a written response However the ticket price would definitely rise At  feet  inches Chicago economics professor Devin Pope knows the risk of sitting behind someone who chooses to recline the seat Dr Pope likened it to a classic economics experiment called the Dictator game in which a person is given  and allowed to keep it all or share it with another person Surprisingly the dictator often chooses to share the money It suggests that people really do care about other people sometimes said Dr Pope associate professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicagos Booth School of Business I think it suggests why a lot of people dont lean the seat back
