The sight of a woman frantically giving CPR to her tiny monthold nephew along a busy Miami highway is enough to instill fear into any parent After the dramatic photos went viral many asked if they knew what to do to save their own children The answer said Dr Robert A Berg one of the worlds leading experts in CPR is simple Do something Too many people he said are afraid to make a mistake with CPR They call  and wait And I guarantee that if you do not do anything and that childs heart has stopped he wont live All too often small children die needlessly According to Berg about  children per year suffer whats called outofhospital nontraumatic cardiac arrest The cause could be a stuck piece of food a bit of vomit blocking an airway mucus from a cold Survival among infants who suffer such cardiac arrest is about  percent It could be much higher Photographer Al Diaz said he took the pictures in Miami after helping the family in the hopes that it will inspire someone to take up CPR in the future A person whose heart has stopped will appear lifeless said Berg chief of critical care medicine at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia But if theres any doubt Berg said do full CPR alternating chest compressions with breathing According to   Berg helped create a lone rescuer should perform  chest compressions two mouthtomouth or mouthtonose breath resuscitations and repeat the cycle preferably while another person calls  If theres nobody else start CPR before calling  yourself Begin with the compressions Without fresh blood the brain will be damaged The chest compressions should be aggressive Berg said Guidelines call for two fingers on the lower sternum for small children but Berg doesnt want people to worry so much about that Pressing hard enough to break a childs bones isnt all that easy and if one does break thats OK given the alternative of death Berg passionately encourages people to take a basic CPR course and suggests that ideally anybody who looks after children should know the basics But even without training people should not hesitate If you do something whenever somebody is lifeless and unresponsive you have a chance to save a life If you do nothing youve lost that chance
