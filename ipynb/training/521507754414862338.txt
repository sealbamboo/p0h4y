Thousands of health workers including nurses midwives and ambulance staff have taken part in the first strike over pay for more than  years But disruption was minimised after unions agreed staff would make sure emergency care was covered Workers from seven trade unions took part from  to  BST in England while two unions were involved in Northern Ireland The strike is being followed by fourdays of worktorule from Tuesday This is expected to involve staff refusing to do overtime without extra pay and insisting on taking their breaks The full picture has yet to emerge about how much disruption was caused by Mondays walkout  although no major incidents have been reported In advance unions and managers had met to ensure essential services were maintained Military personnel and police were also on hand to help ambulance services where needed As the walkouts progressed reports emerged of ambulance services developing backlogs  but bosses said lifethreatening cases were prioritised Meanwhile hospital staff were seen leaving the picket lines to deal with patients in some places Union leaders had always said their members will be providing life and limb cover during the strike The expectation was that  calls would be answered and AE units would remain open and that seems to have been the case according to reports However hospital outpatient appointments community clinics and some routine operations seem to have been affected The Royal College of Midwives which is taking action for the first time in its history said in advance services for women giving birth were going to be unaffected Instead its members targeted antenatal and postnatal care Doctors and dentists were not involved NHS sources said about  of staff who were expected in work did not turn up although unions had always maintained the numbers not working would not reflect the strength of support across the workforce Rehana Azam national officer of the GMB union said Reports from across the country are that the strike action was rock solid Members are determined to get government to listen to them Unison said the action  the first strike by NHS staff over pay in more than  years  would send a clear message to the government As well as the RCM there were another six unions involved in the strike in England  Unison Unite GMB UCATT the British Association of Occupational Therapists and Managers in Partnership Between them they have over  members including porters cleaners and administration staff In Northern Ireland members of Unite and the GMB staged a walkout from  to  BST Ministers in England have awarded NHS staff a  increase but only for those without automatic progressioninthejob rises These designed to reward professional development are given to about half of staff and are worth  a year on average An independent pay review board had said the  increase should be across the board It was implemented in full in Scotland Northern Ireland has yet to make a decision on pay while Wales did the same as England but did give extra to the lowest paid Some unions are balloting their Welsh members about action there A boisterous noisy picket outside the Edwardian facade of the old Manchester Royal Infirmary has been made up of nursing assistants porters paramedics and for the first time in their history midwives  Plenty of cars are tooting their support as they pass on Manchesters busy Oxford Road  Inside the hospital some services will be affected and a number of midwives have already left the picket to go to staff a ward that was short on numbers  So this is a symbolic strike but one that displays the real anger of health workers over pay  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that hospitals would be forced to lay off staff if the recommended pay award was met in full We have had very clear analysis that if we did that hospital chief executives would lay off around  nurses this year and around  nurses next year he said The NHS has just come through a terrible tragedy with Mid Staffordshire when we discovered the most appalling care happening there and indeed some other hospitals as well We have turned the corner on that by recruiting in hospital wards around  extra nurses in the last year alone We dont want to turn the clock back on that Christina McAnea head of health at Unison said the offer in England was a disgrace  The fact that so many unions representing a range of NHS workers are taking action or preparing to join future actions should send a clear message to the government she said RCM chief executive Cathy Warwick added At a time when MPs are set for a  pay hike were told that midwives dont deserve even a belowinflation  rise And politicians wonder why the public does not afford them more respect It feels to a great many people including midwives that there is one rule for them and another rule for everybody else
