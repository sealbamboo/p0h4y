It could mean no more having to check up on Mom or Dad every morning Motion sensors on the wall and a monitor under the mattress one day might automatically alert you to early signs of trouble well before an elderly loved one gets sick or suffers a fall New hightech gadgets are in the works that promise new safety nets for seniors determined to live on their own for as long as possible Its insurance in case something should happen is how Bob Harrison  describes the unobtrusive monitors being tested in his apartment at the TigerPlace retirement community in Columbia Mo Living at home  specialists call it aging in place  is what most people want for their later years Americans  and older are just as worried about losing their independence later in life as they are about losing their memory according to a recent survey by the Associated PressNORC Center for Public Affairs Research Commonsense interventions like grab bars in bathrooms and taping down rugs to prevent tripping can make homes safer as seniors deal with chronic illnesses Technology is the next frontier and a far cry from those emergencycall buttons seniors sometimes wear to summon help Already some companies are offering monitoring packages that place motion sensors on the front door a favorite chair even the refrigerator and then send an alert to a family member if theres too little activity over a certain period of time Other gadgets can make pill bottles buzz when its time for a dose and text a caregiver if its not taken or promise to switch off a stove burner thats left on too long Researchers at the University of Missouri aim to go further Their experiments show that certain automatic monitoring can spot changes  such as restlessness in bed or a drop in daytime activity  that occur  days to two weeks before a fall or a trip to the doctor or hospital We were blown away that we could actually detect this said nursing professor Marilyn Rantz an aginginplace specialist who is leading the research She compares it to a vital sign of my physical function Why would the gadgets work That monitor under the mattress can measure pulse and respiratory patterns to see if heart failure is worsening before someone realizes he or she is becoming short of breath More nighttime bathroom trips can indicate a brewing urinary tract infection A change in gait such as starting to take shorter or slower steps can signal increased risk for a fall Basic motion sensors cant detect that So Rantzs team adapted the Microsoft Kinect D camera developed for video games to measure subtle changes in walking Yes it can distinguish visitors The researchers installed the sensor package in apartments at the universityaffiliated TigerPlace community and in a Cedar Falls Iowa senior complex Onsite nurses received automatic emails about significant changes in residents activity One study found that after a year residents who agreed to be monitored were functioning better than an unmonitored control group presumably because nurses intervened sooner at signs of trouble Rantz said The bigger question is whether simply alerting a loved one not a nurse might also help Now with a new grant from the National Institutes of Health Rantz will begin expanding the research to see how this monitoring works in different senior housing  and this time participants can decide if theyd like a family member or friend to get those alerts in addition to a nurse Rantz says embedding sensors in the home is important because too many older adults forget or dont want to wear those older emergencycall buttons  including Rantzs own mother who lay helpless on her floor for eight hours after tripping and badly breaking a shoulder Rantz said her mother never fully recovered and died six months later When we started this team I said we are not going to make anybody wear anything or push any buttons because my mother refused and I dont think shes any different than a lot of other people in this world Rantz said Monitoring raises important privacy questions about just what is tracked and who has access to it cautioned Jeff Makowka of AARP To work the hightech approach has to be less about Were watching you Grandma but Hey Grandma how come you didnt make coffee this morning he said Sensor prices are another hurdle although Makowka said theyre dropping Various kinds already on the market can run from about  to several hundred plus monthly service plans
