While milk consumption   in the US sales of organic milk are on the rise And now organic milk accounts for about  percent of total fluid milk consumption For years organic producers have claimed their milk is nutritionally superior to regular milk Specifically they say that because their cows spend a lot more time out on pasture munching on grasses and legumes rich in omega fatty acids the animals milk is higher in these healthy fats which are linked to a reduced risk of heart disease But the evidence for this has been scant except for some small studies from Europe Now a   evaluating organic milk produced in the US finds that organic milk has about  percent more omegas compared to milk produced by cows on conventional dairy farms Cows raised on conventional farms typically spend a lot more time in a barn or confined and instead of grazing theyre fed a diet of animal feed that contains a lot of corn We were surprised by the magnitude of the differences lead author   of Washington State University tells The Salt Benbrook and his colleague analyzed about  samples of organic and conventional milk over a period of about a year and a half The samples were taken at processing facilities around the country The findings published in the journal   come at a time when   to consume more omega fatty acids Most people hear this advice and think of fatty fish  which is of course an excellent source of the omegas DHA and EPA Whats less well known is that plantbased foods such as leafy greens and nuts are rich in another omega called ALA Now its becoming clearer that organic milk is a good source of that too Benbrook says that consuming ALArich milk is also a good way to change the ratio of omega and omega fatty acids in your diet   the National Institutes of Health the consensus is that for good health we need to be eating more omegas and less omegas Omegas are found in corn and sunflower oil and in foods fried in these oils While some experts dont see a problem with omegas many say that the typical American diet already contains too many And averaged over  months the study found organic milk contained  percent less omega fatty acids than conventional milk So heres the rub if you want all of the omegas found in organic milk are you better off drinking whole milk rather than skim Yes Thats because skimming off the fat also reduces the omega content For example if you choose  percent milk it has about onethird the fat of whole milk So youre left with a much lower level of omegas Of course youre also fewer calories so it might be a hard choice for people who are watching their weight If they choose whole milk they may have to trim calories elsewhere And there seems to be a movement towards consuming whole milk Sales of whole organic milk are up  percent this year making it the fastestgrowing category of milk according to a spokeswoman from Organic Valley Skim sales meanwhile are down  percent she says As I   earlier this year some studies have linked fattier milk to slimmer kids despite the fact that pediatricians routinely recommend switching kids to lowfat dairy at the age of  to reduce their consumption of saturated fats These fats which are more abundant in whole milk than in reduced fat milk are linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease As falling sales figures show lots of Americans have simply taken milk out of their diets  due to lactose intolerance or other reasons Some have replaced dairy milk with alternatives such as almond milk which many doctors say is fine since there are plenty of other sources of calcium But for people who are still milk drinkers this study suggests that yes there is a benefit in choosing organic in terms of boosting omega intake One thing to note Dairy farmers of the Cooperative Regions of Organic Producer Pools a group which markets through the Organic Valley brand helped fund the study But the groups had no role in its design or analysis The analysis was funded by the Measure to Manage program at the   at Washington State University
