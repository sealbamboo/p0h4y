Uncle Sam wants you to email your doctor A federal law passed in  says that physicians have to start offering their patients online communication or Medicare will start docking how much it pays them in the future Some patients hope that having online access to their doctors will mean they can cut down on how often they have to go to the doctors office But fresh research suggests that patients with online access actually schedule more office visits Dr   is an internist at Kaiser Permanente Colorado in Denver He says its pretty common for him to see a patient in his office and then think You know we couldve handled this by email Palen whos also a researcher wanted to see if offering patients online access to their doctors would mean theyd need to come in to the office less often Previous studies found around a  percent drop in patient visits once they had online access But Palens much larger   just published in the   showed that patients with online access actually scheduled more visits The finding really did surprise us this association between online access and an increase in inperson services Palen says Why the increase Palen says it could be that patients who signed up for online access were sicker than those who didnt although his study tried to control for that It could be that doctors who arent used to an online giveandtake with patients asked them to come in more often to clear things up Or it could be that the new online relationship between doctors and patients means that together theyre catching important health indicators that were getting missed in the past and patients are getting better care In certain cases with certain diseases the more frequent visits actually make more sense says   an information technology coordinator at the Department of Health and Human Services the federal agency thats requiring doctors to start offering patients online access Murphy says that for some online access to doctors will mean fewer visits for others it will mean more It depends on the patient And the governments intent in requiring doctors to offer online access Murphy says isnt to drive the overall number of office visits up or down but to improve the relationship between doctors and patients by improving communication We have all sorts of individuals right now who actually think their health conditions are the doctors problems and not theirs Murphy says And I think thats what were really trying to focus on helping the patient see that when they get engaged in their care and when they become part of the therapy plan that they can actually have better outcomes Theres no definitive research linking more online access to doctors to better patient outcomes But many doctors are optimistic Its a new form of medical care that offers the promise to be able to improve care says Dr   president of the American Academy of Family Physicians Cain says doctors and patients are still learning what they can accomplish online together and whether that means more or fewer office visits The answer is important both for planning future health system capacity and because most doctors still get paid based on the number of office visits not for answering emails This is something that our current health care system doesnt pay for so its coming out of my spare time Cain says An estimated  million Americans now have access to online communication with their doctors a number thats expected to grow rapidly in the next few years Whether that means more overtime for doctors or better health care or both is a topic for studies that are just now getting started This story is part of a partnership with NPR   and
