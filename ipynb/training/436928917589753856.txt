A paw on the leg A nose nuzzling against your arm Maybe even a hop onto your lap Dogs always seem to know when youre upset and need extra love even though they hardly understand a word of what you say How can that be Our fourlegged friends have a little patch of their brain devoted to deciphering emotions in human and dog voices scientists  Thursday in the journal   And the neural circuitry acts surprisingly like the voicedetection device found in peoples brains The happier the barks or giggles the more that brain region lights up The sadder the growls or whines the less it responds Its the first step to understanding how dogs can be so attuned to their owners feelings says Attila Andics a neurobiologist at the   in Budapest who led the study To find the brain region Andics and his team first had to accomplish the seemingly impossible Get  pooches to lie motionless inside an MRI brain scanning machine for nearly  minutes at a time all while listening to nearly  people and dog noises They are happy volunteers in the scanner  you should just see it They really are Andics tells Shots Other researchers have gotten a few dogs to sit still long enough in an MRI machine to analyze their brain activity But the feat has never been accomplished with so many dogs and for such long periods of time We really have no clue about whats going on in the dogs brain Andics says Now we can start to look at how our best friend looks at us and figure out what makes our alliance and communication with them so strong Back in the late s Canadian scientists identified a part of the human brain devoted to recognizing peoples voices The socalled   doesnt process words or sentences Rather it figures out all the other information packed into sounds For instance whos the person speaking How is he feeling Is she being snarky or serious Silly or sardonic Andics and his team wanted to see if dogs had an analogous region in their brains But how do you get an energetic border collie to sit still long enough to perform the experiment If they move more than a few millimeters we have to start the scans again Andics says He and his team started off with standard training methods heaps of treats praise and love But what really did the trick Andics says was brewing up a little bit of jealousy among the dogs Wed put an experienced dog up in the scanner and hed be up there sitting still Andics says Then wed bring into the room a less experienced dog And hed get so jealous He just wanted to be on the scanner bed like the other dog It became the place of happiness After about  training sessions apiece Andics and his team had a pack of border collies and Labrador and golden retrievers all ready for their experiments They put headphones on each dog and let them listen to three types of sounds human voices doggy voices and environmental noises such as a phone ringing or a hammer hitting a nail The team then looked to see which parts of the brain responded Lo and behold just as with humans the dogs have a little patch of neurons that light up most strongly when they hear voices of their own species  other dogs barking growling or whining There also was a region that was sensitive to emotional tones in both human and dog voices And that area was in the same location as the one found in people  right in the back of the brain near the ears When you   how dogs respond to emotional cues in sounds its very similar to how humans respond Andics says Its in the same brain region  and is stronger with positive vocalizations than negative ones So how do our furry companions tell a happy giggle from a sad sigh Like people dogs use simple acoustic parameters to extract out the feelings from a sound Andics says For instance when you laugh Ha ha ha it has short quick pieces But if you make the pieces longer Haaaa haaaa haaaa it starts to sound like crying or whining This is what people  and dogs  pay attention to
