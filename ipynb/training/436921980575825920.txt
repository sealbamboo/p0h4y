It was hard not to notice the pound freshman in English class who dwarfed his peers and walked with his head down sullen and quiet His teacher knew that the yearold needed help What the teacher didnt know was how Eric Ekis had ballooned to that weight  while mourning the death of his father Or why this lonely kid didnt seem to want to change even though his classmates bullied him Or that in helping Eric he might just help the whole school On that first day of class at Franklin Community High School in Indiana this past fall teacher Don Wettrick tried to engage this new student suggesting they work out together  Id like to but I cant Eric said  A few days later Wettrick brought it up again Again Eric said no Then Eric crushed a desk in class Wettrick tried again and again heard no  He realized his methods were failing He saw that Eric felt terrible  both physically and mentally His classmates bullied him One day Eric smelled so bad Wettrick pulled him aside to talk about his hygiene Eric said he knew it was a problem I just dont care Eric told him  About Anything  When did you give up Wettrick asked  When my dad died  Eric cried as he explained that his dad died suddenly in  of a brain aneurysm and soon afterward yearold Eric fell in the shower shattering his leg He underwent multiple surgeries and received rods and screws to fix it At  feet tall and  pounds the doctors feared that Eric might grow lopsidedly so they broke his other leg to slow the growth The surgeries rendered Eric bedridden and months of rehab followed His lack of mobility and grief made it easy for Eric to stress eat  After that is when he started putting weight on Bedridden and upset and depressed says Laura Ekis Erics mom He gained weight so gradually they did not notice until he ballooned Three years later he was  and  pounds Now everyone noticed and Wettrick needed a plan The English teacher also taught an innovations class which teaches kids to think creatively One of his students Kevin Stahl a senior and star of the swim team needed a project Wettrick approached Kevin    Kevin agreed  Kevin suggested that Eric walk as a way to get used to exercising First period every day Eric walks I was sick and tired of being big and bigger than everyone else Eric says I got lucky it was Kevin Kevin is just a nice person  I am glad he is my friend  The two also talked to a dietitian about ways Eric could also improve his diet  Were eating healthier at home Were baking things and not frying things says Laura Ekis I want him to be healthy and productive and enjoy everything high school has to offer  Eric wasnt the only kid in school struggling with obesity  in  about  percent of Indiana high school students were considered overweight or obese according to the Indiana State Health Department When his classmates noticed what he was doing some joined him and formed a walking group Another student Tessa Crawford lost  pounds thanks to walking and food journaling  Even students who were not overweight supported the efforts  People had been bullying me And they all stopped and people are being supportive Eric says I feel physically better I feel better emotionally too  While Wettrick feels overjoyed that Eric is becoming healthier he also likes that this program has reduced bullying  This has almost been more of an antibullying campaign Wettrick says If more students wanted to help as opposed to point and laugh it can lead to great bonds and friendship  Its been a long journey for Eric and will continue to be The weight is coming off slowly hes lost  pounds Like so many others Eric gained over the holidays But he is learning how to live a healthier life  Wettrick left Franklin Community on Monday  he took a position as an innovation teacher at Noblesville High School  but he still talks with Eric and Kevin Another teacher Lesleigh Groce took over the program The walking group which includes about a dozen students walks for  minutes a day twice a week they do some additional exercise such as shooting hoops or yoga  Eric says that even with the setbacks he doesnt get discouraged because he has so much support  From the beginning I wanted this to help other kids just like me  overweight kids that need the help and the support he says I just like to help others It is the right thing to do  It is what my mom taught me
