Four years ago my husband revealed one of his more peculiar qualities Hes freaked out by the sight of sliced cantaloupe The melon seeds all clustered together make his skin itch and his stomach churn Then he gets obsessed and cant stop talking about it A bit concerned by his behavior I started researching it on the Web Boy was I in for a treat My husband was not alone Trypophobia as the Urban Dictionary   it is an irrational fear of holes pods or cracks  specifically clusters of them Its not recognized by the   or any clinical psychologist we could find but a whole trypophobia community is rising up on the Web On Instagram and   people share photographs of clusters that make them anxious obsessed and even nauseated Many images show holey foods or clusters of seeds like aerated chocolates the innards of a red bell pepper and bubbles rising up in pancakes while they cook I dont like the holes in crumpets or sponges or Swiss cheese CourtneySGray said on Twitter They all make me shudder and panic The trypophobia   page touts nearly  followers who commiserate on their condition and triggers When macaroni noodles stand up straight when Im boiling them I wanna cry   remarked on Facebook Anyone else experienced this The standard litmus test for trypophobia seems to be a photograph of   And I have to admit these pictures can give me the heebiejeebies if I think about them long enough But in Southeast Asia people eat these like peanuts They just peel the pods and pop the seeds in their mouth And down in New Orleans people   lotus from the bayous and then fry up the seeds So Im not convinced about this trypophobia From the comments on Facebook its clear that many people didnt even realize these photographs bothered them until they stumbled upon them on Google Is there really a common phobia to lotus and melon lurking in our society or could this just be some modernday phenomenon fueled by social media and the power of suggestion Psychiatrist   of the University of California San Francisco who specializes in anxiety disorders thinks its mostly the latter Shes never heard of trypophobia and from looking at the comments on the Web she doesnt think most people have a real phobia  or an intense fear  to these objects Instead they simply find the images disgusting or yucky Mathews thinks this response is probably due to a psychological concept known as   Youre asked if the lotus photo makes you feel itchy so its more likely to stir up an itch or two We all have random skin sensations but we normally filter them out she tells The Salt Its like background noise  our brains have taught us not to listen to it But if were asked to pay attention to our skin then we start to feel all these little itches Research psychologist   at the UKs University of Essex has been investigating the phenomenon and he thinks he might know whats going on In images that set off this repulsion the pattern of contrast is similar to that found in photographs of extremely poisonous animals  like box jellyfish king cobras and Brazilian wandering spiders Wilkins speculates that we humans are especially good at picking out these patterns because they help us spot dangerous animals that might otherwise blend with the background Its a tidy evolutionbased theory but Mathews isnt buying it Intermixing truly yucky pictures of parasites and skin conditions with innocuous images of cantaloupes and crumpets she says could also make you feel grossed out by your breakfast This is a type of   in which one emotion  disgust uncomfortableness  gets associated with something that normally doesnt evoke that emotion There might really be people out there with phobias to holes because people can really have a phobia to anything she says But just reading whats on the Internet that doesnt seem to be what people actually have Now that I think about cantaloupes I feel a little disgusted too Mathews says And I really like cantaloupes
