Recent controversy over figures used in the British Medical Journal which were later withdrawn renewed questions over the peer review system  the way medical studies are checked prior to publication that claimed statins used to reduce cholesterol could cause harmful side effects in  of people who took them  However it was later discovered that this figure was unreliable  and scientists are still debating what the true level is  The flaw in the studies was not picked up when they were assessed for publication The system used to check papers before they appear in journals is called peer review It is a way of validating their work through the scrutiny of the methodology that was used by other experts But things do go wrong and the statins debate is not an isolated case  It reflects an increasing problem in the scientific community a dramatic increase in the number of papers retracted  or taken back  by journals When a paper is retracted it means that the research has so many flaws that it has to be withdrawn by the publications in question Many consider this action as the worst punishment for a scientist In recent years the number of retractions has increased dramatically  in  there were  but in  this number had risen to   However the number of studies published increased by only  in that period according to the journal Nature This has serious implications for science  Although these retractions still represent  of what is published each year  around  million studies  the way the scientific community works amplifies the impact of any mistakes Researchers base their new studies on previously published work which means that one paper with flaws can influence dozens of others whose work will then be used by many others before someone spots the mistake To some the large increase in retractions is not particularly surprising  It could be as we and others have argued a good thing and a sign that science is interested in putting the record straight says Ivan Oransky editorial director of the USbased organisation MedPage Today That being said it is often very difficult for critics to get editors to take their concerns seriously and retractions are taking longer and longer So its a complex story he adds Japanese scientist Haruko Obokata became something of a celebrity last January after publishing a study on stem cells  It was supposed to be a groundbreaking discovery but turned out to be a case of fraud Ms Obakatas work had passed peer review But as soon as another research team tried to replicate Obokatas work it became evident that there had been an inappropriate handling of the data She has recently been found guilty of misconduct Science relies on others to replicate the work it doesnt necessarily have to be exactly the same but in a way that guarantees that other results can be replicable Nigel Hooper professor of biochemistry School of Molecular and Cellular Biology told BBC Mundo We dont go out there and ask someone to repeat the study the replication is a natural part of the scientific process he adds Damian Pattison executive director of the PLOS One journal says The thing is that peer reviews arent exempt from problems It is very difficult to understand whats going on in a paper unless you see all the data And the problem is that in the majority of cases the scientists dont include all the data in their report  So there may be many reasons why a study may have a good peer review and later it turns out that it is unreliable Dr Elizabeth Iorns a cancer biologist and CEO of Science Exchange where scientists can share information says the literature often does not correct itself She believes that the peer review system has several issues with each reviewer  expected to assess a publication that contains data generated by a team of researchers with highly specialised backgrounds The individual peer reviewer may not have expertise in all of the techniques used in particular complex statistical analyses   And she says There is evidence that researchers sometimes selectively present data that supports a specific hypothesis  This means that reviewers do not have access to all of the data generated from the research study and cannot determine if the information provided accurately represents the complete dataset A couple of years ago Ivan Oransky founded Retraction Watch with science journalist Adam Marcus The mission of this blog is to highlight cases of retractions mistakes and corrections These journalists have a lot work ahead of them judging by the study made by Danielle Fanelli a natural scientist who specialises in the study of scientific misconduct bias and related issues and a member of the Research Ethics and Bioethics Advisory Committee of the National Research Council in Italy According to a study of his published in  in PLOS One and based on the metadata of several surveys about  of scientists have admitted to falsifying making up or modifying elements at least once  And one third confessed to other questionable practices including to have modified research results to improve the outcome then to have reported results they knew to be untrue Additionally more than  of scientists say they have witnessed irregular behaviour from their colleagues If this is the case how reliable are the studies published every day I cant really answer that question says Damian Pattinson He admits there is an issue with the availability of the data We are campaigning to make all the research data available  Ivan Oransky admits peer review certainly has its flaws But he said As Churchill said of democracy its the worst possible system except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time  People have suggested a number of ways to improve peer review  One that we champion is for journals to embrace postpublication peer review more than they currently do so that the publishing record really reflects how science works  Another option he said was to make peer review open not anonymous in the interests of transparency But there is general agreement that in most cases flaws in the peer review system are due to human error and have little to do with malpractice
