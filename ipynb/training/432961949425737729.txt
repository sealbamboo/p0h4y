We now know what Michael Sams teammates have long known The AllAmerican defensive lineman from the University of Missouri is gay and could very well become the first ever openly gay football player in the NFL Much has and will be written about the historical impact of   but a quietly remarkable aspect of Sams story is this For at least an entire college football season Sams teammates knew his secret and they not only accepted it they helped him keep it Sam has said that he came out to his team before the  season during a team meeting in which each player was asked to tell a secret about himself I looked in their eyes and they just started shaking their heads  like finally he came out Sam   His team and the coaches kept their star players secret even as the team faced building media attention as they competed for a national title But even in a generation notorious for social media oversharing and in a sport not known for its tolerance no one let Sams secret slip Not even  I think its tremendous in this day and age that they could do that without anything leaking said Leif Smith a clinical and sports psychologist who works with athletes at Ohio State University Its also possible that his teammates didnt think it was that big of a deal Smith and other sports psychologists said I do think its more of a hohum issue for this generation Smith said It was a big issue to address it but once they started playing football they could care less According to the days stereotype of a machobro culture like college football an admission like Sams could lead to ostracization or a   of bullying And indeed some unnamed NFL insiders have  already responded to Sams admission by saying things like an openly gay player would chemically imbalance an NFL locker room and meeting room But sports psychologists who work with college athletes say that they see this generation being more tolerant when it comes to the matter of their peers sexual orientation Seventy percent of millennials  defined here as those born after   said in a   that they support gay marriage and that percentage is rapidly increasing up from  percent in  Sams teammates said his sexuality was no big deal in the lockerroom and many of them joined a chorus of public support that   Sam is a gifted athlete named in his last year at Mizzou to the College Football AllAmerica Team which means his team has even fewer reasons to care about his personal life I think the bottom line for most players is  if you have a teammate that can help you win it doesnt matter said John Murray a clinical and sports psychologist in Palm Beach Fla who has worked with NFL athletes If Sam did explicitly ask his teammates not to share his sexual orientation the teams secretsharing may even have strengthened their cohesion as a group We know that when people choose to confide secrets with us that can draw us closer together because that disclosure signals trust and intimacy in itself said Clayton Critcher a psychologist at the University of California Berkeley who has researched the psychology of secretkeeping In ideal circumstances a team may function much like a family experts say Teams are going to protect their own Murray said The family will kind of circle the wagons and protect their secret he said Because a family very well represents that concept of a unit that needs to be able to be cohesive to be able to perform well to be able to win
