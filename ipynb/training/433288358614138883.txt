My young friend had just finished the last months of his medical training He had faced down many multiplechoice tests and triumphed over them all Starting with the SATs and ending with a series of medical licensing exams including all the prep courses and practice exams he probably had tens of thousands of single best answers under his belt Now they were all burbling up to the surface He went off to evaluate an older patient with   It hurt when she turned her head It had been going on for a few days Wouldnt hurt to get a cardiac workup he reported back Stress her get an echo Neck pain you know tipoff for heart disease Gotta remember In old women heart disease will have unusual symptoms True enough occasionally But not in this woman who had a stiff neck and probably needed a new pillow He saw a patient whose hips were hurting after a long hike a few days before I got an   pronto he announced It could be aseptic necrosis Bone death Thats what it usually is with someone taking those drugs No in fact even with those drugs it is usually muscle strain the kind that hurts a lot and then goes away Only in the wonderful world of the single best answer should you put your bets on anything more exotic He spent a long time with a patient with yet another in a history of headaches I vote we put her in for an MRI angio he said Could be a slow recurrent bleed Possibly Gotta rule it out No gotta not do that Gotta sit tight and let it be Reassure the patient already panicky enough that all will be well Put that order form down get those itchy fingers off the keyboard and learn that in the real world the answer to most questions actually turns out to be D none of the above In  a Supreme Court decision upheld the validity of multiplechoice testing for evaluating firefighters for promotion prompting a heated nationwide discussion   that testtaking savvy may have little to do with job performance Medical educators have been contemplating this possibility for years But the problem particular to medicine may be the sheer volume of these tests and the standard hysterical preparation they engender which constitute a form of training in itself Educators may not actually teach to the test but students think to the test in linear multiple choice They learn to recognize key phrases neck pain and stock situations older woman and they live in dread of unlikely worstcase scenarios Dies from heart attack while buying new pillow You are sued Sometimes the actual threedimensional patient is not real enough to eradicate all her paper iterations Fear of uncertainty is expensive and my young friend seemed poised to become singlehandedly responsible for the high cost of health care in his ZIP code Like all victims of the single best answer syndrome he ordered tests in wild profusion because in his experience every question had an answer and a test that would get you there Options never included You decide to keep an eye on it for a little while You tell the patient to come back if it gets worse or You must make peace with the fact that you are never going to figure this one out Some medical educators have tried to bend the linear algorithms of the multiplechoice experience to the nuances of the actual clinical world   from the Mayo Clinic specifically set out to teach against the test Instead of the usual callandresponse questions the educators took their students through complicated contradictory cases for which there were no clear best strategies but many reasonably acceptable ones Some students appreciated the point others complained that all the ambiguity took up too much time One bemoaned cognitive overload and another wrote We know that there are many correct ways to do things but I prefer to be taught one way rather than many A linear thinker that one heading for an unhappy collision with the nonlinear world My young friend never veered from his own wellhoned habits I could tell he thought I was remarkably ill trained and Id rather not imagine what he muttered about me to his peers To my own I muttered about his remarkable lack of sense and judgment until their eyes began to glaze From more than one I got exactly the same response How bad could he be they said with finality He passed his boards didnt he Of course that final hurdle in the path out of training consists of nailing a gigantic quantity of single best answer questions
