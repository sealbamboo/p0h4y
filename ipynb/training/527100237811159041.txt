I write about health and health care but even Im not immune to the young and invincible mentality My annual dental checkup is more than six months overdue A provision of the Affordable Care Act that took effect in  aimed to make it easier for young adults to access preventive care by allowing them to stay on their parents insurance until they turn  As of  some  million young adults gained coverage through this provision So does this mean more young people are getting their annual checkups and cholesterol screenings Sort of suggests a   published Monday in   Researchers from the University of California San Francisco found that after the provision took effect the number of young adults using preventive care services went up slightly Between  and  there was a  percent increase in the number of young people getting routine checkups and a  percent increase in annual dental visits But the  to yearold group is still avoiding annual flu shots Though the improvement is modest it is encouraging says   an assistant professor of pediatrics at UCSF who led the study This study shows us basically if we remove the financial barrier young adults will actually take us up on getting the care that they need The results are based on data from the annual   conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services The researchers only looked at the numbers through  before young adults had the option to get insurance through state and federal exchanges As we start analyzing data from   and  we will likely see a further uptick in the number of young people getting preventive care Lau says  of the Commonwealth Fund a health care research and advocacy group agrees Collins wasnt involved in the     study but she says early results from other surveys suggest that health coverage and preventive care access among young adults are continuing to go up a result of the insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion These are early data Collins says but it looks promising Still coaxing young adults to get all the recommended screenings and immunizations may take a little extra effort Lau says Lau treats young adults at UCSFs Adolescent and Young Adult Clinic and sometimes this group needs a bit more guidance she says They may not have refilled a medication before so you may have to explain Broader educational campaigns wouldnt hurt either she adds This is an age group in transition A lot of them are living independently for the first time We need to educate them tell them why its important to get preventative care At least her study has guilted me into finally calling my dentist
