New diagnoses of colorectal cancers which have been on the decline for years among those over  are increasing exponentially among those between the ages of  and  new research has found By the year  the rate of new diagnoses among the under set can be expected to nearly double even as that rate declines by a third among those over  who generally get routine screening for the disease according to an epidemiological study by researchers at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston The jump in youthful cancer risk isnt unique to cancers of the colon or rectum New diagnoses of breast cancer too are rising among younger women The reasons for the jump in either cancer arent entirely clear But when it comes to colorectal cancer the researchers have their suspicions increasing obesity sedentary lifestyles and the widespread embrace of a Western diet thats high in processed foods and red meat and low in fruits and vegetables all may be contributing to the rate of new diagnoses in young people they wrote Given the rising incidence of such cancers in young people physicians seeing younger patients with potential symptoms of colorectal cancer should not dismiss their suspicions the authors wrote And in all patients they should emphasize the importance of good nutrition and regular exercise as a means of colorectal cancer prevention they added The study was   Wednesday in the journal JAMA Surgery The research team was led by Dr Christina E Bailey a surgical oncology fellow at MD Anderson Colorectal cancer is still a disease of aging Close to  of the  new cases diagnosed in  in the United States are expected to be in those over  And between  and  the median age of diagnosis was  But new diagnoses have grown fastest among adults between  and  a group in which the disease was virtually unheard of until fairly recently Between  and  new diagnoses in this group grew by roughly  per year the new research found And the uptick in new diagnoses were at all stages of the cancer from local to advanced Among those  to  a pool that accounts for about  of colorectal cancer diagnoses over the studys  years rates of new diagnoses increased by a more modest  Spun forward those numbers spell trouble for a disease that cancer specialists thought they had brought under control with increased screening Most colorectal cancers start from slowgrowing polyps which can be detected early by fecal occult testing sigmoidocopy or colonoscopy and removed before they cause trouble Largely because such screening is widespread among those over  rates of new colorectal cancers in this group fell during the studys year span by roughly  yearly But among patients younger than  such screening is recommended only for those with a family history of colon cancer or polyps Without any changes in those recommendations  or to risk factors such as poor diet and exercise patterns that may be contributing to the uptick  the MD Anderson researchers concluded that by  the rate of new colon cancer diagnoses among patients  to  years old can be expected to increase  for colon cancers and  for rectal cancers This is an important moment in cancer prevention said Dr George J Chang a cancer surgeon at MD Anderson and the senior author of the study If no changes are made in public education and prevention efforts he added the potential effect of colorectal cancer could be very real in patients under  This is the moment to reverse this alarming trend Chang said in a statement released with the study
