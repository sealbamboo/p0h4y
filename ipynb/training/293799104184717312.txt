 Far too few sexually active young women are getting tested for   an oversight that could lead them down a perilous path to severe health consequences including infertility later in life A new survey from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that only  percent of sexually active girls and women were screened for this common   STD in the year prior to being questioned Chlamydia often infects men and women without causing symptoms Not only that another new study finds that only a small proportion of men and women got the recommended followup test once they had tested positive for chlamydia Reinfection with chlamydia is common if partners remain untreated In those women who are left untreated chronic pelvic pain and ectopic pregnancies can result along with infertility Both reports were to be presented Tuesday at the National STD Prevention Conference in Minneapolis as are two additional studies outlining ways clinics and providers might improve on these numbers According to Dr Gail Bolan director of the CDCs division of STD prevention an estimated  million new cases of chlamydia occur each year in the United States The CDC recommends   aged  and under as well as retesting either three months after initial   or during their next regular health care visit in the year following treatment said Bolan who spoke at a Tuesday news conference With only about one third of young women getting tested for chlamydia twothirds  million are going without noted study author Dr Karen Hoover a medical epidemiologist with the CDC She called the results alarming Slightly more encouraging she said was the news that some groups at particularly high risk for chlamydia infection actually had higher testing rates This included black women  percent got tested those with more than one sexual partner  percent and people who had no health insurance  percent or relied on governmentsubsidized insurance  percent Women who received some sort of reproductive health care such as contraception a Pap smear for cervical abnormalities or a pregnancy test were also more likely to get tested compared with women who received no such care  percent vs  percent Older women also had higher testing rates This suggests that we may be moving in the right direction Hoover noted The study authors had no data on chlamydia testing in men as routine testing in this population is not recommended by the CDC Hoover said There is insufficient data to support this recommendation she said although retesting rates among men will probably be the subject of future analyses A second study based on a laboratory data from almost  men and women who had tested positive for chlamydia found that only  percent of men and  percent of women went for their recommended retest within six months of the original positive results Among those who got a followup test onequarter of men and  percent of women were positive Retesting rates were much lower than we had expected said study author Kelly Morrison Opdyke of Cicatelli Associates Inc a nonprofit organization Again though certain demographic groups were more likely to get retested including younger people under  those visiting family planning clinics as opposed to STD clinics and health centers including health centers at universities or colleges Retesting rates also declined over the study period which spanned  through  although Hoover said researchers werent able to explain this drop Two additional studies found success in boosting retesting rates by using relatively simple followup and reminder systems One system which included email and telephone reminders to students visiting the University of Buffalos student health center in New York managed to boost retesting rates for chlamydia and gonorrhea from  percent to  percent in just one semester Chlamydia accounted for most of the infections detected Here retesting rates jumped from  percent to  percent Another study used popup screens on electronic medical records to remind providers that a patient needed to be retested The system was conceived after researchers noted low retesting rates even among women who visited a health care provider one to six months after their initial treatment In this case testing for   and chlamydia increased from  percent to  percent
