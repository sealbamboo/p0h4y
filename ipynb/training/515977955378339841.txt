That Friday I was dizzy and sick to my stomach with what felt like food poisoning only sometimes my chest throbbed I declined my husbands offer of a ride to the emergency room because I had to prepare for a crucial school meeting on Monday Our sixyearold son a gifted child with a disability had been repeatedly sent home for eloping from class and disruptive behavior The school had laid a paper trail to ship him to a more restrictive program across town but I was blocking the exits My goal for Monday was to keep him in his class and get him support to develop coping skills I was afraid he would learn to hate school While I liked my new job day care kept evaporating One afterschool program kicked our son out without notice while my husband was out of the country Our kid had already trashed the other semiaffordable options Hey but what working mom isnt stressed It seemed that whenever I solved one problem another wrapped a tentacle around my leg to drag me down The day before I got sick I received emails that another school parent had been circulating for months making our son out to be a menace to society and lobbying to have him removed from school At the Monday meeting we were congratulated on our sons progress He was welcomed to second grade where he would receive a trained aide I was relieved But I could feel my heartbeat flicker erratically It didnt hurt but it wasnt normal so after work I asked my husband to take me to the emergency room A burly nurse with a tattooed neck joked during the electrocardiogram But his expression changed as he looked at the screen With breathtaking speed I was hoisted onto a gurney stripped wrapped in a hospital gown had an IV jammed in each arm and was pumped full of heparin Somebody told me I was having a heart attack Your troponin levels are rising said a doctor who resembled a hedgehog with glasses Its a protein your heart gives off when it is damaged People kept asking me about chest pain but I had none Im sorry for leaving you with the kids I called to my husband as EMTs rolled me away I feared that not going to the emergency room earlier may have fatally damaged my heart An echocardiogram showed that my left ventricle had ballooned and the tip of my heart wasnt working I was scheduled for an angiogram the next morning Any artery blockage and Id get a stent On Tuesday I lay sedated in a chilly operating room while a cardiologist snaked a probe through an artery in my right wrist straight to my heart The last time I got narcotics this good was when I gave birth to the twins I woke up afterward with my right wrist in a splint but no stent in my heart The cardiologist looked pleased Your arteries are completely clear he said I was shocked My dad had a heart attack at  but he was a smoker I was in my early s and I knew that with less estrogen my risk of heart disease was rising What I didnt realize is that   are different from those in men But it turned out that I hadnt had a heart attack at all Instead it was a rare condition called   or heartbreak syndrome that mimics one The cardiologist said he saw perhaps  cases a year out of hundreds of heart patients Triggered by intense emotional or physical stress the left heart ventricle distends to resemble the shape of a traditional Japanese octopus trap Cases tend to spike after earthquakes and hurricanes particularly in women past menopause I hadnt experienced an earthquake I had been internalizing too much stress for too long The doc told me that my heart now pumped at only twothirds of normal capacity but that the damage would likely heal within months And a few months since being   I am stronger Our sons behavior has been stellar in second grade He adores his teacher A trained class substitute helps everybody out and both our children have made new friends in the city afterschool program that welcomes all kinds of kids The poisonletter writer moved out of the district One parent invited my son to join his childs Aikido dojo A neighbor offered help with afterschool pickup I have used my reprieve to take my kids to the beach as often as possible I wear a red bikini under my rash guard Yoga irks me but Im trying to touch my toes anyway Retraining the stress response of a lifetime is difficult but it helps to remind myself what I cant control and what I can My hearts got to keep going for another  or  years
