If youre looking to go out for dinner see a movie or plunk down big bucks on a new TV chances are youll look online for help with the decision Lots of people are now checking out potential doctors that way too Online ratings are becoming part of how many Americans shop for a physician according to a study in the latest issue of   the journal of the American Medical Association Among more than  people who took part in an online survey  percent said that online doctor ratings were either somewhat important or very important in making a decision about which doctor see When the researchers from the University of Michigan med school zeroed in on people whod made use of an online review in the preceding year  percent responded the ratings were either somewhat useful or very useful in making a decision about a doctor For comparison  percent of people who had used online ratings to help pick a restaurant and  percent of people who had tried them to select a book or movie were similarly satisfied Just for fun I looked up the ratings for my primary care doctor on   one of the sites thats been around for a while There were only four reviews two of them dated back to  None of the people who reported their insurance coverage have the same kind I do One person clearly had a bad experience The other three reviews were pretty positive There was no clear picture of my doc from the limited data Nevertheless rating sites that treat reviews of physicians like reviews of movies or mechanics may be useful to the public but the implications should be considered because the stakes are higher as the authors of this study write A   that looked at ratings for urologists found there were only  reviews for each doctor on some of the big sites such as Healthgradescom Vitalscom and RateMDscom Just one review  very good or very bad  can skew the picture when there arent many to go on Another problem with current ratings is that they tend to emphasize things like punctuality bedside manner and the friendliness of office staff Youd probably like to know how good a doctor is at diagnosing and treating what ails you Accurate assessments of the quality of care are hard to come by Still   a health policy researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health says were in the very early days of consumer ratings for doctors It would be nice to start supplementing the patientexperience stuff with real quality information he tells Shots And he expects that will happen before too much longer There is a clear consensus that Medicare is going to start doing for physician practices what it has been doing for hospitals he says The Medicares   isnt easy to use but its already bringing data based on quality to the masses And now Medicares   is   about large group practices of doctors to the online mix
