The Torontoarea woman was having her third   in three days And this time she refused to suffer in private  Yepes recorded a selfie video of her symptoms after pulling over while driving The next day the video would help doctors at   correctly diagnose her with transient ischemic attacks or ministrokes due to plaque buildup in her arteries  Now according to Yepes she is on cholesterollowering medication and blood thinners and hasnt had any more strokes  The video may have saved her life  Two days before the recording doctors at a local emergency room in Toronto dismissed her face numbness and slurred speech as stressrelated They told her stroke tests had come back negative and counseled the yearold legal secretary on breathing techniques Those were ineffective and Yepes suffered two additional ministrokes in consecutive days  the first leaving the hospital parking lot on April   She knew something had to be done  I think it was just to show somebody because I knew it was not stressrelated she said   with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp And I thought if I could show somebody what was happening they would have a better understanding That was exactly what happened Yepes filmed the third ministroke the next day en route to work After arriving she showed the video to coworkers who immediately suggested she go to a different hospital  Still Dr Markku Kaste with the   said he believes Yepes was lucky  His advice Dont waste time on a video just call   He said Its the same thing for everyone If youre having a stroke think youre having a stroke or see someone having one  just call  Kaste and his organization are working on an  targeting women and their likelihood for strokes  According to the    women have strokes each year  As in Yepes case the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said   generally include sudden numbness confusion and difficulty walking  The American Stroke Association uses the acronym    meaning face dropping arm weakness and speech difficulty are all signs that its time to call   Usually paramedics emergency responders and doctors correctly identify the situation and will get individuals the help they need Its hard to say why there was an incorrect diagnosis initially but things like that can happen Kaste said Still the quicker you are to the hospital the higher the likelihood of a good outcome
