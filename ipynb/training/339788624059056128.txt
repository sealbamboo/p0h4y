My rear end is big My stomach is huge My arms are wobbly Im enormous No Im more enormous Fat talk the bodydenigrating phrases many women engage in with their girlfriends may feel like a kind of female bonding but it can be damaging to selfesteem The issue drew attention earlier this week in an article in   where researchers called fat talk a contagious bonding ritual that can set the stage for eating disorders The story cited a study that found that  percent of college women engaged in fat talk TODAYs Savannah Guthrie said that figure did not shock her at all and asked her guests psychologist Belisa Vranich and plussize model Emme Aronson if they agreed Women Vranich said fat talk all the time  It helps sort of ease the discomfort between friends and have something to complain about together she said Unfortunately its gone too far That is because fat talk is not just the harmless idle chatter between friends that it may seem she said There is a larger danger because if you keep hearing this over and over not only from other people about how fat they are but you hear yourself say that you are fat and you are not beautiful and youre not perfect it definitely takes a toll on your selfesteem Vranich said We have to stop this right away Guthrie noted that fat talk is not always grounded in reality and Aronson agreed that its not just a phenomenon of larger women  You could be size zero or you could be  or larger she said All women engage in this and its very disastrous for our self esteem and our own body image and reaching our goals Women fat talk sometimes as a way to gain reassurance from a friend that in fact they do look good or as they are striving for perfection I think the fat talk comes from that constant like well I can be better blogger Stacy Morrison said in a taped segment on TODAY I think theres always that Im reaching for just my best my personal perfect best I think we just want that reassurance that we arent fat Niria Portella of Cosmopolitan for Latinas said in the taped segment But seeking that reassurance and the oneupmanship it can bring is also unhealthy Vranich said Unfortunately what usually happens is that it goes back and forth and you almost start competing about whos looking fat or whos looking worse she said And thats toxic Fat talk is so ingrained in women the New York Times said that its often used to show how a woman feels she is expected to feel about her own body rather than how she truly feels Even if you dont feel that way about your body women talk that way as if thats how they should be talking Times reporter Jan Hoffman said in the taped segment Aronson said women need to accept the bodies they have rather than bashing themselves and their shapes  We dont need to body bash she told Guthrie If theres something else bothering us go to that issue Stop body bashing yourself Even if women know that fat talking is not healthy will the chatter about bulging thighs or a poochy tummy go away The real challenge is its such an ingrained habit blogger Morrison said  She suggested not making fat talk the social currency and instead suggested women ask each other How are you doing Whats awesome in your life right now Related
