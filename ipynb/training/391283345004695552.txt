In Eastern Europe and the Balkans small thinfleshed singletipped green peppers are grilled and filled with cheese then dipped in flour and fried I spent a summer in Croatia years ago and watched my friend Zorans mother make these by the dozen day after day In Provence the stuffed peppers usually have a filling based on bread crumbs and in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East the filling usually involves rice I decided to play around with stuffed pepper recipes and made some delicious nontraditional fillings with red rice and vegetables Swiss chard in one recipe fennel in another and with quinoa I combined the quinoa with feta to stretch my otherwise traditional Balkan filling for fried small peppers In some of my recipes I grilled the peppers before I stuffed them and in one I poached them in a sweet and sour marinade and served the stuffed peppers cold   The peppers make a very nutritious home for the delicious fillings Bell peppers are an excellent source of Vitamin C as well as a wide range of carotenoids like lycopene betacarotene lutein and zeaxanthin They are also a good source of some of the sulfur compounds we usually associate with cruciferous vegetables like cabbage and broccoli  The roasted peppers make a nice contrast in color and flavor to the sweet tomato sauce   Delicious stuffed peppers that can be served hot or at room temperature  A hearty filling that works well with red peppers  Peppers that taste great filled or unfilled
