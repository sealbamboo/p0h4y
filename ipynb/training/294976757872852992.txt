Maurice Sendak the renowned childrens book author and illustrator died earlier today in Danbury Conn of complications from a   he suffered last Friday He was  One of Americas most famous authors of childrens books Sendak actually told interviewer Terry Gross during a  interview on the NPR radio show   that he never wrote with children in mind Indeed Sendak ranks among the few picturebook authors whose works appeal equally to adults and kids for proof look no further than the  film adaptation of his most famous book   which was aimed largely at adult viewers Going against the prevailing bent of his contemporaries Sendaks stories did not showcase children who eat everything on their plates go dutifully to bed at the proper hour and learn all sorts of useful facts or moral lessons by the time the book comes to an end as Nat Hentoff wrote in a January  profile of Sendak in   magazine Instead Sendak gave us Pierre a boy so contrary he is nonchalantly eaten by a lion in   story bearing his name True Pierre does come around after hes rescued from the lions belly but being eaten alive is quite a price to pay for learning to be more agreeable Then of course theres Max the wolfsuitclad boy at the heart of   Maxs adventures start only after he angers his mother and is sent to bed without supper In these and other books Sendak brilliantly combined dark and light themes never shying from the   inherent to childhood In another interview on   in  Sendak explained his aversion to sugarcoating childrens life experiences Ive convinced myself  I hope Im right  that children despair of you if you dont tell them the truth he told Gross The devoted following his books inspired certainly more than proves the wisdom of his approach Famously prickly Sendak had little patience for people who felt his emotionally evocative work was too scary or adult for children Upon its publication in  many critics panned   and some libraries even banned the book But most kids actually found the books monsters funny and playful and a constant clamor for it among young readers made it a genuine success Fortysix years later the same scenario repeated itself upon the release of the   movie This time when asked during an interview with  what hed tell parents who thought director Spike Jonzes film was too frightening for their children Sendak famously replied I would tell them to go to hell In the end Sendaks work still appeals so strongly to kids and their parents decades after its publication because of the perennial   it addresses In an interview with his close friend Selma Lanes for her  book   the author and illustrator says three of his most famous works     and   represent a trilogy concerning how children master various feelings  danger boredom fear frustration jealousy  and manage to come to grips with the realities of their lives And those feelings as they say never go out of style In his final interview with Terry Gross on   last September Sendak told a story that seems to encapsulate his approach to his work Gross asked him if he could share some favorite comments from readers hed received over the years Sendak replied there were many but one in particular stood out Hed received a card from a young boy named Jim with a drawing on it Sendak answered the boys card with a postcard of his own on which he drew one of the Wild Thing monsters Soon after the boys mother wrote Sendak to tell him Jim loved your card so much he ate it Sendak told Gross That to me was one of the highest compliments Ive ever received He didnt care that it was an original drawing or anything He saw it he loved it he ate it Sendaks final book  inspired by his relationship with his older brother Jack who was also an artist and author  is to be published in February
