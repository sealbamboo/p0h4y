When Jessica Green competed in roller derby she wondered how training socializing and colliding with other roller girls could be affecting her health in invisible ways As a member of the Emerald City Roller Girls Green went by Thumper Biscuit on the track but she is also the director of the   at the University of Oregon She and her colleagues just published a   in the journal   looking at the bacteria that live on the skin of roller derby team members and how theyre swapped around during competition According to the official rules of the   players are allowed to make contact at the arms chest hips and thighs when jockeying for track position If youve ever seen roller derby you know that contact is a pretty mild word for what goes on Researchers swabbed the exposed upper arms of roller derby players on three teams from different cities before and after bouts at a tournament in Emerald Citys home base of Eugene Ore They found that before a bout the different teams had distinct populations of skin microbes We could have picked out one player at random and just by looking at the bacteria on her upper arm we could have told you what team she played for says   a postdoctoral researcher at the BioBE Center who led the study Its not entirely clear why the teams had such distinct bacterial communities It might be because their hometowns of Eugene San Jose Calif and Washington DC have different climates urban settings and plants and animals the researchers said Or the players might have picked them up from some other common environment like a team van But after a bout the microbes on the players arms had more overlap We could still tell which team she played for but with a lot less accuracy says Meadow The results point to persontoperson transmission though Green says its also possible that the bacteria were transmitted by contact with the ground or even through the air Its not clear how long the changes seen after a bout would persist though that would require looking at players skin bacteria over days or weeks  an associate professor at the University of Colorado who studies microbial communities says the results are in line with other studies showing that bacteria are swapped between people who make other kinds of contact like shaking hands He reviewed the study for   a new peerreviewed openaccess journal at which Green is an academic editor So what might all this bacteria swapping mean for our health Well researchers arent sure but they are investigating how bacteria from other people and the environment might influence our own personal bacterial colonies Some skin bacterial populations for example can mediate skin disorders provide protection from pathogens and regulate our immune system the study authors write And rarely diseasecausing bacteria such as   are passed along too Using DNA sequencing to study the various bacterial colonies or microbiomes that live on our skin   and elsewhere in our bodies has become a hot area of research So its likely were going to learn more and more about whats going around and coming back around
