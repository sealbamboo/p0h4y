Before the Affordable Care Act was even open for enrollment Viviana Alvarado was already taking calls from people who wanted to know more She and about  of her colleagues are staffing the phones for   the company Connecticut has contracted to run its call center The government contractors running the troubled HealthCaregov website have been under intense scrutiny in the past month but those businesses arent the only ones being paid to rollout Obamacare In the states that are running their own health care exchanges practices vary Oregon for instance set up its own call centers other states like Connecticut farm that business out to companies like Maximus Its a huge opportunity and it remains so says   an analyst at Gartner a technology research firm There are millions of millions of folks coming in for insurance coverage That represents a great opportunity for both commercial carriers and for those contractors who are servicing health care How much is Maximus making in Connecticut In a   the company valued the contract at  million over three years for staffing and operating the call center But that lump sum is all the information the company provides Access Health CT the states   wouldnt confirm the  million price tag And while it will say that it is paying a per minute fee per call it wont say how that fee is calculated In fact   with Maximus that it makes available to the public blacks out all language that has to do with pricing That means that taxpayers cant know how much the state of Connecticut is paying Maximus Why Well redactions are things that typically relate to privacy and competitive issues from vendors says   CEO of Access Health CT the states new insurance marketplace Counihan says state law allows vendors like Maximus to redact what they think is proprietary information from public documents But should pricing be propriety in a government contract Is price something that someone should be able to redact I sure think so Whats the whole point If everybody knows what everybody is pricing everybodys going to be pricing at the same level And that doesnt drive a good deal Counihan says Maximus refused to comment on its Connecticut pricing In a statement the company says call centers are in a highly competitive industry But in emails to the state the company justifies its position by saying that releasing its pricing information would result in irreparable economic damage to Maximus and significantly weaken its competitive position in the marketplace Maximus also has a contract in Hawaii But in that state it doesnt have to disclose its contracts at all because its entire health insurance marketplace the Hawaii Health Connector is   from the states sunshine laws Vermonts exchange handled things differently It has posted on the internet a complete unredacted copy of   with Maximus The document spells out everything from how long a call can be on hold to how quickly it must be answered Mark Larson the head of Vermonts exchange explains We are spending taxpayer dollars and we understand our responsibility to ensure that theres transparency in how those dollars are being spent to whom theyre being given and what we get in return for them And we want to make sure that its easy for Vermonters or others to find that information According to the contract Vermont pays Maximus  cents a minute for calls and the state estimates a call volume of about  minutes per month That comes out to about  a month Rick Howard the Gartner analyst says that in an ideal world none of the call center prices would matter Everyone would sign up on the Internet This is just a really complicated initially enrollment cycle Howard says Once the websites continue to evolve then I would expect over time call center activities to be greatly reduced from what they were here in the first months or year of the marketplace Until that happens theres money to be made But in Connecticut the public just cant know how much
