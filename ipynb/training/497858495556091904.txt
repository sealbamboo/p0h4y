Did Pfizer fail to warn the public that Lipitor may cause Type 2 diabetes or memory loss? A fast-growing number of lawsuits have been filed by women who allege that the drug maker knew about the possibility of such serious side effects associated with its blockbuster cholesterol-lowering pill, but never properly warned the public, according to Reuters.. In the past five months, the news service reviewed federal court filings that show lawsuits by women in the U.S. who say that Lipitor caused them to develop type-2 diabetes jumped from 56 to almost 1,000. One attorney says the actual number of women represented in these lawsuits numbers approximately 4,000.
