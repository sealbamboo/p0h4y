As you scour shopping websites and store aisles this season captive to that frenzied loving and exasperated hunt for perfect holiday gifts heres a little gift of sorts from researchers who study gift giving and receiving Think gift card Because the less specific the gift the more it will be appreciated You shudder you recoil But the sad truth is that while gift cards constitute a minority of holiday gifts   they have been the most popular gift request since  But you know your recipient best right In studies to be presented early next year at a   researchers tried to analyze the emotional turmoil churned up by the exchanging of gifts noting that the givers earnest intentions may often widely miss the mark of the recipients true desires  When Mary Steffel an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Cincinnati and her colleagues asked subjects what kinds of gifts they preferred to give the replies were specific and highly personalized  Chained to the firmament that its the thought that counts givers pride themselves on putting inordinate time and focus on tailoring gifts to fit receivers And the closer the relationship the more thought givers believe they should put into selecting a gift But when subjects were asked what they would like to receive they overwhelmingly replied that they wanted creditcard gift cards which would give them the flexibility to choose exactly what they want We find that when people are thinking about what gifts they want to give they focus on the recipients traits and personality Dr Steffel said But when recipients are evaluating gifts theyre thinking about their current wants or needs So we encourage givers to focus on what the recipient would like rather than what they are like   And when all else fails she said rather than overthinking givers might try a simple solution Ask Her line of research on gift giving was inspired partly by her own predilection for overthinking gift giving for example the pair of oven mitts she bought for her newlywed friends individually monogrammed  the ones that ultimately never graced their kitchen and couldnt be returned for store credit One Christmas her family obsessed over a present for her uncle We picked out the perfect shirt she recalled It was the right pattern color size and style So much so that when he opened the gift he happened to be wearing the exact same shirt Ironically   that if recipients like their gift they dont give much thought to how much effort the giver put into it Theyre too consumed emotionally with enjoying the thing itself  But if recipients disdain the gift they assume the giver put little effort and thought into it Thought and time counts more for the giver because it makes them feel closer to the receiver said Nicholas Epley a professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago  Additional research shows why a gift card may be preferable to cash Research   found that recipients of cash felt obligated to use the money on utilitarian items But when getting something labeled a gift card whether to a particular store or tied to a credit card recipients focused on the word gift which gave them permission to treat themselves and indulge  By far the biggest challenge for gift givers is shopping for picky people Thats when asking  and sigh the gift card  can be particularly useful Evan Polman a psychologist and assistant professor of marketing at the University of WisconsinMadison found that of  Black Friday shoppers in   percent said they were shopping for recipients they defined as picky He and his colleagues have identified two types of picky people One types preferences are relatively straightforward They want the same things all the time  The more irritating type Dr Polman said clearly has strong opinions but givers often scratch their heads trying to discern what those opinions are  Givers believe that the receiver will be snobby and snarky about the gift Dr Polman said and assume that their picky recipients will return regift or throw out the gift  So they feel defeated he added As a result they typically either spend less on the picky person skip the gift altogether or indeed settle upon a gift card  Asking the picky person exactly what he or she wants would no doubt save a lot of time and emotional capital   that receivers appreciate those gifts more than imaginative guesses  And yet many givers dont like to resort to these measures Dr Polman said We feel we are copping out because we have to ask It feels like a cold transaction Theres no warmth in it All the mystique of giving has been erased Remember if asking receivers their preference violates your deepseated beliefs about gifting there is alas always the gift card  Either way the picky person comes away satisfied  Picky receivers annoy givers but they get what they want Dr Polman said Theres some benefit to being picky
