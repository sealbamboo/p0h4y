Interest in drugs that might be used to treat Ebola virus has hit a fever pitch but the buzz isnt simply about fear of Ebola or about saving lives in poor nations of West Africa Its also about money Take for example the Canadian drug company   It is trying to develop an Ebola drug thats based on a technology called RNAi This is an intriguing concept using genetic material rather than conventional drugs to disrupt the Ebola virus The company says it has a  million grant from the US Department of Defense to develop this concept But the company also trades on the stock market    so  no surprise  theres a fair amount of chatter online by investors pumping up the prospects of the putative Ebola drug and hoping to make a buck Tekmiras experimental drug is by no means ready for prime time In fact the first tests simply to determine whether its safe to give to people screeched to a halt earlier this spring after the US Food and Drug Administration raised concerns On Thursday the company   that the FDA had eased that hold somewhat The human tests on healthy volunteers are still forbidden but the company says it now has the option of offering the drug to people who are infected with Ebola and therefore already facing a lifethreatening risk The company didnt say whether it actually plans to do that And its not clear whether that drug would be the best option for people in West Africa currently ill with Ebola There are certainly   Theres an experimental drug called    based on traditional pharmacology  that like the Tekmira drug has protected animals from Ebola and related viruses And then there are   Thats what the two American missionaries who contracted Ebola received Though these were hightech antibodies the concept of using antibodies to treat disease goes back more than a century The decision to try these antibodies on the missionaries generated huge media attention The plain fact is we dont know whether that treatment is helpful harmful or doesnt have any impact CDC Director Dr Tom Frieden said Thursday at a congressional hearing And were unlikely to know from the experience of two or a handful of patients whether it works The truth is that patients who receive good supportive care can get better  for example if they get good hydration or oxygen and treatment for other infections Frieden noted that when patients with an Ebolalike disease received good treatment in Germany a few years ago threequarters of them survived Health officials are concerned that all this talk about a breakthrough drug for Ebola is a distraction Frieden said drugs wont stop the current outbreak Whats needed is an effective campaign in West Africa to identify people who are sick with Ebola so they can be isolated and given good supportive care The World Health Organization is hoping to stir a stronger international reaction to put the needed people facilities and supplies in place
