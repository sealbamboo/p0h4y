Jean McFee Raichle  is a remarkably cheerful woman  She lives in an assisted living center in Seattle staffed by aides who are warm and nurturing  She exists in the moment mostly untroubled by her Alzheimers disease Only once in the past several years has her daughter Marilyn Raichle witnessed her become alarmed That was when Marilyn was having problems at work and called to tell her mother about it She could hear the stress in my voice and I could feel her becoming anxious said Ms Raichle   I saw that she was picking up on my emotions and I just stopped right there Ms Raichle had stumbled onto a phenomenon experienced by many people with relatives who have Alzheimers emotional contagion  The term refers to the way we sense the emotions of others through their facial expressions tone of voice or body language and reflect them without being conscious of doing so   Babies have this innate ability to catch and mirror the emotions of those around them And its not just humans who share this capacity   too according to several scientific studies  Now new research published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that   And the greater the level of cognitive deterioration the more pronounced this emotional mirroring seems to be Several explanations may account for the finding said Virginia Sturm an assistant professor of neurology at the University of California San Francisco and lead author of the report   As the hippocampus  the brain region that helps modulate emotional responses  atrophies in Alzheimers disease emotional sensitivity may be heightened she speculated And the brain network associated with emotional connection and empathy may become more active as pathways involved in memory and internal reflection become impaired  These networks may have a reciprocal relationship thats not yet understood Dr Sturm said In their research the San Francisco researchers asked caregivers friends or relatives to fill out a questionnaire rating the emotional responsiveness of  people with MCI and  with Alzheimers  people with cognitive concerns served as a control group Then all the participants in the study received MRI scans of their brains The scans showed that higher levels of emotional contagion were associated with atrophy in the hippocampus and other temporal lobe regions predominantly on the right side Those regions are involved in several social and emotional functions including assessing the trustworthiness and perspectives of other people Degeneration in these regions may make people less adept at identifying the emotions of others in pencil and paper tasks but theyre still able to maintain emotional reactions and connections via other routes that dont depend on higherlevel cognition Dr Sturm said Mary Sano director of the Alzheimers Disease Research Center at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City called the study fascinating and said We talk so much about the cognitive loss in MCI and Alzheimers but in fact the emotional disturbance is equally problematic Irritability or emotional volatility in people with MCI and Alzheimers are common these may arise because someone is picking up an emotional cue that they cant put into a cognitive context and is therefore misunderstood Dr Sano said Dr Dylan Wint director of education programs at the Cleveland Clinics Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas said I often tell caregivers that as facts start to fade feelings and tone of your interactions become more important A great deal of what our higherorder cognitive function does is inhibit or modulate our lowerlevel responses Dr Wint continued  As these higherorder functions fail theres less of a dampening effect and our instinctual responses rise to the surface What can caregivers do Dr G Allen Power a geriatrician in Rochester talks to groups around the country about this issue We have to be very aware of our body language  being centered present not being distracted  when were with someone with dementia he said If were not theyll pick up on it and it will begin to shut them down If we are calm we can bring people with dementia to a calm place he said  And if we are anxious we can amp people up   Also recognizing that people with dementia live in a world suffused with emotion can help caregivers understand the importance of identifying feelings that may underlie a patients behavior and respond to those meeting needs that someone is no longer able to express directly If youre getting frustrated with someone with dementia try stopping and counting to  Dr Power suggested Think of a positive quality they have and focus on that  Any mind trick you can use to get a place of acceptance and being nonjudgmental makes a difference because the person youre caring for will sense that and respond to that he said
