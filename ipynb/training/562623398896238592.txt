About a decade after the Food and Drug Administration first warned that antidepressant medications increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children new research has found that kids and young adults starting on high doses of antidepressants are at especially high risk especially in the first three months of treatment The researchers found no increased risk of suicidal behavior among adults older than  who started medical treatment for depression or anxiety at larger initial doses It might also be that those started on highdose SSRIs are more likely to discontinue their therapy and to suffer from discontinuation syndrome which can bring physical symptoms of anxiety and is sometimes linked to unpredictable behavior
