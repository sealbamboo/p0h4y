Here at NPR weve heard about some wacky food scandals There have been   harboring bad bacteria turkeys trotting around with arsenic in their guts and a   that brewed up botulism But a recent report from China may take the cake  or should we say the eggplant Two people in a Beijing restaurant intentionally laced the eggplant dishes with enough of a blood pressure drug to send  diners to the hospital Everyone recovered but  of them had to have their blood pumped to remove the drug Over the past few years China has experienced a string of food safety scandals   and   sickened hundreds last year And back    sent shock waves through the country But why the heck would a restaurant want to harm its customers According to a recent   in the   the two perpetrators were in cahoots with the restaurant down the street and they wanted to give it a competitive advantage by sickening their rivals diners Such competitive poisoning is not unheard of in China Just last year The  on a local dairy farmer who intentionally tainted his competitors milk supply with nitrite In the eggplant incident the miscreants hid the drug    a white odorless powder  in the restaurants starch When the chefs thickened up the braised eggplant with the starch they inadvertently served up a few nearly toxic stirfries All diners that ate eggplant for lunch on April   fell sick almost immediately the report says They got dizzy and tired suffered from nausea and blurred vision and even started vomiting At a local hospital doctors discovered potentially toxic levels of clonidine in their blood They treated the patients for low blood pressure and within  hours all their symptoms resolved Police eventually discovered the drug in the restaurants starch and traced it to the neighboring restaurant The two perpetrators were convicted and sentenced to one year in prison the report says Efforts to reach Chinese officials who wrote the report were unsuccessful so we turned to a a domestic poison expert for insights Toxicologist   says the criminals probably chose clonidine because its a potent drug that takes only a tiny amount to cause serious symptoms They wouldnt need to put a lot of the drug into the eggplant so people probably wouldnt notice it It wouldnt change the taste she says Thats just my guess KleinSchwartz helps run the Maryland Poison Center She says clonidine is especially dangerous for kids Its on the   for children under  and each year about  young children in the US go to the emergency room after accidentally taking the drug Even when a kids taken just one tablet were very worried about this she says Usually this occurs when a toddler grabs his grandmas blood pressure drug from a table she says not from Chinese takeout Nonetheless the   report cautions that doctors treating what appears to be a foodborne illness should also consider drug spiking as a potential cause
