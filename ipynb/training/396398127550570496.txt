The Treasury Department is scrapping the rule that requires people to use or lose the money they set aside each year in accounts to cover health care expenses that are otherwise unreimbursed Instead the department plans to   people to carry over up to  of unused money to the following year at their employers discretion That could start as early as the end of this year An estimated  million families use these flexible spending accounts or FSAs Tied usually to employment at big companies the accounts let people put aside money before taxes to help pay medical expenses insurance doesnt cover Deductibles and copayments qualify but so do things like eyeglasses and dental expenses The   both the amount of money people could put in the plans and the types of things that could be reimbursed in an effort to raise money to pay for the measure But now after taking note of public comment the Treasury Department says it wants to make the accounts more accessible to more people An overwhelming majority of feedback from individual employers and others requested that the useorlose rule for health FSAs be modified the   Commenters noted that people have a hard time estimating exactly how much they will spend on medical care at the beginning of the year when they have to make a determination how much to put in the account The prospect of losing unspent funds tends to deter those who earn less in particular Some people who find themselves with unspent funds toward the end of the year often wind up going on medical spending sprees to avoid a loss of funds buying extra eyeglasses or frantically trying to schedule holiday medical appointments Among those praising the rules was Sen Orrin Hatch RUtah He is one of several members of Congress who have introduced bills to roll back some of the new restrictions on FSAs But the changes were still not enough for Hatch Id like to see more done to expand these critical accounts that employer the individual to make informed health care decisions using money they saved
