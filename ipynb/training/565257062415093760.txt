Another influenza season is in the books and overall it caused less sickness and death than flu seasons in the recent past according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Between Sept   and May   a total of  specimens sent to US labs tested positive for a flu virus Among them  were influenza A viruses and the most common of these were versions of the HN virus that prompted the swine flu epidemic in  The other  of the confirmed specimens were influenza B viruses The   which were published Thursday in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report did not estimate a total number of flu deaths for the  flu season But based on records kept by doctors and hospitals researchers concluded that flu activity in the last year resulted in lower levels of outpatient illness and mortality compared with years when the predominant strains were versions of the HN virus At least  children died of the flu in the last year laboratory tests confirmed Those deaths were reported in  states New York City and Chicago In about half of these cases the patients had at least one preexisting conditionÂ such as a neurologic disorder or a pulmonary disease that may have made them more vulnerable to the flu The most striking statistic in the report is the rate of hospitalization among people between the ages of  and  Over the course of the entire flu season the cumulative hospitalization rate for these adults was  per  people In the previous four years that figure has been as low as  and it never topped  The cumulative hospitalization rate was even higher for Americans who were at least  years old   per  people But that was well within the range in recent years  to  per  people Nationwide the flu season peaked in the week that ended Dec   The peak came earliest in the southeastern United States the week that ended Dec  and latest in the Northeast excluding New England the week that ended Jan  The HN and other A viruses were the predominant flu viruses through late March Then influenza B viruses took over with the region encompassing New York New Jersey Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands particularly hard hit The report noted one human case of a HN virus that was first spotted in pigs in  and was identified in a dozen people the following year The new case was a child from Iowa who had direct contact with pigs The patient fully recovered apparently without spreading it to relatives or anyone else according to the CDC Lab tests show that last years flu vaccine was wellchosen Fully  of the HN samples tested were antigenetically similar to the flu strain used in the vaccine as were  of the HN samples tested Some vaccines also protected against just one influenza B virus which accounted for  of the B viruses that circulated last year Of those  were antigenetically similar to the strain in the flu vaccine Other vaccines also protected against a second B virus and those were a good match as well according to the report The vaccine for the  flu season will be based on the same four viruses the CDC said
