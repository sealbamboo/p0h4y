 While   has long been linked to cancer its frequent companion drinking may be as well a new study suggests Three new studies presented at a medical meeting this week find a link between heavy boozing and a rise in risk for the number one cancer killer On the other hand studies also suggest that heavier people are less likely to develop lung cancer than smaller folk and black tea might help ward of the disease as well The findings were to be presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians Oct  in Honolulu More Americans die from   than any other form according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC In  the most recent year for which statistics are available more than  people in the United States were diagnosed with lung cancer and nearly  died In one study presented at the meeting Dr Stanton Siu and colleagues at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland Calif looked at the diets and lifestyles of more than  people first surveyed between  and  They then tracked their incidence of lung cancer through  The team found that having more than three alcoholic drinks per day upped lung cancer risk with a slightly higher risk ascribed to beer consumption versus wine or liquor Specifically compared to teetotalers people who had three or more drinks daily were  percent more likely to develop lung cancer with a  percent rise in risk if the drink of preference was beer One expert stressed however that its tough to tease out drinking from another even more carcinogenic habit smoking since the two often go together Smoking remains an overwhelming   but    heavy drinking whether its the alcohol itself or that heavy drinking is a surrogate for hanging out in smoky bars and getting more smoke I dont know said Dr Norman Edelman chief medical officer of the American Lung Association who was not involved in any of the studies In another intriguing finding from the study a higher body mass index BMI which indicates overweight or obesity was linked to a reduction in the odds for lung malignancies The finding may not mean that packing on extra pounds insulates one against lung cancer however Edelman noted that being overweight or obese is typically associated with poorer health while people who are sick weigh little he said So the results may just mean that the heavier study participants havent suffered the ill effects of their lifestyle  yet In a separate study also slated for presentation at the meeting researchers from the Czech Republic found that among nonsmoking women regular black tea consumption appeared to lower lung cancer risk by about  percent and higher amounts of fruit in the diet was also linked to lowered lung cancer   for both genders Edelman and Dr Mark Rosen chief of the division of pulmonarycritical care and sleep medicine at the North ShoreLIJ Health System in New Hyde Park NY cautioned that all of the study results need to be replicated before being taken seriously They show some interesting associations but that doesnt mean theyre necessarily factual Rosen said If you put a lot of data into a computer youre going to find some things come out linked just by chance Associations are interesting but they all require further studies Experts also note that research presented at scientific meetings is considered preliminary and has not been peerreviewed
