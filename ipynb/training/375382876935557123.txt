Hot summer days often mean air pollution warnings in big cities But the air inside your kitchen can sometimes be just as harmful Cooking fumes from your stove are supposed to be captured by a hood over the range  but even some expensive models arent that effective  spends a lot of time thinking about what happens when she cooks Shes a research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab where she studies indoor air pollution You spend  percent of your time in your home says Logue And what you do in your home has a huge impact on what youre exposed to Cooking on a gas stove releases some of the same pollutants that you find outdoors in smog Logue looked at homes in Southern California that cook at least once a week and found more than half of them were above the outdoor health limit for a pollutant called nitrogen dioxide If you exceeded the standards outdoors it would be a really big deal she says But if you exceed them in your house nobodys paying attention Homes with electric stoves arent in the clear because cooking the food itself creates air pollution Sauteing fats produces a lung irritant called acrolein And cooking puts off   Just like smog outdoors these emissions increase your chances of developing longterm respiratory and heart problems If all this sounds a little scary Logue says theres a simple solution a good range hood that vents outside But she says Not all hoods work the same and currently unfortunately theres no way for people to really know how effective their range hood is Inside the test kitchen at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab   a building systems engineer and his team are trying to figure out exactly that Some of the hoods hes tested are only  percent effective because their fans arent as powerful Delp says when youre buying a hood thats labeled as air flow But the shape of the hood also makes a big difference like how far it reaches over the stove Delp and his team are developing a standardized test to measure hood effectiveness Its being reviewed by an international testing board which would allow manufacturers to voluntarily label their hoods Unfortunately theres not really a state or federal agency that has comprehensive authority over indoor air pollution says Peggy Jenkins who manages the indoor air quality program at the California Air Resources Board She says there are strict ventilation rules for other gas appliances in homes like furnaces and water heaters Stoves and range hoods have been largely overlooked In a sense its lowhanging fruit but its not really simple she says Jenkins says theres growing interest in changing Californias building codes around range hoods  but it would take a number of state agencies to do it Meanwhile for we home cooks Logue has a few tips She says use the highest fan setting on the range hood and put pots and pans on the back burners Thats where hoods capture the most pollutants Simple changes but effective ones Logue says The hard part is remembering them  Always turn your fan on  Cook on the back burners  Use highest fan setting  Clean grease traps periodically  If you dont have a hood open windows  Look for one that covers the entire stovetop  It should move  cubic feet of air per minute certified by the Home Ventilating Institute  Choose a noise rating of   for a quieter fan  Choose a hood shape with a hollow space underneath for collecting fumes
