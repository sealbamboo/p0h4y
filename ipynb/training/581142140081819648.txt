Mom this is a horrible idea So my college student son declared when he learned I had started a threeday juice cleanse  hours of a juice diet Six bottles each day plus water and herbal tea No solid food Go ahead Make fun of me Call me a clich A cleanse in January Really You and everyone else who has  to drop on three days of juice  for one person that is not the whole family I chose a juice shop close to my house and was sold lots of green juices a couple with coconut or almond milk and one spicy beet juice and a charcoal lemonade yup a little gritty They were to be honest pretty delicious and totaled about  calories a day And just what is the point Reboot purify detox reset and revitalize  and you have to admit that sounds alluring A cleanse gives your digestive system a rest juice advocates say If you feel better and lose a few pounds you might be motivated to keep to a more healthful diet But its hard to prove whether youve been detoxified or rebooted Not that that stops people from trying Our culture is obsessed with cleansing said Alexandria Dika Pandola who wrote the play Juicd about a bachelorette party where instead of frozen daiquiris the bridetobe is served a juice cleanse one bottle after another with names including humility honesty and clarity Some regimens include some solid food colonics saunas drybrushing of the skin or various supplements Some juice company websites have notices that they are not medical facilities and advise people to seek out doctors before beginning a regimen People see this as a time to start fresh and juicing is often associated with detoxing or cleansing said Tricia Psota a nutritionist at the US Department of Agricultures Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion But she added Our GI gastrointestinal tract is set up to naturally detox The best way to keep it in shape is to use it she said Eating fiber is like lifting weights for your GI tract Theres no data whatever that shows detoxes or cleanses work said Roger Clemens director of analytical research at USCs School of Pharmacy who has written about cleanses with Dr Peter Pressman And extended for more than a few days  or for people with chronic diseases or other issues  they can be nutritionally compromising and harmful he said The claims are all nonsense Pressman said The kidneys want to be used the liver wants to be used You dont improve them by depriving them Rebooting our attitudes and kickstarting a healthful diet is no small feat Changing habits is hard And theres something to the ritual to taking resources and time to prepare for the cleanse and endure it I know people claim they feel better said Dana Hunnes a nutritionist at UCLA Medical Center but I dont know if its a placebo effect  hey Im doing something amazing for my body so I feel great Whether juice cleanses work or not they can be funny  or at least the juicers can be And Pressed Juicery has captured some of that with their YouTube video of a beautiful blond woman offering such cleanse insights as so detoxing right now and I only drink words I can pronounce and hashtag kill me It wasnt that bad for me I lost a little weight from the fit of my clothes But as Hunnes says it may be water weight and back before you read this Not one person told me I glowed
