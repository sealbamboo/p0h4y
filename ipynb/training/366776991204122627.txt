Im not a sedentary person In my s and s I was a runner and for decades I played singles tennis three or more times a week After a back injury in my late s I took up swimming and cycling Now in my s and with artificial knees I walk or cycle and swim laps daily all of which has kept me aerobically fit free of pain reasonably trim and energetic So in combing recently through the professional literature on exercise and bone health I was quite disappointed to learn that neither swimming nor cycling is especially good for my bones  at least not the ones most susceptible to fracture Swimming in fact might compromise the strength of those bones because it lacks the tug of gravity Thats what researchers have found when they measured bone mineral density in young athletes who swim or cycle and even in some who run There are two reasons for this One is the continuous nature of these activities Bones it seems dont like constant pressure They respond better to exercise that involves forceful muscle contractions occurring in starts and stops and with some variety  as happens for example when playing tennis or training with weights To maintain strength bones also need the stress of gravity which is lacking in cycling and swimming and not as powerful when walking as it is when running Being suspended in water is like floating in space for a short time once they leave Earth astronauts lose bone But before I was too discouraged and before you abandon exercises like mine and retreat to your recliner I did some more research Regular walks can indeed offer some protection against hip fractures among women and presumably men of a certain age I found In the famous Nurses Health Study which has followed tens of thousands of postmenopausal women for decades those who walked for at least four hours a week were  percent less likely to suffer hip fractures than those who walked less Those who walked for at least eight hours a week or did the equivalent amount of another activity were   long known to protect bones As a bonus walking briskly for exercise also lowered the womens risk of developing heart disease diabetes and stroke Activities like walking may not be perfect bonebuilders but they are far better than doing nothing As a bone doctor Ill take anything said Dr Vonda Wright an orthopedic surgeon at the Center for Sports Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Her studies of  athletic seniors whom she described as normal people have shown that even in their s and s they are able to maintain bone densities higher than the general populations Still she emphasized the need to bash our bones to make and keep them strong This can be done she said through dynamic impact  by hopping or jumping rope  times a day for example  or through positive stress by walking rapidly uphill or upstairs or even standing on the pedals while cycling uphill Although many bone experts recommend weighttraining on resistance machines like those found in gyms Dr Wright realizes that most older adults wont or cant join a gym Or like me they simply dont like machines and wont use them regularly Rather she recommends homebased exercises that more closely mimic how the body functions in the real world The house or office can be as effective as a gym Dr Wright said We never prescribe machines anymore she said Pushing leg presses is so unnatural Its not how the body uses squats We train the body functionally using the bodys own weight and free weights for resistance instead of machines Without any equipment you can strengthen your bodys core and multiple muscle groups by doing   Stand straight with feet shoulderwidth apart knees and toes pointed forward hands behind your head and elbows pointed outward Sink down keeping your weight on your heels as if you were about to sit in a chair Rise up with your back straight and repeat working up to two sets of about  squats each For a slightly greater challenge the same exercise can be done against a wall using an exercise ball between you and the wall You can use hand weights or even hold cans of food to strengthen the upper body at the same time Dr Wright also encourages people to use the stairs at home and at work Walking up and down  steps five times at a fast pace provides both an aerobic workout and one that strengthens bones Walking rapidly uphill is another option If jumping rope has some appeal Dr Wright suggested using a cordless digital jump rope to reduce the risk of tripping It also records the number of jumps with each turn of the wrists If you have access to chesthigh water in a pool lake or seaside you can build muscle mass and strengthen bones by walking forward and backward and sidetoside in the water she said This can strengthen the quads buttocks and core providing bone stimulation for the spine and hips and shock absorption for the knees And dont forget dancing The waltz or swing dance is one of the most popular things I prescribe Dr Wright said Of course if your back can handle it there are many ordinary tasks that can strengthen bones among them carrying heavy items or small children for short distances In the warmer months I do a lot of outdoor tasks  pushing a lawn mower raking sawing digging and the like  that involve intermittent bonebuilding stress Bone density exams typically involve only the spine hips and forearms the areas most susceptible to compression or fragility fractures But other bones like those in the thigh upper arm and shoulder can also break under minimal stress if they are weak so activities that strengthen them  like walking cycling and swimming  can indeed be helpful While some doctors think measures of the internal structure of bones may more accurately indicate strength than traditional bone density tests several experts told me that there is as yet no standard by which to judge bone health based on structure
