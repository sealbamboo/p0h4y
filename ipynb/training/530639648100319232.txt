As cases of a worrisome respiratory   continue to pop up in the Middle East scientists who study it in the US are struggling to understand how theyll be affected by a government   on certain kinds of experiments One of those researchers is   a virologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill Any virus that has pandemic potential and thats any respiratory virus that emerges from animals is a major public health concern Baric says And Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS fits that description perfectly Camels seem to carry it and it has sickened more than  people so far Over a third died If this virus mutates so that it spreads easily through the air millions could die It would go around the globe quickly and this would result in high morbidity and mortality disruption of the economy and in some cases the collapse of governments says Baric Thats why researchers want to learn as much as they can about MERS Its a type of virus called a   which is the special focus of Barics lab Usually coronaviruses only give people a case of the common cold But MERS is the second deadly coronavirus that has jumped from animals to humans The first was SARS about a decade ago Ralph is probably the foremost coronavirus biologist in the United States and one of the best in the world says   a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who used to work in Barics lab He says Barics group has produced essential research tools  animal models antibodies and mutant strains  that are used in coronavirus labs around the country Almost anyone working on coronaviruses would admit that Baric is the big cheese Frieman says And Baric gets a lot of funding from the government So he really felt the effects in October when the White House did something unusual Officials   they were halting certain governmentfunded experiments on three viruses  influenza SARS and MERS The Obama administration was concerned about any research that could make the viruses more dangerous so they wanted to stop and review studies to see if they could make these germs capable of causing more disease or spreading easily through the air Officials with the National Institutes of Health say that about  grants contracts and planned research projects fall under the new ban They say waivers can be obtained for research thats critical for public health though its not clear exactly how long that will take At first Baric was blissfully unaware that anything had happened Word of the moratorium came out on a Friday afternoon when Baric was out of the office He has four kids and a daughter was getting married I had a fantastic weekend It was a beautiful wedding It was one of the best times of my life She was so happy says Baric He recalls that when he came back to work that Monday he opened his email and was stunned to learn about the moratorium He thought of all his labs research projects It took me  seconds to realize that most of them were going to be affected he says The governments move came in the wake of some highprofile lab   at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plus some extremely controversial flu experiments Those flu studies made a deadly bird flu virus called HN more contagious between ferrets the lab standin for people The goal of that work was to see whether this bird flu virus might mutate in the wild and start a pandemic in people Critics were aghast What if this labmade superflu escaped I dont think its wise or appropriate for us to create large risks that dont already exist says   a microbiologist at Stanford University He thinks the government was right to include SARS and MERS in this moratorium because they are so close to being pandemic viruses Im quite delighted that great scientists like Ralph Baric are working on SARS and doing the work they are doing says Relman But there still are specific experiments that I think should cause everyone pause and potentially cause concern if conducted For SARS and MERS he says the one thing that I would feel most concerned about doing is to give them that one missing trait their means of transmitting easily between humans Baric says that kind of experiment is not happening in his lab Hes not trying to change the way SARS or MERS gets transmitted In fact he doesnt know of any lab trying to do that Still his group has recently been tweaking the genes of the MERS virus So is he making it more dangerous If youre a mouse the answer is probably yes or at least I was trying to says Baric Scientists study viruses in mice so they can test vaccines and drugs MERS doesnt make mice ill Baric wants to alter the MERS virus so that it can make mice as sick as it makes people The trouble is the government ban applies to all experiments that might make these viruses more dangerous in any mammal In response to questions from NPR an NIH spokesperson sent this explanation But Baric says when it comes to SARS and MERS there are key differences between people and mice No  mice dont sneeze says Baric so they dont transmit these diseases through the air And he says the process of adapting these viruses to mice actually makes the germs less able to infect human cells Theyre safer says Baric Still hes doing what the government wants The NIH has asked me to stop those experiments says Baric and so we have stopped those experiments Hes hoping federal officials will soon grant him waivers that will let that work continue Hes been told that other studies can go on for now but will need to be reviewed later Asked if his lab is creating any new forms of these viruses that would be more dangerous for people Baric replied Absolutely not And we do more genetics in coronaviruses than probably anyone else in the world He was surprised that SARS and MERS were included in the moratorium But he understands that controversial flu experiments did raise real concerns for scientists and the public And as stewards of that public trust I think we have to have open dialogue about that I think we have to have transparency says Baric He says he may not ultimately agree with whatever guidelines are put in place but if thats what it takes to continue the research then thats what well do Ultimately we are responsive to the public Its clear that Baric really really likes viruses Theyve fascinated him ever since a swimming scholarship took him to college and he got a job in a virology lab as an undergraduate His lifes work began there at a sink where he earned a couple of bucks an hour to clean the flasks and glassware I started as a dishwasher he recalls Im pretty good at it I can still do that He later learned that he was also good at working with viruses in the highcontainment biology lab a specialized skill that not everyone can master One of his coworkers   recalls that she always knew when Ralph was in that lab because shed hear disco You can see on the signin sheet whos in there but sometimes you can tell in advance based on the music she says If it was the Bee Gees I knew it was Ralph Baric says viruses can be dangerous but theyre also elegant Theyre a form of life thats so simple he says you actually have a shot at understanding how it all works And so viruses provide beautiful intricate probes that allow you to study that he says Theres a certain beauty in them
