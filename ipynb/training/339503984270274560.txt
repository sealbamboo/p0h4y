On a day like Memorial Day  clear skies comfortable temperatures day off from work  I would normally ride the subway to a corner of the city and do some exploring on the run But Monday was the first day of New Yorks   and I wasnt about to miss the unveiling of a new public transit system  So I decided to rent one of those new blue bicycles from the West Village in Manhattan and ride to BedfordStuyvesant in Brooklyn where the farthest bike share station from my home is located After returning the bike I planned to run back to Manhattan It would be a   at a decidedly nonrace pace Soon after   turned on its kiosks around  am I slid my blue plastic key into a slot at West th Street and Sixth Avenue and slowly removed a bicycle by lifting it just below the seat The key came in the mail when I signed up for an annual membership You slide it into a slot on the bike rack and thats what makes the bike removable Its actually a rectangle not a traditional key After adjusting my seat height and using the attached bungee cord to secure a bag holding my water bottle and running hat I started riding People immediately started chatting while I waited at red lights How is it so far Excellent Is the bike heavy I wouldnt climb the   on it but it actually feels like a normal bike Dont lose that thing theyll make you pay big How much does it    a year  a week  a day with extra fees beyond  minutes or  minutes for members The conversations and the knowing glances with fellow bikeshare riders were the type of interactions with strangers that only seem to occur during a power outage a transit strike or something worse Given the   to the program part of me was hoping to hear at least one negative comment but there were only good vibes and curiosity I got so caught up in the chitchat though that I missed my turn for the Williamsburg Bridge and ended up on the Manhattan instead No matter I switched into first gear the bike has three speeds for the climb and then cruised down into Brooklyn As I rode east along Park Avenue under the BrooklynQueens Expressway I noticed that I had used about  minutes of my minute maximum Rather than race the clock to BedStuy and risk becoming an early bikeshare casualty I stopped at a docking station I returned the bike to the rack and checked out another one which reset the clock and allowed me to sightsee at a more leisurely pace That was a wise decision because BedfordStuyvesant is not to be hurried I meandered through   marveling at the gorgeous brownstones rounded turrets and wellkept gardens in the cultural heart of AfricanAmerican Brooklyn At the corner of   I dropped off the bicycle finished my water and began my jog back to Manhattan For the first few minutes I was all too aware that I was jogging with a cellphone in one hand and a   in the other But after I made a left onto Hancock Street the lush tree cover and majestic architecture distracted me and it was never again a thought What I did notice was that suddenly nobody seemed interested in chatting with me anymore It was back to the   I turned right on Bedford Avenue then left on Gates Avenue I stopped for a moment to read a sign promoting the   contest judged by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden Thankful I didnt have to pick a winner out of all these gems I jogged on making rights and lefts until I found myself on DeKalb Avenue at the entrance to the   a private art college A security guard let me enter and I ran around randomly admiring the   and the   on display throughout a campus that Architecture Digest ranked in the   for architecture Exiting onto Willoughby Avenue and another postcardready stretch I ran east through the   neighborhood and into Fort Greene Park past one of about a dozen bikeshare stations I encountered on my jog home After running a bit around the park I climbed a hill to the visitors center which houses a public restroom along with an important history lesson Next to the center is the   a fittingly solemn stop on Memorial Day This foottall column marks the site of a crypt that houses the remains of  Americans who died of disease and starvation aboard British   during the Revolutionary War According to a   by Elizabeth Giddens they might have secured their release by joining the British forces yet all but a few refused I ran down a footwide granite staircase passing several exercisers who were climbing up and then families having picnics and exited the park I continued onto St Edwards Street and through a carfree stretch of public housing across Flatbush Avenue and onto the pedestrian side of the Manhattan Bridge path bicycles ride on the north side After a long climb up the bridge and some clear views of the Brooklyn Bridge and the downtown skyline I worked my way through Chinatown Little Italy and NoHo before cutting through Washington Square where a large crowd was watching a man play a grand piano while half a dozen dancers swirled around him I finished my run with a giddy endorphinfueled stretch down one of my favorite blocks in the city th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues After passing wroughtiron balconies and the former homes of   and   I stopped across the street from the   tower once a courthouse and now my public library branch Walking two blocks back to my apartment I passed the same bikeshare station where I began my journey that morning At the corner was a woman on a bicycle answering questions about her blue bike
