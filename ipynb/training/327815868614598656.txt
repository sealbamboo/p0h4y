The largest current study of an AIDS vaccine involving  people is being stopped After an oversight committee took a preliminary peek at the results this past Monday they concluded there was no way   would show that the vaccine prevents HIV infection Nor would the vaccine suppress the wily virus among people who get infected despite being vaccinated So they   on HVTN as the study is called It was a huge disappointment says study leader   who learned the bad news at  Monday afternoon Hammer tells Shots the blow was all the more crushing because just a month earlier the   had met its goal for participants It was a big traumatic event to put all this effort in and then have the vaccine trial stop because of futility a month after we completed enrollment Hammer says Hes chief of infectious diseases at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and a leading AIDS researcher whos been fighting the virus since the pandemics beginning Participants are being notified that no more shots will be given They will be followed for up to five more years to glean as much insight as possible from the  million federally financed project Its another swerve into the ditch for AIDS researchers on the long road to devise a vaccine that can prevent HIV infection or at least blunt it in a significant proportion of people at risk The only success so far has been in a   involving  volunteers in Thailand Published in late  it showed a reduction in the rate of HIV infection by only  percent  not enough to deploy as a public health weapon but a glimmer that encouraged researchers to think a protective vaccine is possible However the latest big hope was dashed by these numbers Among those in the justhalted study who got the vaccine  people got infected with HIV compared to  who got placebo shots That doesnt necessarily mean that the vaccine actually   peoples risk of HIV infection because the difference is not statistically significant But Hammer acknowledges that possibility Its clear evidence the vaccine didnt work and may in some fashion put them at greater risk  we dont know that he says The major message is they were not protected It may put the kibosh on the future use of an weakened cold virus called   that was used as a vector  a vehicle carrying selected HIV genes that was used as part of the complicated fourshot vaccine regimen The possible riskiness of using the Ad vector was raised by results of an earlier HIV vaccine trial called   back in  That study was halted prematurely because of evidence that those who got the vaccine had higher risk of HIV infection The designers of the big HVTN study hoped theyd avoided that problem by enrolling only people who had no evidence of prior exposure to the Ad cold virus They reasoned that antibodies directed at the cold virus could have interfered with its efficacy as a vaccine vector and somehow increased the risk of HIV infection Other earlyphased HIV vaccine trials are using the Ad vector Those will be reevaluated in light of the new findings Hammer says My own feeling is its curtains for the Ad vector Hammer says Even more ominous is the possibility is that its not the vector that may be increasing the risk but rather   vaccine component that stimulates immune cells to attack HIV Since thats precisely what vaccines are   to do that would be a catch and a serious setback for AIDS vaccine research But its too soon to jump to that conclusion Leading AIDS researchers were disappointed by the failure of HVTN  but not necessarily surprised given the history of previous attempts In a lot of ways were not much farther down the road than we were a number of years ago   of the University of California San Diego   MedPage Today We understand a lot more about how HIVinfected people respond to the virus Schooley says We dont know as much as we need to know about how to make uninfected people make the same kind of responses AVAC an   pushing the development of an HIV vaccine said this latest failure is a reminder of how challenging it is to develop an effective AIDS vaccine This trial has provided a clear swift answer about a specific vaccine strategy says Mitchell Warren of AVAC Its not the answer we hoped for but the search doesnt end here In fact the search will continue with a careful dissection of the data gathered by the latest study Hammer says researchers will look at whether some people who got the vaccine were protected and whether the vaccine produced the expected immune response Did it put pressure on the virus but then the virus escaped he wonders Weve got a bunch of things to do to figure this out To help with that task the researchers are going to be talking with all  volunteers in the hope they can be persuaded to be poked and prodded for at least another couple of years to follow their responses and their risk of HIV infection The researchers will also redouble their efforts to get study volunteers to avoid risky behaviors that could expose them to HIV given the clear evidence that the vaccine didnt protect them and could have increased their risk of infection Meanwhile this latest bad news will throw the field into another round of discussion about what to do next Hammer says What it will  do he says is reduce the drive to keep trying until scientists come up with a vaccine that gives us solid protection against multiple strains of HIV That will be a very joyous day he says
