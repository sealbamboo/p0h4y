A   at the University of Vienna tested subjects in Austria and Arizona and tracked their activity finding that that the only significant predicator of yawning was temperature subjects were much more likely to yawn at higher temperatures  Other factors like sex season age humidity time spent outside and hours of sleep the night before did not have a significant effect on the likelihood of a subjects yawning Ultimately it appears that yawning is related to regulating brain temperature and creating a state where arousal in a yawner can be achieved  The idea is that if its hot but still cool enough so that a large intake of air will bring your body temperature down youre in perfect storm territory for yawns
