Looking crisp and official in his khakicolored sheriffs department polo shirt Steve Steinhardt says Sheboygan Wis is a pretty good place to be a director of emergency services Nothing bad happens here he says knocking on wood Unless that is you count the tuberculosis outbreak that struck the orderly Midwestern city of  this spring and summer I never expected TB to be one of the bigger emergencies Id face when I got into this field Steinhardt says Sheboygan County officials have had to scramble to contain it At the height of the crisis the county activated its emergency operation center  a step usually reserved for major fires floods and tornadoes The county has had to borrow personnel from other jurisdictions calm parents of schoolchildren find housing to isolate infected families and appeal to the state for millions of dollars in extra money to deal with the situation Its a reminder that TB  a disease most Americans may view as a relic of the th century  is still an insidious threat that can pop up anywhere In its advanced stages tuberculosis can   lungs damage other organs and cause death The Sheboygan outbreak came to light on April  The first case was a woman at the center of a large closeknit family Health officials decline to identify the family but they say the people were part of an immigrant community a common theme in most current TB outbreaks in the US Sheboygan is home to sizable populations from Mexico and Southeast Asia where TB is common Asian immigrants make up half of Wisconsins recent TB cases Refugees among the Hmong people of Laos and Thailand have been among   Public health nurse Jean Beineman says the first case in the current outbreak is a middleaged mother who had suffered from TB for many months She had symptoms since at least last August  weight loss cough just feeling poorly Beinemann says By early May Sheboygan County health workers found active TB in three other family members spread over several households And others had symptoms and abnormal chest Xrays Ominously several were schoolchildren Once the families were identified we knew we had a tiger by its tail says Dale Hippensteel Sheboygan Countys public health manager But the   bad news was that the woman at the epidemics center had a TB strain resistant to at least two of the main drugs used to treat the infection Thats known as   or MDRTB Its especially hard to cure The antibiotics can cost around  for a single case Officials worried the MDR bacteria had spread to a lot of other people in town Epidemiologists predicted Sheboygan could end up with  symptomatic MDRTB cases and up to  people infected with the resistant strain but not yet showing symptoms Asymptomatic or latent TB isnt contagious But it has to be treated with antibiotics for six months to a year The kids in the family with active TB infections attended a Sheboygan high school and middle school One big priority was to see if they had transmitted the disease to their classmates We tested about  students and teachers who had very close contacts with the affected individuals Beinemann says The results of a second round of testing arent yet known More than three months after the outbreak first came to light there have been nine confirmed cases of active TB among five households Fortunately none of the other cases is as drugresistant as the first one Its not clear yet how many other people in Sheboygan will turn out to be infected Officials think it will be in the dozens That may not sound like such a big deal But treating TB infections of any kind is complex and laborintensive Every day without exception a nurse must watch each person take medication A lapse in treatment could cause them to develop a multidrugresistant strain Active TB has to be treated until its no longer contagious That can take up to a year Officials recently moved the woman with MDRTB into an apartment paid for by the county Keeping her and the others apart from everyone while theyre contagious requires continuous monitoring and education And the cost of all this is enormous When officials feared they faced a wider epidemic of highly resistant TB they projected it would cost the county  million to bring it under control In the end Sheboygan dodged that worstcase scenario But it had to persuade the governor and state legislature to appropriate around  million to deal with the situation Still Lorna Will Wisconsins TB control director says Sheboygan has avoided a much higher number of TB infections than it might have had Thats because we jumped on them and got them right away she says But across the nation the ability to jump on these outbreaks is eroding fast TB in the US is at an   with less than  cases each year But a   by the National TB Controllers Association shows  percent of states have cut their TB control budgets Many health workers say cases of TB are being missed and they cant investigate outbreaks the way they used to This reminds   of what happened in the early s Funding cuts in TB programs led to a resurgence of the disease We corrected that mistake and weve had great resultssays Chaisson who directs TB research at Johns Hopkins University Now were making that same mistake all over again which is declaring victory and withdrawing from the fight before the disease is controlled Overall TB rates wont go back to the  level Chaisson says But outbreaks like Sheboygans will start popping up more often  and stopping them will cost a lot more than keeping TB under control
