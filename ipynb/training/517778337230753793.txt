So there she has stayed along with her yearold son and two nephews in their s But it hasnt been easy Louise told CNNs Cooper by phone that she is checking her temperature every hour and based on that and everything else isnt sick She expressed frustration being confined nonetheless since people are only contagious with Ebola if they are symptomatic Duncans girlfriend has been frustrated in other ways as well She said no one brought food Thursday to four people who cant leave to get it themselves at least until later in the day There was also the matter of their power going out which was likely related to strong storms that rolled through the area Then of course theres the idea of living in a place that  just a few days ago  was home to an Ebola sufferer Her yearold daughter brought over Clorox to help clean the house and she sealed up Duncans dirty clothes and towels in a bag But authorities said we shouldnt throw anything away until they can get back with me Louise said That hadnt happened as of Thursday evening Men in trucks from Cleaning Guys a company that specializes in hazmat and biohazard cleaning services was turned away for lack of the necessary permit to transport hazardous waste on Texas highways it said  Once everything is cleaned up even if plenty of food arrives Louises ordeal is far from over First off theres the fact Duncan  who flew from Liberia to visit her and family members  is still in the hospital fighting a disease thats already killed thousands in West Africa And Louise her son and her nephews must wait  days from when Duncan first showed symptoms before they can leave the apartment Thats because Ebola can be in a person for that long before it manifests itself and someone starts to feel sick Reflecting on it all Louise said Thursday Im just hanging in there depending on God to save our lives If it were up to the Dallas County director of homeland security the four people quarantined shouldnt be stuck in the apartment at all Judge Clay Jenkins   of the countys Homeland Security and Emergency Management said officials are working on that relocation after Duncans partner told CNN of being forced to live with distressing living conditions Jenkins acknowledged some hygiene issues in the apartment I would like to see those people moved to better living conditions Jenkins told CNNs Jake Tapper on Thursday afternoon We are working on that I would like to move them five minutes ago Jenkins acknowledged problems with Louises apartment but defended the overall government response We have some hygiene issues that we are addressing in that apartment Jenkins said earlier in the day Those people in the apartment are part of Dallas County and theyre going to be treated with utmost respect and dignity in this unusual situation We are working to get the response which has been a good response strengthened every hour of the day the judge said Louise a caregiver sometimes refers to Duncan as her husband  even though theyre not legally married  CNNs Cooper said  When Duncan arrived in the United States on September  he didnt tell me that he came in contact with anybody with Ebola Louise said Nor was he showing any signs of the virus But things changed three days later when Duncan got a headache and a fever according to his partner On September  she took him to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where Louise said hospital staff were told twice that Duncan had come from Liberia But they did not ask him anything about Ebola including whether hed had contact with anyone with the disease in Africa according to Louise Duncan was taken by ambulance to the hospital on Sunday September  after Louises yearold daughter saw him shaking really hard and with a fever when she came by to give him tea Louise said she went to the hospital herself soon thereafter seeing Duncan through the glass  It was then that health officials first told her that medical officials first told her that her partner may have Ebola I was so scared Louise said So too is Peterson Wayne But Wayne doesnt want his yearold son who is the youngest person quarantined in the apartment of his mother Louise  to know that what hes feeling So every time they talk on the phone Wayne said he want just to encourage him not to frighten him I believe he knows everything said Wayne who is no longer with the boys mother but is still pulling for her Theres no need for me to just go and talk about Ebola  Wilfred Smallwood Duncans halfbrother said his yearold son is also among those quarantined in Louises apartment where he lived He said that Duncan had come to Texas to help his son and visit his family Asked about health authorities have handled the quarantine including the sweatstained sheets and lack of food Smallwood conceded that hes skeptical That worries me now yes Hes not alone  Dr Irwin Redlener a professor at Columbia Universitys school of public health called the handling of the quarantine hair raising If in fact there was a health worker there every day what exactly were they doing other than just taking her temperature and leaving Redlener said It should have been a whole lot more that Louse should be expecting Ebola only spreads through infected bodily fluids And its distinctly possible that no one around Duncan got exposed to his Louise said she didnt think she had Still CNNs Dr Sanjay Gupta said the continuing presence of the sheets on which Duncan may have transmitted the virus through sweating are disturbing Weve talked about the fact that this virus can live outside the body can live on surfaces Its unlikely for it to be transmitted to someone else that way Gupta said But why take a chance  Gupta said that it is hard to believe the oversight and there arent good explanations here One Ebola expert Dr Alexander   also said the federal response to the first Ebola case on US soil seemed troubling  So far we dont seem to reacting as well as we could he said
