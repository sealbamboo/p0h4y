A funding crisis and increased demand for care means general practice as patients know it in the UK is under severe threat of extinction the head of the Royal College of GPs has warned The royal colleges president Dr Maureen Baker said failing to properly fund GP surgeries could have an impact on the sustainability of the NHS  Some practices were already closing due to lack of staff she said The Department of Health said it recognised the vital job GPs do Health think tank the Kings Fund agreed that GP services were under increasing pressure but said talk of extinction was a huge exaggeration While general practice deals with  of patient contact it only receives  of the overall NHS budget the RCGP said Dr Baker urged governments in London Cardiff Edinburgh and Belfast to take action to address the huge and historic imbalance in funding  General practice as we know it is now under severe threat of extinction said Dr Baker It is imploding faster than people realise and patients are already bearing the brunt of the problem She said For generations GPs have been the bedrock of the NHS and provided excellent care for patients  But we can no longer guarantee a future for general practice as our patients know it rely on it  and love it GPs are doing all they can but we are being seriously crippled by a toxic mix of increasing workloads and everdwindling budgets which is leaving patients waiting too long for an appointment and not receiving the time or attention they need and that GPs want to give them Funding for GPs is vital to protect the future of the NHS as a whole Dr Baker said Cutting funding to the bone is a false economy  by investing in general practice we are shoring up the rest of the NHS from collapse she added  We are fiddling while Rome burns and the four governments of the UK must wake up to the critical state that general practice is now in If there is not sufficient funding in the  budget rounds the RCGP has grave concerns for the sustainability of the NHS according to its president   The royal college says that funding for general practice in England has fallen by m in real terms over the past three years In October it published a report saying that bn had been invested in  compared with bn in  which is the equivalent of bn in  prices And in November it   with the National Association for Patient Participation showing GP funding across the UK at a nineyear low Between  and  the proportion of the NHS budget spent on general practice had fallen from  to  in Scotland and from  to  in Wales it said In Northern Ireland the figure dropped from  in  to  in  Dr Baker told BBC Radio  live that while budgets had dwindled over the past three years demand for GP services was increasing  from  million consultations in  to  million in  She warned that in some areas we believe that some practices are already shutting down She welcomed government moves to train more medical staff but called for immediate action to shore up the service in the next few years until these new doctors nurses and support staff come on stream Prof Chris Ham chief executive of health think tank the Kings Fund said that factors such as the ageing population and the complex needs of patients were putting GP surgeries under pressure and he agreed their share of the NHS budget had fallen in recent years But he added Im not denying the real pressures and the lack of funding but its a massive leap from saying that to saying GPs face extinction He said some surgeries were finding ways to cope with the pressures including by offering more services by telephone and email An RCGP survey found that  of  people questioned thought the number of consultations carried out by GPs each day believed to be between  and  in most cases risks the standard of patient care they provide More than a quarter  said the last time they tried to book an appointment with their doctor they could not get one in the same week  Four in  were worried that the amount of time they have to wait to see their GP could affect their health The poll carried out by ComRes also showed that  of the public want funding moved to general practice from other parts of the health service  Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said it was simply unacceptable that some patients had to wait up to a week for a GP appointment He said this was putting pressure on hospital accident and emergency departments A DoH spokesperson said We recognise the vital job that GPs do  This is why we have cut GPs targets by more than a third to free up more time with patients and are dramatically increasing trainees so that GP numbers continue to grow faster than the population NHS England said its funding for GP services had increased by a third in real terms since  It said recent changes to the GP contract would free up doctors time by removing rigid performance targets
