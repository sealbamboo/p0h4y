We already know that cat memes and BuzzFeed lists spread around Facebook quicker than germs in a kindergarten classroom But can emotions go viral as well Perhaps researchers say When your Facebook friends post happy things online youre more likely to do so too according to a study published Wednesday And the same applies for negative posts If your friends are being grumpy online youre more likely to post something negative Researchers from the University of California San Diego analyzed millions of Facebook posts over the course of three years To gauge how moods traveled across social networks the researchers looked at the example of rain We were literally trying to answer the question If it rains on your friend in Los Angeles does it make you a little less happy in New York says James Fowler the lead researcher and a professor of medical genetics and political science at UCSD After controlling for things like the average weather in a Facebook users city the researchers found that a rainy day increased the number of negative posts that users published on Facebook by a little more than  percent Its a small change   tells Shots But the researchers also found that each sad status posted on a rainy day gave rise to another negative post by a friend living in a city that was dry Positive moods seemed even more contagious  each happy post typically yielded two additional happy posts by others The scientists detailed their   in the current issue of the journal   To measure how positive or negative the posts were the researchers used a word classification system called the   Rain seemed like a good variable because its essentially random  it tends to fall on happy and sad people in equal measure Most studies that show a correlation between social interaction and mood cant prove that one causes the other Fowler says Positive people for example might simply choose to associate with other positive people and grumpy people might befriend other grumpy people But this study he says found that even a single isolated rainy day could affect a persons mood  and that mood could be contagious online Of course the research only looked at how rain affected the general tenor of Facebook posts And the effect was fairly small Fowler says the next step is to look at how specific emotions spread across social networks He says its likely the study underestimates how emotion spreads online since a bit of bad weather isnt the worst that can happen But the takeaway here Fowler says is that social medias influence on mood isnt all bad despite studies that show young people can pick up   and that social media use can make us   You can   online as well Fowler says While its true that there are always people out there who might influence our mood we also have the capacity to influence other peoples mood Thats something to consider before posting your next rant about this winters horrid weather
