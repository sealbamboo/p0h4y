Traveling across Borneo I came across a most delicious vegetable Stirfried with red peppers shallots and egg in a thin juicy gravy sayur manis tasted both rich and nutritious like very good spinach But it had more complexity than spinach as though it had been fortified with broccoli and infused with asparagus The flavor itself wasnt so much novel as it was a recombination of familiar tastes in a new and exciting way Sayur manis has all the traits of a superfood Its packed with protein antioxidants and other nutrients like vitamin C vitamin E and a compound called lutein a key pigment in human retinas Its easy to grow at least in the tropics Its the kind of thing healthfood nuts would put in smoothies But sayur manis smoothies are a bad idea though it can be eaten raw doing so in even moderately large quantities has proven deadly Sayur manis is hardly alone in this   the same chemicals with health benefits might also do damage Despite years of research scientists still dont understand the toxicity mechanism Mohammed Rizman the proprietor of the restaurant where I first tried sayur manis explained to me that it also goes by Sabah veggie because its so popular in the Malaysian Borneo province of Sabah Though it grows wild he buys his from a wholesaler in Kundasang a town on the slopes of Mount Kinabalu the highest peak in Southeast Asia at about  feet When he served it to me at the night market in Kota Kinabalu Sabahs capital it tasted like the perfect food in the perfect place When I returned to the US I discovered that sayur manis has many more names To rule out any confusion your best bet may be the scientific     the Malaysian name simply means sweet vegetable According to Wendy Huttons   though wild varieties are eaten across the region commercial cultivation began in Sabah and only the cultivated varieties have edible stems which supply the asparagus taste Bee Yinn Low a Malaysian living in California who has developed recipes for companies like Betty Crocker and Red Boat fish sauce says that shes nostalgic for  another name for the vegetablefrom her childhood in Malaysia Even in Penang where she grew up she says it was the kind of delicacy prepared at home not usually in restaurants Low prizes it for its texture  more of a bite than spinach she says She occasionally gets some from a friend who grows it in California but theres never been enough demand for it to be commercially grown in the US But there might be another reason for its relative scarcity   can be deadly It can cause lung failure which is odd for something that you eat rather than smoke For reasons that remain somewhat murky in the late spring and early summer of  a   craze swept across southern Taiwan As a team of Taiwanese doctors  they were at first mystified by an epidemic of patients with respiratory problems who started showing up in their hospital that April Eventually they realized that their patients young and middleaged women were suffering from a rare syndrome in which the bronchioles  the smallest branches of the airway in the lungs  were compressed All the women had been drinking juice made from   leaves which they thought would help control their weight In that first   paper the doctors were unable to explain why the vegetable was causing lung problems Nearly  years later   a professor of food science at the University of WisconsinMadison says it remains a mystery Despite several efforts to isolate the compounds it seems we still dont have a good idea what compounds did cause that outbreak he says Of  patients accounted for in the Taiwanese diet fad eight   lung transplants and nine died The good news is that whatever causes the toxicity is inactivated by heat or cooking says Bolling So you can probably eat as much stirfry as you like and still be okay But the Taiwanese outbreak was not the end of it Another slew of wouldbe dieters   in Japan around  The obvious solution would be to abstain from the vegetable entirely But despite the documentation of   dangers  and the lack of understanding of exactly   it is dangerous  there are a variety of wellmeaning efforts to increase consumption A TaiwaneseIndonesian group is   hoping to improve growth and disease resistance in fish farms Other researchers in Indonesia are introducing raw leaves to both   and   and     Bolling told me is rich in   a drug used in the West to treat both high blood pressure and impotence in men No research group has yet he says succeeded in understanding how the chemicals in the plant are metabolized and reach the lungs This is part of the reason that there still isnt a good therapy for treating people suffering from   poisoning I tried to describe to Bolling as best I could what   tasted like Hearing you describe the taste he said it sounds to me like there might be unidentified compounds in the plant Whatever they are they taste great If you come across it eat it But do cook it first
