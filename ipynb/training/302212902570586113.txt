People who have a strong sweet tooth matched with a genetic sensitivity to bitter flavors may be at increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome according to research published in the   Differences in basic taste perception can affect food choices which may in turn influence risk of obesityrelated conditions like   The study conducted at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill analyzed taste preferences in  overweight adults The researchers used simple taste tests to identify sweetlikers as well as supertasters people with an extreme sensitivity to specific bitter compounds Both taste profiles are controlled in part by genetics Previous studies have found that bitter and sweet taster status can impact food preferences and body weight Individuals classified as both sweetlikers and supertasters were more likely to have metabolic syndrome than those who fell into one but not both of these categories Interestingly people identified as neither sweetlikers nor supertasters were also at increased risk Metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors that in combination increase risk for heart disease stroke and   To be diagnosed individuals must have at least three of five components large waist circumference equal to or greater than  inches for men or  inches for women elevated blood pressure equal to or greater than  mm Hg elevated triglycerides equal to or greater than  mgdl elevated fasting blood sugar level equal to or greater than  mgdl and low HDL or good cholesterol levels less than  mgdl in men or  mgdl in women Approximately one in three US adults meet the criteria for metabolic syndrome according to data from the National Health Statistics Report produced by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Older adults are more likely to have metabolic syndrome as are people who are overweight or physically inactive The relationship between taster status and metabolic syndrome is thought to be influenced by what people eat the researchers wrote in the study Taster status was associated with fiber consumption and calorie intake from beverages and although the exact relationship wasnt made clear in the study these dietrelated findings may help explain the link between taste sensitivity and blood pressure blood sugar and other features of metabolic syndrome Its possible that people with a high affinity for sweetness may sip more sugary drinks while bittersensitive supertasters might avoid certain fiberrich vegetables because of their strong taste the study authors theorize More research is needed to determine if these theories will help explain the relationship between bitter and   and disease risk Understanding the impact of bitter and sweet preferences on daily food choices may improve metabolicsyndrome prevention efforts according to the researchers Assessing genetic differences in taster preferences may be a useful strategy in the development of more tailored approaches to dietary interventions to prevent and treat metabolic syndrome
