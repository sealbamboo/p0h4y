For many women the risk of taking a small dose of aspirin a day may outweigh the benefits In a year study Dutch researchers randomized  healthy female health professionals average age  to take either  milligrams of aspirin every other day or a placebo on the same schedule The   Over all aspirin use was associated with a reduced risk for cardiovascular disease and   and in some women other cancers as well But in a majority of women  those under   the risk of   outweighed the benefit For women over  the risk of cardiovascular disease and   increases but so does the risk of bleeding Still the researchers conclude that for women over  the benefit of aspirin outweighs the risk Moreover using a formula that includes many health and behavioral factors collected in the study  age smoking     and more than two dozen others  the researchers will be able to create a personalized estimate of risk for a given patient There are good large studies of the risks and benefits of aspirin said a coauthor Dr Frank L J Visseren a professor of vascular medicine at the University Medical Center Utrecht But its difficult to apply a single trial average to all patients This makes better use of the wealth of information available in a trial
