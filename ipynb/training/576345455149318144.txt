The latest craze is the baobab  known as Africas superfood the sugarfree fruit is making its way into the mainstream thanks to its high levels of antioxidants calcium vitamin C and potassium But its not just the baobab For millennia the continents fertile lands have provided a bountiful supply of indigenous plants for food and medicine Harnessing years of shared knowledge passed down through the generations savvy foodies with an eye for business are now using local produce to create healthy dishes  and make a fortune in the process One of them is Yaganoma Baatuolkuu a Ghanaian entrepreneur whos using locallysourced ingredients packed with nutritional goodness such as hibiscus and tamarind to bring a new twist to her offerings  There is this new underground movement which was started by the art community explains Baatuolkuu whereby a lot of the artists are either going vegetarian vegan or looking for the way our grandparents used to eat Baatuolkuus startup called Wanjo Foods is built on the childhood memories of picking herbs and fruits with her grandmother who would dry boil and juice the leaves into their meals She recalls rarely falling ill Years later in  inspired by her grandmothers healthy cooking skills the enterprising Ghanaian started her company but halted production when she decided to pursue a Masters degree in Scotland Upon her return home in  constant requests from former clients propelled Baatuolkuu to revive her brand  I process some of these indigenous crops herbs and spices into something that we already know says Baatuolkuu who is constantly researching the medicinal properties of her ingredients and incorporating them into her recipes Im looking at these vegetables that we have one way of eating and I am reprocessing them into another way Baatuolkuu has found success supplying her line of healthconscious juices syrups and marinades to the hospitality industry  her biggest client she says is a local bar that has started incorporating her syrups in to cocktails  Looking ahead Baatuolkuu hopes to soon introduce other fruits and vegetables like the baobab to her line Rising in popularity African superfoods are not just staying inside the continents borders Shrewd business minds are taking them out of Africa and putting them in supermarkets across the world Across the North Atlantic former Peace Corps volunteer Lisa Curtis has established her business Kuli Kuli named after a popular Hausa snack  Several years ago while in Niger volunteering she began to suffer from the effects of malnutrition and soon learned firsthand about the medicinal properties of the local plant moringa Following her return to the US the plucky entrepreneur decided to set up a business to offer moringa products at home while providing a financial avenue for women back in West Africa  Meanwhile over in the UK Malcolm Riley a Zambiaborn chef is introducing his beloved homelands tastes and traditions to far flung foodies by bringing baobab to British shores In  he founded his line of Africaninspired health products The African Chef  Riley says The African Chef ethos stems from using fruits such as the baobab fruit  which has twice as many antioxidants as goji berries blueberries or pomegranates and it is a sustainable resource There is also moringa which is very rich in protein  about  antioxidants in it Its fantastic for helping malnourished children across Africa  And then youve got Shea butter which we are also trying to pioneer as an edible food And Im also trying to pioneer pumpkin leaves both cooked and dried where youve got very low sodium a good amount of iron and Bvitamins As well as offering up some of his countrys delicious products Rileys passion also extends to a desire to help people back in Zambia while trying to create something that had the potential to double their income Baobab is a phenomenal resource for the African continent he says  Its this wealth of food and the tantalizing tastes that prompted BritishGhanaian filmmaker Tuleka Prah to start documenting popular plates across the continent and offer them up to the world through her online series    Its a job most would dream of  eating your way across Africa The yearold food lover decided to embark on her selffunded culinary adventure after wanting to cook a dish her Ghanaian father used to serve up  kontomire a coco yam leafbased stew or soup  Looking online she was confronted with unappetizing lumps of green mush  I thought its a good thing I know what this tastes like she says I used to take a lot of photos of my food  like everybody does  but then I thought why dont I try and find a way to archive these recipes properly with good pictures to try and transport the flavor of the food to someone who doesnt know what it is but might want to try it  Starting in Ghana where she had family to stay with Prah then went to Kenya before traveling down to South Africa As she heads to each gastronomic destination she talks to local food enthusiasts searching for the most favored dishes which she then highlights through recipe videos she produces herself  While Prahs mission is to make beloved African dishes accessible to foodies around the world local market sellers also provide her with the products medicinal attributes which she confirms before adding them to her blog They are trying to sell it to me so they would say Do you know this is good for you or This vegetable is good if you have hypertension and this market seller is giving me health advice she laughs Then Id ask the host I was staying with or taxi driver more about it and follow up with research online  She adds The medicinal aspects are also more sort of passed down information through generations and then I try corroborate it with other research methods
