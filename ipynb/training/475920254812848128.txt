A Seattle familys summer camping trip barely escaped tragedy last year after their highly allergic yearold ate a mislabeled snack food that could have cost her her life  an alarming example of what food safety experts say are growing reports of undeclared allergens that can lead to potentially serious harm Isabelle Thomelin bit into what she thought were chocolatecovered banana pieces only to realize too late that they were actually chocolatecovered walnuts She comes racing back to the camp and shes saying I had a nut I had a nut said Toni Thomelin Isabelles mother recalling the July  scare Within minutes the girl diagnosed as a toddler with a severe tree nut allergy developed hives around her mouth and began having trouble breathing The family was camped at a rural site near Washington states Grand Coulee Dam miles from any hospital but her parents hustled Isabelle and her sister into the car and started racing toward the nearest emergency room It took us almost  minutes and spotty cell phone service recalled Toni Thomelin  a technology industry worker We were out of cell phone range and I was trying to call an ambulance The family had an EpiPen a shot of epinephrine that could reverse her symptoms but Isabelles own adrenaline began to kick in the car Thomelin said Five hours and a dose of steroids later Isabelle recovered but the memory still haunts the nowyearold girl It was a pretty traumatic event for her Toni Thomelin said She was eating something she thought was safe something shed eaten before It never dawned on us that something could be completely mispackaged In fact many foods that US consumers routinely buy have the potential to be mispackaged  and dangerous food safety experts say The most common food recalls in the US arent for salmonella listeria or other pathogens Instead theyre for eight undeclared allergens  milk egg peanuts soy fish crustacean shellfish wheat and tree nuts  that accidentally get into foods because of manufacturing errors No one keeps tabs on how many injuries or deaths have been caused by undeclared allergens but Food and Drug Administration researchers found dozens of reactions associated with recalls reported from  to   and  percent to  percent of such reactions are severe and can lead to death if untreated There have been nearly  such recalls so far this year including an announcement last week that Ocean Spray the top maker of dried cranberries is recalling because the snacks may contain peanuts instead This is one of our worst nightmares Toni Thomelin said Covered with yogurt never would we expect the inside to be a peanut For the up to  million people across the country who suffer from food allergies such mistakes can be lifethreatening said John L Lehr chief executive of the advocacy group Food Allergy Research and Education or FARE Undeclared allergens are definitely a source of concern because they can have serious consequences he said Every three minutes someone is being taken to the emergency room for a food allergy reaction And such recalls are growing government researchers say Between  and  there were  food recalls in the US including  for undeclared allergens or  percent When FDA officials checked again last year using the agencys Reportable Food Registry database undeclared allergens accounted for  percent of the recalls And those are the equivalent of Class I recalls the most dangerous type where there is a likelihood of serious adverse events for allergic consumers In the  to  study  of the allergen recalls resulted in reactions that affected  people Ten percent to  percent of such allergic reactions are severe or result in anaphylaxis a severe fullbody reaction that can lead to death within minutes if left untreated Alarmingly twothirds or more of these cases involved children FDA researchers wrote And those are only the reported reactions Theres no universal monitoring system for allergic reactions in the US and emergency department reports often fail to say whether such problems are caused by food said Steven Gendel the FDAs food allergen coordinator Consumers often think of peanuts as the top allergen perhaps because of growing discussion about topics like peanutfree lunch tables and  in schools  and because the number of allergic kids in the US between  and  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention But milk is actually the chief cause of reactions from undeclared allergens FDA researchers say Milk can make its way into many foods in many forms with disastrous results A trace amount of milk can lead to a very serious reaction Lehr said The only way to prevent allergic reactions is to avoid them entirely said Dr Stephen A Tilles an asthma and allergy specialist in Seattle And the only way to treat them is with a dose of epinephrine  a socalled EpiPen  which counteracts the allergen quickly Undeclared allergens pose a far smaller problem than outright mistakes  eating foods made with known triggers Still theyre dangerous Tilles said Especially in these families that have done a good job of avoiding allergens its easy to be caught off guard he said noting that he advises families to have an allergy emergency plan in place including practicing using the EpiPen The key to avoiding undeclared allergens is to understand that they occur  and to be looped into particular product recalls FARE reaches about  people through its  and others subscribe to recall notices offered by the   and the US Department of Agricultures   But those sources cover just a fraction of people who could potentially be exposed to hundreds of foods laced with undeclared allergens each year The risks that allergens pose in food was formally recognized in  when Congress passed the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act or FALCPA which requires product labels to declare if they include one of the Big Eight allergens But the law doesnt stop mistakes from happening said Steve L Taylor professor and codirector of the Food Allergy Research and Resource Program at the University of NebraskaLincoln The major reason for recalls is putting the wrong product in the box or container he said You make a mistake and you put the peanut butter granola bars in the oatmeal granola bar box That could be a pretty serious situation The FDA is bolstering existing rules with  under the new Food Safety Modernization Act or FSMA Often its the situation seen with the yogurtcoated Craisins which were produced by a separate copacker a bulk packager that doesnt actually make the foods according to Ocean Spray The products were packed by machines that failed to differentiate between yogurtcovered dried cranberries and yogurtcovered peanuts Companies frequently learn of the problem when a consumer alerts them  or reports a reaction Taylor said Three people complained about finding peanuts in the Ocean Spray snacks but there were no reports of allergic reactions a company spokeswoman said Large companies like Ocean Spray make headlines with allergen recalls but its the many small firms with problems that pose more of a threat Taylor added Theyre often less stringent about preventing contamination and when problems occur consumers are less likely to hear about them It was a copackers error that led to the chocolatecovered walnuts in Isabelle Thomelins treats Kristain Stone a spokeswoman for Tropical Valley Foods Inc the small Plattsburgh New York firm that made the Next by Nature Dark Chocolate Bananas that Isabelle ate told NBC News the firm switched to handpacking after the incident The banana products were recalled on May   but they were still on local store shelves two months later when the Thomelins stocked up on snacks for camp Getting recalled foods properly off the market is yet another problem food safety officials say It is very scary You feel very out of control Toni Thomelin said Now we avoid chocolatecovered anything of course You dont really know what youre biting into
