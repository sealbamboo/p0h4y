Friendly bacteria in the human gut can trigger a natural immune response against malaria say researchers They found that sugary proteins on the surface of some healthy gut bacteria train the immune system to fend off the malaria parasite Tests in the journal Cell showed the same sugary protein could be used in a vaccine to immunise mice against malaria It may explain why some people never catch malaria There is a vast community of bacteria living in the human gut that keeps us healthy A team of Portuguese researchers discovered that the Plasmodium parasite which can cause malaria when it enters the bloodstream through a mosquito bite has a sugary molecule on its surface that is also found on E coli that live in the gut Experiments in mice showed that natural antibodies triggered by the bacterial sugar also attached to a similar version on the malaria parasite It sets off an immune reaction which stops the parasite from entering the bloodstream halting the infection in its tracks Further investigation with researchers from the US and Mali found that in an area where the disease is endemic people with the lowest levels of those antibodies were most susceptible to catching malaria The researchers said the reason why young infants are more likely to contract malaria may be because they do not yet have sufficient levels of these circulating natural antibodies They now want to see if a vaccine containing the sugar known as alphagal would work in humans and particularly young children as it seems to do in mice It is estimated that  billion people are at risk of contracting malaria WHO data from  reveals that about  African children died from malaria before reaching their fifth birthday  Study leader Dr Miguel Soares said If we can vaccinate these young children against alphagal many lives might be saved Dr Alvaro AcostaSerrano a lecturer at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine said it was an exciting idea and his team are looking into the role of alphagal in protection against Leishmaniasis This may explain why some people are less susceptible to malaria he said
