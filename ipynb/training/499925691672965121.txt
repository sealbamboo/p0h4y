Since we spend a lot of our lives in our offices we thought understanding the impact of light was important said Ivy Cheung   published this summer in the   Cheung is a doctoral candidate working in  s laboratory at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine We already study circadian rhythm in sleep labs and find that  light is the most important synchronizing agent for the brain and the body Cheung and Zees most recent study found that workers who had a window in their office had a much better sense of health They examined the lives of  people   who worked in windowless offices and  who worked near windows These were people who worked a typical day shift Participants were not told about the objectives of the study so they wouldnt be overly aware of windows in their offices Exposure to natural light during the workweek tended to inspire people to exercise more Workers with a window were also better rested Those with windows got  more minutes of sleep a night on average and the ones without windows had more sleep disturbances   Without sleep people tend to suffer from all sorts of other problems that could hurt their performance at work such as   slower psychomotor reflexes   and    This lack of sleep could lead to more workplace accidents and errors Something as simple as daylight the study suggests may provide a profound way to improve office workers productivity and health as well as the safety of the community they work and live in In another recent study  researchers looked at the performance of nurses who worked long shifts during nonstandard hours The study was published in the latest issue of the journal Health Environments Research and Design  Researchers found that nurses who had access to natural light communicated better with their colleagues They laughed more at work They were nicer to their patients And even their own physical health was improved Those who saw daylight had significantly lower blood pressure Thats all in comparison with nurses who worked mostly in an environment with artificial light Letting natural light into a nurses station also improved nurses alertness In a job where they are dealing with life or death matters that impact can make a huge difference in patient care   These studies add to a growing body of evidence that suggest exposure to light and dark patterns is one of the most important aspects influencing a persons natural circadian rhythm These   affect everything from sleep and physical movement to mental wellbeing have looked at how daylight helps a persons overall psychological health and how students perform better in school if they see some daylight   Cheung who did the study involving office workers said she hopes architects will keep this research in mind when they design new office buildings But if you arent lucky enough to have a window in your office she said you can make up for it by finding other ways to let the sunshine in Get outdoors during the day Cheung said Take that phone call meeting outside or make sure your lunch break is outside Even that daylight exposure can help
