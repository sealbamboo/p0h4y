Greetings and welcome to another working week. Hopefully, the weekend was a relaxing respite because, once again, that familiar routine of deadlines and meetings and assorted task has resumed. To cope, yes, we are quaffing that mandatory cup of stimulation; our flavor today is Blueberry Cobbler, which also helps fortify us as we attempt to hustle one of the short people out the door to a summer program. Busy, busy, busy. We trust you can relate. Meanwhile, here are a few items of interest to get you going. Have a great day and do stay in touch…. Speaking of interesting, AbbVie is close to clinching a deal to buy Shire $53 billion, in what would be one of the largest so-called inversion deals through which U.S. companies are seeking a lower corporate tax burden; Mylan Laboratories has agreed to pay $5.3 billion to buy so-called established drugs from Abbott Laboratories, and China has confirmed for the first time that Shanghai prosecutors have indicted a U.K. man and his American wife and business partner for work carried out in connection with the GlaxoSmithKline bribery scandal.
