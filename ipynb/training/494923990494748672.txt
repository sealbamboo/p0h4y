Elizabeth Krusic a mother of two young children from Seal Beach California knows how difficult it can be to take a sick child to see a doctor When her daughter developed an eye infection she took a friends advice and tried Medicast calling a doctor into her home and saving the stress of getting her small children ready and out of the house The doctor arrived in  minutes and had the necessary prescription medication on hand My son was able to sleep during the entire visit because the doctor came to the house Krusic said  The doctor came into my daughters room and conducted the visit there where she was comfortable The house call also removed the risk that her children would be exposed to illnesses in a waiting room In early  Uber cofounder Oscar Salazar saw room for improvement in the health care system and seized the opportunity The app he developed   offers house call services for customers in Manhattan and starting next week Brooklyn Pagers doctors are available from  am to  pm  days a year with an additional afterhour fee for nights and weekends Toby Hervey Pagers head of marketing and business development said that several aspects of Uber informed Pagers approach Like Uber the app is structured as a mobile locationbased service Convenient access to quality health care when you need it is a real problem he said  Were using technology to make the house call  one of the best ways to get personal care  viable again Hervey said customers range from parents not wanting to take a sick child to an emergency room to businesspeople with no time to see a doctor during the day A similar company   started in South Florida in late  with services now also available in San Diego Orange County and Los Angeles  Long wait times are frustrating for everyone Sam Zebarjadi cofounder and CEO of Medicast said With the proliferation of technology and increasing levels of education we knew there were alternate ways to get amazing health care Dr Kimberly Henderson is a Pager physician and works in the emergency room at New Yorks Beth Israel Medical Center For her the idea of being a part of a new practice of medicine was appealing I believe we will see a shift away from medical practice exclusively in the brick and mortar model Henderson said  Medicine will become or return to being more mobile As the doctor shortage grows and patients struggle to balance their busy lives telemedicine has become a fastgrowing field Health care professionals offer their services using twoway video email smartphones and other forms of technology  Apps such as   and   allow patients to speak to a physician via phone or video chat  Doctors enrolled with the service   can receive text photo or video messages from their patients that can be forwarded to colleagues for referrals and are automatically saved to the patients medical file Another app   connects patients to  doctors across the country for verified answers to medical questions Patients can search the database or ask their own questions and receive responses from multiple doctors providing them with several opinions The American Medical Association says that telemedicine including house call services is useful for both patients and the health care industry as a whole according to its June Report on the Council of Medical Service Telemedicine a key innovation in support of health care delivery reform is being used in initiatives to improve access to care care coordination and quality as well as reduce the rate of growth in health care spending After a brief video conference a doctor will assess the patients need for a home visit If no visit is necessary or the physician recommends a trip to the emergency room theres no charge With this system were able to provide high quality care that goes beyond the issue at hand Zebarjadi said With the doctor visiting patients in their own homes its easy to make observations and discuss other health concerns and lifestyle choices I love the concept of bringing our services to peoples homes said Medicasts Dr Elisa Malin  Its a convenience factor both for the patients and for us as physicians in the sense that I can choose to be on call whenever Im available Malin also works as a pediatric hospitalist for Kaiser Permanente  She said that a typical house call visit lasts about  minutes as opposed to the average minute visit at a clinic The fact that I get the luxury of time with Medicast patients improves the quality of care they receive With both apps physicians follow up with the patient via phone and are available to answer any questions that may have come up since the visit Although the apps are only currently available for iPhone Pager and Medicast are actively working on an Android app For noniPhone users their services are also available by phone and on their websites They also have plans to move into other markets in the near future The house calls are comparable to an urgent care visit and cost much less than the emergency room where many people still go to seek treatment for minor ailments Both companies offer flat rates starting at  for a house call Customers can also sign up for a monthly plan that allows them two or four visits a year The companies arent able to accept insurance but are in talks with various providers to make that option available in the future House calls have their advantages such as privacy and convenience according to Dr Jane Orient executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons They also can save on office overhead for physicians But they do have limitations she said The doctors black bag wont have all the equipment available in the office she said  Both companies websites have long lists of conditions they treat such as cold and flu sprains eye infections pneumonia abdominal pain and cuts that require stitches But there are also conditions their doctors cannot handle You should call  or go to the emergency room if you are experiencing chest pain shortness of breath or have had a head injury and lost consciousness
