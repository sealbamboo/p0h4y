When it comes to reining in medical costs delivering more health care and bringing it right to the patients home can for a select group of patients save money These particular patients are elders struggling with multiple chronic medical conditions such as congestive heart failure stroke diabetes or dementia They make up just  percent of the people on Medicare but they account for about half of all Medicare spending In a   conducted by MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington DC  such patients were provided with homebased health care delivered by a team a physician a nurse practitioner licensed practical nurses and social workers The visits were frequent and there was someone on call for urgent situations  We prevent crises says Dr K Eric De Jonge the chief of geriatrics at MedStar Washington Hospital Center and the lead author of the study He says that having a doctor who has access to the patients electronic medical records on call at all times cuts down on having to call  and going to the emergency room which often ends up in a hospital admission In fact the study found that patients who received this homebased care had  percent fewer ER visits  percent fewer hospitalizations and  percent fewer stays in a nursing home than similar Medicare patients in the control group The death rate among these very vulnerable patients was high but was about the same for both the study group and the control group The bottom line In a twoyear period Medicare saved  for each patient getting homebased care MedStar Washington Hospital Center is one of  facilities nationwide participating in a Medicare demonstration project to gauge the impact of home health care on very frail patients De Jonge says for such a system to work on a larger scale Medicare would have to change the way it pays health care providers You have to start paying people for their results says De Jonge as opposed to the volume of how many things you do to the patient Then this program could really take off
