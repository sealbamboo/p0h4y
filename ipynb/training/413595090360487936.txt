The twoyear budget deal approved by the Senate on Wednesday is aimed at preventing another government shutdown It also includes a familiar annual rider  language to avert a steep pay cut to   But this time might be different with a fix that lasts After more than a decade of temporary solutions it appears Congress might be on the verge of permanently solving its persistent problem in the way it makes Medicare payments to doctors The problem was actually created by Congress itself back in  through a flawed formula called the   or SGR And every year since  when the formula first began calling for cuts the SGR has created political and fiscal fits for lawmakers The SGR has threatened to make draconian cuts to physician payments  cuts that could cause seniors to lose access to their doctors said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus DMont And every year Congress has had to spend more time and money to pass temporary fixes Indeed the socalled Medicare   unlike the Affordable Care Act is one of the few health issues that has enjoyed near unanimous bipartisan agreement Neither Republicans nor Democrats have had the stomach to allow cuts in pay that in recent years would have topped  percent Yet no matter which party has been in charge the annual  and sometimes monthly  exercise to cancel the cuts has been painful Since  weve had to patch the SGR  times at a total cost of  billion said Sen Orrin Hatch of Utah the Finance Committees ranking Republican The current patch cancels a scheduled  percent cut in doctor pay  at a cost of around   And thats just for three months But thats because this Congress thats now famous for doing almost nothing is poised to do something significant It appears ready to repeal the flawed payment formula and replace it with a whole new system  one that pays doctors according to the quality of results they produce rather than the quantity of services they provide Im optimistic were optimistic said   the president of the American Medical Association which has led the charge to fix the formula almost since its inception I think the prospects of repealing the SGR and replacing it with an appropriate payment mechanism are very good she said And members of Congress understand this and understand the need to move ahead Indeed all three committees in the House and Senate that oversee the Medicare program have now approved such legislation The House Energy and Commerce Committee approved a bill   and the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees followed suit   In the normally more partisan House of Representatives the votes on the bills were approved unanimously Still its not yet a done deal For one thing while physician groups are united in their opposition to the current payment system they dont all agree on the details of the bills that are emerging The bill approved by the Senate Finance Committee for example has drawn the opposition of the  One big problem is that the bill would freeze physician pay at its current level for the next decade To really  send the message to physicians that things are going to be frozen for  years doesnt seem like an appropriate policy issue said David Hoyt the groups executive director But even more troubling Hoyt said is that the bonuses some doctors could earn under the proposal for performing well would come at the expense of other doctors  even if those doctors perform well too It might reduce a physicians incentive to share best practices with others and to work toward improving care together Hoyt said And we dont think thats a good policy at a time when were trying to get more consistency in care Even if those issues can be worked out  and most people think they can be  theres another thorny issue involving how to pay the estimated  billion to  billion   The difference depends on whether fees are frozen over the next decade Most of the previous doc fee fixes  including the one in the budget bill passed Wednesday  have been paid for by cutting payments to other Medicare providers usually hospitals But Chip Kahn of the   said that while hospitals strongly support a permanent repeal of the SGR his industry is tired of being the piggy bank If that has to come from other providers where we see robbing Peter to pay Paul theyre just creating one problem trying to solve another Kahn said Kahn said the glitch in the way doctors are paid for treating Medicare patients is not a health care problem but a fiscal problem created by Congress when it devised the SGR and then refused to deal with the ongoing problem across a decade And if Congress insists on offsetting the cost they should do it without penalizing health care providers or Medicare patients he said Its Congress fault so why should providers who are trying to serve beneficiaries pay a price for it he asked Lawmakers will now have three months to figure that out  or else theyll have to pass a th fix for doc fees
