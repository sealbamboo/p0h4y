Sending special administrators into a troubled health trust cost almost £19.5m, a health watchdog has revealed.. Monitor, the government regulator, said its investigation into the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust "took longer and cost more than originally planned".. The original budget of £15.25m was exceeded after the timescale of the inquiry was extended twice.. A new trust took over running hospitals in the area in November last year.. The trust had to pay £3.55m to accountants Ernst and Young during the course of special administration because it "did not have the specialist staff required to carry out the work", Monitor said.. Dr David Bennett, its chief executive, said: "If nothing had been done the trust would have been £100m in debt by 2018.. "Our priority was securing safe and sustainable services for the people of Staffordshire, and while special administration took longer than expected it nevertheless led to substantial investment in local health services.". The regulator said it had brought forward the publication of the figures in response to a "pending parliamentary question". . A detailed breakdown of the costs, alongside a report setting out some of the lessons learned, would be published "in due course", Monitor said.. The University Hospitals of North Midlands trust now runs Stafford Hospital, renamed County Hospital, and City General, renamed as Royal Stoke University Hospital.
