As a child Elana Simon suffered for years from crippling stomach pain Yet despite trips to multiple specialists her pain remained a mystery Nothing seemed to be explaining why I was having these problems Elana told NBC News Ann Curry Then at age  Elanas bright future hit a terrifying hurdle when she was diagnosed with a rare form of liver cancer Her parents knew nothing would be the same The moment that I heard those three words fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma were life changing said her mother Rachael Migler What they didnt know was just how their lives would be changed  that Elana would not only recover from the cancer but embark on a journey of scientific discovery that would lead her as a New York high school student to make a discovery so cuttingedge it was published in a major science journal Research on Elanas type of cancer commonly known as fibrolamellar has been limited Experts estimate that roughly  cases are diagnosed annually in the US mostly among women under the age of  For many patients the prognosis is grim with about  percent surviving five years after being diagnosed In many cases symptoms dont appear until the cancer has already spread There was very little understanding theres still very little understanding of hepatocellular carcinoma across the board said Elanas surgeon Dr Michael LaQuaglia Chief of the Pediatric Surgical Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center But Elana Simon was born into a family of scientists and her instinct was to ask questions Her mother is a trained biologist and her father Sandy Simon an esteemed biophysicist at Manhattans Rockefeller University Ive been lucky in that I grew up with one of these scientists and so to me it seems completely normal to you know pursue a research question that you have she said Elana was doing research for a high school internship when she had the idea to genetically sequence fibrolamellar She realized that the quest to find a cancercausing mutation is incredibly complex especially since many mutations are often due to age alone I thought OK well if over time you keep getting more and more random mutations wouldnt you rather just study something thats younger but its gonna have less of these random background mutations Elana explained Elana approached her surgeon with the idea and asked him for help Together Elana and Dr LaQuaglia reached out to patients across the country for tumor samples Elana also worked with the   to put together an outreach YouTube video for other patients The video worked Weve had people contacting us and saying Hi I found your video online This is incredible What can I do to help How can I get you my tumor she told NBC News Fifteen patients sent fibrolamellar tumor samples as well as adjacent healthy tissue for the research The next step getting the samples to the New York Genome Center to sequence the DNA and look for differences between tumor tissue and healthy tissue What they found was remarkable A genetic mutation caused part of one gene to attach to part of another gene creating a unique protein called a chimera This chimera was present in all  tumor samples We found is theres one key that was broken in each of the  tumors and that key turns out to be something that nobody has ever seen before and is probably crucial in driving Elanas tumor said Dr Robert Darnell who headed the team at the   In this unusual collaboration with physicians geneticists and computational biologists the yearold coauthored a study   in February Darnell of the New York Genome Center characterized the finding as part of an emerging field of patientdriven science This was really a great example of a single patientdriven project he said It will help drive the science and I think even help drive the pharmaceutical companies to focus on a new kind of target that they havent thought about before There are other unsung heroes behind Elanas efforts The year after her surgery Elana met a boy named Tucker Davis at a charity event for fibrolamellar Davis had fibrolamellar and knew he was dying Elana remembers a conversation when he told her he felt he got the cancer because his parents have the money to help make a difference I kind of realized that thats probably why I got it too Not because we have the money but because you know my dads a scientist Elana said And I have the resources to potentially make a difference too Tucker died at  years old in  but before his death Tucker founded the Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundation dedicated to raising awareness funding research and establishing a community for this rare and deadly disease The foundation built a lab at Rockefeller University where   A plaque outside the lab bears Tuckers name Elana and her father say though their results are promising more research needs to be done to confirm that this chimera is responsible for fibrolamellar They have begun to make progress in the direction of better diagnostic test and even potential drug treatments to target fibrolamellar based on the discovery Im incredibly proud it kind of makes me think that the reason that this innocent  year old girl got this cancer was so that she would go on and do this work her mother Rachael said Elana also a talented actress dancer and acrobat plans to attend Harvard in the fall to study computer science She says she is grateful Its just incredible that the research that all started just because I had cancer could actually go potentially help other people Thats  thats amazing It makes me feel like you know it was so lucky Dr LaQuaglia Elanas surgeon says theres a bigger message to be taken from Elanas research The real tragedy in the present moment is the fact that research money from the federal government is getting cut he said We have such advanced biological and biomedical research techniques that we can do things like this very quickly and I think we can impact not only this disease but other diseases Elana sees hope for other cancers too She says this collaborative effort could serve as a model for other cancer groups It can be the patients who themselves can try to make a difference in their research she says
