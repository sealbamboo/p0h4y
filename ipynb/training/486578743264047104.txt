Guinea worm is about as close to a reallife   event as you can get  a parasitic worm mates inside a persons abdomen grows up to  feet long and then exits painfully from a blister But the worms final chapter is near The world is closer than ever to wiping the parasite off the face of the Earth There were only  cases of Guinea worm in the first five months of this year the Carter Center   Monday Thats a  percent reduction from this time last year when  people reported infections Back in the mids more than  million people were catching the parasite each year Then an international campaign started slashing cases year after year We anticipate well end  with less than  cases says   who leads the Guinea worm eradication effort at the Carter Center The data speak for themselves Great strides have been made against Guinea worm Now Guinea worm has been eradicated in  of the  countries where it ever existed And the worm has cropped up in only two countries this year South Sudan and Chad Most of us arent familiar with   Its never existed in the Western Hemisphere But once you hear how it   people you probably wont forget it The parasite lives in tiny fleas swimming in fresh drinking water When someone accidentally swallows a flea the worms larvae are released inside the persons stomach The larvae mate and mature inside the abdomen Then about a year later a painful blister appears on the persons skin often on a leg or a foot A long worm slowly emerges from a hole The worm doesnt usually kill you But its exit is debilitating and excruciatingly painful To remove the worm a health worker winds it around a small stick and manually pulls it out of the skin over the course of a few weeks During the process a person usually cant go to work or school The disease is also known as dracunculiasis or affliction with little dragons because the worm feels like tiny hot daggers poking through skin This burning sensation makes a person want to dip the blister into cool water such as a lake or river Then the worm releases a fresh batch of larvae into the water And the infection process starts all over again There is no cure or vaccine for Guinea worm So the Carter Center together with local health agencies has focused on stopping the parasites spread They teach people to filter water and they dig wells for clean drinking water When health workers hear about an emerging infection they rush to the village to make sure the person doesnt infect local water sources The health workers also kill water fleas with insecticide in potentially contaminated lakes or rivers Guinea worm requires humans to complete its life cycle So once the parasite is wiped out of people it will be extinct The challenge now RuizTiben says is finding the last few and farflung cases before a person spreads the worm These cases are in very remote parts of the world he says We have a monetary award set up A person can get  if they have information about infections or if theyre infected themselves So that helps with surveillance and awareness Twelve of the  Guinea worm cases this year have occurred in one small pocket of   South Sudan Luckily RuizTiben says this region is far away from the recent   in the young country So health workers have been able to continue treating cases there despite the civil war So when will Guinea worm be gone for good Its conceivable that we could have zero cases in  RuizTiben says But if I was a betting man I would say that we have a  to  percent chance of getting to zero there in  Our chances the following year are much higher
