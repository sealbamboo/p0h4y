The current craze for cocktails includes many drinks that feature raw egg Is drinking one dangerous In drinks like a Pisco Sour cocktail makers use the white of an egg to give the drink a foamy head You can also find it in a Pink Lady Ramos Gin Fizz or Clover Club  But theres been years of concern over the presence of salmonella bacteria in eggs  Infection causes diarrhoea abdominal pain and cramps headache nausea vomiting and fever Young people the elderly pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems are most susceptible But the prevalence of salmonella in eggs has fallen considerably on both sides of the Atlantic  In the UK Kevin Coles of the British Egg Information Service says there is never a castiron guarantee of safety when it comes to raw eggs in food or drink but points to the industrys red lion mark  Any egg can contain salmonella but it is more or less a thing of the past in the UK Eggs with the red lion mark have all come from chickens vaccinated against salmonella Most supermarkets only sell red lion eggs but bars and restaurants can buy eggs from wherever they want  there are no legal requirements And the Food Standards Agency doesnt advise against people consuming raw eggs if they so wish  However for vulnerable groups including the elderly we suggest they should avoid consumption of rawlightly cooked eggs because of the risk of salmonella says the agency  Many cocktail books would offer the same advice regarding raw egg use And there are plenty of cocktail mixologists who choose not to use them Alessandro Palazzi head barman at the Dukes Bar in London says there is no need to use eggs in cocktails at all Palazzi avoids them even with classic concoctions  Raw eggs were used in the old days to make classics like the whisky sour but a lot of people dont use them now including us Its a lazy thing to do  like a chef adding flour to a sauce to make it thicker  He says a good barman can create classic cocktails without using eggs at all  The only difference is the longevity of the froth If you know how to shake a cocktail properly and use the right ingredients you can create the same effect In the old days bar staff used more basic ingredients They make drinks slimy and too thick I think some people use them to hide the taste of cheap bad ingredients  And he doesnt approve of the raw egg substitutes that some bars use The smell is awful I tried it only once then threw it away But eggs have always been a part of cocktails argues Dale DeGroff founder and president of The Museum of the American Cocktail  Many might think that cocktails were an American invention but DeGroff explains that the roots are in fact in the UK Many of those recipes originated from tavern fare in England  flips nogs and possets Theyre traditional drinks composed of warm spiced ale with sugar spirit and eggs  DeGroff questions the logic of health fears over raw eggs in drinks when they are frequently used in food Shall we do away with eggs Benedict because the hollandaise sauce is prepared without cooking It is a silly controversy created by nanny states   But its impossible to guarantee the safety of any drink containing raw egg  The popular belief that either the alcohol or lemon or lime juice in a cocktail would instantly kill salmonella bacteria is not quite true argues Dr Paul Wigley from the University of Liverpools Institute of Infection and Global Health It is much harder to eliminate the risk of salmonella with alcohol because of the high protein content in eggs You would need a very strong cocktail and you would need to mix the cocktail and leave it to rest for a very long time Lemon and lime juice would be more effective but you would need to use a lot and leave it to sit for a very long time for there to be any reduction whatsoever The best way to avoid the risk of salmonella in drinks is not to use raw eggs at all Thats a position many riskaverse drinkers will take whatever the cocktail traditionalists say
