Violent crime is continuing a longterm fall in England and Wales according to annual figures from NHS hospitals There was a  fall in injuries from violent incidents in  according to data from almost a third of emergency departments examined by Cardiff University It found  people were treated following a violent attack in    fewer than in the previous year  The authors said the rising cost of alcohol might have played a role They also said the figures mirrored other research adding to evidence that the longterm trend in violent crime was down  The  fall means it is the fifth consecutive year that NHS units have recorded a decrease in violent injuries  Professor Jonathan Shepherd the reports lead author said The data shows another significant yearonyear fall Apart from a  increase in  levels of serious violence have fallen every year since  Continuing substantial decreases in serious violence are welcome for citizens communities and in combating the fear of crime  They also decrease the costs of violence to health services and the criminal justice system and reduce pressures on hardpressed Accident and Emergencies late at night at the weekend Men between  and  years old remained the most at risk of being a victim  but the report also found that the greatest annual decreases occurred among youth and young adult victims  Prof Shepherd said Violence is falling in many Western countries and we dont know all the reasons why  Binge drinking has become less frequent and the proportion of youth who dont drink alcohol at all has risen sharply  Also after decades in which alcohol has become more affordable since  it has become less affordable  For people most prone to involvement in violence those aged  falls in disposable income are probably an important factor The authors said that antiviolence strategies involving local public agencies working closely together could also be yielding results  The Cardiff University study looked at treatment given to victims at  emergency departments minor injury units and NHS walkin centres  Responding to the report UK Faculty of Public Health president Prof John Ashton called for an increase in the price of alcohol We do periodically have these crazy periods where theres a lot of drinking  like Hogarths Gin Lane  years ago  and society eventually responds and drinks less he told BBC Radio  live And whats important is to get behind the history curves that are happening and give them a push in the right direction I think raising the price of alcohol would be giving a push to bring down the consumption levels further The trend mirrors the findings published in the Crime Survey of England and Wales a massive rolling project that interviews people about their experiences of crime whether or not they have gone to the police  Crimes recorded by the police also show longterm falls in violence but the Office for National Statistics recently said that data from forces could not be considered reliable  There is no comparable data for injuries from violent incidents in Northern Ireland or Scotland However   on recorded crime trends published last July found that violent crime figures had remained fairly constant since  There had been a small decrease from  incidents in  to  in  the report added  published last month showed there had been a  drop in recorded incidents of violent crime since  In a separate report published on Wednesday a watchdog urged probation services to do more to tackle alcohol misuse by offenders  Paul McDowell Chief Inspector of Probation said that good work in rehabilitating offenders in the UK was being let down by a lack of attention to alcohol despite its known link to violence
