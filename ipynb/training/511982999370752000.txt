Pediatricians chart childrens growth at every visit tracking how they conform to ageappropriate standards What if standard measures of aging were similarly available Warren Sanderson a professor of social and behavioral sciences at Stony Brook University is working on ways to define aging other than the passing of years With colleagues at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg Austria he recently published a study showing that the strength of   in people with varying levels of education The conversation below has been condensed and edited for space and clarity  Your work over the past several years suggests that the conventional definition of old age  as beginning at age     Why   Life expectancy has changed Disability rates have changed Health status has changed Everything is changing about yearolds Theyre not the same as they were in  or as they will be in  Still conventional measures used across the world treat everyone as becoming old starting at age  That distorts our view of aging and public policies related to aging   How should we think about the onset of older age   We should consider people as old when they near the end of their life when their remaining life expectancy is  years or less Lets take two yearolds Say one has a remaining life expectancy of five years One has a remaining life expectancy of  years  Which one is aging faster   We would say the first one because shes so much closer to the end of her life The second one is still far from the end of her life Shes effectively younger  What would this mean in the United States     In  if you used our definition men would start being classified as old when they reached the age of  years old and women when they reached the age of  years old      Youve proposed what you call a   to evaluating aging What does this entail  We think age has much more to do with how people function than how many birthdays theyve had so measuring function is the crucial thing Our research agenda calls for looking at different measures of functioning because aging is multidimensional We started with handgrip strength a measure of upperbody strength  Why did you begin there   Handgrip strength is   of future rates of mortality and morbidity or sickness Its been measured for individuals in surveys across the world We now have comparable data on about  people from the US many European countries Japan South Korea China A substantial body of research suggests that this can be used as a reliable predictor of aging   Tell me about the study you just published    We know there are important differences in the US in life expectancy among groups with different levels of education  We decided to compare men and women with low education  those who never graduated from high school  with those with higher education   We wanted to compare them in terms of how rapidly they were aging based on their hand grips   What did you find   A yearold white woman with low education had the same handgrip strength as a yearold white woman with more education The woman with low education had an age disadvantage of about  years She was more like an old person than the woman with higher education For a yearold white man the difference was  years For AfricanAmerican women the more educated women had a year advantage For AfricanAmerican men there was no difference between people with low and higher education We dont understand that finding but we think its interesting and something we need to follow up on   What are the implications  Measuring handgrip strength is very simple and cheap  We think every primary care doctor should have a dynamometer in their office At every visit the doctor could check grip strength for older patients If someone was in the th percentile for their age and the measurements were stable great  But if that person suddenly dropped to the th percentile then thats a sign that the doctor should look seriously at what might be going on We view this in a larger context  There are going to be more measures than this one  We want to look next at measures of lowerbody strength  It may very well be a measure that looks at how long it takes someone to rise from a chair  Then we will have an upperbody measure and a lowerbody measure and we can compare the two in terms of how aging goes  We envision one day that physicians will have standard agerelated tables for these measures and chart their patients progress just as they do with height and weight for children
