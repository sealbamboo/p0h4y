Circle Montana  There is no part of life in McCone County Montana where the communitys age has not begun to show Farmers have gone gray There were some dozen funerals last winter Each year makes more widows Nearly  percent of McCone Countys  residents are already over  a bellwether for changes that will soon roll across Montana State projections show a quarter of Montanans will be seniors by  twenty years before the same demographic shift hits the nation as a whole Montana policymakers have watched that shift coming toward them knowing it brings more older potentially sicker patients to a largely rural medical system in which providers and specialists are already scarce Seniors here often travel an hour or more for emergency care and nursing home beds are dwindling particularly in the sparsest areas In the face of these changes Charlie Rehbein head of the Montana Office on Aging asks How do we provide services to them Hes thinking about people like Gloria Busse Since her husband passed away nearly  years ago she has lived alone in her spotless onestory house on the edge of Circle the person town that is the seat of McCone County Her children relocated hundred of miles away across this vast state years ago But Busse now  stayed This is my home she said Stretched in a plush recliner in her living room Busse says that McCone will be okay because people here have long known how to make do Weve always lived in isolation said Busse waving a rednailed hand From the beginning of time the pioneers helped each other This is just a natural thing Some  percent of older people want to age in place according to surveys by the AARP Whether in their longtime house or assisted living in the same area most want to live out their last days in the community where they spent their best Figuring out how to help them do that is not a problem exclusive to Montana As the US population ages the demand for care and the cost of providing it are expected rise nationwide But the countrys  frontier counties of fewer than  people per square mile face particular challenges The first is distance Circle is  miles from the next incorporated town Its onebed emergency room is  miles from the next hospital and  miles from the nearest fully equipped hospital with specialists in Billings Patients can be rushed by ambulance or plane when time is crucial But thats expensive and doesnt offer a solution to helping older people with the more quotidian things that keep people well How do they get to the doctor Rehbein asked Are there people within that community that can be trained up to work with older people or are they even willing to do this work Like many rural counties throughout the country McCone is growing older by attrition Fewer are born there Those who are often leave and dont return Those who remain grow older That includes the people who provide the care Nearly  percent of Montanas physicians are age  or over About  percent of its registered nurses have hit  So Montanas seniors need more help  up to  times more health care services than younger peoplebut the pool of younger workers to care for them is shrinking While this demographic shift was seen a long way down the road there has been little concentrated effort to grapple with these issues at a national level said Professor Andrew Coburn of the Maine Rural Health Research Center at the University of Southern Maine Aging is the kind of thing most of us dont like to think about so there hasnt been a lot of policy innovation that has been widely embraced said Coburn Yet failing to create smart policy around aging could have major implications across the country he said Its most acute in the parts of the Northeast and Mountain West that are simultaneously aging and shrinking Experts in rural health believe the answers start in the communities themselves For decades now Montana has been searching for ways to keep care accessible It was one of the first states to create a Medicaid waiver program in the s Waivers allow people who need longterm care to use Medicaid funds to be cared for in their community often by family or friends rather than in an institution It was also one of the first to roll out the model of small limitedservice rural hospitals now known as Critical Access Hospitals These have also begun to provide longterm care in areas that have a shortage of nursing home beds But Montana needs more The number of nursing home beds in the state dropped from nearly  in  to fewer than  in  because of regulations that made it harder to keep these homes as part of a hospital Home health care has dwindled too from  agencies in  to just  in  because of payment methods that require a minimum volume to remain viable  one Montana couldnt meet This comes even as the states Plan On Aging identified home care and communitybased services as some of the key areas the state should grow in order to meet the needs of the aging tsunami Patti Schipman runs the McCone County Community and Senior Center out of a storefront on Main Street in Circle There is no inhome care program in the county so as people grow older Schipman often reaches out to offer help I cant have someone there all the time but I can make sure someone stops by every day she said On a windy afternoon in late spring Busse the yearold widow had just said goodbye to Sharon Jensen a public health worker who stops by weekly to check her blood pressure A homemaker also arrives regularly to help Busse around the house Still spry Busse on Fridays drives down to the Senior Center for the weekly midday dinner subsidized for seniors and Mondays she might stop by again to join the regulars for Pinochle I feel like I have assisted living she said Everyone in town helps me That was true even last spring when Busse fell while pulling weeds in her yard Her arm was broken and she couldnt get up so she lay on the grass out front until a group of young women walked by One picked her up and took her to the McCone County Health Center which told her she would have to go two more hours down the highway to Miles City to get the arm seen The town has no public transport and because it was no longer an emergency Busses ambulance trip would probably not have been covered She turned to the young woman who had found her on the lawn I asked her Will you take me And she did Busse said This is being in a small town in Montana And therein lies the rub While Circle sits far from many health care services its a good place to age Old ranchers and farmers drive into town for coffee and gossip once sometimes twice a day If a regular lady does not show up at the Friday senior lunch or a man for his afternoon drink people notice Here in the places that feed the country where wheat and cattle are raised up and sent to markets East and West ties still bind The pioneer spirit has made many in these communities uninclined to demand government resources yet figuring out policies to help to keep these people and these places healthy is an issue of fairness said Brad Gibbens deputy director of the Center For Rural Health at the University of North Dakota Were all Americans Were all citizens We all have certain rights and expectations of the availability and quality of our education housing and health care systems McCone takes care of its own but even Busse knows that should she need more help she might not be able to stay And while she approaches this subject with the same straight spine as everything else  she is after all Montanan  that would change everything Ive never lived anywhere but in McCone County she said
