A large new study found that one of the oldest and most commonly used heart medications may shorten the lives of patients with atrial fibrillation a common type of irregular heartbeat that afflicts about three million Americans The findings are prompting some experts to warn that the drug should be prescribed less widely The drug digoxin is used every day by millions of mostly older patients including many with atrial fibrillation or Afib It is also prescribed for heart failure Digoxin can help slow an abnormal heart rhythm and strengthen the hearts contractions But the line between an effective dose and a toxic one is especially thin and in recent years a growing body of research has called the drugs safety into question The research published in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology suggests that doctors need to be particularly cautious about prescribing digoxin as a treatment for atrial fibrillation which causes some of the deadliest and most debilitating strokes The researchers followed more than  people with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation and found that those prescribed digoxin were  percent more likely to die over the next several years than those who received other treatments I dont want to say that every patient should come off this drug and every doctor should stop using it said Dr Mintu Turakhia an assistant professor of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford and an author of the study But this data should make us take pause and really evaluate whether we should be using this drug as much as we do Digoxin is derived from digitalis an extract of the foxglove plant that was first described in medical literature by a British doctor in the s who reported its use an herbal remedy for congestive heart failure The drug is considered such a standard heart medication that the World Health Organization includes it on its list of essential medicines About  million prescriptions for digoxin were dispensed in the United States in  according to the most recent data available from IMS a health care information and technology company Despite its long use in medicine  or perhaps as a result some say  relatively few studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of the drug as a treatment for atrial fibrillation The research has been limited and in some cases conflicting Two studies published in the same journal last year analyzed a single set of data on the use of digoxin in about  atrial fibrillation patients and came to differing conclusions One reported that the drug   and the other   of greater mortality or hospitalization Unlike many prescription drugs digoxin has never been subjected to a rigorous clinical trial in which the drug is compared with a placebo And because it is sold generically experts say there is little incentive for companies to fund such a venture We would all love to see an actual clinical trial said Dr Matthew Reynolds a cardiologist and a researcher at the Harvard Clinical Research Institute in Boston who was not involved in the new study But theres a big hurdle to getting that done which is money No one really stands to make a big profit from investing in such a trial The latest study was not a randomized controlled trial but it was the largest to date drawing on a sample size  times larger than any previous study of the subject Dr Reynolds said For the study researchers followed roughly  mostly older patients at Veterans Affairs hospitals across the country from  to  A large percentage of these patients  nearly one in four  were prescribed digoxin to help control their atrial fibrillation Over all regardless of their age or whether they used other drugs those prescribed digoxin had a  percent increase in mortality One possibility the researchers considered was that doctors might be more likely to prescribe digoxin to patients who are frail or more vulnerable to begin with But that would not have accounted for the large increase in mortality  Dr Turakhia said Because of the potential issues with digoxin and the fact that there are several alternatives  like beta blockers and calcium channel blockers  doctors should prescribe digoxin to atrial fibrillation patients only when there is a very good reason for doing so Dr Turakhia said We have so many other options for the management of atrial fibrillation that are safe and effective he said We dont need to be tied to this old drug Cardiologists are less likely to prescribe digoxin than geriatricians and general practitioners many of whom may not be aware of the questions surrounding its safety said Mellanie True Hills the founder of   a nonprofit patient education group The atrial fibrillation patient community knows that digoxin is not a particularly good drug to be on she said But so often it seems like its one of the first drugs that doctors prescribe She and her group have long issued cautions about the drug and the new research confirms their concerns she said I think the key message is that if patients are on digoxin they need to be asking questions as to why she added A lot of it is probably because their general practitioner doesnt know the impact this drug has on patients
