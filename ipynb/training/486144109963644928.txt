Hello, everyone, nice to see you again. We hope the long weekend was relaxing and fun. Those extended breaks are enjoyable, yes? Now, though, the time has come to resume the usual routine of meetings and deadlines and what-not. And not surprisingly, there is much to be done. After all, there is a reason it is called work. How to cope? Please join us for an invigorating cup of stimulation. Our flavor this morning is Southern Pecan, for those who care to dabble. Meanwhile, here are some tidbits. Hope your day goes well and do stay in touch…. For the first time, a new type of cancer treatment that is generating considerable excitement among physicians and investors has received regulatory approval. The so-called checkpoint inhibitor from Ono Pharmaceutical and Bristol-Myers Squibb was approved in Japan. And a study of 24,000 Medicare patients found testosterone therapy did not increase the risk of heart attacks, contrary to several earlier studies. The findings are a boost for proponents of testosterone therapy, but still are unlikely to settle long-standing debate over testosterone safety.
