 Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., having so far been spurned by takeover target Allergan Inc., raised its offer to buy the Botox maker to $49.4 billion and sold the rights to some of its skin-care products in an attempt to smooth the antitrust review process if its unsolicited takeover bid is successful.. Valeant Chairman and CEO J. Michael Pearson also hinted at a possible increased offerâ€”but not until Allergan officials agreed to sit down and negotiate.
