Every time I sign a consent form I wonder how informed I really am Do physicians    physicians convey the consequences of their treatments to cancer patients Or is this where artists step in    A few years before the Canadian painter Robert Pope died in  he dealt with an aggressive form of Hodgkins disease by undergoing a succession of standard treatments and by creating evocative canvases about the fraught experiences of cancer patients Social realism meets surrealism in large paintings that portray the loneliness of sick men and women within the sterility of contemporary hospitals Popes works reproduced in the book Illness  Healing  ask us to think about blood sacrifice about patients as well as caretakers reenacting archaic fearful rituals in technologically advanced settings   Take for example his painting Radiation in which a man lies alone on a narrow plank beneath a huge machine directing rays at his abdomen The artist explains that the red lasers which are used for positioning suggest a Christian cross the table the man lies on is like an altar he is covered with a white shroud the machine hovers above him like an idol or faceless god that must be propitiated with bodily sacrifices Holding still in a black void the marked man is caught in the beamed crosshairs He has to expose himself to a dreaded otherness that he cannot possibly understand and that all others flee Will its invisible powers heal or harm him   In another painting Chemotherapy a turbaned woman lying on her side pulls up a sheet to cover herself Beneath her in the foreground a disproportionately large syringe of Adriamycin looms The chemical is red like lifegiving blood and the Red Cross but also like an alarming stop sign or the inferno of its red devil nickname The knot on her turban parallels the knot of her clenched knuckles all imbued with the purple pigment called caput mortuum which looks like dried blood and means dead head Does the patient shrink from a drug that will debilitate her or accept its curative capacities     Such ambiguous images address the isolation of treatment In paintings that include other figures the perspective generally remains that of the patient in the hospital bed  again prone but sometimes without a head For we view the scene from the patients perspective as if we were he From his vantage whitecoated physicians tower over him as do most visitors In a selfportrait with Robert Popes doctor the physical intimacy of the standing physician with the seated patient is meant to convey the relationship between priest and layperson Next to a bedside picture of Jesus in another work Mr Pope draws a tray of syringes to suggest that faith in science has replaced faith in religion   Even when the artists figures are upright and vertical and entwined they are riven on the stake In the sixfoot high Hug the clasping patient and caregiver are divided  here by the IV rod that sunders the couple like a dagger in the artists words Although the man and woman encircle each other in their embrace they are cleaved by the cross of the IV pole holding high its bag of solutions The intravenous tubes undulating around the pole form the spiral figure of infinity although in some drafts the tubes look serpentine Will the loving couple be destroyed by venomous toxins or sustained in the continuum of life and death In the cancer dance patient and caregiver remain indistinguishable since both are entangled in the paraphernalia of treatment     Though we accept ambiguity in art it is harder to accept in science harder still in medicine Robert Popes work reminds us that often patients and caregivers cannot fathom what we sign up for Even when physicians try to communicate the consequences of their prescriptions patients need to make a leap of faith   Mr Popes paintings make me wonder Is cancer treatment a form of religion a means of transformation that involves its own rituals trials high priests sacraments vestments and bodily signs for people in need of a miracle and convinced that we have to be stripped of everything before we can be reborn   In   a memoir about his sons death from metastatic melanoma the theologian Richard Lischer writes The religion of cancer treatment holds out the carrot of survival It confuses the prolongation of life with salvation  Do chemotherapy and radiation endanger more precious forms of redemption the wholeness of the human spirit connectedness and compassion
