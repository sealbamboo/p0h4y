All but seven abortion clinics in Texas are faced with the prospect of closing after a federal appeals court ruling Thursday that allowed a restrictive provision of a state abortion law to take effect.. The law, enacted last year, includes a provision requiring abortion clinics to qualify as “ambulatory surgical centers”—a standard currently met by only seven clinics located in the state’s five largest cities. At that time, the state had about 40 abortion facilities.
