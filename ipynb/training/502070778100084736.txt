An yearold student has made a scientific breakthrough that could help save the lives of black athletes with undiagnosed heart problems Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can lead to the heart suddenly stopping Henry Roth from Hampshire proved different tests for the condition were needed for black and white athletes  which do not currently take place  A cardiologist who worked with Henry on the project said he was astonished by the teenagers findings Henry was inspired to investigate the condition after the death of his uncle at the age of  A research project emerged from a conversation with a cardiologist at St Georges Hospital in London during tests on Henrys own heart  They discussed how black athletes were at higher risk and the aspiring doctor resolved to find a better way of testing  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an inherited disease where the heart muscle becomes thickened increasing the risk of the heart suddenly stopping  Screening does take place but intense exercise can also lead to a thicker heart  so some athletes might not be aware they have the condition  Bolton footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed on the pitch in  when his heart stopped despite being described as one of the fittest players at the club MarcVivien Foe the Cameroon footballer died during an international match in  An alternative way of testing involves looking at the maximum amount of oxygen the body can use up at the limits of physical exercise  Those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cannot reach the same peak  Henrys study on elite athletes found differences between black and white athletes but these were not accounted for during screening It meant black athletes were less likely to be diagnosed  Henry who studied at Guildfords Royal Grammar School said he could not believe the difference had not been identified already He told the BBC I was quite frankly shocked but it takes people who are shocked to do something about it make something happen and not sit back and accept normal practice  Prof Sanjay Sharma the medical director of the London Marathon and the charity Cardiac Risk in the Young said Henry has a thirst for researching the heart driven by his own familys experience of sudden cardiac death  He wants to make sure other families dont go through what he has experienced and I have been really excited and quite astonished by the research he undertook with me and my colleagues at St Georges Hospital  Henrys work has the potential to change the way we test athletes for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Around one in  people in the UK has the condition although it will not affect the lives of the majority of patients  Henry explains An aeroplane on the ground with a mechanical fault is not dangerous but as soon as you take it into the air its dangerous  As soon as they go on to the field it leads to the possibility of arrhythmias irregular heartbeat Henry was also a finalist in the   He will be returning to St Georges to continue the research before travelling during a gap year and then pursuing a career in medicine
