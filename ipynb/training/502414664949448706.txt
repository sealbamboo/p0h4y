Since Richard Nixon declared   in  the National Cancer Institute has poured some  billion into research and treatments Yet a cure remains elusive Experts have plenty of targets for blame including a   and Big Pharma betting on   But a new study raises a sobering possibility Cancer simply may be here to stay Researchers at Kiel University the Catholic University of Croatia and other institutions discovered that hydra  tiny corallike polyps that emerged hundreds of millions of years ago  form tumors similar to those found in humans Which suggests that our cells ability to develop cancer is an intrinsic property that has evolved at least since then  way way way before we rallied our forces to try to tackle it said Thomas Bosch an evolutionary biologist at Kiel University who led the   published in  in June To get ahead of cancer he said you have to interfere with fundamental pathways Its a web of interactions he said Its very difficult to do Thats why cancer   Cancer results from DNA mutations that throw a wrench into the molecular circuits that regulate the cell cycle Unregulated cancer cells multiply uncontrollably They also evade a process known as apoptosis in which cells with genetic mistakes essentially commit suicide Bosch and his colleagues have investigated hydra stem cells and tissue regeneration for years In an earlier study they showed that these pulsating polyps carry genes that can cause cancer in humans But they wondered did those genes also trigger tumor growth Sure enough they discovered tumorridden polyps from two hydra species Oddly the tumors ravaged only female polyps They bred them for five years generating several clones of each To unravel the tumorcausing mechanisms the researchers observed cell division in hydra with and without tumors They saw that stem cells programmed to turn into female sex cells or eggs divided uncontrollably They accumulated without being naturally culled through apoptosis  resembling ovarian cancer in women They then sequenced the tumorous hydras DNA and discovered a gene that halts apoptosis and the activity of which runs amok in tumor tissue Turns out a similar gene hijacks apoptosis in humans and also spurs unbridled cell proliferation So we know that tumors can grow in hydra but are hydra tumors invasive the way they are in humans To find out the researchers transplanted tumors into healthy polyps The cells from tumors transplanted in the midsections of healthy polyps migrated all the way to both ends of their bodies All this means that cancer genes and the mechanisms that allow tumor cells to evade death and invade healthy tissue have deep evolutionary roots the researchers wrote Any crucial cell in your body can at any point make a mistake and theres no way to prevent it Bosch said You carry a time bomb in your body when youre born he said It can explode early in life or middle age or later But Bosch adds that doesnt mean that with a patient who develops cancer theres nothing you can do While our cells probably always will have the ability to make mistakes that trigger cancer Bosch believes medical technology will allow us at early time points  at least in some cases to successfully treat and clean a patient completely and forever of troublemaking cells One strategy might be to   against these cells Yervoy a drug that does just that eliminated melanoma in    and counting An infusion of Yervoy and a similar drug nivolumab has kept some lung cancer patients diseasefree for about six years so far Their cancer hasnt come back yet It might never come back   Ben Creelan an oncologist at Moffitt Cancer Center I think its the most exciting thing in decades And of course basic research on the evolution of cancers arsenal remains crucial Knowing your enemy from its origins is the best way to fight it and win many battles Bosch said Our goal then if we cant slay the beast is to learn enough about it that we render it harmless
