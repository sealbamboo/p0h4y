having lived so long It was always comforting Her grandmother Ann Ciampa occasionally needs her help too Though still healthy and independent at  Mrs Ciampa asks her granddaughter to buy her health food supplies online She stayed with Ms Cortese who now lives in nearby Linden when hurricanes caused extended power failures in the area and she relied on her granddaughter for a ride home after

And now that she has two children she still seeks Mrs Ciampas advice Raising kids when you never know what youre doing its nice to sit back and hear her say Its fine Dont worry so much  she told me Much of the research on grandparents and grandchildren has focused on young children and on the safetynet function that grandparents can provide in troubled families But lengthening lifespans mean that more people will have adult relationships with their grandparents too sometimes for many years We know relatively little about what grandparents and grandchildren do for each other on a daily basis during the grandchildrens adulthood said Sara Moorman a Boston College sociologist who set out to learn more She presented the results of her research at the American Sociological Associations annual meeting in New York this week  Using the Longitudinal Study of Generations which surveys families in Southern California about every three years Dr Moorman and her coinvestigator Jeffrey Stokes looked at data from  through  Their sample included  grandparents and  grandchildren selected randomly if a grandparent had more than one grandchild who were over the age of  In  halfway through the period in question the grandparents mean age was  the grandchildrens was  These relationships had impact the results showed When the pairs described themselves as fairly close emotionally affectual solidarity the sociologists called it both generations showed fewer symptoms of depression on a standard psychological scale than those with more detached relationships Those with close relationships were less likely to report feeling lonely or sad and were not as prone to symptoms like insomnia lack of energy or sleeplessness More practical assistance  for example helping each other with chores with transportation with advice with money Dr Moorman said  had no significant connection to grandchildrens depression scores but it did affect the grandparents scores They reported fewer depressive symptoms if they provided help functional solidarity or if the assistance was reciprocal If they were only the recipients of aid though the grandparents depression scores were higher Older adults want to continue to be independent and productive Dr Moorman said When they cant give back thats depressing Its worth noting that over all these grandparents and grandchildren  some of whom may have moved away from each other over the years of the study  did not describe particularly high levels of involvement Based on six questions and a scale in which  meant not at all close and  meant extremely close the grandparents rated their emotional closeness at  on average the grandchildren rated their relationships at  Pretty centrist responses Dr Moorman said Over the full study period the grandparents estimated that they gave practical support to adult grandchildren about  percent of the time received it about  percent of the time and both gave and received it about  percent of the time The grandchildren saw the relationship differently Grandparents say theyre giving more Dr Moorman said The grandkids perceive more of an exchange Most of the time though both generations said they neither received nor provided practical support Still the connections between these relationships and depression scores were statistically significant A close relationship that induces exchange is good for both parties Dr Moorman said Grandchildren and grandparents are a resource for each other or at least they can be She knows whereof she speaks My grandma and I were really close she said They lived in State College Pa where as a teenager Dr Moorman worked in the public library Her grandmother Mary Moorman whose house was right next door often made her lunch And with her brandnew drivers license Dr Moorman drove her to hairdressers appointments and restaurants thrilled to be trusted Her grandmother died last summer at  The new study Dr Moorman said was a tribute to her
