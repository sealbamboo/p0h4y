What does it mean to be lonely Its tempting to equate the feeling with a dearth of social interaction but some people are now saying that its more complicated than that  and that true loneliness might be dangerous In a story at Medium Robin Marantz Henig   some common loneliness myths Lonely people arent necessarily weird or uncool Ms Henig cites a study of Ohio State undergrads showing that those who called themselves lonely had just as much social capital  defined by physical attractiveness height weight socioeconomic status and academic achievement  as their nonlonely peers And they may not be actually alone The students at Ohio State who were lonely belonged to as many clubs and had as many roommates as those who were socially embedded And while some studies indicate that living alone puts people at greater risk for loneliness living with a spouse is not necessarily any protection Rather loneliness may be psychological The lonely writes Ms Henig are more likely than others to feel put upon and misunderstood in social situations to see social danger even where none might exist She writes People grow lonely because of the gloomy stories they tell themselves And in a cruel twist the loneliness itself can further distort their thinking making them misread other peoples good intentions which in turn causes them to withdraw to protect themselves from further rejection  and causes other people to keep them at arms length This distancing can have a physical impact Ms Henig argues that loneliness deserves further study in part because it may increase the risk of high blood pressure sleep problems and Alzheimers disease Though it still gets less coverage than other psychic ills Ms Henig notes that a search for depression at the National Institute for Healths website turns up far more hits than searches for loneliness or lonely the last few years have seen rising attention to loneliness and its risks At The Wall Street Journal Elizabeth Bernstein   that the share of lonely Americans has doubled since the s to  percent perhaps because were now more likely to live alone though as Ms Henig points out living with someone isnt necessarily protective Natalie Gil of The Guardian   on a recent survey finding that Britons are the loneliest Europeans and writes that young people may be most at risk She quotes Nicky Forsythe a psychotherapist We treat the networks we have as incidental but theyre fundamental to our wellbeing The most important thing is to have a regular time and place to reflect on your life and to have an empathic listener And in a  story in The New Republic Judith Shulevitz   the current research on loneliness and offers this disturbing formulation of its dangers Just as we once knew that infectious diseases killed but didnt know that germs spread them weve known intuitively that loneliness hastens death but havent been able to explain how Psychobiologists can now show that loneliness sends misleading hormonal signals rejiggers the molecules on genes that govern behavior and wrenches a slew of other systems out of whack They have proved that longlasting loneliness not only makes you sick it can kill you Other people are offering accounts of what loneliness feels like from the inside In her  memoir   Emily White takes stock of what we know about loneliness through the lens of her own struggles with it Of a time when shed been feeling lonely for about a year she writes I no longer had periods of not needing others Rather my sense of need was present and piercing much of the time It was also the case that during that winter my dreams began to change I stopped dreaming of warmth and close connection and began to dream of loneliness Id be at a pay phone trying to call around to find the location of a party but wouldnt be able to reach anyone who could tell me how to get there Or Id be lying in bed and waiting for someone to join me but hour after hour would go by and Id wind up alone on the mattress in the weak dawn light It was as though after more than a year of battling loneliness my mind had temporarily run out of gimmicks and resources Ms Henig too speaks of loneliness from experience She writes There are many days when I dont utter a single word to anyone but my husband On these days I think of Leo Gursky the solitary old man from Nicole Krausss   who goes out for a glass of juice when hes not thirsty or shops for shoes he has no intention of buying just for the human interaction All I want he says is not to die on a day when I went unseen However she says shes working on getting better She notes that John Cacioppo a neuroscience professor and widely cited expert on loneliness believes that if were aware of our tendency to feel aggrieved and unappreciated the awareness itself is an important first step in conquering loneliness allowing us to grab hold of our negative thinking and turn ourselves into someone that others will want to have around Ms Shulevitz sounds a similar note Teach a lonely person to respond to others without fear and paranoia and over time her body will make fewer stress hormones and get less sick from them For those dealing with loneliness the recent attention to the condition may be helpful As Ms Henig notes changing the way your mind works is easier said than done But knowing that loneliness may be a relatively common psychological problem  and not a sign that youre strange or unlovable  may make it a little easier to combat
