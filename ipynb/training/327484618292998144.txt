Theres no good time to find out you have a brain tumor but I think my father has a solid claim on the worst luck ever in this regard  When he got the bad news I was camping Not just camping actually  I was sleeping in a tent in southern Ethiopia days away from the nearest phone signal or Internet connection I would have been more in touch if I had been on the moon By the time I finally returned to Addis Ababa and checked my email the operation was already over Hed gone through the ordeal alone  Although he survived the surgery the lingering cognitive side effects were severe He couldnt recognize me let alone answer questions about things like his health insurance policy and doctors didnt know if the condition would ever improve Id never felt like a grownup before but suddenly I was dropped into adulthood At  I didnt yet have my own health insurance policy retirement account or house I could barely take care of myself let alone take care of someone else To put it in millennial slang I was a hot mess As anyone who has cared for a sick parent knows there is a huge amount of medical logistical and financial information to figure out But it can be especially overwhelming for young adults who have little if any experience managing complicated finances dealing with insurance companies and making major logistical decisions  My situation was a little unusual perhaps since my father is not married and I dont have any siblings But I certainly wasnt the first young adult to care for an unexpectedly sick relative and I wont be the last Many parents of young adults are still fairly young themselves so they dont expect to have a major medical crisis If they do their children are particularly ill equipped to care for them  At least I was I dont know his Social Security number I sobbed during at least a dozen phone calls with health insurance companies longterm care facilities hospitals and banks I didnt know his computer passwords his bank account numbers or even his mothers maiden name I didnt know the name of his employer or whether he had a safe deposit box at a bank Frankly there wasnt a single thing that I did know  and worst of all every minute I spent learning those basics was a minute I didnt spend with my father  None of this was his fault of course My father is a very responsible man who had a will and an advance health care directive established years before he got sick But it wasnt nearly enough For weeks I berated myself for not asking him certain critical questions that could have helped me navigate this maze on his behalf back when I had the chance Then amazingly we got lucky A final medical procedure resolved the hydrocephalus that had been putting pressure on my fathers brain and causing the mental impairment and his cognitive function returned with a vengeance Suddenly I could ask every question Id never asked before  I wrote them all in a list and sent it to my father Within days he responded with the answers Its a simple document that took us almost no time to make but it feels like a life raft I showed these questions to a few of my friends and suddenly dozens of people were asking me for copies to forward to their own families I think readers of this blog might find it useful too
