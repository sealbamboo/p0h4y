There have been previous studies that showed that people who were cynical were more likely to die earlier and have other poor health outcomes but no one that we could tell ever looked at dementia said   one of the studys authors and a professor at the University of Eastern Finland We have seen   that show people who are more open and optimistic have a lower risk for dementia so we thought this was a good question to ask Cynicism is a deep mistrust of others Psychologists consider it a kind of chronic anger that develops over time Specifically the kind of cynicism researchers looked at involved doubting the truth of what people say and believing most people are motivated by selfinterest rather than by what is best for the community The study tested  people with an average age of  The study participants took a test for dementia A separate test measured their level of cynicism  Both tests are considered reliable by researchers   The cynicism test asks if the person agrees with statements like Most people will use somewhat unfair reasons to gain profit or an advantage rather than lose it I think most people would lie to get ahead and It is safer to trust nobody  Those who agreed with the critical statements in the test were considered highly cynical  The people with the highest level of cynical distrust had a  times greater risk of dementia than those with the lowest cynicism rating Researchers also examined the test results to see if the subjects who were labeled highly cynical died sooner than the others But once compounding factors were screened out they did not Previous studies have shown a link between cynicism and an earlier death   Still the new study does not prove that having a bad attitude causes bad health outcomes To prove a causal relationship a study would need randomized controlled trials to show that a reduction in cynical attitudes through treatment actually lowered the risk of bad health outcomes   More research is necessary to replicate the conclusions But the results complement a wide body of research showing how over time people with highly cynical hostility do worse health wise said   assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh What might explain an association between cynicism and poor health  This is a complex issue that needs to be studied more Tindle said The relationships between psychological attitudes and health outcomes are very complex   I can tell you from my clinical perspective from treating patients I am absolutely certain that psychological attitudes can lead people down a road to poor health because I see it every day when I talk to patients said Tindle who wrote the book Up How Positive Outlook Can Transform Our Health and Aging  Tindle was the lead author on a study that examined the health outcomes of over  women and found that cynical women had a   of cancerrelated mortality  The bottom line is that a high degree of angerhostilitycynicism is not good for health she wrote Research shows cynical people also tend to smoke more exercise less and weigh more They also have a harder time following even the best medical advice because their cynical natures wont let them believe what people tell them Tindle said Past studies have also found that people who are cynical have a higher rate of  problems and cancerrelated deaths Cardiovascular disease can contribute to dementia because it essentially damages small blood vessels everywhere in your body including in your brain Cynical people also tend to have greater stress responses which means they typically have a higher heart rate a higher blood pressure peak and a tendency to have greater inflammation of their immune systems Chronic inflammation is now known to be harmful to ones overall health and it is linked to everything from   to   to even     The good news is being highly cynical is not a permanent state of mind  I am also certain that people can learn to change  they change every day in that they quit smoking they lose weight they cut ties in unhealthy friendships Tindle said The ultimate message is people are not doomed if they have cynical tendencies So if your assumptions about people are making you angry and irritable try having a little more trust  All of us are capable of adopting healthier attitudes Tindle said As a physician I see people of all ages making positive change every day
