For hundreds of years coffee has been one of the two or three most popular beverages on earth But its only recently that scientists are figuring out that the drink has notable health benefits In   from last year researchers primarily at the National Cancer Institute parsed health information from more than  volunteers ages  to  who were free of major diseases at the studys start in  By  more than  of the participants had died But men who reported drinking two or three cups of coffee a day were  percent less likely to have died than those who didnt drink coffee while women drinking the same amount had  percent less risk of dying during the study Its not clear exactly what coffee had to do with their longevity but the correlation is striking Other recent studies have linked moderate coffee drinking  the equivalent of three or four ounce cups of coffee a day or a single ventisize Starbucks  with more specific advantages a reduction in the risk of developing   basal cell carcinoma the most common skin cancer     and   Perhaps most consequential animal experiments show that caffeine may reshape the biochemical environment inside our brains in ways that could stave off dementia In a   mice were briefly starved of oxygen causing them to lose the ability to form memories Half of the mice received a dose of caffeine that was the equivalent of several cups of coffee After they were reoxygenated the caffeinated mice regained their ability to form new memories  percent faster than the uncaffeinated Close examination of the animals brain tissue showed that the caffeine disrupted the action of adenosine a substance inside cells that usually provides energy but can become destructive if it leaks out when the cells are injured or under stress The escaped adenosine can jumpstart a biochemical cascade leading to inflammation which can disrupt the function of neurons and potentially contribute to neurodegeneration or in other words dementia In a   researchers from the University of South Florida and the University of Miami tested the blood levels of caffeine in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or the first glimmer of serious forgetfulness a common precursor of Alzheimers disease and then reevaluated them two to four years later Participants with little or no caffeine circulating in their bloodstreams were far more likely to have progressed to fullblown Alzheimers than those whose blood indicated theyd had about three cups worth of caffeine Theres still much to be learned about the effects of coffee We dont know whether blocking the action of adenosine is sufficient to prevent or lessen the effects of dementia says Dr Gregory G Freund a professor of pathology at the University of Illinois who led the  study of mice It is also unclear whether caffeine by itself provides the benefits associated with coffee drinking or if coffee contains other valuable ingredients In a   at the University of South Florida for instance mice genetically bred to develop Alzheimers and then given caffeine alone did not fare as well on memory tests as those provided with actual coffee Nor is there any evidence that mixing caffeine with large amounts of sugar as in energy drinks is healthful But a cup or three of coffee has been popular for a long long time Dr Freund says and theres probably good reasons for that
