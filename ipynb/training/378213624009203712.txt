Everyone recognizes the pink ribbon of breast cancer but fewer know the color of testicular orchid uterine peach lung white pancreatic purple or head and neck burgundyivory cancers Given current research and treatment as well as a commitment to equity is it time to imagine a rainbow coalition        Breast cancer activists have brilliantly organized to heighten public awareness of a disease that threatens too many women Support groups regional conferences runs Tshirts memoirs and photographs raise money for research and help individual women confront a dire diagnosis   In a post on the Foundation for Womens Cancer Web site   worries that she has the wrong color of cancer More than  American women are diagnosed annually with below the belt cancers but they do not get the attention information and care they need  When we look at cancer through rose colored glasses we save thousands of lives Ms Ledford wrote We might save thousands more if we look through a stained glass window swirling with all the colors representing womens cancer   Even though TV ads tell us about erectile dysfunction and prostate cancer light blue are we leery of publicly discussing lady parts I take this to be a serious question about the debilitating silence surrounding gynecological cancers     I wonder as well about colorectal cancers dark blue that afflict men as well as women Any disease involving excremental matters seems to remain unspeakable for the most part It is difficult to ascertain the color of anal cancer but I believe   Also marginalized in representation and debate are men and women dealing with cancers that afflict smaller populations  like multiple myeloma burgundy carcinoid cancer zebra or thyroid cancer tealpinkblue   American history has taught us that separate is not equal         In the midst of these competing claims for attention and support cancer research is undergoing a paradigm shift  We are informed that there are several quite distinct types of say breast cancer that must be treated differently Just as important a single genetic mutation can cause cancers originating in different body parts  Today a number of drugs work on multiple cancers Gleevec has been used on leukemia orange but also on gastrointestinal stromal tumors periwinkle Avastin is effective for certain colorectal nonsmall cell lung brain gray ovarian teal and kidney cancers also orangethere are only so many colors to go round Doctors can now prolong lives by prescribing Abraxane for breast lung and pancreatic malignancies   Perhaps the organ of origin is less important than other factors In this context the balkanization of cancer identity politics seems absurd Why should people with melanoma black contend against people with liver cancer emerald green over limited resources Instead of haggling over a meager slice of the pie the breast surgeon and author Dr Susan Love has argued we should demand a bigger pie   Wouldnt we have more clout banding together not only to support research into prevention detection and cure but also to counter the exorbitant expense of treatment The price of some of the newer drugs is sky high Gleevec can cost  a year Avastin  a year Abraxane  a year The issue of the colors of cancer was raised by Ms Ledford to broadcast the fact that September is National Gynecological Cancer Awareness Month which is sometimes called National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month  There is cause for celebration among this constituency because   suggests that the biomarker CA when used over time to monitor change may finally provide a much needed detection tool for ovarian cancer  Currently  percent of those with diagnoses deal with latestage disease and miserable mortality statistics as I do On the first day of National Gynecological Cancer Awareness Month I discovered that the experimental drug extending my life has been so successful that it will be moved from a Phase  to a Phase  clinical trial Unlike the Phase  trial which studied the drug in various cancers the Phase  trial will be open only to breast cancer patients I very much hope it will help the women enlisted but what about those excluded     Maybe cancer research and fundraising cant function without organrelated identifications Pharmaceutical companies are drawn to large markets Money is often donated by people honoring a beloved friend or relative felled by a particular form of cancer  Important as the ribbons are however can their use inadvertently set advocates against one another Without relinquishing the colors what would it mean to support people dealing with every type of cancer In the st century children and adults with cancer are unfortunately legion   We may have something to gain from dreaming a dream that really can come true of banding together under a symbol adopted by a number of social justice movements the spectrum of a rainbow coalition I would like to wear that sort of bracelet though I have never seen one in the hospital gift shop This idea comes to me during National Gynecological or Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month The ovaries are where we all come from
