Most people try to avoid ticks But not   The University of Rhode Island researcher goes out of his way to find them He looks for deer ticks  poppy seedsized skin burrowers  in the woods of southern Rhode Island These are the teenytiny carriers of Lyme disease an illness that can lead to symptoms ranging from   to memory loss Mathers not having much trouble finding deer ticks In fact he just might be the best deer tick collector in the country He caught  of them last year His success is a sign of a growing problem Adultsized deer ticks are thriving throughout much of the Northeast and parts of the Midwest Mather has a trim gray beard and a runners build He moves through the undergrowth with precision He goes from one plant to another sometimes plucking off ticks five at a time You know I can hold eight to  in my fingers and do it that way Mather says If there is more than that usually I will sort of touch the branch to my thigh and let the ticks crawl up on my leg and then I have a couple seconds to pick them before they start walking away Mather doesnt have to go into the deep woods to find ticks A lot of times hes practically in peoples wooded backyards People would be incredulous if they only knew he says But most people cant spot the ticks Theyre tiny Deer ticks tend to be a little smaller than dog ticks and theyre pretty good at blending in with their surroundings too Mather has spent about  years studying deer ticks When he started he didnt know the organism would become the focus of his academic life  or something that sends him into tickinfested areas for work This wouldnt be the job that most people would want  walking through the brush getting pricked and latched onto by ticks at the same time Mather says laughing I think its great Just down the road from these woods is Mathers lab at the University of Rhode Island campus When we bring the ticks back in from the field we just keep them in the refrigerator he says Probably half of the adult deer ticks he encountered in the woods carry some sort of pathogen like the   And most of the ticks he collects this fall will be used for research The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that more than  people last year in the US contracted Lyme disease People really need to become tick literate he says When not so many people got sick it seemed like less of an issue When more people get sick  you need to know more about the situation Mather had Lyme disease  once Hes fine now but he knows plenty of people who didnt fare as well Thats one reason why hes gathering ticks to use for the development of effective vaccines to fight tickborne diseases I feel that research has to be done for a purpose he says And the purpose is to protect people In this case protect people from being bitten and getting a disease or several diseases And thats why Mather will venture back into the woods whistling to himself as he collects thousands more ticks
