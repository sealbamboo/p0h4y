Tomorrow marks the third International Day of the Girl Child designated by the UN to highlight the need to create a better world for adolescent girls Its a day when activists ramp up efforts to make the public aware of issues like child marriage violence against girls and the lack of access to education Its also a time for activists to push world leaders to make commitments  financial or policywise  to end those problems But these days it seems like every other day is the International Day of this that or the other thing In October alone the UN has designated  days to celebrate teachers the eradication of poverty even the UN itself It makes you wonder How effective are these commemorative days Goats and Soda asked a few scholars who specialize in global issues Their answers were decidedly mixed Commemorative days have their defenders Activists single out an issue for the public government and private donors to focus on It forces a lot of governments and agencies to comment on a certain issue says   a policy analyst at the DCbased think tank Center for Global Development And its more than just comments A few years back the challenges of girls werent even on the agenda of world leaders much less on the minds of the average person The first Day of the Girl in  changed that It focused on ending child marriage enabling activists to bring the issue to the fore says   a senior policy manager at the International Center for Research on Women That year the US State Department included child marriage in the annual Human Rights Report putting pressure on countries to end the practice Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also announced a slew of   including tackling child marriage in Bangladesh where rates are among the highest in the world Between the US government and private donors Thompson says roughly  million was pledged to those initiatives So the day led to new commitments to help girls But you cant prove that the day itself had any impact on the ground says   an American University professor who does research on the effectiveness of international aid My concern is they dont serve the people theyre intended to serve but the agencies that invent and popularize them he says So the benefit may turn out to be bigger budgets and staff along with more political leverage for those agencies Thats good for the agencies but what about the girls Esser points to a   that asked whether money that the United Kingdom invested in global development groups led to greater impact on the ground The results he says are sobering The British government rated the impact of agencies like the Food and Agriculture Organization and the United Nations Development Fund for Women as poor The World Health Organization and the United Nations Population Fund received an adequate score So does that means we should do away with dedicated days Dunning says you cant expect one day to spark a revolution But that doesnt mean its not an effective way to raise awareness It plants a seed says Thompson And if were lucky that seeds going to wiggle and grow
