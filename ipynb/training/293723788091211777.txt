 Obese drivers are up to  percent more likely to die in a   than normalweight drivers a new study finds Car designers may need to take heavier drivers into consideration to keep them safer the researchers said This study highlights yet another negative consequence of   said study coauthor Thomas Rice a research epidemiologist with the University of California Berkeleys Safe Transportation Research  Education Center Our findings suggest two things first that there is something about obese vehicle occupants that causes poorer outcomes That thing is probably a higher prevalence of comorbidities  other health conditions  related to obesity that inhibit survival and recovery from severe injury he said Second earlier research has shown that the proper interaction between seat belts and the human body is inhibited in the obese Rice said Specifically the lap belt is prevented from engaging the pelvis due to excess body fat It is this engagement between lap belt and pelvis that impedes the forward motion of occupants during frontal collisions he said Rice stressed the  especially among the obese It is critical that the lap belt be positioned as low as possible on the lap and as close to ones pelvis as possible he said The report was published in the Jan  online edition of the   For the study Rice and Dr Motao Zhu from the department of epidemiology and Injury Control Research Center at the University of West Virginia used fatality data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for  to  During that time details of more than  car accidents were documented Rice and Zhu looked specifically for accidents involving two cars resulting in a death They refined their search further and included only accidents involving cars of similar size and type In all their final pool included more than  pairs of drivers Obesity was determined by   a measurement that takes both height and weight into account As the level of obesity increased so did the odds of dying in the crash Compared to normalweight drivers those at the lowest level of obesity were  percent more likely to die those at the next level were  percent more likely to die and those who were most obese were  percent more likely to die Rice and Zhu found Obese women had a greater risk of dying than obese men the researchers noted In addition underweight men were slightly more likely to die in a crash than normalweight drivers the study found These risks remained even for drivers wearing seat belts and even when the airbag deployed the authors noted Car design may have to be adapted to reduce the risk to these drivers Rice and Zhu add especially in light of the US obesity epidemic It may be the case that passenger vehicles are well designed to protect normalweight vehicle occupants but are deficient in protecting overweight or obese occupants they wrote in their study Commenting on the findings Dr David Katz director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center said We have a serious and pernicious problem of antiobesity bias in the United States Efforts to address that may at times invite us to pretend that size doesnt matter but in fact it does The world around us has been built to accommodate prevailing norms of height weight he noted It just stands to reason that safety systems such as those in cars designed for people of a certain average size may serve a population of a larger average size less well Katz said That may be whats behind the new findings he said but it also could be that obesityrelated illnesses affect recovery from trauma But minimally the findings appear to mean that in car crashes size does matter because it affects outcome How why and what we can do about it now become the important questions Katz said Although the study found an association between obesity and death rates in car crashes it did not establish a causeandeffect relationship
