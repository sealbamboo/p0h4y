Could you dig up the next antibiotic in your backyard Two scientists would like you and if theyre lucky millions of other people to give it a try The researchers hope that lots of doityourself scientists around the world can come up with the next big idea for muchneeded drugs There are plenty of precedents Many blockbuster antibiotics were found in soil where many bacteria produce chemicals to keep rivals out of their territory Terramycin for instance an old antibiotic from Pfizer was developed from bacteria   outside a company factory in Terre Haute Ind Vancomycin an Eli Lilly drug has its roots in   Streptomycin the first antibiotic used successfully against tuberculosis also came from bacteria found in dirt The   Rutgers Selman Waksman win a Nobel Prize in  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   at least  million people get infected with antibioticresistant bacteria each year and at least  die As soon as doctors start prescribing an antibiotic the germs fight back by evolving to become resistant Agricultural use also   The world needs new antibiotics soon because so many of the existing drugs are losing their punch Some people are already talking about a postantibiotic era when   doctors have at their disposal But drug companies dont spend as much money looking for antibiotics as other types of medicines such as cancer drugs This is the one therapeutic area where when we design a brand new antibiotic what will happen is the world will say Thank you very much thats a great contribution to human medicine but Im going to put it on the shelf and only use it when I really have to use it  says David Payne a vice president overseeing antibacterial drug discovery at GlaxoSmithKline He says that although this is how doctors should use new antibiotics its not a good way to make money The federal government is now pitching in Earlier this year Glaxo and the US Department of Health and Human Services   And the government could pay Glaxo as much as  million over the next five years if things go well But crowdsourcing is another option Josiah Zayner whos about to take a job doing synthetic biology research at NASA and Mark Opal a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago want to make the drug discovery process easier They   to send out simple test kits so people can check plants chemicals and other substances around them for substances that kill bacteria The kit would include test bacteria that dont cause disease so theres something safe for doityourselfers to experiment with The kits which would cost between  and  depending on the version people select would include all the equipment necessary for amateur antibiotic hunters Zayner and Opal plan to put the results in an online database so others can independently verify discoveries You look out your window and you see a tree and you think Oh I bet you somebodys looked at that tree bark and tried to see if theres some drug or antibiotic compound in there  says Opal who also worked on drug development at the National Institutes of Health In reality in most cases this is not the truth They say the more people working on the problem the better Having what seems like too much data or having people test the same plants would be good signs says Zayner He points to the Human Genome Project When they first sequenced the human genome they were like Oh my gosh I have so much data what am I going to do with this  Zayner says A database like the one they are trying to start if it succeeds massively would just be amazing not only for now but for the future for scientists to look at for people to look at just to help us understand what compounds are in plants insects and other organisms But this massive crowdsourcing effort probably wont find the next antibiotic says   an associate medical director at the HarborUCLA Medical Center and coauthor of a   on antibiotic resistance Over the course of a halfcentury pharma pretty much dug in every soil they can get their hands on Spellberg says Drug companies have chemical libraries with millions of compounds he says If something is easy to find they probably have it Glaxos Payne agrees and   about his companys efforts to identify new drugs based on whats in their libraries They didnt find much Spellberg says its better to go to places that havent been explored before like the bottom of the ocean He also points out that just because a substance kills bacteria its not necessarily a good antibiotic Drugs must be safe and they have to be relatively easy to take Although this project may not uncover the next antibiotic there may be another benefit says Gregory Daniel a fellow at the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform at the Brookings Institution Its likely to get more people interested in antibiotic resistance This isnt just talk Daniel says This is actually engaging people into taking part in a potential solution Advocacy organizations for antibiotics are really hard to come by Advocacy can lead to real changes he says   Starting in the s HIVAIDS patient advocates pushed for regulatory changes that sped up access to drugs and included activists and patients on advisory boards Campaign creators Zayner and Opal say even if they cant meet their fundraising goal they have already heard from schools interested in using the kits as classroom tools
