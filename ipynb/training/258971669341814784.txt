A small study offers a bit of cautious optimism about the prospects for treatment of tuberculosis one of humankinds most ancient scourges This weeks   has a   showing that adding a yearold antibiotic called   brand name Zyvox to existing treatments cured nearly  percent of patients with a form of tuberculosis resistant to both first and secondline antibiotics This kind of TB called   because its extensively drugresistant is a lot harder to treat than multiple drugresistant TB or   a type thats unfazed by firstline drugs A   from the World Health Organization estimates that  people have MDRTB most of them in India   and the Russian Federation While XDRTB is worse MDRTB is bad enough says   of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention All of a sudden you switch from being able to cure someone in  months to requiring  years of treatment and lowering your ability to cure using lousy and toxic drugs he says About  in  people with drugresistant TB have the more severe XDR type Eightyfour countries have seen cases of XDRTB although most of them have counted fewer than  cases so far There are nearly  million new cases of all types of TB globally each year and  million deaths Drugresistant TB is a growing problem and a flashing neon sign of what happens when people dont get prompt and proper treatment for ordinary TB One of the major reasons for MDRTB is inadequate treatment of plain old TB say   of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases And one of the drivers of XDRTB is inadequate treatment of MDRTB Fauci and Castro spoke at a Washington press conference on Wednesday to mark the WHOs annual TB update The linezolid study conducted in South Korea suggests that even the mostdifficulttotreat form of TB may be curable most of the time Patients have to take the drug along with others for  months and health workers have to make sure theyre complying That of course is no foregone conclusion in places with the worst XDRTB problem countries such as Tajikistan Azerabijan and Belarus And as with everything TBrelated the good news about linezolid comes with a dark side Theres a high incidence of serious side effects such as nerve toxicity and bone marrow suppression which caused several patients to drop out of the study And a few patients developed resistance to this antibiotic too though fewer than feared The linezolid report isnt the only encouraging news The TB drug pipeline contains  other new or repurposed drugs and two or three may get US market approval in the coming year says   of the WHOs Stop TB program Initial trials are showing that the capacity to kill bacteria resistant to the most important drugs is dramatically increased Raviglione says The new drugs have been tested so far only in patients with MDRTB but Raviglione hopes they might ultimately be used as firstline treatment for TB that could shave months of the standard sixmonth regimen Millions of TB patients wouldnt progress to the MDR or XDR stages if they got treated promptly and correctly in the first place And thats where another recent advance comes in Its called   a rapid diagnostic test that can tell in under  hours if someone has TB and if its a drugresistant form Standard tests rely on growing the TB bacteria in the lab which can take up to  weeks for results Castro says prompt diagnosis of TB is a big boon In the same day you should be able to identify TB and start the patient on treatment he says That is a gamechanger Sixtyseven low and middleincome countries have adopted GenXpert and experts hope its use will expand rapidly due to a recent price cut for lowerincome countries from around  per test to under  In the future Fauci is confident there will be an effective   More than a dozen are in development But for all progress the fight against TB remains a long slog Patients have to be diagnosed started on treatment monitored and retained in treatment Drugs have to be procured and distributed Labs have to be built and their quality maintained It can be done Over the past  years  million people around the world have been successfully treated for TB Consequently the TB death rate has gone down by  percent The world as a whole is on track to cut TB deaths by half the  rate by   although Africa and Europe will miss that target But even though new cases of TB are falling at a rate of  percent annually Raviglione says thats far too slow to see elimination in this century He fears the campaign to stop TB will stagnate if additional resources are not urgently mobilized The WHO says  billion a year is needed over the next three years for TB care and control Thats  billion more than donors have promised Research and development has a  billion funding gap
