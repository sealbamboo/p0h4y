So youre on the couch entering hour three of a Pinterest binge This is a time when you probably could use a little motivation to get yourself to finally log off and drag your butt to the gym Thats essentially the point of fitspiration  a cutesy Internetty term for images and slogans meant to inspire people to meet their fitness goals hundreds of which are posted and pinned every day on imageheavy social media sites like Pinterest Tumblr and Instagram And a lot of fitspo as its nicknamed does a great job of doing what its intended to do inspire people to get and stay fit say body image experts and fitness bloggers  But mixed right into those healthy messages are also some sneakily harmful underlying themes   A lot of these things are very reasonable  they say things like Just start says David LaPorte a psychologist at Indiana University of Pennsylvania who has studied body image and social media Or I love this one Failure isnt falling down its refusing to get back up  The trouble is when you surround all those good messages with images of people that are unattainable for most women quite frankly he says  Because many of the fitspo images actually look a   like thinspiration  and if youre unaware of that term do a quick search on Pinterest Tumblr or Instagram Youll immediately find thousands of photos of heartbreakingly thin young women and some guys too but mostly young women Its a lot of protruding hipbones visible rib cages   Search for fitspiration and youll see pages and pages of similar images  its usually a headless shot zoomed in on a defined flat set of sweaty abs Heres a couple examples of these images from Tumblr It sets up an equally unrealistic standard of beauty but its under the guise of being healthy says Charlotte Hilton Anderson a fitness blogger from Denver On her blog shes called fitspo   and many body image experts say shes exactly right Recently Tumblr and Pinterest responded to reports about the negative impact of thinspo or thinspiration by placing PSAstyle language at the top of the results page when a user searches for those and other terms that may promote selfharm Instagram banned both hashtags entirely But fitspo has so far stayed mostly under the radar  Out of curiosity LaPorte pulled up two Pinterest pages to look at them sidebyside in one hed searched for thinspiration and the other fitspiration There are very very subtle differences but they look for all intents and purposes identical says Laporte who was halfseriously designing a study as we spoke over the phone We could pull them up and have people sort them out by fitspo or thinspo he mused Im going to have to put an undergrad on this one Its worth noting the similarities because researchers who study body image and mental health have linked thinspo to some potentially damaging consequences In  LaPorte published a   that showed even when people with no history of eating disorders briefly looked at thinspo sites it actually changed their eating patterns On average they ate about  fewer calories the next week The participants only clicked around the thinspo sites for about  minutes at a time  Now imagine youre a  or a  year old  and you go onto these websites for hours LaPorte says And a  Italian   found that thinspo sites worsen some of the issues associated with eating disorders specifically asceticism competition and obsession for control  Few academic studies have looked at thinspiration and   have considered fitspiration But psychologist Mia Holland who specializes in treating patients with eating disorders sees more than a few links between fitspo and   While scrolling through a fitspiration tagstream on Pinterest slogans like Exercise til it hurts and Pain is only in your mind particularly stood out to Holland Those are very unhealthy mottos to live by when exercising If something hurts STOP Holland said via email The body is a great barometer of its own tolerance Yes we do experience some discomfort when working out  However if the pain is unbearable it is time to stop Slight discomfort can mean a muscle is working  full pain means we are pushing it too hard and need to stop she says  Holland reiterates that there really is some healthy positive stuff under the fitspo and fitspiration hashtags too like healthful recipes or practical and safe workout tips And if the fitspo online community is where youre getting your encouragement to lace up your running shoes and head out the door  well thats wonderful and you should keep it up But be sure youre aware of some of the sneaky negative messages hiding there Fitspiration does contain some good advice and healthy recipes but that can veil the hidden negative and potentially harmful messages such as Exercise til it hurts Holland says If someone sees the positive information listed  they will be swayed to think all of fitspiration is positive and helpful  when in fact it is not Jodi Rubin the creator of   a training program to help fitness instructors spot eating disorders in their clients offers this advice for people who want to participate in the online fitness community without becoming dangerously obsessive about it Being active can and should be  she reminds  I use that as a gauge often Rubin says Hopefully exercise is fun for people When it starts to become a drag when it starts to feel like if I dont go then Im not going to feel good about myself  thats when it becomes a potential problem she says
