A New Jersey woman desperate for a lifesaving doublelung transplant says shes glad a yearold Pennsylvania girl got the organs first  Nereida Smith  of Cinnaminson NJ has been waiting two years for new lungs in the same region that provided Sarah Murnaghan not one but two lung transplants last month after a highprofile appeal by her parents and ensuing court order  But Smith said she was moved by Sarahs plight even more than her own because no child should have to endure the wait for new lungs  I know how hard it is for me I couldnt even imagine how hard it is for her said Smith My first thought was basically as sick as I am I could say if my lungs were to come I would have given up my chance to give her a chance to live Smiths lungs are ravaged by systemic scleroderma a rare autoimmune disease that causes scar tissue to build up inside the body First diagnosed in  she now suffers from pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension two lifethreatening complications her doctor said  She really needs to have a lung transplant said Dr Sergio Jimenez director of the Scleroderma Center at Jefferson University Hospitals in Philadelphia who has been treating Smith Right now I think its her only chance But Smith a mother of two grown sons says she doesnt begrudge the two sets of lungs that have gone to Sarah who has latestage cystic fibrosis  If that was meant for me then God would have given them to me she said her voice hoarse with the effort of talking Maybe God wanted that little girl to have her chance Smith is one of  people waiting for lungs in Region  one of  transplant regions nationwide designated by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network or OPTN That region includes Delaware Washington DC Maryland New Jersey Pennsylvania and West Virginia Nationally some  people are on the waiting list for lungs with  on the active list for all organs according to OPTN figures Sarah had been on a pediatric waiting list for  months when her parents protested the way lungs for transplant were allocated A highprofile public relations campaign led to a court order that forced Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius to direct OPTN to allow Sarah to be considered for the adult list based on the severity of her illness not her age  The child received one set of lungs on June  but then developed primary graft failure a severe complication She received a rare second transplant three days later Since then she has had surgery to repair her diaphragm developed pneumonia in one of the new lungs and had to have a tracheostomy to insert a breathing tube in her throat  Sarah is out of surgery and resting comfortably Janet Ruddock Murnaghan Sarahs mom wrote on Facebook Friday I am relieved that it is over and it is a joy to see my babies sic face again without tape and tubes Sarahs situation sparked a national debate about organ allocation procedures and prompted OPTN to change policies for children on the transplant waiting list allowing them to petition to be included on the adult list based on severity of illness  Some critics said that changing the system was unfair to others on the waiting list while others said the Murnaghans shouldnt have waited two weeks to disclose publicly that the child received two transplants  Still others were far less kind about Sarah and her family which Smith says she found disturbing  I couldnt understand how people could be so evil she said I already gave her my blessing to be strong and to continue fighting In order to fight her own battle Smith needs to travel to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center to be ready when lungs become available  They would really love for me to be in Pittsburgh yesterday said Smith who has been hospitalized five times since January  She and her husband Richard Smith a milk truck driver are hoping to raise up to  to help pay travel and living expenses while she waits Volunteers are holding a   on July  in Cherry Hill NJ For details contact Sandra Domenech at  The waiting is hard says Smith who uses oxygen piped through a foot hose that she navigates through her house  If the call comes I have to make sure I have the phone in my hand she said  She is continuing to follow Sarah Murnaghans progress hoping for the best for the little girl  I heard today they were doing a surgery on her she said Shes doing well Thats awesome
