 AstraZeneca PLC on Friday rejected an improved takeover offer from Pfizer Inc. worth more than $106 billion, saying the proposal substantially undervalued the company and putting the onus back on Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read to either raise his bid again, go directly to shareholders, or walk away.. The British company said the financial and other terms described in the U.S. group's latest proposal were inadequate and not a basis on which to engage in talks.
