Researchers have identified a common substance that makes smokers much more likely to kick the habit  money The promise of up to  in shopping vouchers proved a powerful inducement to get pregnant women to quit smoking Compared to women who were merely referred for routine smoking cessation services those who were offered financial incentives were more than twice as likely to give up cigarettes according to a new study from Scotland Smoking is a major financial drain on Britains National Health Service according to the researchers who organized this unconventional clinical trial About  in  pregnant women in Scotland smokes which increases the risk of miscarriage stillbirth and infant death Throughout Britain the annual cost of treating pregnant smokers is somewhere between  million and  million plus another  million to  million to treat their babies So a group of researchers from Scotland and England screened pregnant women who were treated by the National Health Service in   Women who said they had smoked at least one cigarette in the previous week had their breath tested for carbon monoxide those who exhaled at least  parts per million of carbon monoxide were considered current smokers All of these women were referred to smoking cessation specialists who offer a facetoface counseling session followed by four weekly phone calls and  weeks of free nicotine replacement therapy About half of the study participants were also offered   for meeting certain goals like showing up for their counseling session passing a breath test if they went two weeks without smoking and remaining smokefree for  weeks Among the  women who were eligible for the shopping vouchers  had stopped smoking and were still smokefree when they were  to  weeks into their pregnancies Only  of the  women in the control group had done the same That meant the women offered financial incentives were  times more likely to be nonsmokers at the end of their pregnancies the researchers calculated Those results were better than the quit rates in most clinical trials of either behavioral or pharmaceutical interventions designed to help pregnant women quit smoking the researchers noted In order to get one woman to quit smoking by the end of her pregnancy the financial incentives need to be offered to  women according to the study Not all of those women would actually earn the shopping vouchers the researchers noted Some of the women who said they had quit smoking in order to get their shopping vouchers were later found to have nicotine byproducts in their blood saliva or urine Still considering that current recommendations to help smokers quit during pregnancy are not very effective the idea of offering financial incentives should be tested in a larger trial involving more women from a larger geographical area the researchers wrote
