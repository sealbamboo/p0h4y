Enrollment is picking up in new health insurance marketplaces But the  whove signed up as of November  is a fraction of just one highvisibility group  those whose previous insurance has been cancelled because it didnt meet Affordable Care Act standards Theyre  like Doug Normington a yearold selfemployed videographer in Madison Wis who has struggled to buy new insurance since late October Getting the   made me feel kind of nervous because my insurance runs out on December  Normington said when I first talk to him on November  I go on the   website and spin my wheels for a couple of days and its just not working Since Normington has diabetes maintaining coverage is especially important to him But like millions of others Normington ran into a dead end again and again on the federal exchange website He agreed to let me follow along with his attempts over the phone OK so Im at the Get Insurance page now he says in midNovember and Im going to click  view eligibility results And I hit the same wall here I get a PDF file that I cant read The same thing has been happening to him for weeks So he calls the  number on the HealthCaregov site and gets a woman who says he should make sure hes installed the latest version of Adobe Reader and is using Google Chrome He thinks he already has the right software But he reinstalls it Everything they suggested last time Ive done he says and I cant get any farther than I did last time This is not changing Were just stuck here I suggest maybe its time to see if his issue can be kicked up to a higher level of diagnosis I want to talk to Obama Normington says ruefully I think hes the keeper of the key But he has to settle for another telephone support person Hes momentarily encouraged when the phone rep calls up Normingtons application and runs into the same wall That tells me theres an issue on their end Normington says So the fix is on their end Hopefully Normington asks the phone rep if his problem is unique So this error that youre seeing concerning the results of my application  is that happening to everybody Or is it just happening to me But before he gets a response we hear a series of beeps OK I just lost contact with him The next day the problems still not fixed Meanwhile Normington pokes around and discovers that a change in his Adobe Reader settings allows him to see the elusive eligibility results file It says hes not eligible for a   which seems unlikely since his most recent annual income is less than  It says more information is needed but they dont say what information they need or how to provide them with it Normington says Which leaves the only option  to call them He decides to try his luck at  AM when the phone traffic is lighter Hes still put on hold for  minutes Eventually hes told his problem is being referred to the Advanced Resolution Center Its the first time hes heard of that So youre able to put me in a queue now to have the Advanced Resolution people give me a call back Normington says Wow He should expect a call within two to five days hes told He gives the phone rep his cell phone number The person I was speaking to doesnt really know what the Advanced Resolution Center is going to ask me but it would probably be good to have my last years tax forms with me Normington says So if Im at the grocery store Ill have my  return with me The call never comes But finally after about a dozen tries Normington has a breakthrough on December  I went in today and magically the issue has resolved itself and I can look at my various choices and know that I have a tax credit he exults Normington finds a plan that will cost him  a month with a  deductible  and dental coverage Hes been paying twice that in premiums with three times the deductible and no dental I feel all this relief Its great he says But he still hasnt actually enrolled So let me click the enroll button see what happens He clicks the button and gets a screen asking him to confirm your health plan selection He hits that button The wheel is spinning he says And Congratulations you have successfully completed all steps of your application See below for next steps or return to my account  But after all hes been hearing on the news Normington doesnt quite believe his application really got to Unity Insurance his new carrier So last Friday he calls them to ask A person named Steve tells him it will take a couple of days before his application gets into Unitys data base So he should check back This week he tries again  and has success The Unity Insurance woman finds his application and tells him hell get a welcome packet with payment instructions in plenty of time to meet the December  deadline for coverage beginning in  This is great Normington says The ironic twist is that this insurance company is a company that turned me down a year ago because I was diabetic They cant now Normington says he sympathizes with the many other people now in this same kind of anxious mode because theyve been cancelled But since the balky HealthCaregov system and state websites seem to be working better now there should be a ton of people signing up They need to move fast The deadline for enrollment for January  coverage is
