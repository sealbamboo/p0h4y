The Food and Drug Administration approved two new medications this year to help obese and overweight individuals lose weight Diet drugs have been around in different forms for a while but now researchers hope one of these two might actually help make a dent in the obesity epidemic Both of the drugs    and    were approved in July Belviq works in a similar way to the fenphen appetitesuppression drug combination that was pulled from the market in  because of a link to fatal heart valve problems The new drug at a lower dose has been shown to be safe Belviq was developed specifically to avoid the receptor on the heart valve which had been associated with heart damage and theres no evidence in our research that heart valve problems will develop says   a researcher and obesity specialist at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center which conducted studies of the two medications for the drug makers Qsymia is a timereleased combination of two older medications topiramate an antiseizure medicine and phentermine a stimulant It is more powerful than Belviq but works in a similar way to stave off the bodys starvation response to weight loss Most of us who have tried to lose weight are familiar with that Hormones are released to stimulate appetite and metabolism slows down in order to conserve energy adding up to an unfortunate recipe for regaining weight  an obesity specialist at New Yorks Columbia University Medical Center says her patients know this well I have one patient who came in and said hes lost the weight of a Volkswagen during his lifetime she says Its like  pounds hes lost  pounds and gained it back and lost and regained Ryan says the drugs work to make you feel satisfied with less food  and not as hungry between meals The medications are working through biology  to reduce appetite and to diminish hunger she says adding that people still have to diet The drugs dont work magic in the body They simply help people eat less Patients must intentionally go on a diet try to reduce food intake and increase physical activity Ryan says The new prescriptiononly medications dont do anything to boost metabolism Only exercise helps with that There are side effects from the medications including dry mouth constipation and a slight tingling in fingers and toes But Qsymia can also have serious side effects It can increase heart rate and it can cause birth defects So women who want to become pregnant should stay away from the drug Both drugs must be prescribed by a doctor Women of childbearing age are advised not to become pregnant Belviq may interfere with treatments for migraine headache or depression Patients should consult with their doctor to see if either drug is right for them Neither is right for people who want to lose weight for a wedding or get into their bikini for summer Ryan says They were approved to treat people who are obese body mass index over  or who are overweight body mass index over  and who suffer from at least one weightrelated problem such as high blood pressure cholesterol or blood sugar Decreasing blood sugar in particular says Ryan is the drugs biggest benefit We know if we can get that modest weight loss we can prevent the development of Type  diabetes Type  diabetes is a chronic disease and its reaching epidemic proportions in the United States and we really need to get the jump on that she says In studies patients lost between  percent and  percent of their original body weight and diabetes risk was reduced Korner says the new medications are a welcome option for her patients most of whom do not want to have surgery to reduce the size of their stomach Were slowly starting to come around to treat obesity as we treat other chronic diseases just like we do for controlling blood pressure cholesterol and a multitude of other diseases she says But Cindy Pearson with the National Womens Health Network cautions that those benefits may not be enough to justify potential risks Both of these drugs have met a very modest test of maybe around about  percent weight loss and theres hope that over the long term if you can maintain  percent weight loss you would start to get some health benefit but we actually dont know if thats true she says Pearson says longterm studies are needed to ensure both drugs safety We really think women and all consumers deserve better information before these drugs are marketed widely she says Qsymia became available this month but   Belviq is expected to become available around the beginning of next year
