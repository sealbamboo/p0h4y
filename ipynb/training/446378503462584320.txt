One year ago Pavel Rucsineanu was running out of options Drugresistant tuberculosis was ravaging his lungs And the disease had evolved into an incurable form doctors said Its like an infectious cancer Dr Tetru Alexandriuc   at the time We have no other medicines to treat Pavel the doctor added Although he wouldnt say it the doctor expected   would kill Pavel But Pavels wife Oxana had other ideas Oxana once had   too She and Pavel fell in love back in  when they were both patients at a TB hospital in   The couple had their first child a few years ago Oxana had managed to get herself cured of TB Then she set out to help her husband Her strategy Get Pavel some of the new medicines that shed heard could attack even the most deadly strains of the bacterium In  the US Food and Drug Administration   the first new TB medicine in  years The drug called   was developed specifically for treating drugresistant tuberculosis But Oxana couldnt get the drug imported to Moldova We wrote a lot of letters to the government she says And the official answer was that there is no legal framework to bring a medical product that is not yet authorized in our country So Oxana went after another drug an antibiotic called   which the European Medicines Agency had recently approved for use against TB Getting this drug also proved to be a huge challenge Moldova hadnt yet approved linezolid for use And the medication was prohibitively expensive Pfizer has linezolid patented under the brand name Zyvox And a onemonth supply costs more than  here in the US But Oxana was still not deterred She contacted the nonprofit   in New York and managed to get a sixmonth supply of linezolid for Pavel From the time you saw him a year ago hes gained  kilos  pounds Oxana says Hes feeling much better  Hes saying hes cured already But we know that we have some time in front of us with this TB We have to follow the treatment to the end But his results so far give us big power to move on The treatment with linezolid however is no walk in the park Oxana hasnt yet managed to secure enough of the drug for a full course of treatment which takes  months And the drug comes with serious side effects The most common is   a form of nerve damage It is difficult but not more difficult than other drugresistant TB therapy Oxana says All the drugresistant therapies are difficult It took about a month and a half for him to get used to the side effects Linezolid also has to be taken with a battery of other medicines under the direction of Pavels doctors Its more than  pills per day Oxana says Yeah more than  pills per day But finally after years of treatment for tuberculosis Pavels health is improving Hes no longer infectious no longer coughing the potentially lethal bacteria into the air And the young father is finally able to move out of the TB hospital and into a small apartment with Oxana and their son Thank God and thank a lot of people who did a lot for Pavel and my family Oxana says Hes right good now And we are very happy about it
