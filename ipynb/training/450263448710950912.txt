Thirty years ago the small town of Denmark SC had one of the states highest teen pregnancy rates We had very young grandparents grandparents were maybe in their s says Michelle Nimmons who has worked for the past  years on the issue of teen pregnancy Greatgrandmamas were in their s and parents were in their teens so a lot of education had to happen Efforts like hers have paid off in Denmark and around the country in the past couple of decades Since the s teen pregnancies have decreased by more than  percent as a   from The Brookings Institution reports In  the    babies were born to women aged  years a number the CDC calls a record low Despite those declines in the United States the US still has one of the   in the industrialized world says Forrest Alton chief executive officer of the South Carolina Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy Frankly its not even close Alton says We certainly can pause for a moment to celebrate the progress that weve made but by no means should we wash our hands of this issue and think we have it solved Denmark now has one of the lowest teen pregnancy rates in South Carolina and now every student there gets comprehensive sex education starting in middle school But those changes were hardfought over many years Nimmons tells NPRs Rachel Martin that the biggest challenge to reducing teen pregnancies has been getting people to acknowledge that theres a problem in the first place Remember South Carolina is the Bible Belt  and churches are the central focus of the community Nimmons says We had to convince parents that we were really just wanting to reinforce the values that they were teaching in their homes Because we truly believe that abstinence is the best option for young people and thats what parents want for their children Teen pregnancy is not only about young women and Nimmons says they recognized this and focused their program on the boys in the community as well She says the boys also needed to understand the consequences of having unprotected sex both emotional and financial We have sessions where young men and young ladies are there talking together and learning the curriculum together because its important for them to have those conversations she says Though Nimmons isnt afraid to meet teenagers where they are when it comes to talking about sex not all adults are comfortable in those conversations So some former students help by acting as mentors for current students The program relies on local businesses  some owned by those former students  to help carry its sex education message too For example while part of the program is promoting the use of condoms distributing condoms in South Carolinas schools is not permitted Thats where local businesses can step in to help make condoms available Despite the Denmark programs success Alton says theres still a tremendous amount of work left to be done Alton wants more funding for teen pregnancy prevention programs to send a clear social message to kids that abstinence is best but that safe sex is a must And he says parents still need to get better at having honest and early conversations with kids about sex and about the risks and responsibilities that come with it
