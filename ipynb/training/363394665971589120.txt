Rates of homicide and other violent crimes often spike in cities during heat waves People get cranky Tempers flare So as the Earth gets hotter because of climate change will it also become more violent Many scientists have thought so And now a team of economists offers   for just how much weather changes might amplify human conflict The analysis published in this weeks  includes largescale events  such as war and riots  and also personal conflicts including murders rapes and domestic violence Not all climate watchers agree with their estimates But if the economists prediction is right climate change could boost conflicts between nations and ethnic groups by as much as  percent by  and interpersonal violence by  percent Previous research has found correlations between extreme weather  droughts and flooding  and escalating wars and civil unrest Often the violence is associated with   or unemployment Other reports have linked hot temperatures and increased aggression  everything from higher rates of domestic violence to more hornhonking on freeways Heat may even boost the likelihood that baseball pitchers   with pitches one study suggests The likely connection between weather fluctuations and conflict dates back at least  years says   an assistant professor of public policy at the University of California Berkeley who led the current metaanalysis One of the worlds first powerful empires     collapsed during a period of drought Hsiang tells Shots Almost all Chinese dynasties collapsed during dry episodes And they didnt get restarted until the climate shifted back More recently with climate change now on everybodys radar research exploring the possible weatherviolence link has exploded Hsiang and his team found about  papers touching on the topic They whittled the list for their analysis to just the  most rigorous studies Hsiang says and thats when they saw a clear trend When temperature or rainfall deviates much from the average whether up or down violence is more likely to occur For each standard deviation rise in temperature  which is about  degrees Celsius in New York City for example  interpersonal violence is predicted to increase by about  percent and largescale clashes by  percent Conflicts arise from strains in personal relationships or intercultural relationships Hsiang adds Extreme weather increases the likelihood that those strains turn into violence Some researchers caution that Hsaings study paints an incomplete picture of the causes of conflict It would be a mistake if readers of this paper felt that the world has become a violent place as the climate changes environmental scientist   of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution tells Shots The aggregate picture is not that Recently the world has become less violent Street crime in the US has been steadily declining for a couple of decades Solow notes And parts of subSaharan Africa have clearly seen changes in climate but civil conflict there has decreased overall That doesnt mean that climate has no effect on violence Solow adds But other factors  economic and social  affect the rate of violence and are probably responsible for the observed decline
