How early can autism be detected in babies and how soon can they be treated A babys first birthday visit to the pediatrician usually includes a screening for the social deficits common with autism spectrum disorder But doctors and scientists tend to agree that they cant make a very reliable diagnosis until the toddler is  years old The bulk of treatment programs begin then Several recent studies however have documented subtle signs of the disorder including erratic eye motion among infants as young at   That and other behavioral differences become more noticeable between  months and a year of age other studies have shown Researchers at UC Davis MIND Institute have been watching and playing with babies for many years to study autism and other development issues This time researchers set out to test whether they could accurately identify early signs associated with autism and whether parents would be willing and able to follow directed therapy aimed at improving interaction with their babies And if they did would it help The study published online Tuesday in the Journal of Autism and Development Disorders suggests a qualified yes on all counts The data from the pilot program jibe with a growing body of research that shows that guided social interaction between a mother and her baby can decrease autism symptoms by age  The babies whose parents underwent the coaching showed far fewer autismrelated measures at  than peers whose parents declined to participate even though their infants met all criteria Infants in the training program also scored higher than nonparticipants who later were diagnosed with autism the study found It gives us a little hint that the children may well have gone on to have more difficulties had we not done this intervention early said lead investigator Sally J Rogers a developmental psychologist at the MIND Institute But its only a hint not proof The sample of the pilot study was small  just seven babies from UC Davis programs or the community underwent training and babies were not assigned randomly to different treatments So results will have to withstand more rigorous testing In some ways the study was as much a test for parents as for babies Researchers wanted to know whether mothers could be professionally coached to maximize opportunities to connect with babies who often dont make eye contact and can exhibit repetitive behaviors and become obsessed with a single toy or other object These and other symptoms had been identified among study subjects through the Autism Observation Scale for Infants and other clinical measures These were very atypical infants and everyone who interacted with them recognized that Rogers said So I do think we found a group of children who had very atypical social communication development Mothers with their babies went through  weekly onehour training and observation sessions with professional therapists Several families received booster sessions or were referred to extra therapy such as speech coaching Babies underwent regular developmental testing usually at intervals of three months until they were  months old Control groups were culled from  infants enrolled at the MIND Institutes Infant Sibling project which studies the development trajectory of siblings of children with autism diagnoses In some ways rapid developmental progress is not surprising particularly since mothers were teaching skills appropriate for their babies ages the authors acknowledge Were capitalizing on an incredible period of brain development and natural learning Rogers said But parents of children with autism can unwittingly miss opportunities for natural learning because their infants dont transmit the expected cues  facial contact and babbling among them Or they may opt not to disturb infants who are quietly occupied most of the time If that goes on for a long time children are having fewer and fewer chances to learn and thats going to have its effect over time Rogers said And thats why its important that children get into treatment as soon as their symptoms emerge Rogers cautioned that later interventions also have shown promise Theres no reason to think that children would do better if theyre getting these interventions earlier rather than later she said And in fact most children havent shown their symptoms this early Clinical measures of autism symptoms also can be problematic A San Diego County study involving  toddlers over several years showed that  who exhibited problems on a question   at age  later developed either autism language delay or more general developmental delays That also means there was a  false positive rate
