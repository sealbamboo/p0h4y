When Richard Larson cowrote a   about the perils of upanddown funding for the National Institutes of Health he noted that the research cycled between states of euphoria and a hangover far greater than youd expect The editors of the journal   at first argued that those labels were inflammatory says   who is an engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology But he successfully argued that the wording was spot on It turns out theres a natural amplifier in the NIH grantfunding system It leads to higher highs and lower lows when budgets rise and fall And Larsons analysis offers lessons for avoiding the pain of boomandbust funding that is currently causing some scientists to spend more time writing grant proposals than they spend conducting research The key ingredient in this surprise budget problem is that most grants given out to scientists are promised for four years Onequarter of the funding is given out in four consecutive years One consequence of that system is that in any given year threequarters of the budget goes to pay for grants approved in the three previous years The remaining quarter  for grants that have run their fouryear course  is available for new projects This formula works fine when funding is the same year to year But Larson looked at what happens in a year when theres a big increase It turns out a  percent increase in funding for one year leads to a whopping  percent increase in money available for new grants Thats a huge jump How so Well existing grants dont require any more funding than before so the entire increase goes to new projects If funding increases from  billion to  billion for example existing grants require threequarters of the  billion   billion That leaves  billion for new grants Thats a huge jump from the previous year where new grants garnered  billion Thats the euphoria part of this equation But wait A hangover is on the way In the case of the real NIH budget funding doubled between  and  After that the funding flattened out Naturally the existing grants given out during the time of budget increases required a lot more money to support And as a result the amount of money available for new grants took a huge tumble In fact money for new grants plunged by more than  percent in a single year according to Larsons simplified mathematical model even though the overall budget was simply flat Thats a bad hangover Once you see it in black and white you say Oh my God its obvious Larson tells Shots Its very simple mathematics but the implications for policy are profound Scientists who had the bad fortune of having their grants expire in a hangover year were in big trouble The chances of getting renewed fell through the floor As Larson and his colleagues at MIT and Ohio State University ran the numbers they found a simple mathematical solution to this The NIH could have avoided the worst of the hangover by holding back some of the largess and spreading it out over several years Thats what a prudent business could have done Not so the NIH By federal law they have to spend everything They cant carry over he says Larson says the NIH can use other techniques to limit funding shocks for scientists For example they can adjust the length of grants so some run three years some go for four and others go for five That would reduce the euphoria and hangovers But it may give some scientists headaches since they tend to think in terms of fouryear funding blocks and they plan their research accordingly Sally Rockey the NIH Deputy Director for Extramural Research says the institute is acutely aware of these mathematical quirks and takes steps to minimize them For example last year the federal budget sequester removed  billion from the NIH budget so the agency reduced the number of grants  but also took the extraordinary step of reducing the size of grants that had previously been approved This year congress returned about  billion to the NIH budget it had withheld from the sequester and that enabled NIH to increase the number of new grants approved by  to  Rockey says The NIH contemplated the future commitments involved in new grants when deciding how many more to fund And of course NIH doesnt know what lies in store for future grants Obviously it would be a lot easier if our budget was on some sort of stable trajectory if we had something that gave us more predictability and a little growth each year she tells Shots Larson can relate Hes hoping to explore other solutions to the NIH problem  that is if he can get fresh funding His fouryear NIH grant to study this issue has expired
