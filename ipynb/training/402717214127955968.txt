Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker is one of  Republican governors who are rejecting the health laws expansion of Medicaid But Wisconsins own Medicaid program known as BadgerCare is more generous than that of many states and now Walker wants to transfer many people out of BadgerCare and into the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act Its a plan that allows Walker to reject a key part of Obamacare by turning down federal money offered to help states pay for the expansion of Medicaid But it also may make it possible for Wisconsin to still provide health coverage to many of the states poor and working poor residents And for a governor who appears to be gearing up for a  presidential bid that may not be a bad strategy Its part of overall reform Walker said in February when he announced the states plan The goal he said is to get more people out into the workplace more people covered when it comes to health care and fewer people dependent on the government not because weve kicked them out but weve empowered them to take control of their own destiny Walkers plan will open up Medicaid in Wisconsin to about  poor childless adults starting Jan  They were previously locked out because of a cap on the number of people who could be in the program At the same time Walker announced that the state   for  people who have incomes above the poverty line Walkers maneuver is possible because the states Medicaid program was already one of the more inclusive in the country It allowed people making up to  percent of the federal poverty level to be covered by BadgerCare Now the governor wants to roll BadgerCare eligibility back to  percent of the poverty line and put everyone making between  percent and  percent  a range of  to  for a single person  into private subsidized coverage that they buy on the new marketplace Walker says everyone losing coverage will be able to buy subsidized plans under the Affordable Care Act and many will find monthly premiums under  Youre going to hear some detractors claim that moving people to the private market or to the exchanges isnt affordable Walker said in February But he maintains that these critics arent aware of how much the subsidies will bring down the cost of coverage Jessica Jaglowski is a stayathome mom in Milwaukee who recently got a letter from the state saying she would be dropped from Medicaid Her husband will be able to get coverage through his job and their kids can stay on Medicaid so Jaglowski is the only one who will need to seek new insurance Its somewhat comforting to hear that there are exchange options available but we dont know what those will mean and what will be covered and what doctors well get to see says Jaglowski It is very stressful and its overwhelming looking through the plans because we dont even know really where to start Walkers changes put Wisconsin in a unique position says   a health policy researcher at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities a think tank in Washington DC The state is moving people off Medicaid but everyone under the poverty line still has a chance at getting coverage which isnt the case in all states There is a positive part of the story which is that everybody does have a pathway to coverage Solomon says In some states that also rejected a full expansion of Medicaid Solomon notes there are adults who dont qualify for it yet and are too poor to get subsidies on the exchange Solomon says Wisconsin is a longtime leader in serving the poor and the states decision to reject federal funds offered to the states to expand their Medicaid enrollment is puzzling from a fiscal perspective Its ironic to me that when you have the pathway to providing a uniform system of coverage with the rest of the country theyve decided to go in the opposite direction she says States that rejected a full expansion are seeing bigger increases in the Medicaid costs Solomon says citing   And a nonpartisan review   will cost state taxpayers an additional  million through  than if hed gone for a full expansion that would have pulled more federal dollars into the state Governors who have rejected the federal funds for Medicaid expansion say it would be a shortterm windfall that wouldnt cover the longterm costs of coverage Last week Walker said he would tweak his plan because of the troubled startup of   the Web portal for  states that are relying on the federal government to run their marketplaces Walker says he will let people set to be dropped from Medicaid on Jan  stay on the rolls three months longer so they have more time to sign up for plans on HealthCaregov We are going to take decisive action to make sure that the people of this state particularly people in need do not fall through the cracks Walker said The reprieve is likely to clear the state Legislature in the next few weeks Walkers Medicaid plan requires a waiver from the federal government which is pending but expected to be approved
