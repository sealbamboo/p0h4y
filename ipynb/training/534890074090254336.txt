Try as they might to adjust to a schedule that has them toiling while others sleep swingshift workers do not fool their bodies into burning calories and using nutrients the way people who obey their internal circadian clocks do says a new study The result  a metabolism that burns fewer calories during sleep and slows down at night despite work demands  could help explain why those who work overnight shifts are more likely to be obese and to develop type  diabetes In a   conducted by UniversityÂ  of Colorado sleep specialists  lean healthy adults agreed to turn their days upsidedown progressively over a sixday period Checking into a University of Colorado clinical research facility the volunteers were all fed a diet sufficient to maintain their weight They simulated a sleepwake schedule that started with two regular working days and then made a transition to three night shifts in a row Published Monday in the journal PNAS the research reported that as subjects commenced their simulated swingshift schedule their bodies first responded by revving higher for the first hour period that their sleepwake schedule was transposed they burned  calories more than they had during an ordinary baseline day At no point in the sixday experiment did subjects adapt to a snoozebyday workbynight schedule by boosting production of the sleepfriendly hormone metatonin in the day and curtailing it at night But their bodies quickly adapted to the reversal by turning their thermostats down Compared to the baseline readings taken on their arrival a day when they were awake by day and asleep eight hours at night the subjects burned  fewer calories on day  of their swingshift schedule and  fewer calories on day  of that schedule The lower energy expenditure came both during daytime sleep and during nighttime wakefulness their sleep was more fragmented and their energy expenditure at night when they were awake but their bodies were accustomed to sleeping remained suppressed As their upsidedown schedules entered days  and  their bodies became more efficient at using fat but less efficient at using carbohydrates and protein Despite reduced levels of the satiety hormone leptin on days  and  subjects reported lower levels of hunger And the thermic effect of a latenight dinner  the revving that signals the body has taken on a new infusion of fuel  was significantly more muted than their baseline response to an endofday dinner The study lacked a control group and it lasted only six days which hardly allows researchers to predict how a worker will adapt to a schedule that consistently upends sleepwake cycles or to one that does so inconsistently But it does suggest that even a brief circadian misalignment puts the metabolism into a lower gear Even if the reversal of night and day activities is occasional burning  to  calories a day fewer without adjusting ones diet accordingly every once in awhile is a formula for weight gain And the study may explain why despite evidence suggesting that night workers eat no more than those on a normal sleepwake schedule they more often struggle with obesity The researchers also point out that shift work is wearing and that hardly bodes well for a workers exercise schedule As increased exhaustion and fatigue levels mount a shift workers physical activity levels are bound to decline they suggested further upsetting their metabolism
