If you take a Geiger counter with you on your next flight youll notice the dial ratchet up as the plane approaches cruising altitude Every time you fly you get zapped by a little extra radiation from space It goes right through you in teensy amounts Its usually nothing to worry about even if youre pregnant But for people who fly a lot  like the planes crew  that sort of exposure might in rare instances amount to something Research   Wednesday in   shows that pilots and other air crew members have approximately twice the incidence of melanoma compared to the general population The studys authors say that difference might be partially due to inflight exposure to UV and   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is using computer models to look into how working as a flight attendant might affect reproductive health A   in the journal   looked at data from  million flights and found that some flight attendants may exceed recommended radiation limits This would be uncommon but it does happen says Jeri Anderson a health physicist with NIOSH and lead author of the study It could be at a level that could be of concern and in excess of the national recommended dose for a pregnant woman In some countries including the United States members of a flight crew are considered radiation workers According to NASA researchers a pilot who routinely works longhaul flights may be exposed to   the radiation of the average landlubber and   a fuelcycle worker in a nuclear power plant Galactic cosmic rays may sound like beams from an alien weapon but theyre actually the charged particles emitted by stars including our sun In an instrument called a cloud chamber they   gentle wisps When   by violinists they sound like buzzing flies The rays pass through us all whizzing through you every day of your life delivering a smidgen of radiation says radiation physicist Robert Barish   a book about inflight radiation On a longhaul flight particularly at high latitudes that smidgen can become a dollop There are a few reasons for that At a passenger jets cruising altitude   feet or more above the ground  the protective layer of atmosphere that surrounds the Earth and deflects cosmic rays isnt as dense The Earths   is also weaker over the poles which means that more radiation enters at high latitudes And the sun sometimes lets loose with space weather delivering  times   than usual Airlines in European Union countries   their employees as if they were working directly with radioactive materials Elsewhere Canada and Japan have issued similar recommendations US airlines tend to be less prescriptive though the Federal Aviation Administration has published   to advise them The possible health ramifications for flight crews are still   NASA is developing a space weather   that might be used to give airlines a heads up when rays are likely to be particularly intense The International Commission on Radiological Protection is working on a report on the subject And an upcoming NIOSH study will look at the possible impact of flight on the risk of miscarriage Evidence that solar radiation has any   is scanty researchers say The science says that the fetus is particularly sensitive between the eighth and th week says Jacques Lochard leader on the upcoming ICRP report This is the sensitive period for IQ loss But most of that information is based on cases of extreme exposure he says such as the children of atomic bomb survivors who would have received a different kind of radiation and in doses much higher than those experienced on a plane flight Radiation is only one part of why European airlines encourage female staff to declare their pregnancy as soon as possible Jet lag for example which entails a disruption of circadian rhythms might also affect reproductive health Even if the risk from occupational exposure to cosmic radiation is small airlines should routinely provide information that would enable flight crew members to figure out their lifetime exposure as a matter of respect Lochard says Judith Murawski   with the Association of Flight Attendants agrees Would it be justified to not mention to nuclear workers that theyre being exposed to radiation she asks Its the same There isnt much crews or passengers can do about their exposure short of avoiding polar flights or taking a boat instead Flying airlines at low altitudes would burn more fuel and it wouldnt make sense to encase jets in heavy protective material But commercial airlines can heed warnings about unusual space weather so they can change flight paths And pregnant air crew can choose flight routes that travel at lower altitude and latitude Anyone can estimate their own exposure with various online   or check out   conditions as Murawski did when she was pregnant Had there been a solar storm of   then I would not have flown she says Of course many travelers dont have that level of flexibility or concern Barbara Grajewski an   with NIOSH says at the end of the day its about probability The more youre exposed the higher the probability that youve somewhat increased your risk of something like cancer or prenatal defects That may sound scary But this   from the blog Information is Beautiful helps put things in perspective As the diagram makes clear walking through an airport security scanner exposes a person to about the same ionizing radiation dose as eating a banana Flying from New York to Los Angeles exposes you to roughly the same amount of radiation youd get from eight dental Xrays  and less than youd get living in a stone house for a year And those peanuts that airlines hand out Theyre   radioactive too Radiation is one example of where people have such a wrong idea about what is dangerous and are also unaware of its ubiquitous nature says Barish Radiation is all around us It is in us
