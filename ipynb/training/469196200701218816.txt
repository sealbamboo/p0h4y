Popeye and our parents have been valiantly trying to persuade us to eat our veggies for decades now But Americans just dont eat as many fruits and vegetables as we should And when we do theyre mainly potatoes and tomatoes  in the notsonutritious forms of french fries and pizza according to a   from the US Department of Agriculture Americans eat  cups of vegetables daily on average the USDA finds But the national   recommend  to  cups a day for adults And more than half our veggie intake comes from potatoes and tomatoes whereas only  percent comes from dark green and orange veggies like spinach carrots and sweet potatoes Of course potatoes are great on their own  theyre a good   of potassium But most Americans eat them with a hefty side of fat and sodium According to the USDAs handy chart at home most people get their potato fix in the form of chips And when eating out about  percent of the potatoes we consume are fried Baked potatoes are also popular but most people dont eat the skin  a great source of fiber that fills you up Tomatoes start out   as well and theyre a good way to boost your vitamin A and C intake Tomato sauce on the other hand can pack in a lot of hidden sugar and salt While a cup of raw tomato has about  milligrams of sodium canned tomato sauce can contain more than  milligrams of sodium per cup according to the USDA And even potatoes and tomatoes in their healthy forms dont make for a complete balanced diet Americans eat far less fiber than they should the researchers say and fiber is found in dark green and orange veggies As weve   fiber can make you gassy but its essential to a healthy microbiome After a  government nutrition report found that higher fruit consumption correlated with a lower body mass index but not vegetable consumption USDA researchers decided to look more into how Americans are getting their vegetables We started thinking about it and realized its quite common to just pick up a piece of fruit and eat it asis says   a nutritionist at the USDAs Economic Research Service who coauthored the report But that wasnt the case for vegetables Vegetables often need to be peeled cut and cooked so theyre just not as handy So maybe this tomato and potato finding isnt a huge shocker Just a few years ago public health experts were   whether school lunch programs should get to count a slice of pizza as a serving of vegetables and fries have garnered their share of   in recent school lunch battles too But as Guthrie tells The Salt the report is a reminder that we need to pay more attention to how we prepare our vegetables We all want to have a healthful diet she says So mind the sugar and sodium and branch out from pizza and french fries
