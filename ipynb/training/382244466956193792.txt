Im getting off lightly Dr Stoffregen a professor of kinesiology uses the apparatus to study motion sickness and often subjects must stand and endure subtle computerdriven oscillations in the walls until they are dizzy and swaying Dr Stoffregens research has also taken him on cruises  cruise ships are to motion sickness what hospitals are to pneumonia No ones ever vomited in our lab he said But our cruises are a different story For decades now Dr Stoffregen  director of the universitys Affordance PerceptionAction Laboratory has been amassing evidence in support of a surprising theory about the causes of motion sickness The problem does not arise in the inner ear he believes but rather in a disturbance in the bodys system for maintaining posture The idea once largely ignored is beginning to gain grudging recognition Most theories say when you get motion sick you lose your equilibrium said Robert Kennedy a psychology professor at the University of Central Florida Stoffregen says because you lose your equilibrium you get motion sick Motion sickness is probably a problem as old as passive transportation The word nausea derives from the Greek for boat but the wellknown symptoms arise from a variety of stimuli lurching on the back of a camel say or riding the TiltaWhirl at a fair Pandemonium the perpetually seasick Charles Darwin called it No definitive explanation for it exists In  Dr Michel Treisman a psychologist at the University of Oxford proposed that   If taste or the guts chemosensory system fail to detect a toxin in a meal he said then perhaps the dizziness loss of coordination and vomiting exist as a fallback system Whatever its origins Dr Stoffregen said motion sickness may worsen with the proliferation of digital devices and displays We travel turbulent skies we bury our noses in smartphones play video games on moving buses Anecdotal reports suggest that Google Glass and Apples latest software update iOS can induce motion sickness Dr Stoffregen has published research on   Despite its prevalence   the director of the Man Vehicle Lab at MIT said There has been relatively little research on nausea vomiting and motion sickness in the modern era Most of the research is  or  years old Dr Oman believes neuroscience may confirm the traditional explanation known as the sensory conflict theory which holds that motion sickness arises because of a conflict in the inner ear when the perception of movement in the brain doesnt match stored patterns Its generally accepted that a functioning vestibular system is a prerequisite for motion sickness An unlikely study published in  for example found that   on a narrow wooden boat in foot swells off the shore of Nova Scotia Dr Stoffregen rejects the theory which he says fails to explain why women are more prone to motion sickness than men or why its harder to stomach being a passenger than a driver He argues that humans become nauseated in situations where they have not yet learned strategies effective in maintaining a stable posture The body has a subtle natural wobble or postural sway In one study he found that the more a video game players head swayed the more likely he was afterward to experience symptoms of motion sickness In   pregnant women who experienced morning sickness also exhibited more swaying A   can predict whether he will feel sick after a few punches to the head Dr Stoffregen has reported Similarly undergrads prone to seasickness   before embarking on a semester at sea Widening ones stance reduced the swaying and the risk of motion sickness Simply put Dr Stoffregen believes new movement patterns must be learned and until they are the bodys posturemaintenance system rebels  along with the stomach Some people adapt more quickly Still like the common cold there may be no single explanation for motion sickness Neither he nor anyone else has explained why there should be any subjective consequences to getting in a car or why we maintain a lifelong talent for riding a bicycle while even experienced sailors struggle at sea after months on land Current treatments for motion sickness do little more than induce drowsiness Dr Stoffregen said On a recent cruise the crew spent two days wondering where hed disappeared to He was in his room another scientist laid low by the very thing he studies He refuses to take Dramamine or any of the countless alternative treatments I know they dont work for me Not even as a placebo
