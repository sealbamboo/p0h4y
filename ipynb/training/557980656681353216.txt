Do hormones drive volatility in world financial markets According to new research chronically high levels of the stress hormone cortisol can alter the behavior of beleaguered financial traders boosting their risk aversion and inspiring irrational pessimism In a   published Monday in journal PNAS researchers found that London financial traders experienced a  increase in cortisol levels during periods of market volatility When researchers reproduced similar levels of chemicals in human subjects in the lab they observed a large change in the study participantss willingness to take on risk Any trader knows that their body is taken on a roller coaster ride by the markets said study coauthor John Coates a former Wall Street derivatives trader who researches neuroscience and finance at the University of Cambridge What we havent known until this study was that these physiological changes  the subclinical levels of stress of which we are only dimly aware  are actually altering our ability to take risk It is frightening to realize that no one in the financial world  not the traders not the risk managers not the central bankers  knows that these subterranean shifts in risk appetite are taking place Coates wrote in a prepared statement on the research Risk and the willingness of humans to accept it are key focuses of economics and finance While games and experiments designed to measure risk aversion often assume that peoples decisionmaking is consistent Coates and his colleagues say this is not the case Physiological factors play a role as well Cortisol is secreted by the adrenal glands during times of stress While the hormone can increase physical arousal aid memory and help in learning chronic longterm exposure can impair the immune system reduce mental attention and produce anxiety and depression among other effects Researchers began their study by testing levels of cortisol in London traders who were responding to erratic markets over a period of eight days The traders revealed a  increase over their mean daily cortisol levels researchers said By way of comparison physical trauma or surgery can increase cortisol levels up to  In order to examine how elevated hormone levels might impact decisionmaking researchers enlisted the help of  volunteers   men and  women between the ages of  and  Some of the group were given hydrocortisone pills  the pharmaceutical form of cortisol  while others were given placebos for a period of eight days During this time the study subjects also played computerized lotterystyle games in which they could win real cash Researchers found that while an initial increase in cortisol appeared not to effect decisionmaking chronic and sustained cortisol levels resulted in a noticeable drop in their willingness to accept risky propositions High cortisol subjects exhibited a large reduction in their risk premium  the amount of additional risk someone will tolerate for the prospect of winning more money Researchers said the premium dropped by  for those who had elevated cortisol levels Interestingly while some studies have concluded that women are more risk averse than men Coates and his colleagues did not find this to be the case in their study Study authors said that based on their findings the role of cortisol in world financial markets could be widereaching They speculated that hormones may have exacerbated the credit crisis of  to  when volatility in US equities reached historically high levels Chronic stress authors wrote may have decreased risktaking just when the economy needed it most when markets are crashing and need traders and investors to buy distressed assets Physiologyinduced shifts in risk preferences may thus be a cause of market instability that has been hitherto overlooked by economists risk managers and central bankers authors concluded
