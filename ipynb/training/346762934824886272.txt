The young sisters played outside together every day that summer in a Vallejo Calif suburb and during one long boring summer day the older girl thought of a new way to pass the time She led her little sister to the backyard tethered the yearold to one of the poles on the back porch then taped her eyelashes to her eyebrows and left her there to stare into the bright California sun Thats the account of Nancy Kilgore now  and living in Sacramento who says she doesnt remember feeling physical pain that day She just remembers feeling helpless I just basically got to a point where I accepted anything my sister said or did says Kilgore Back then Kilgore didnt know she was a victim but she says she believes now that she grew up as a bullied sibling a group thats drawing new attention from doctors and researchers who warn parents that such childhood battles may not be as benign as many believe  The antibullying movement has exploded in the last decade and a half  every state but Montana has now passed   the   Bullying as its typically understood takes place between unrelated peers  its kids being cruel at school taunting each other or beating each other up  But a new study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics is a reminder that bullying also happens at home between brothers and sisters And as with peer bullying sibling bullying is also harmful to a child or teenagers mental health the new research finds  Historically sibling aggression has been unrecognized or often minimized or dismissed and in some cases people believe its benign or even good for learning about conflict in other relationships says Corinna Jenkins Tucker lead author of the paper and an associate professor of family studies at the University of New Hampshire  Thats generally not the case in peer relationships There appears to be different norms for what is accepted What is acceptable between siblings is generally not acceptable between peers The mental health consequences of bullying between siblings are real researchers say Tuckers report used data from The National Survey of Childrens Exposure to Violence a phone survey that collected the experiences of  children aged  month to  years who had at least one sibling younger than  living in the household at the time of the interview One child was randomly selected to be the subject of three telephone interviews  Children ages  to  answered the questions themselves for children younger than  the parents answered the questions Tucker acknowledges this is a potential limitation of the study as parents may not know as much about sibling conflicts as they might think  particularly if the children share a bedroom  The interviewers asked about incidences of sibling aggression in the past year and they also assessed mental health by asking how often the children experienced anger depression and anxiety  Of the children interviewed or interviewed by proxy  percent reported experiencing at least one type of sibling victimization in the past year Researchers found that all types of sibling aggression both mild and severe were associated with significantly higher distress symptom scores for both children and adolescents the study authors write  At school the lines are much more defined If a kid punches or kicks or relentlessly teases another kid in his or her class  thats bullying But at home if a brother or sister does the same it might be dismissed as just another sibling squabble The difference between normal sibling shenanigans and sibling aggression is a little murky  The accepted attitude is Well children will be children and that this is a normal rite of passage for being a human being says Kilgore who writes the blog   and has written a   about bullying And thats true in a way If you have a brother or sister he or she is probably the first person you ever fought with That can be a good thing Tucker says  most sibling conflicts and competitiveness are normal and they can teach children constructive ways of fighting and negotiating  John Caffaro a psychologist in private practice in Del Mar Calif a San Diego suburb says one of the biggest red flags signaling sibling bullying is this One child is always the aggressor and another child is always the victim Parents should also look for signs of aggression that aims to leave the other child feeling humiliated or defeated  Moving forward Tucker hopes some of the many antibullying programs that exist today will begin to include a focus on sibling aggression  Children who were bullied by a sibling but not at school fared a little better than the children for whom the opposite was true the study showed Still the emotional impact of being bullied in your own home by a brother or sister you trust or look up to isnt easily dismissed  Think about it You may be sharing a room with your worst enemy Thats much worse than meeting this bully once a week at school says Caffaro who has written several books on sibling abuse including Sibling Abuse Trauma which will be published this fall Also this brother or sister knows you better than anyone else so they know how to get to you quickly Kilgore says that as a small child the bullying was all the more hurtful because as mean as her sister got she couldnt stop loving her Her family disputes her account of bullying says Kilgore and she cut off contact with them a decade ago But back then I was in love with her Kilgore says I just adored my sister
