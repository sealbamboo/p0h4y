A boy with irreversible brain damage should be taken off a lifesupport machine despite the objections of his parents a High Court judge has ruled Ms Justice Russell said she had reached her decision after a Family Division hearing to assess what was in the boys best interests with great reluctance The oneyearold who was born prematurely now requires ventilation His mother said she believed he might recover and doctors did not have to right to end his life He is still alive she told the judge Miracles do happen The boys father told the court We know he is reacting to certain things He still has life We dont have the right as parents as individuals to take this privilege from him The case followed an application by the NHS foundation trust which runs the hospital where the boy is being cared for  Neither the boy nor his parents or the hospital can be identified and the judge said the restriction on naming the trust would remain as long as the boy was alive Ms Justice Russell described the case as unbearably sad and said she had nothing but sympathy for the boys parents  As committed and devout Christians they dont feel they have the right to agree to lifesustaining treatment being withdrawn she added The parents believe in the possibility of recovery That is not the opinion of the medical experts The court heard the boy was born prematurely by emergency Caesarean section in poor condition He suffered an acute cardiorespiratory deterioration which required him to be mechanically ventilated once again in late    Specialists told the court the boy had suffered profound irreversible brain damage and chronic lung disease and it was in his best interests for the lifesustaining intensive care to be withdrawn Claire Watson a lawyer representing the trust told the judge the mother remains firmly of the view that her son is able to sense her presence and the presence of father and gains pleasure from certain activities  in particular having his face washed Her deep religious feelings and beliefs lead her to believe there may be a miracle But she added Unfortunately looking at the medical evidence the miracle the parents hope and pray for is unlikely to happen Ms Watson indicated that something had gone wrong in the treatment and although she did not go into details said the trust have endeavoured to be entirely transparent The judge said there had been multiple failures in the multidisciplinary team caring for him She accepted the trust had not tried to cover anything up but said what happened had affected the way his parents feel about his treatment as it would Yogi Amin from law firm Irwin Mitchell which acted for the parents said The courts are charged to make these very difficult decisions where there is a dispute between the parents and clinicians over serious medical issues The family are desperately upset and devastated and will now want to come to terms with the courts decision and grieve for their son
