Its an important question for American families and the nation as a whole Why do so many kids weigh too much There are recent hints the epidemic may be   Still   American kids is overweight or obese To understand why NPR conducted a   with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health It focuses on what happens in American households during the hours between school and bedtime This is crunch time for most families  when crucial everyday decisions get made about food and exercise Our poll used a unique design to get at what is actually happening in the life of a target child in each household We supplemented their responses with more than  that came in when we asked parents through NPRs Facebook page to describe their own crunch times The most striking finding is that US parents get it When we asked a parent or other principal caregiver in our poll how important it is that their child eats and exercises in a way to maintain a healthy weight more than  in  said it was important  and most said it was very important But all too often theres a disconnect Despite good intentions its not happening More than half of children ate or drank something during the crunch time window that can lead to unhealthy weight gain as perceived by their parents And more than a quarter of children did not get enough exercise their parents say Its hard enough to get dinner on the table while trying to help them with homework says Paige Pavlik of Raleigh NC Once we do everything there is absolutely no time to go outside and take a walk or get any exercise Its simply come in eat sit down do homework go to bed The relentlessness of it makes her emotional Pavlik starts to cry as she talked about her familys daily crunch time Its really hard she says This isnt how I thought family life was going to be Nearly half the parents in our poll say its difficult to make sure their child eats healthy Lori Bishop of Lexington Ky says she tries to excel as a parent and as a fulltime laboratory manager But she ends up feeling mediocre at both Both she and her husband have stressful jobs she says and often feel exhausted at the end of the workday But you gotta go right to work in the kitchen Bishop says And while I would love to prepare a wellbalanced meal each evening  it doesnt happen She says dinner at the Bishops house is often prepackaged meals  things that are frozen that you can heat up like frozen pizza frozen chicken nuggets In threequarters of the households polled most of the family ate dinner together the previous evening And of those most said the target childs dinner was prepared at home with fresh ingredients But about a third of children who eat at home with their families are like Lori Bishops kids  they end up relying on prepackaged frozen or takeout food And nearly half of those in our poll say its difficult for families to eat together on a daily basis Adam Jacobs family in Mesa Ariz is a case in point He and his wife have long commutes to work My wife and I dont even get to talk about our days he says If I have something to tell her I literally put it on my smart phone to remind me Their two boys who are  and  usually have afterschool activities On one recent evening Jacobs tried to rustle up dinner for himself and his older son I was at home at  and it was ready by  he says And by that time my wife and younger boy werent even home yet and my older son had already eaten  so it wound up just being another solo deal Its not just time thats in short supply Among the parents we talked to who say its difficult to prepare fresh foods money was also a factor Araceli Flores and her two young children live in the farm belt of central California surrounded by fields of broccoli cauliflower asparagus and fruit orchards But she says its too expensive to buy fresh foods I can buy a box of macaroni and cheese for a dollar Flores says A bunch of bananas  like a good maybe weekandahalfs worth of bananas  will cost me over a dollar Strawberries are four dollars Apples a bag of apples is going to cost me five dollars  way more pricier to buy vegetables and fruits than it is to buy boxed food And its not just time and money that get in the way of doing the right thing Parents say there are other barriers  such as their physical surroundings school lunch policies and their familys culture Vanessa Benavides is a single mom in Miami whos CubanAmerican She comes from a family with nutritionrelated health issues Most of my family is overweight she says Most of my family has high blood pressure My fathers diabetic On weekends Benavides fills up her grocery cart with fresh fruits and vegetables She intends to cook healthy meals she says But at the end of a long day when she picks up yearold Emily at her moms house its often easier to eat the dinner that her mother has made Its a lot of Cuban meals Benavides says You know its just a lot of ricemeat combinations that are often fried or greasy And then Benavides mom and dad keep urging Emily to eat more They want to fatten her up she says That bothers Benavides because she was once a skinny kid like Emily But now she struggles with her weight They were always trying to tell me to eat more and eat more and eat more she says You know a nice chunky kid is considered healthy in our culture Parents often say schools are undermining the messages many parents are trying to give their children In school cafeterias across the country kids are still eating dense highfat and overprocessed food for lunch Assonta Wagner one of our Facebook respondents lives with her husband and four children in Alamogordo NM Her kids typically take their lunch to school But sometimes she allows them to eat school lunches And when they do she cringes One of their favorite meals was this mashed potato bowl Wagner says It was mashed potatoes little fried chicken pieces and corn And then they covered it in gravy Shes a stayathome mom whos superconscientious about making healthy food at home  lots of fruits vegetables and lean meats no prepackaged foods no instant meals no soda So whats offered at school is particularly upsetting to her And its not just the lunches At Halloween Thanksgiving and other holidays they get bags of candy  even her overweight son  as a reward for doing a good job And when all those calories add up over the years parents say the very environment they live in makes it hard to reverse the problem Some parents say its too hard  or too expensive  to get their children to a safe place to exercise Thats one reason one poll respondent Vivian CarterSmith is so worried about her yearold grandson Hes a good boy she says Hes overweight Hes short  and I know he weighs  pounds easy She says her grandson doesnt get any exercise He stopped going to the Y when other boys teased him about his weight And CarterSmith says there isnt a place near his Cincinnati home where her grandson and his younger brother can even get outside and walk And in fact they dont want to The way the streets are she says with these kids with no parents and no rules and regulations and upbringing skills  they are scared But she knows that a lack of exercise combined with an unhealthy diet can lead to disaster After all her grandsons father died last year of a heart attack  at the age of
