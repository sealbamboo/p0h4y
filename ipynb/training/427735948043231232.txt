Mary Snyder found out at her week ultrasound that her unborn baby had   Both of the fetuss feet were completely turned inward forming the twisted Ushape typical of clubfoot The condition is one of the most common birth defects affecting about   but that was little comfort to Snyder It was terrifying remembers Snyder who lives in Towson Md It was very emotional We did a lot of testing and everything to make sure she was going to be OK but you never really know until you see them when theyre born Just a decade ago up to  percent of babies like Snyders daughter Alice were treated with surgery that usually had to be repeated several times That created a buildup of scar tissue that often left patients with a lifetime of chronic pain stiffness arthritis and medical bills But with the help of a simple noninvasive solution and an Internet campaign led by parents the course of treatment and likely outcomes have changed completely Alice who is now  has a checkup every year with   an orthopedic surgeon at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore Alice happily follows the doctors instructions walking back and forth across the exam room then on her tippy toes and finally with her feet turned out like a duck To the untrained eye Alice looks perfectly normal Her feet are turned out as if theyd been that way since birth She has never had surgery Instead Herzenberg used whats called the   Doctors begin by applying a series of fullleg casts to slowly turn out the infants flexible feet Casts are changed weekly for three to eight weeks Before applying a final cast which stays on for three weeks a small incision is made in the Achilles tendon Then the child wears a special set of boots connected by a bar at night for a few years to make sure the feet stay in the right position  think of it as a retainer worn after braces are removed from teeth In the past before I learned Ponseti guaranteed I would literally have had to do a surgical operation to take apart and put together the entire foot says Herzenberg looking at a photo of Alices feet at birth which formed a bowed Ushape beneath her tiny torso The casting technique was developed by   at the University of Iowa in the s The Spanish physician discovered that if an infants feet were slowly turned out over the first few months of life the foot could be coaxed into a normal position Unlike the traditional surgical method the Ponseti method is pretty much painless and patients who receive it usually have a complete recovery with no longterm discomfort It also   Ponseti spent the next  years tirelessly trying to get other doctors to accept it but with little success People were falling over themselves to do fancy invasive surgery and this one strange old guy who speaks softly with a Spanish accent in Iowa was getting sort of ignored by the drumbeat of people who were in favor of surgery says Herzenberg who is one of the foremost practitioners of the Ponseti method today Surgeons are trained to operate explains Herzenberg and usually thats the way they make money The Ponseti method brings in a lot less for orthopedists For about  years the technique mostly stayed in Iowa But then something new came along the Internet When Jennifer Trevillians daughter was born with clubfoot in  the doctors said surgery was inevitable He started talking about her pending surgery before he physically examined her foot Trevillian remembers Trevillian started researching the condition on her new dialup connection There wasnt much But she did find a few other parents talking about another option on iVillage and a new Yahoo support group called NoSurgeryClubFoot A few days later she traveled with her daughter from the familys home in Chatham Mich to Iowa to see Dr Ponseti In the amount of time that we would have just been waiting for her to be big enough to tolerate the anesthesia for the reconstructive surgery she was supposed to have Dr Ponseti completely corrected her foot says Trevillian Trevillian joined the small but growing group of parents evangelizing about the Ponseti method online She built a few websites telling her daughters story and she stayed active on the fastgrowing Yahoo group Parents began following each others advice  choosing to abandon doctors who insisted on surgery and often traveling long distances to find a Ponseti practitioner The way that the clubfoot treatment pendulum has swung is really a classic example of supply and demand  because once parents found out about it they demanded it for their kids and it really forced the medical industry to rethink the Ponseti method says Trevillian Herzenberg agrees Clubfoot is a real prototype for how the Internet has changed medicine and how parents have been the driving force in many ways he says Today the Ponseti method is now almost always the treatment of choice for clubfoot and is recommended by the   When it is done correctly  percent of children born with clubfoot never need invasive surgery
