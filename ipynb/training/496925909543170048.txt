Amelia TogbaAddy lives in Atlanta but Ebola is always on her mind Like many Liberian Americans she has family and friends in West Africa where Ebola has killed nearly  people In Liberia alone the World Health Organization has   almost  cases and more than  deaths so far So when TogbaAddys aunt called early one morning last week she panicked The first thing I thought about was Oh A family member has come down with the virus  she says So I started crying What her aunt said next seemed to confirm her fear Its your brother her aunt told her Hes been vomiting blood I said Oh Lord Im finished  TogbaAddy recalls In the end the problem turned out to be an ulcer  not Ebola But TogbaAddy says it was enough of a scare that she had to do something to help her fellow Liberians Its been difficult to contain the largest Ebola outbreak in history partly because of misunderstanding This years outbreak is the first in Liberia and many locals there are understandably not familiar with the nature of the virus how it spreads or what treatment to seek So international health officials have been activating a phone network that spans continents  enlisting Liberian Americans like TogbaAddy to help clear the confusion by reaching out to their families back home Mobile phones are everywhere in Liberia even in places where electricity and water are scarce says   a health communications specialist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention We can move information through these channels perhaps even more effectively than we can through social mobilization programs in country he says Manning spoke Sunday at the   offices where TogbaAddy and more than a hundred fellow immigrants gathered to ask questions about Ebola And there were a lot Ebola is from a monkey How did the animal get Ebola one person asks And should people avoid    like monkey and bats Yes Manning tells them In some small and remote villages the disease has been overwhelming And residents dont know what to do with the bodies  keep them at home or put them outside Keeping those dead bodies in the streets  is it more safe another man asks Or is it more dangerous in terms of the virus Its more dangerous to keep the bodies in public places Manning tells them His overall message that night was clear Tell your loved ones   what it isnt how its spread and how to avoid exposure Were leaving no stone unturned in the sense of trying to reach out Manning says
