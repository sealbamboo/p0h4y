The world will be watching as a yearold Texas girl undergoes lifechanging obesity surgery on Friday but for now Alexis Shapiro just wants to pet the penguins The pound preteen drew international attention earlier this year after   that US military insurers wouldnt cover a doctorrecommended operation to counter the effects of brain surgery that sent her metabolism haywire piling on extra weight TRICARE officials reversed their decision eventually for the gastric bypass surgery that doctors say will help her lose weight curb her ravenous appetite and allow her to lead a normal life But this week as Alexis and her parents Jenny and Ian Shapiro prepared for the unusual threehour operation scheduled at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center they took a break from stress and worry at the local Newport Aquarium in nearby Kentucky There on a sunny morning Alexis gazed at the colorful creatures  Fishies she said  and giggled at the touch of penguins named Blueberry Simon and Speckles The little girl in the baggy black pants and the womens size XL shirt still doesnt like to talk to strangers even after a flood of publicity from local national and international media and wellwishes from thousands of people including those who  more than  for medical expenses Its good she said turning to her mom for help Shes nervous Excited but nervous explained Jenny Shapiro  The last time she had surgery her life totally changed That was two years ago when Alexis then a typical yearold was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor The surgery went well but it left her with hypothalamic obesity and panhypopituitarism complicated metabolic side effects that the Shapiros say have ravaged their oncenormal daughters life Its been a rollercoaster said Ian Shapiro  an insurance rep You take your faith and you put it in the doctors and then well do the part that we can We got to this point because we were all out of options Without the surgery Alexis would continue to gain an estimated  pounds each week despite a strict diet and enforced exercise Her diabetes would worsen and shed develop other problems as she ballooned to as much as  pounds on her childs frame cautioned Dr Thomas Inge the pediatric obesity expert who will lead the operation Friday morning But with the gastric bypass which makes the stomach smaller and allows food to bypass the small intestine and a procedure that snips part of the vagus nerve which controls appetite and the sense of satiety Alexis will be able to regain more control over her body and brain Initially she could lose up to  pounds a week rapidly reducing her skyhigh body mass index of  improving or curing her diabetes  and curbing the constant hunger that has forced her parents to padlock their kitchen cupboards I think thats possible Inge said Still the procedure in such a young child is rare and potentially risky Alexis is among the youngest patients for Inge whose team has performed weightloss surgery on  teens and children including just two other yearolds and seven who were  Hypothalamic obesity poses even greater challenges he added Our biggest angst is the fact that metabolically theyre so fragile said Inge who will be joined by another surgeon Dr Michael Helmrath and a support team Theyll be closely monitoring Alexis kidney function and hormone levels which are controlled through careful calibration of vital drugs Theyll watch for excessive bleeding and for all the typical hazards involved with anesthesia and surgery Inge said Because of the in Alexis case public relations staff at Cincinnati Childrens plan to liveTweet the operation offering uptothe minute updates as the surgery progresses at   They have blog posts prepared detailing every step of the surgery with   from Inge and commentary from Jenny Shapiro Inge said he and his crew expect the operation to go smoothly Alexis should be through the surgery by noon and sitting up in a chair that evening Shell likely remain in Cincinnati for a week before heading home with her parents to Cibolo Texas where her sister Kayley  and brother Ethan  are staying with their aunt Alexis will remain on a liquid diet for about a month to give her new smaller stomach time to adjust Shell gradually add new foods to her diet until shes eating a full range of healthy options Inge said Its hard to predict Alexis progress he cautioned Because of her metabolic problems shell always have to monitor food and exercise and like others with hypothalamic obesity she could lose weight more slowly He estimates that shell lose about  percent of her weight or a little more than  pounds in the first year They dont get back to normal typically said Inge I dont know that well be able to tell them to expect that But the Shapiros say they have a realistic view of how the surgery will help Alexis Jenny Shapiro says she wants her oldest daughter to be able to ride bikes with her brother and sister to go swimming in the summer to walk through a grocery store or amusement park without anyone staring at her Right now I just tell her Dont look Just concentrate on what youre doing Jenny Shapiro said But its hard The Shapiros say they take comfort in the outpouring of support from people whove heard Alexis story and responded with kindness and understanding Other parents of kids with hypothalamic obesity have reached out and now theres new momentum for research into the rare condition They say theyve used some of the donated money to pay for travel costs and insurance copayments and for normal living expenses because Ian and Jenny Shapiro have both exhausted leave from their jobs But theyd also like to help families in similar circumstances Its been really crazy but its been nothing but positive Jenny Shapiro said Did I ever think Id be on TV No But as a parent you would do anything for your child
