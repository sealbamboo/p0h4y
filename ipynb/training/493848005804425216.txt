Medicares Hospital Insurance Trust Fund which finances about half of the health program for seniors and the disabled wont run out of money until  the programs trustees said Monday Thats four years later than projected last year and  years later than projected the year before the passage of the Affordable Care Act But thats not the case for the part of Social Security that pays for people getting disability benefits The Disability Insurance Trust Fund is projected to run out of money in  just two years from now unless Congress intervenes   Medicare is considerably stronger than it was just four years ago Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Monday She noted that slower growth of the programs spending will very likely mean that the Medicare Part B premium charged to beneficiaries  currently    remains the same for the third year in a row Thats a growth rate of zero percent she noted All the trustees however including the secretaries of HHS Treasury and Labor and two public members stressed that Medicares financial problems are far from fixed particularly as  million baby boomers are on the precipice of joining Notwithstanding recent favorable developments both the projected baseline and current law projections indicate that Medicare still faces a substantial financial shortfall that will need to be addressed with further legislation   And the sooner lawmakers face that reality the better said   a public trustee and former head of the Congressional Budget Office For the first time the Medicare report deviates from current law and does not assume that scheduled deep cuts in reimbursements to physicians who treat Medicare patients will occur Congress has suspended the cuts each year since  and in this report the trustees assume that will continue until   known as the sustainable growth rate or SGR The change should make the Part B cost projections more useful than they have been in the past said Reischauer Part B pays for most physician and outpatient costs It technically does not have a trust fund because it is financed by a combination of general tax revenues and beneficiary premiums but the trustees make projections for its spending each year The trustees opted not to wade into the ongoing debate over the extent to which the slowdown in Medicares spending increases can be attributed to changes to the program made in the  health law No one knows and certainly there is an active debate said Charles Blahous the other public trustee and lone Republican on the panel And thats not something the trustees are going to settle said Blahous a fellow at the conservative   But whatever the reason no one contests that the slowdown has been dramatic Medicare which covered an estimated  million people in  spent  billion and for the second year in a row per beneficiary costs were essentially unchanged the report said The financial picture for Social Securitys disability insurance fund by contrast is much more dire The projected reserves of the DI Trust Fund decline steadily from  percent of annual cost at the beginning of  until the trust fund reserves are depleted in the fourth quarter of    After that the program would be able to pay only  percent of scheduled benefits The disability program has seen a   in recent years yet Congress has not taken any action to change its financing which is  percentage points of the overall  percent Social Security payroll tax paid by employers and workers
