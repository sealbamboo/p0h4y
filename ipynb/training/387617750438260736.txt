The NHS in Wales will get m of extra funding over three years Finance Minister Jane Hutt has announced It includes m for this financial year she told AMs as she unveiled the Welsh governments draft budget She said the extra money would help the NHS in Wales to avoid a scandal such as the one in Stafford Hospital where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse However funding for local government will see a cut of  next year Early calculations suggest that local government cuts are particularly tough Local government spending will fall from bn this year to bn next year a cut in cash terms of  or  in real terms Their budgets will be around  lower in real terms between now and  Meanwhile Ms Hutt said the pressures faced by the NHS will continue to grow Welsh NHS spending will rise from bn to bn next year an increase of  in cash terms or  in real terms Earlier in the day Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood and Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams agreed to help the minority Labour administration get its budget through the assembly chamber But Conservative shadow finance minister Paul Davies criticised the budget deal Clearly they are willing to prop up this failing Labour government he said Under the terms of the deal ministers will devote m to Plaid and Lib Dem spending priorities in return for the two opposition parties abstaining in the crucial vote in December The money included m to treat more patients in the community rather than hospital and the doubling of funding for the pupil deprivation grant a scheme to help poorer school pupils Whilst praising the extra spending Welsh ministers had agreed to as part of the budget negotiations Ms Wood raised concerns about the impact of local government cuts What effect will this have on their ability to provide essential services she asked the finance minister What will this mean for council tax increases next year What advice do you intend to issue to local government about council tax and what impact will this budget have on young people trying to stay in education and gain qualifications Ms Hutt said it was not possible to shield all services from UK government spending cuts  Rising demand levels cost increases and pressures resulting directly from the UK governments welfare reforms are biting she said   She stressed the priority was to protect health schools and universal benefits such as free prescriptions school breakfasts and bus passes for older people   We have also been clear that our focus will continue to rest on creating growth and jobs for the Welsh economy  Our commitment to tackle poverty by raising educational attainment and supporting children families and deprived communities will also help to achieve a fairer healthier Wales Ms Hutt added Lib Dem finance spokesman Peter Black AM urged Ms Hutt to ensure the money got to those in most need and was spent as effectively as possible  Commenting on another key element of the budget deal his party and Plaid Cymru had made with Welsh ministers he said  Im very proud indeed that we now have m supporting the poorest pupils in our communities next year a commitment to investment in education and training  these are the main areas of investment The Welsh government hopes the extra funding for the NHS will be a shot in the arm for a service which has often this year looked as if it is struggling to cope  The health and finance ministers spent the summer looking at the problems the NHS faced and came up with a figure The result  m  exactly the threeyear package of extra investment announced today  But bear in mind some economists estimate that the NHS here needs more  well in excess of m extra a year just to stand still  Why Most of the money is spent on staff  and most of them on contracts which give them incremental rises each year So unless jobs are cut or theres a pay freeze then the bill increases  Also spending on drugs and medicines increases year on year as does the costs of replacing equipment Dont forget either were living longer putting more strain on the service and the NHS is also a notoriously inefficient organisation  So a big chunk of the extra money could be swallowed up almost immediately The Welsh governments budget deal also includes a m fund designed to keep people out of hospital who dont need to be there  A huge rise in the number of elderly people going to AE put the NHS under a massive strain in the spring Theres also almost m for robotic cancer surgery  Up until now dozens of Welsh men have had to go to England for less invasive prostate cancer operations and pay up to  for the privilege  But one of the key questions will be what will the seven Welsh health boards do with the rest money coming their way Will they invest in sorting out some of the longer term challenges they face or take their foot off the pedal The   welcomed investments into a new intermediate care fund and enhancements to health technology funding which it said was long overdue Secretary Dr Richard Lewis said Doctors and healthcare staff need to know that our limited resources are being targeted at services that matter to patients and support their day to day work  The government need to be honest with the profession and the public about what can and cannot be delivered in these financially straightened times There has to be a focus on clinical priorities and safe services There is no room for unnecessary bureaucracy and empty targets  which represents health boards welcomed the investment but said Even with this additional funding change must take place right across Wales to ensure efficient safe and sustainable health care services are provided within the resources allocated by Welsh government  This will inevitably mean that difficult choices have to be made on what services are provided where and when The  union said it applauded the Welsh government for its commitment to a publicly owned and financed NHS as well as the increase in funding Wales secretary Margaret Thomas said Under the circumstances this is a responsible budget proposal from the Welsh government Councillor Aaron Shotton the   finance spokesperson said by the end of  local government will have borne the brunt of austerity in Wales This will see councils potentially having to close libraries and sports centres slash pothole and other daytoday maintenance budgets cut bus subsidies and switch off streetlights between midnight and dawn he said  While local councils will do everything they can to protect frontline services like education and social care they will simply not be able to protect everything Commenting on the budget the   said this was a hugely challenging time for all who believe in social justice and quality public services General secretary Martin Mansfield said the Welsh government had worked to mitigate the impact of UK cuts since   He said The UK government has slashed our finances by bn a year in order to pursue their austerity ideology  on top of Wales already being under funded due to the Barnett formula The Welsh government approach is prioritising the best use of the resources left available to them It will be a very difficult process but we will try to support them in that effort All public service employers must play their full part in holding together our Welsh public service ethos He said there must be no knee jerk moves towards pay cuts job cuts and privatisation With the economy of Wales held back by too many people in low paid or low skilled work and many others not well enough to work this budget appears to be trying to tackle that to make Wales wealthier  While extra money for health will flow back into the wider economy in the short term it is hoped that increasing the impact of Flying Starts parenting support and the extra money for teaching children who are eligible for school meals will together try to break the poverty cycle In an attempt to get more young people working the Jobs Growth Wales programme is being extended and an extra m is being spent to create another  job opportunities for  year olds At the same time m will support apprenticeships  The losers as expected are local authorities The local government budget is being cut by  in cash terms Thats equivalent to cuts of  when inflation is taken into account  It also needs to be remembered that two thirds of local government spending is covered by education and social services leaving just one third to absorb those cuts That includes leisure services libraries road repairs and street lighting but also planning and economic regeneration that can have a direct impact on jobs and prosperity locally  We shall hear how that directly affects local councils next week The  s Welsh policy unit chair Janet Jones said On the face of it the budget announced today appears to be well grounded with the Welsh Government embracing the use of innovative forms of finance to invest in muchneeded infrastructure projects The Pupil Deprivation Grant PDG was introduced last year  Schools are allocated funds of  per child on free school meals aged five to  which goes directly into their budgets Following todays deal that should more than double to  in  The Welsh government has always stressed that each school will be able to decide how it spends its allocation of money But it does expect the money to help challenge the link between poverty and achievement in schools with a particular focus on literacy and numeracy However earlier this year there were reports that schools were absorbing the money into their budgets using the money to buy tablet computers and to pay for teaching assistants So now schools have to account for their spending by publishing an online breakdown as part of a push for greater transparency Last month a survey of schools by the Liberal Democrats suggested that only  of schools use the PDG funding strictly for pupils on free school meals  But thats the only real evaluation to date of the PDG  To be fair it is still early days and the Welsh government has commissioned a team from Cardiff University to monitor how effective the grant has been Theyre due to start reporting their findings next year So yes the money may have doubled But well have to wait to see if its money well spent Following the announcement of the draft budget the   said while education had not been shielded from the implication of cuts to Welsh government finances they were pleased with the significant investment for the PDG NUT secretary David Evans said We are still lagging behind other parts of the UK  However I think it is fair to accept that in the face of swingeing cuts to the Welsh governments funding to have m earmarked for schools through the PDG is something to be positive about
