Close to  children have crossed illegally into the US since last October Theyve sparked a crisis But is it a humanitarian crisis or a public health one The children carry swine flu dengue fever Ebola virus and tuberculosis and can spread the diseases to the US wrote Rep Phil Gingrey RGa a retired obstetriciangynecologist in a July    to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Gingreys concerns have been widely circulated as part of a public campaign by folks who share his view that the kids should be sent back And some of the points hes raised have been widely rebuffed The current Ebola outbreak has been confined to Africa as have past outbreaks And neither dengue nor the   disease known as Chagas which was   by others spread from human to human Transmission involves bugs and dogs But some health issues in this contentious debate require closer examination There have for example been a handful of reported cases of TB among the children And concerns that the children may not have been vaccinated  or may harbor scabies and lice  arent as absurd as the Ebola claims A TB epidemic is perhaps one of the biggest concerns since the US doesnt vaccinate against the disease The fear of a fatal respiratory disease that attacks the lungs and can spread through the air is understandable But its worth keeping in mind that in  the average coverage for TB vaccine in Central America was  percent the World Health Organization reports And the facts on the ground do not back up such worries All children who arrive at a border station are screened for TB with skin tests and chest Xrays those infected are immediately isolated and treated So far this year only three TB cases among unaccompanied children have been reported by federal officials to the   says spokeswoman Carrie Williams and only one case in Arizona according to a   by Pima County Health Director Francisco Garcia Such low numbers are not cause for alarm given that Arizona already sees about  cases of TB a year and Texas sees nearly  What about the possibility that the children could spread measles and mumps Gingrey wrote that many children come from countries that lack basic vaccinations which would pose a risk to unvaccinated Americans The general public may well believe that vaccines are hard to come by in low and middleincome countries but thats not always the case The primary care system in developing countries is more effective than in the US  better than people think says   a pediatrician at Columbia University and cofounder of the Childrens Health Fund which provides health care to the disadvantaged Indeed in Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador where roughly   of the children have come from immunization for measles has   coverage according to WHO To be on the safe side all children are vaccinated during their short stay at processing facilities in Texas and Arizona That happens at least three days before theyre sent to different shelters around the country says Kenneth Wolfe a spokesman for the US Department of Health and Human Services in an email Like any shelter system when you have a group of people or children living together theres always theoretical risk of spreading diseases says pediatrician Alan Shapiro who cofounded an immigrant youth clinic in New York called Terra Firma But those risks he adds usually remain within the shelter and wont spread to the community as long as good primary care is provided Since October Shapiros clinic has provided physical and mental health care to nearly  unaccompanied children now living with a family or sponsor He says theres no need to worry about a spread of contagious diseases The children that I see for the most part have a good experience in the shelter he says The facilities have been more than adequate and they are seen by medical personnel and getting vaccines Some kids have even brought immunization records from their home countries he says At the processing centers vaccinations are updated  everything from measles mumps and rubella to tetanus whooping cough and polio As a cautionary measure all detainees are evaluated right at the border to stop any potential disease from spreading as early as possible Theyre screened at least once  first by a member of the Border Patrol and then by physicians if necessary  for signs of any disease This includes rash fever persistent coughing vomiting and diarrhea says Jessica Maxwell a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security which works with Border Patrol The incidence of infectious diseases is very low she says The more common issues are related to traveling dehydration heat exhaustion foot and ankle injuries lice and scabies which are treatable Children who have medical problems may be transferred to a hospital for treatment Aside from the TB cases there have been three flu cases and a few gastrointestinal and respiratory issues at the McAllen Processing Center in Texas says Williams Of the  unaccompanied minors processed in Nogales Processing Center in Arizona there were two flu cases and two chicken pox cases reports Garcia who noted that the risk of spread beyond the shelters is low Thats not to say there are no health issues among the kids its just that none poses a threat to the public The centers havent been perfect Texas health officials who visited the McAllen facility two months ago reported overcrowding as well as a lack of full medical scans and handwashing stations But Williams says better care is now being provided partly because fewer immigrants are arriving Meanwhile the fear mongering as Shapiro calls it takes attention away from the bigger issue at hand mental health These are children who are coming over to escape the violence that absolutely pervades the community back home he says During their journey they are at risk for abuse by Mexican gangs In the US they must adjust to a new environment and unfamiliar faces Theres such incredible amount of change that these children have to go through during a relatively short period of time he says The amount of trauma or stress cannot be understated
