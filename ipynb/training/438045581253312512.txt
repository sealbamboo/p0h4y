Most older women dont need the routine Pap tests used to check for cervical cancer There are exceptions which Ill get to in a minute But since  the United States Preventive Services Task Force the American Cancer Society the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other medical groups have recommended a Pap smear every three years   After that lowrisk women those with a history of negative Pap tests and no previous cancer or precancerous lesions can stop Further testing provides little to no benefits the task force said For years before the  update medical groups had been urging less frequent testing for those at average or low risk  So it is clearly going to take a major effort to change behavior and prevent rampant overuse Just how major an effort has become clearer from data recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine Deanna Kepka a population scientist at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City and her coauthors reviewed   participating in the National Health Interview Survey in  They found that  More than  percent of those over age  who hadnt undergone a hysterectomy and still had cervices reported getting a Pap test within the past three years Some of these women were in their s  Of these plus women more than  percent said theyd gotten Pap tests annually because they think thats what theyre supposed to do Dr Kepka said  Even among women who had undergone hysterectomies after which the guidelines say Pap tests should stop more than half had gotten them in the past three years Why all this Paping  Its very hard for people to keep it all straight said Dr Sarah Feldman a gynecologic oncologist at DanaFarber Cancer Institute in Boston The guidelines can get complicated and they depend on a patients history of symptoms and test results  Its easier for the clinician to say I dont know this patients whole prior history I dont have time to ask her Ill just do it Dr Feldman said Also Dr Kepka pointed out If youre paid for the services you provide theres an incentive to provide more services Weve talked before about the overtesting experienced by older Americans Some of these tests become so automatic year after year and decade after decade that neither seniors nor their doctors seem to recognize when its time to call a halt So   despite the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation against routine screening for colorectal cancer in people over age  After age  most women need   not annually the task force has concluded and theres insufficient evidence to decide whether the benefits of mammography outweigh the risks after age  Men without symptoms are warned against prostate cancer screening at any age As for the cervical cancer guidelines a   outlines the basics Women over age  whove had adequate screening  which means three negative Pap tests or two negative combined Paphuman papillomavirus tests in the past decade the most recent within five years  and who have no history of cancer lesions or other abnormalities can stop getting tested Women whove had a hysterectomy and no previous cervical cancer or dysplasia abnormal cervical cells can stop getting tested On the other hand women whove never had a Pap test probably should get one even if theyre over age  and women with a history of highgrade dysplasia in the past  years should continue regular screening In practice Dr Feldman pointed out older women will probably want to personalize these rules When Dr Feldmans mother and motherinlaw both long married and monogamous women in their s asked her advice she told them in effect enough already A yearold whos had adequate screening and normal results her whole adult life can comfortably decide shes done A yearold who divorced in her s began dating and had several new sexual partners on the other hand might want to continue with Pap testing every three or every five years She should probably discuss the matter with her doctor Cervical cancer grows so slowly however that for most older women unnecessary Pap tests run up Medicare expenditures while providing no useful information Lets reframe the idea of the annual exam Dr Kepka suggested We need to focus on the screenings that people should be getting
