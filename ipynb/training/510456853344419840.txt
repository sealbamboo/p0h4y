Doctors and hospitals treated more patients and collected more payments in the spring as millions gained insurance coverage under the health law new figures from the government show But analysts called the secondquarter increases modest and said there is little evidence to suggest that wider coverage and a recovering economy are pushing health spending growth to the painful levels of a decade ago Thursdays results from the   join other recent cost indicators that are quite a bit lower than what the folks at CMS were projecting said Charles Roehrig director of the Center for Sustainable Health Spending at the Altarum Institute a nonprofit research and consulting outfit And theyre lower than what we were expecting as well CMS is the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services the governments main health care bookkeeper Last week CMS projected that healthexpenditure growth   this year from an estimated  percent in  But health and social spending as measured by the Census Bureau grew by only  percent from the second quarter of  to the same quarter of  Hospital revenue increased  percent during the same period Revenue for physician offices barely budged growing by only  percent Medical lab revenue rose  percent The report is far from being the last word It doesnt include spending on prescription drugs which has been rising this year thanks to new   for hepatitis C And while the Census Bureaus yearoveryear results for the second quarter show tame cost trends the increase from the first quarter to the second was more substantial Total health and social spending rose at an annual rate of more than  percent from first quarter to the next If sustained such acceleration would raise alarms and actuaries blood pressure But some who follow costs closely dont think the pace will continue First health spending suffered a minicrash over the winter as bad storms kept people away from caregivers Hospitals and doctors billed less from January to March than they did last fall Part of the secondquarter recovery may just have been catchup analysts said At the same time many people covered through the health laws online marketplaces didnt sign up until close to the deadline at the end of March Much of the spring increase may represent a onetime surge as those folks sought treatment for previously neglected conditions For those reasons the yearoveryear results for the second quarter may give a better indication of longerterm cost trends than the change from the first quarter to the second Roehrig said Estimates   but no one disputes the idea that the Affordable Care Acts health insurance marketplaces and expansion of Medicaid for the poor have added millions of previously uninsured people to coverage rosters this year History and logic suggest that expanded coverage and an improving economy will boost longterm national health expenditures from their average growth rate of  percent during the past five years Thats spending by everybody  government programs employer insurance commercial plans and consumers paying out of pocket But so far the speedup seems nowhere close to the neardoubledigit rates in the early s
