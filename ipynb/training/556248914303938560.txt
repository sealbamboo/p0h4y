Warning Being a firstborn may be hazardous to your health So suggests   of middleaged men in New Zealand Compared with  their younger brothers the firstborns weighed more and were less sensitive to insulin Researchers had recruited the guys to be part of clinical trials testing whether olive leaf extract or krill oil could improve their metabolic health All of the volunteers were between the ages of  and  and all were overweight with a body mass index between  and  To study the effects of birth order they pulled out data from trial participants who were either the first or second child born in their family Men were excluded if they had diabetes high blood pressure or high cholesterol or if they were on any medications that might affect these conditions Smokers and other tobacco users were also dropped from the analysis The final group included  firstborns and  seconds Though men in both groups were about the same height  on average  feet  inches for the older brothers and  feet  inches for the younger   there were significant differences in weight The average weight for the older brothers was just over  pounds while the younger brothers averaged  pounds As a result their BMIs diverged as well  for the firstborns and  for the seconds These differences arose despite the fact that men in both groups had similar amounts of body fat The older brothers averaged  body fat compared with  for the youngerThe difference wasnt statistically significant However there was a real difference in insulin sensitivity which was  lower in the firstborn men than the younger brothers When the body doesnt respond properly to insulin it can lead to problems like diabetes heart disease and obesity This difference was seen even after researchers controlled for the amount of exercise the men got their fat mass and other factors The researchers at the University of Aukland speculated that something had happened in the womb that made the firstborns more vulnerable to these metabolic problems One possibility they mentioned was placental blood flow A first pregnancy causes changes in certain arteries in the uterus and those changes are permanent That means firstborns dont get the benefit of these changes from the moment of conception but second children do This might also explain why firstborns generally have lower birth weights than the next child they said The researchers said that their results may not apply to women In fact they may not generalize beyond middleaged overweight white men  of the men in the study were of European descent Still the results were intriguing enough to warrant further study they wrote The   were published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports a Nature publication    and like   on Facebook
