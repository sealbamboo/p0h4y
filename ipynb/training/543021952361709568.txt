Remember back in October when I   about the flu vaccine here Research published since then suggests my efforts might have been in vain at least in part The post might have changed some minds but it seems unlikely to have led legions of people to race to get vaccinated In fact people concerned about flu vaccine side effects may have been   likely to get the shot after reading the piece even if it convinced them that the myths were false Yes you read that right The study   in the journal   found that countering a big misperception about flu vaccines  that they can give you the flu    had a surprising effect Education reduced misbelief but it also reduced the likelihood that people already uneasy about the vaccine would plan to get it Theres a temptation to believe that communication is a silver bullet said Brendan Nyhan the Dartmouth researcher who conducted the study with Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter Our research suggests thats the wrong way to think about this Peoples minds arent that easily changed Because researchers cant look into peoples heads they test what influences may lead someone to get or avoid a vaccine We were interested in whether people believing the flu vaccine can give you the flu is the reason theyre not getting the vaccine and whether correcting peoples misperceptions would make them more likely to get it Nyhan said The answer is no Nyhan and Reifler randomly split  people into three groups and asked them how concerned they were about serious side effects from vaccines thereby identifying those very or extremely concerned about vaccines generally  percent overall divided about equally across the three groups Then the researchers gave one group information explaining the dangers of influenza and another group an explanation of how the flu vaccine cannot give someone the flu The third group the comparison group received nothing After the first two groups read the materials the researchers asked them how likely it was they would get the flu vaccine this season how safe they believed it is for most people and how accurate it is to say someone can get the flu from the vaccine The debunking materials did appear to shift the needle on beliefs Among those with high concerns about side effects  percent in the comparison group believed they could get the flu from the vaccine compared with  percent who read the mythbuster Among those with low concerns  percent of the comparison group and  percent of those who read the debunking materials believed the misperception But actually planning to get the vaccine Thats another story  percent of those with high concerns in the comparison group said they intended to get the vaccine Yet only  percent of folks with high concerns who read the debunking materials said they might get one And thats just their intention If you cant change their intentions good luck changing their behavior Nyhan said So whats going on here Its probably not actually the misperception stopping people from getting the vaccine If misperceptions cause vaccine hesitancy then debunking those myths should increase willingness to vaccinate Nyhan said But these results suggest that misperceptions about vaccines may be a reflection of less favorable attitudes toward vaccines rather than a cause One reason for this is   according to Melanie Tannenbaum a PhD candidate in social psychology who studied persuasion at the University of Illinois UrbanaChampaign Motivated reasoning is the psychology concept that explains why people move the goalposts in an argument Even if you address specific misperceptions our motivated reasoning system is going to jump in to fill in the gaps Tannenbaum said We do a lot to protect the beliefs we already hold and if one aspect of that belief is challenged it is easy enough to fill in other reasons So then is there no point in countering all the misinformation out there as I did with that previous mythbusting post Not necessarily I think theres still value in putting the accurate information out there because for the more casual reader you dont want them seeing only the wrong information and thinking that must be right because thats all that exists Tannenbaum said Even if youre not succeeding in convincing every person who reads it on a macro level youre making sure that the correct information is available in as much quantity as the misinformation Further Nyhan said his research is aimed at public health officials whose goal is to increase vaccine uptake a different goal than mine as a journalist providing accurate information And motivated reasoning kicks in primarily with topics people feel strongly about Nyhan said When you ask people about things they dont care about theyre very happy to accept corrective information he said Still in this study even those with low concerns were no more or less likely to get the vaccine after reading the corrective information And Nyhan pointed out that a possible weakness of our approach was stating myths in the first place some past research has found that exposure to the myths  even for the sake of debunking them  creates an illusion of truth that may reinforce the incorrect beliefs The problem is that there arent many effective alternatives yet Research shows the source matters  people accept correct information about vaccines from trusted health care professionals in particular  but its not clear what public health messaging might work We know very little thats evidencebased about how to communicate about vaccines Nyhan said We need to do a better job whether its journalists or educators or people in the health system of providing accurate information about vaccines in a way that people will find persuasive and we dont know how to do that yet
