Theres a part of our body thats only now getting mapped the trillions of microbes mostly bacteria that live in our guts Some scientists describe this community as a previously unnoticed vital organ It appears to play a role in how quickly we gain weight and how well we fight off disease A study   in the journal   suggests that changes in this community of microbes also may cause kwashiorkor a kind of deadly malnutrition If youve seen the horrifying pictures of famine  listless children with swollen bellies  youve seen the face of   Its not the most common form of malnutrition but it is the most deadly It can hit a child quickly Nutritionist   who directs the international nutrition program at Cornell University says theres something baffling about this disease Some children get it while others who seem to be eating the same diet do not What causes some malnourished children to transition into kwashiorkor remarkably remains a mystery after all these years she says Many scientists she says suspect that theres something going on inside the gut But what Enter   from the med school at Washington University in St Louis Gordon has pioneered studies of such microbial communities  what scientists now call the    and how this microbial community affects conditions such as obesity Gordon decided to take on kwashiorkor He joined forces with other scientists who were already working in Malawi a country in southern Africa where malnutrition is common They decided to study twins so that they could compare children who were genetically similar and living in similar environments We recruited a group of  twin pairs identical and fraternal and followed them through their first three years of life he explains None of these twins at the beginning were malnourished But when they came back for checkups a pattern emerged in almost half of the pairs of twins One twin in the pair remained healthy and the other twin developed either moderate or severe malnutrition These children immediately were treated with therapeutic food But before they were treated and again afterwards for several weeks the scientists took samples of their feces to study the bacteria that lived in the gut Gordon says the children with kwashiorkor had a different population of microbes than their healthy twins During treatment a healthy community of microbes started to emerge but the improvement didnt last It was clear evidence that this abnormal community of microbes was associated with malnutrition But could it actually be the cause of their disease Gordon wanted to see if these microbes caused similar symptoms in laboratory mice So he transplanted samples of the microbial communities from just three pairs of twins into special strains of mice that were raised in completely sterile conditions Their bodies contained no other microbes The mice got food similar to what children eat in Malawi And in two out of three cases the mice that got microbes from the sick children started to lose weight Gordon says it suggests that down the road we might be able to treat severe malnutrition with better food and also   Nextgeneration probiotics he says Other scientists arent ready to go that far First of all its impossible to draw many firm conclusions from observations of just two or three pairs of mice Even though the mice lost weight you cant say they had kwashiorkor And finally were a long long way from a probiotic treatment But they agreed that this hint of a link between microbes and severe malnutrition is intriguing and worth pursuing further Stoltzfus meanwhile was struck by something else in Gordons study The twin study makes it all the more perplexing How did these babies get so different she asks They were genetically the same growing up in the same home Yet it was generally just one child in a pair of twins who had kwashiorkor  rarely both twins together How are these babies being cared for Whats going on between these twins How are they having such different life experiences Stoltzfus asks Answering such questions she says means getting into homes and understanding how families work Its something we can do right away she says And it might prevent kwashiorkor from developing in the first place
