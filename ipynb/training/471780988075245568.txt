An ambulance races down an empty street in Folkston Ga population about  It bypasses Charlton Memorial Hospital makes a sharp right turn and speeds to an emergency room  miles away Why Because Charlton Memorial Hospital has been closed since last August Four of Georgias  rural hospitals have shut down over the past two years A dozen more have cut services in response to shrinking budgets There just wasnt enough money to keep   going says Doug Gowen who stayed and is in charge of whats left of the defunct hospital A small staff handles the medical records accumulated when it was still in business With  beds Charlton Memorial like many rural hospitals struggled to cope with a lack of hightech specialty care a big drop in local funding and populations that were getting older and poorer From his office in a trailer behind the hospital Gowen can see the locked building that was once the secondlargest employer in town Ever since we closed weve maintained hope that were going to open back up he says Weve not sold any of our equipment Everything is ready The state of Georgia just threw him a lifeline offering a   to allow struggling hospitals and those that have closed in the past year to become rural freestanding emergency departments The intent here is to have some kind of health care infrastructure in a community as opposed to nothing at all says Clyde Reese who runs the Georgia Department of Community Health He doesnt know of another state thats tried this approach The new emergency departments would handle runofthemill urgent care such as broken bones But they would also stabilize patients for transfer to larger hospitals that are better equipped and staffed Reese doesnt know how the freestanding ER would be funded Medicaid and Medicare could pay for some of the services but at reduced nonhospital rates This is a first step of not just looking at hospitals but at health care in general in our rural areas he says Because of the strains on the Georgia system Republican Gov Nathan Deal created the   One thing that wont be an option   to expand Medicaid to adults without dependent children That move would cover a halfmillion poor Georgians The Republicancontrolled Legislature opposes the Affordable Care Act which created the expansion and says Medicaid expansion would cost the state too much in the long run Thats a mistake says   health policy director at the nonprofit Georgia Budget and Policy Institute If the primary issue is the financial stability of rural hospitals then expanding Medicaid should be Step  he says Georgia is missing out on  billion in federal money for the states health care system over the next decade by not expanding Medicaid he says We know that it would provide significant new funding for hospitals in rural Georgia that are serving uninsured patients right now Deal has said he would prefer the federal funding come in a lump sum directly to the state rather than abiding by the federal governments stricter rules for Medicaid In Folkston Gowen fears time is running out for the hospital He says he will apply for a license to open up the ER even if he has no idea where the money will come from There is a very vital lifesaving service provided in our emergency room he says And if we can get at least that part back up and running thats vital to this community
