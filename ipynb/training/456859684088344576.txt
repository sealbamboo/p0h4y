I heard those words often during my years as a soccer player at Drexel University The mantra reminded me of my goals and helped me endure the pain of practice and the mental stress of competition Now at the age of  I find myself relying on that mantra again  not as an athlete but as a patient Last September doctors told me that I had Stage IV gastric cancer With my sports background I have come to view treatment as a competition Remembering that its not a sprint its a marathon now helps me endure the pain of treatment and the mental strain of the unknown Just as I did in soccer I have set my mind on victory My youth was all sports  years of waking early and piling into a crammed minivan to get to this or that game Whether running point guard on a hard basketball court stealing bases or playing the worlds most beautiful game on fresh green grass I never knew that one day I would rely on my training to face my fiercest opponent ever Now my game day is treatment day As in soccer I spend the weeks before treatment drawing up a game plan Ive learned that by following a pretreatment training regimen I can recover much more quickly Of course I can train only on good days  the days when Im not clutching the toilet or shivering even while wrapped in thick clothing But the reality that not every day is a good day just steels my resolve to make the most of those times On good days I push myself to get to  pushups followed by squats and as many squat thrusts as my quivering legs can handle I often end up gasping for air I also run steps when I can breathing deeply and feeling the cold air burning through my lungs After these sessions I rest hydrate and mentally prepare for the looming treatment I can still vividly see my old self in the locker room with my teammates my soccer uniform drenched in sweat Nowadays of course I am without my teammates I am wearing tights to keep my legs warm and sitting in my room wrapped in blankets To psych myself for treatment I speak to a thinner bald person in the mirror I often dont recognize But as I do I can see my former self surrounded by my teammates as we get ready for battle Both then and now I remind myself that no matter the pain the victory will be worth it As game day inches nearer I focus on yoga and meditation Deep breathing calms my mind as does envisioning waves crashing as I lie on a warm sunny beach I also imagine a finish line as if I am running the meter dash I picture myself crossing that line snapping the ribbon of victory and celebrating with exuberance I pictured these scenes in my mind as a young athlete I do it now for a very different kind of race In sports a three a day means three practice sessions in one day  an extreme effort During the hardest days of posttreatment I reflect on how grueling those sessions were how much I demanded of myself Sometimes I would fall exhausted to the ground after wind sprints but I would always pick myself back up Merely remembering this remembering that I had tested my body and mind before and prevailed gives me strength to endure I can pick myself up again I also think about my knee surgery in my junior year Chemotherapy is torturous but it fortifies me to recall how much pain I was in after tearing the meniscus and medial collateral ligament in my knee and how hard I worked to recuperate I have done it before I tell myself When I enter the confines of the treatment room  my field of competition  I sit in the recliner with the toxic chemicals running into the port in my chest I recall a soccer tournament I was in as a teenager We were playing in Sweden against the top seed Brazil and we were losing I assembled my teammates at halftime urged them to reach deep down to go the distance to finish strong and to show what we were made of Weve had uphill battles before and won I remember telling them We got this We faced long odds in that match but my team fought hard In the last minute I scored the winning goal Its a happy memory for me one of my best I try to summon the courage I felt back then Ive had uphill battles before and won I whisper to myself We got this
