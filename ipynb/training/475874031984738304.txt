A death registry for infants may help researchers get a better handle on how many babies die each year from SIDS and other causes a new government study suggests Sudden unexpected infant death SUID accounts for one in three deaths in children aged  month to  year explained the studys lead author Carrie ShapiroMendoza a senior scientist in the division of reproductive health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Its the leading cause of death in infants of this age she said ShapiroMendoza and her colleagues developed a new classification system to help medical examiners and coroners provide a more accurate description of the circumstances of each infant death Right now theres a lot of confusion or lack of standard practice among medical examiners and coroners when theyre deciding whether to call it SIDS or suffocation ShapiroMendoza said The hope is the new system will give a clearer picture of infant deaths And that ShapiroMendoza said might help researchers learn more about the causes of these SUIDs and perhaps come up with ways to prevent future deaths Once researchers have a better handle on how many deaths can be explained they can start to look for reasons for the unexplained deaths Maybe we need to look at biological or medical factors ShapiroMendoza said Currently SIDS is a garbage diagnosis that is used when the cause of death is unknown said Dr Marlyn Woo a professor of pediatric pulmonology at the Mattel Childrens Hospital UCLA With all these cases being labeled as SIDS you cant really home in on the cause of this epidemic And you cant learn how to identify those children who are at risk and find measures to prevent it The new research will go a long way to helping scientists to find answers Woo said Thank goodness the federal government got involved and funded this classification system she added
