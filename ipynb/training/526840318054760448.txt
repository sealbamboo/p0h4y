he Five Year Forward View blueprint by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens which claims that the NHS could deliver bn of annual savings in five years time is the latest of a long line of reports to assert that there is scope for the   to make major savings The previous one was issued in October  by Monitor one of the NHSs regulatory bodies which claimed the NHS could save between bn and bn by  through greater efficiency and joint working between hospitals Such figures illustrate how much of a blind alley the reorganisation of the NHS was three years ago Its justification was that   Health secretary Jeremy Hunts recent assertion that the reorganisation had delivered just bn of savings is an admission that the reforms had failed There now seem to be three plans for the NHS Stevenss plan shadow health secretary Andy Burnhams plan for the NHS to take over care services and the Conservatives plan which seems to be to try to improve what we have Will any of them deliver what is needed and are the demands for extra funding realistic Stevens seems to have accepted Monitors figure for bn of extra funding annually However the idea that bn of savings will be achieved by  a  yearonyear saving is not credible if it relies on local initiatives to do so The various models that have been described will deliver some benefits However the history of the NHS shows that while there are some great local initiatives these are rarely taken up widely Saving  a year will also require expertise that many of the    hospitals and  GP practices will not possess If they did many of the savings would already have been achieved Such savings over the next seven years will require some compulsion The current model of essentially independent trusts is fine when there is plenty of money around but is not a fitforpurpose model for todays financial challenges However the last thing the NHS needs is yet another major reorganisation An alternative would be to create task forces to support hospitals deliver savings Some could come through simple improvements in practice   being given the authority to send people for blood tests and Xrays before they see a consultant or doctor Other big wins could be single NHS wide structures for the management of procurement IT and estates Where does this leave the NHSs finances The bn a year that Stevens says the NHS will need by  assumes efficiencies of bn a year There is no chance that any political party will   so we should expect some radical surgery to the services being provided
