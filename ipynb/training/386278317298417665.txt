A charity is urging GPs to do more to diagnose bone cancers early in order to help to improve the survival rate The Bone Cancer Research Trust says the survival rate of  has barely changed in the last  years It says early diagnosis is key to spotting the condition which mainly affects young people Symptoms include painful bones or swollen joints which can be misdiagnosed as sporting injuries or growing pains Primary bone cancer is cancer which starts in the bones rather than spreads there The two most common types are osteosarcoma and Ewings sarcoma The condition is rare  there were just  new cases in the UK in   But it is an aggressive cancer and those who survive are often left with significant disabilities The trust has teamed up with the Royal College of GPs to launch a specialist elearning module to help doctors spot the symptoms and diagnose patients earlier Prof Andy Hall chairman of BCRTs independent scientific advisory panel said Primary bone cancer is thankfully very rare but it is vital that it is diagnosed early to give patients the best chance of survival He added The average length of time it takes for a patient to receive a correct diagnosis is  weeks from the time when the patient first noticed their symptoms  A simple Xray performed early can make all the difference Callum Flynn  from Leigh in Greater Manchester experienced knee pain for  months before being diagnosed with osteosarcoma   on his th birthday I would wake up with my knee locked I couldnt stand up That would last for about two weeks at a time  and it happened five or six times over an month period We kept going to the walkin centre because it seemed to be something that just happened overnight and they thought it was a virus each time But eventually I went to my GP who felt behind my knee and obviously felt the tumour though I wasnt told then  I had an Xray and a biopsy in the space of a week and a half His diagnosis came as a shock Id never heard of it I didnt think you could get cancer when you were young Callum had to have chemotherapy and a full knee replacement at the time and has recently had to have a further operation on his knee He cannot play all the sports he used to although he is part of the England physical disabilities cricket squad and toured with them in Dubai last year Callum also works to raise awareness of bone cancer and funds for research He says his experience of going undiagnosed for  months means he feels it is vital to raise awareness about early diagnosis And in the end he says it is simple to check It just took one Xray
