 Breast cancer detection increased by  percent when threedimensional mammography was combined with conventional breast imaging investigators reported The combined detection rate for invasive and in situ cancers was  per  exams with conventional mammography and  per  with combined imaging Combining D mammography tomosynthesis with conventional imaging led to a  percent increase in detection of invasive breast cancers and a  percent decrease in falsepositive results according to an article published online in   The overall actual number of women recalled as a result of arbitration was larger for those initially assigned a positive score at mammography plus tomosynthesis Per Skaane MD PhD of the University of Oslo in Norway and coauthors wrote of their findings However the concordant increase in the detection of  additional cancers resulted in a similar positive predictive value for the cases ultimately recalled for arbitration Because of the paired nature of the current study these results could be biased against mammography plus tomosynthesis in that some of the dismissed cases initially referred on the basis of mammography alone might not have been dismissed if tomosynthesis had not been available at arbitration Despite its proven ability to reduce breast cancer mortality screening mammography has several limitations such as overlapping imaged tissue As a result several xray and nonxray imaging modalities have been evaluated adjuncts or replacements for conventional plainfilm mammography Alternative imaging techniques evaluated to date have in common one potential drawback Each is performed as a separate procedure that requires technical and professional resources Use of tomosynthesis has been limited by inadequacy of image reconstruction possible with twodimensional data sets the authors noted in their introduction The advent of a new generation of detectors has created the potential to integrate tomosynthesis into routine clinical practice The feasibility of using tomosynthesis in breast imaging was demonstrated more than a decade ago and the FDA recently approved the first commercial system for clinical use Clinical evaluation of tomosynthesis has consisted largely of small retrospective studies involving specific patient populations in experimental settings Skaane and colleagues performed a randomized clinical trial to evaluate tomosynthesis in clinical practice The study was designed to address four issues cancer detection rate with tomosynthesis falsepositive rate positive predictive value for women recalled after arbitration of imaging results and the types of cancers detected by tomosynthesis The researchers studied a subgroup of women enrolled in an ongoing breast cancer screening program in Norway Investigators screened  women with both D mammography and tomosynthesis Screening consisted of two views of each breast by digital mammography and tomosynthesis which added about  seconds to image acquisition for each view Combined imaging doubled the radiation dose compared with mammography alone but remained within accepted safety limits Each image was interpreted independently by four experienced radiologists and a positive score was  All positive scores were reviewed during an arbitration meeting to reach a consensus The final analysis included  study participants Mammography alone resulted in the detection of  cancers and mammography plus tomosynthesis increased the detections to  a difference that translated into a  percent increase in the detection rate with combined imaging Adjustment for readerspecific performance levels resulted in a ratio of  for combined imaging versus mammography alone Evaluation of the different types of cancer detected by the two imaging strategies showed that mammography plus tomosynthesis led to detection of  invasive cancers versus  with mammography alone a  percent improvement Use of tomosynthesis also increased detection of highergrade cancers by  percent Arbitration led to recall of  women  with cancer and  with combined imaging  with cancer resulting in positive predictive values of  percent and  percent respectively These results suggest that despite the fact that the number of cases assigned a positive score before arbitration and recalled after arbitration was greater with mammography plus tomosynthesis there was no substantial decrease in the positive predictive value in these patients the authors noted Source
