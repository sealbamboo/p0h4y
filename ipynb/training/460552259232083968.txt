Sharon Holmes found a lump in her left breast quite by accident At work one day as a high school custodian her hand brushed up against her chest and she felt a knot sticking out She was perplexed After all just three months earlier she had been given an allclear sign from her doctor after a mammogram A new mammogram in February  showed she in fact had an aggressive stage  breast cancer The horror of the discovery was compounded by the reason The earlier test results she had gotten werent just read incorrectly They were falsified She wasnt alone in facing this news The lead radiological technologist at Perry Hospital in Perry a small community about  miles south of Atlanta had for about  months been signing off on mammograms and spitting out reports showing nearly  women were clear of any signs of breast cancer or abnormalities Except that she was wrong Holmes and nine other women were later shown to have lumps or cancerous tumors growing inside them Holmes said the discovery was horrific enough With a son in his s and another in high school at the time she trembled at the thought of leaving them without a mother To me that meant a death sentence she said She underwent successful surgery the month after the cancer was discovered to remove the lump from her breast and followed that with chemotherapy and radiation treatments Her breast has been cancerfree for four years and subsequent cancers found elsewhere in her lymph nodes and thyroid have been successfully treated Now she just prays it doesnt come back But to find out later that she had been deceived made it even worse Im thinking Im doing what Im supposed to do getting my tests done and then I find out someone else isnt doing their job Holmes told The Associated Press The tech Rachael Rapraeger pleaded guilty earlier this month to  misdemeanor charges of reckless conduct and one felony charge of computer forgery She was sentenced to serve up to six months in a detention center to serve  years on probation during which she cant work in the health care field and to pay a  fine The reasons she gave were vague She told police she had personal issues that caused her to stop caring about her job that she had fallen behind processing the piles of mammogram films that stacked up So she went into the hospitals computer system assumed the identities of physicians and gave each patient a clear reading an investigative report says That allowed her to avoid the timeconsuming paperwork required before the films are brought to a reading room for radiologists to examine her lawyer Floyd Buford told the AP Her actions were uncovered in April  after a patient whod received a negative report had another mammogram three months later at another hospital that revealed she had breast cancer As hospital staff began to investigate it was determined that the doctor whose name was on the faulty report had not been at the hospital the day the report was filed Rapraeger quickly confessed to her supervisor that she was responsible and was fired from her job about a week later according to an investigators report Rapraeger told police she knew what she was doing wasnt right but that she didnt consider the consequences until she realized a patient with cancer had been told her scan was clear She didnt return a phone call from The Associated Press seeking comment Her attorney said she feels great remorse about any pain that she caused Cary Martin CEO of Houston Healthcare which operates Perry Hospital released a statement saying he is pleased this component of Ms Rapraegers unfortunate action is concluded and declined to comment further Sara Bailey also received a falsenegative report By the time it was discovered her breast cancer progressed to the point that doctors had to remove her entire breast rather than just going in and removing a lump she said The surgery was successful and the cancer hasnt returned but Bailey carries a bitterness inside her that surfaces when she talks about her experience Im not hurting and I dont think I have cancer but Im not a woman anymore the yearold said her eyes welling with tears and her voice catching as she talked about the loss of her breast The emotional wound was opened again this month when Rapraeger received a sentence that Bailey saw as a slap on the wrist I feel like we were thrown under the bus and there will be an election day Bailey said explaining that she plans to organize an effort to get Houston Judicial Circuit District Attorney George Hartwig voted out of office Hartwig said he understands how Bailey feels and knows some people think Rapraeger got off easy but he said his office weighed the evidence in the case very carefully and concluded the plea was a fair outcome Even though Rapraeger did make statements and admissions to police they were too general to prove specific instances of wrongdoing he said Given the entirety of the case and the issues that were there I really feel like we did the best we could do to get a measure of justice for these women he said adding that it would have been even more disappointing if the case had gone to trial and shed been found not guilty and walked out of there with no penalty For her part Holmes  has tried to move on and testifying at Rapraegers sentencing helped with that I wanted her to know Im a person not just a name on a paper she said But shes still angry because lingering effects from her chemotherapy and radiation  treatments she said her doctors told her might not have been necessary if the cancer had been caught by the original mammogram  have kept her from returning to work as a high school janitor Like Bailey she thought Rapraegers sentence was too light and she was disappointed that Rapraeger didnt speak in court instead letting her attorney read a statement for her If she had gotten up and at least said Im sorry for what I did Im sorry these women had to go through this that to me would have meant that she was truly sorry for what we went through Holmes said Mary Brown had a mammogram in August  She was contacted by the hospital in May  and told to come back for another That one came back positive and she had a mastectomy to remove her right breast She considers herself lucky that she apparently had a slowgrowing cancer and didnt need to have chemotherapy or radiation Brown a yearold Jehovahs Witness credits her strong faith in God with helping her get through the ordeal and with helping her forgive Rapraeger I dont have any hard feelings about her Whatever she did she brought it on herself Brown said though she conceded her relative good fortune might also be coloring her reaction Maybe if I had been dying sick from it I would feel different  Associated Press
