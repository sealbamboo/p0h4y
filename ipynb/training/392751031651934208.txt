Were used to relying on antibiotics to cure bacterial infections But there are now strains of bacteria that are resistant to even the strongest antibiotics and are causing deadly infections According to the CDC more than  million people in the United States every year get infected with a resistant bacteria and about  people die from it journalist David Hoffman tells  s Terry Gross Many people are familiar with the type of resistant infections often acquired in hospitals caused by MRSA the acronym for   But most people dont know about the entirely different group of resistant bacteria that Hoffman reports on in  airing Tuesday on PBS   The show explores an outbreak of resistant bacteria at one of the most prestigious hospitals in the US and explains why there is surprisingly little research being conducted into new antibiotics to combat these new superbugs We really have a big information black hole about these really really dangerous bacteria and we need to know more and it ought to be a national priority Hoffman says Bacteria have been training at this for a long long time I think when a lot of people took antibiotics in the s and s there was a lot of talk then about miracle drugs and wonder drugs  Had we basically pushed back those evolutionary forces Had we essentially found a way to avoid infectious disease Well what were seeing is this evolutionary process in bacteria Its relentless and what happened here was that bacteria learned to basically teach each other to swap these enzymes and help each other learn how to beat back our best antibiotics our lastresort antibiotics didnt work  In the period before World War II  people that got infections they had to cut it out They had to cut off limbs cut off toes because there werent antibiotics And oftentimes when people talk about the fact that we might have to go back to a preantibiotic age thats what they mean  that a simple scrape on the playground could be fatal In the s and s I think there was something like  classes of new antibiotics And although there were warnings then that if we misused them that resistance would grow you could just see in the marketplace new ones coming on every couple of years  I think we got very very complacent  In the s and particularly in the s we went around the bend a little bit because the science didnt continue to produce new antibiotics at that rate and the economics of drug development changed rather remarkably  Were bombarded with advertisements that there are drugs now to treat chronic diseases  that you would take for the rest of your life And you can imagine if youre in drug development if you create and invent one of these drugs that can tackle a chronic disease that people will take forever the return on investment for the drug companies to develop those big blockbuster drugs  that became irresistible But think about antibiotics If theyre taken properly you take them only for a short course a couple of weeks maybe and then you stop and you forget it you get better  So the economics of making antibiotics wasnt going to make these big profits for the drug companies And slowly but with increasing frequency they begun to pull out of research on antibiotics One feature of some antibioticresistant bacteria is that they have kind of a hard armor around them a shell which protects them from antibiotics They also have the ability to pump out the antibiotics or to basically chew it up inside These  are very very difficult to treat you just dont have antibiotics for them  NDM an enzyme that makes bacteria antibioticresistant has a very very unusual but worrisome characteristic and that is this It has a mechanism to transfer its genes  its genetic material  which helps it resist antibiotics It can transform that to other bugs It can walk around like a coach giving training and directions to other bacteria  helping other bacteria become resistant to antibiotics  teaching them how to do it  NDM is now spreading in the United States  There have been  cases and the year before the numbers doubled in a year You know its not an epidemic or anything but these things are popping up now with more and more frequency in hospitals and in patients around the United States Its here This clinical center is a very sophisticated research hospital Patients are invited there because of research programs going on in the many different institutes of the National Institutes of Heath Its not a hospital you walk into with a sore throat They had enrolled and invited a patient from New York a woman who had had a major operation and she was invited for a particular study that they needed to do When they came they looked at her chart and they had no warning but the chart said that this woman had this drugresistant bacteria  which they had never seen before This is a resistant bacteria called KPC its resistant to some of our most modern last resort  antibiotics They did what they could to prevent this bacteria from spreading They put her in whats called enhanced contact isolation Gloves and gowns for everybody put her at the end of the ICU in her own room and they went through with the research they had to do And after a month  she seemed to survive it she was discharged Everybody at the clinical center breathed a sigh of relief  Then there was a couple weeks of quiet And then a really really surprising thing happened This particular bacteria started to show up in other patients in routine surveillance of the patients Suddenly in the microbiology lab theyre beginning to see this thing and none of these other patients had any contact with the first one  So where was this bug Where was the mechanism that it was moving around And that was a real crisis  So they went through a series of phases of this war that they carried out to try to deal with this The first thing that they thought was Maybe its just in the environment maybe it was on door handles maybe it was on a doctors hands or gloves  So they began to clean a lot of things  They did everything they could to bleach and clean and make sure they could stop it and they still didnt stop it it started to continue to spread  They approached a team of genomics specialists and the people in genomics had some very tentative early experience of taking a bacteria and taking a look at its entire genetic blueprint  So they took a couple samples of this bug that was racing around  and they started running it through the computers It takes a while it took a couple of weeks but when they got the results back everybody was completely stunned  The results showed that the bug had jumped from patient No  to several other people and it had jumped by being carried by people who didnt get sick from it They found out that there were intermediaries or silent carriers that were spreading it around To this day we dont know if the silent carriers were other patients or hospital workers They began to see that this wasnt so much a problem of KPC being in the environment as it was people were moving it around In other countries take Canada for example outbreaks are routinely announced by the hospitals In the European Union they are tracking the rise of resistant bacteria in a way that we arent  I think a little more better tracking better information and transparency would make us all more sensitive to these things and maybe wake us up a little bit from this complacency that we got to miracle drugs in the s and s and realize that this is a very very precarious and precious thing we have We need to act that way  The data the information on this entire thread is very very slim There is not a national surveillance system reporting to the CDC on these new kinds of infections and its something we really need I think its something the government knows we need and we dont have it There are a few states that require reporting on these kinds of infections A few require some hospitals to report and you know after last March when the head of the CDC first spoke out and called these things nightmare bacteria a couple more states signed up and required their hospitals to begin reporting You cant go to any single place and find out whats going on  The last I checked only about  hospitals were participating
