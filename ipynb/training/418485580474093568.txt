The Food and Drug Administration is considering restricting or even possibly banning menthol cigarettes Public health advocates are pushing for this saying menthol makes cigarettes more addictive and makes it easier for young people to start smoking But opponents argue theres no evidence that menthol is bad and even some evidence it may be less risky They also worry about creating a dangerous black market for menthol cigarettes especially in African American communities where menthol is most popular
