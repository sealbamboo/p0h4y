Parents are forever warning children and teenagers that bad things will happen if they take big risks But the kids never seem to listen That may be because their brains just arent properly processing the odds that theyll break an arm or be in a car crash To find this out researchers at University College London asked  young people ages  to  to guess the odds that particular bad things would happen to them The list of  unfortunate events ranged from being seriously injured in a car crash to getting lice After they guessed they were told the real odds of those bad things Evidently  in  Londoners is likely to be a victim of burglary during his or her life After being told the real risk the participants were asked to guess the odds once again They were all good at remembering the actual risk if it wasnt as bad as theyd originally thought But the younger the participant the worse they were at recalling the risks when they were worse than they had first thought The problem though wasnt really that the kids couldnt remember We actually checked peoples memory say   a psychologist who studies the neuroscience behind decisionmaking at University College London and an author of the study Sharot and her colleagues also adjusted for the fact that the older participants should be better at learning facts And they made sure that all the people understood percentages And it wasnt that the youngsters were raving optimists No Pollyannas there But the older the participants the better they were at accurately adjusting their expectations when warned about a real danger The younger participants just randomly adjusted risk This may be why teenagers seem to disregard warnings about the risks of drinking and driving smoking and other evils Sharot tells Shots All humans tend to discount bad news while expecting things to work out This study suggests that the ability to incorporate risks into decisionmaking is something it takes years to learn The   were published online in the   The study findings square with neuroscience showing that positive information is processed in many parts of the brain while negative information tends to be centered in the prefrontal cortex Sharot says Thats the part of the brain that matures last into the s in many cases Its the area in charge of judgment and problemsolving We learn better from good news than from bad news Sharot says Parents may gain more traction by emphasizing the benefits of avoiding risk If you want your kids to eat their fruits and vegetables its not that youll get sick if you dont eat it she says Youll be smart and better at sports Teenagers might benefit from being reminded that theyll be more likely to make the basketball team if theyre not smoking cigarettes
