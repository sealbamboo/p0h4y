It began with a little boy A yearold who was feeling sick His family sent him to a neighboring village called Royail where his grandmother lives so she could care for him In this tiny place surrounded by tall grass and palm trees the grandmother lived in a house on a dirt road Her name was Sinnah Turay but people refer to her as the mamiback  thats what some folks in Sierra Leone call a grandmother What happened in Turays house has set off a deadly chain of infections in a country where Ebola is now surging where government and aid groups are scrambling to build treatment centers and where local communities like the district that Royail is in are straining to care for patients with mixed results Standing outside the house a youth leader Samuel Bangura tells what happened The grandsons symptoms became really serious Vomit A bloody nose Bloody diarrhea All classic signs of Ebola The other villagers were alarmed At their insistence Turay sent her grandson back to his home village He died there a week ago But by then Turay had already started to feel sick showing the same symptoms The villagers called an ambulance Turays son Alpha Fofanah says when it arrived his mother refused to get in She said she only had pain She didnt think she had Ebola All last week Turay grew weaker Finally another ambulance came for her Once again she resisted She said Id rather die at home And right then right there thats what she did With the ambulance still parked outside But Ebola wasnt done with this village A traditional healer named Baby Sesay had treated the yearold boy Now she was feeling sick When the ambulance first came for her she hid in the jungle The villagers say its not surprising  there are a lot of myths surrounding this outbreak Many people believe that if you fall sick and are taken to the hospital youll be injected with poison and die The next day Sesay changed her mind and asked for help The problem Right now there are only a few Ebola treatment centers for all of Sierra Leone So officials will refer only those people with the most severe symptoms  what they call the wet cases  for treatment The dry cases  people like Sesay who present with only a fever or body aches  are sent to a newly built community care center to wait until they can be tested for Ebola The ninebed center is a concrete block building surrounded by two rows of tarp fencing The man who runs it is Alfred Kamara the local chief When we arrive he says Sesay is feeling well enough to speak A middleaged woman in a print cloth dress walks out She moves very slowly and grips a pole to steady herself We speak to her from the other side of the fence about  feet way I ask How are you feeling She says My body weak I have a headache Suddenly her body seizes up For several seconds shes rigid hands locked on that pole Eyes wide and frozen breathing heavily Just as suddenly shes back Still it is clear shes in no condition to give an interview I urge Kamara to tell her to go back inside and lie down Since hes not wearing protective gear all he can do is call out to her Sesay staggers back toward the building Another patient watches nervously He came in with a mild fever to get checked out But its taking days to get his test results Now his fevers gone Stuck in a small room with Sesay hes worried he could get Ebola from her I dont want her to be so close Kamara agrees this is a dangerous situation Instead of stemming Ebola this community care center could be spreading it He gets on the phone with an official to tell him Sesays condition is deteriorating He wants her sent to a treatment center He says she cant wait Ebola is not waiting he tells me Hes aggressively destroying your important systems inside your body When he finally hears back its not the answer he wants There are no free beds Baby Sesay will have to stay
