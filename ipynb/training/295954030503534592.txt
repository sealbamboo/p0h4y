Americans have gotten heavier since   this we know And most doctors would say that the extra weight has made us more prone to   diabetes arthritis hypertension and even cancer Its become a source of major national anxiety The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation   that every state in the nation will have an obesity rate greater than  percent by  and will be sicker for it But not everyone is convinced obesity in America warrants so much gloom and doom Take   an associate professor of sociology at the University of California Los Angeles and the author of a new book called She argues weve gone too far in equating obesity with disease People think that being obese means being sick and there are some health risks but risk is not the same thing as illness Saguy tells Shots Thats a controversial view given how many other researchers would argue the link between obesity and declining health is pretty clear But shes skeptical about the strength of the data proving causality with the exception of Type  diabetes which she concedes is tied to excess weight One of her criticisms is the blunt tool with which doctors assess health and weight   which doctors say is unhealthy when it hits  or higher Its a very arbitrary threshold  there are plenty of people with BMI well over  who are perfectly healthy she says and plenty of people at normal weight with metabolic issues She says that as bigger bodies have become framed as a medical problem those bodies are increasingly seen as bad We are living in society in which is it so deeply ingrained that it is bad immoral to be fat Fat people are widely seen as lazy selfish and consuming too much resources This takes a toll she argues in the form of social problems like bullying weight discrimination and eating disorders And doctors can make the problem worse by turning their offices into what she says is a hostile environment Obese women Saguy says are less likely to get Pap smears and thus have higher rates of cervical cancer Instead Saguy would like to see obesity framed as another form of human diversity  beautiful and healthy And if she had her way wed do away with the word obesity entirely trading it for fatness The problem with assuming that the obesity epidemic has been overblown is that plenty of people are not even aware that their weight puts them at risk for disease which means theyre at even greater risk Some observers like   a bioethicist who specializes in health policy at the Hastings Center argue that we need to apply more social pressure not less to help people lose weight People who are unaware they are overweight need to use an old phrase a shock of recognition Callahan wrote in a recent Hastings   Only a carefully calibrated effort of public social pressure is likely to awaken them to the reality of their condition They have been lulled into obliviousness about their problem because they look no different from many others around them Though policymakers like New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also support nudging people publicly to eat less with things like   there are other signs that thinness as the ideal body shape may not rule anymore One sign is the   A recent survey of  adults found that about  percent of women reported being on a diet in  Thats a significant drop from the  percent who said they were dieting back in  And a recent   also found that a little extra body weight may be associated with living longer Saguy applauds those findings and calls them a reminder of the socalled obesity paradox that suggests some people who are overweight may be healthier in the long run
