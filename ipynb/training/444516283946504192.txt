year she rarely made it into the frantic scrum at the doors of Rock Bridge High School here by the first bell at  am Then she heard that the school board was about to make the day start even earlier at  am I thought if that happens I will die recalled Jilly  I will drop out of school That was when the sleepdeprived teenager turned into a sleep activist She was determined to convince the board of a truth she knew in the core of her tired lanky body Teenagers are developmentally driven to be late to bed late to rise Could the board realign the first bell with that biological reality The sputtering nearly year movement to start high schools later has recently gained momentum in communities like this one as hundreds of schools in dozens of districts across the country have bowed to the   on the adolescent body clock In just the last two years high schools in Long Beach Calif Stillwater Okla Decatur Ga and Glens Falls NY have pushed back their first bells joining early adopters in Connecticut North Carolina Kentucky and Minnesota The Seattle school board will vote this month on whether to pursue the issue The superintendent of Montgomery County Md supports the shift and the school board for Fairfax County Va is working with consultants to develop options for starts after  am  suggests that later high school starts have widespread benefits Researchers at the University of Minnesota funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied eight high schools in three states before and after they moved to later start times in recent years In results released Wednesday they found that the later a schools start time the better off the students were on many measures including mental health car crash rates attendance and in some schools grades and standardized test scores Dr Elizabeth Miller chief of adolescent medicine at Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh who was not involved in the research noted that the study was not a randomized controlled trial which would have compared schools that had changed times with similar schools that had not But she said its methods were pragmatic and its findings promising Even schools with limited resources can make this one policy change with what appears to be benefits for their students Dr Miller said Researchers have found that during adolescence as hormones surge and the brain develops teenagers who

into sensing wakeful daylight slowing the release of melatonin and the onset of sleep The Minnesota study noted that  percent of the students kept a cellphone in their bedroom But many parents and some students object to shifting the start of the day later They say doing so makes sports practices end late jeopardizes student jobs bites into time for homework and extracurricular activities and upsets the morning routine for working parents and younger children At heart though experts say the resistance is driven by skepticism about the primacy of sleep Its still a badge of honor to get five hours of sleep said  a sleep expert at the Childrens National Medical Center in Washington It supposedly means youre working harder and thats a good thing So there has to be a cultural shift around sleep Last January Jilly decided she would try to make that change happen in the Columbia school district which sprawls across  square miles of flatland with  students and  bus routes But before she could make the case for a later bell she had to show why an earlier one just would not do She got the idea in her teamtaught Advanced Placement world history class which explores the role of leadership Students were urged to find a contemporary topic that ignited their passion One morning the teachers mentioned that a school board committee had recommended an earlier start time to solve logistical problems in scheduling bus routes The issue would be discussed at a school board hearing in five days If you do not like it the teachers said do something Jilly did the ugly math A first bell at  am meant she would have to wake up at  am She had found her passion She seemed an unlikely choice to halt what was almost a done deal She was just a sophomore and did not particularly relish conflict But Jilly the youngest of seven children had learned to be independent early on Her mother died when she was  And she is energetic and forthright That year she had interned on a voter turnout drive for Missouri Democrats volunteered in a Frenchimmersion prekindergarten class written for the student newspaper worked at a fastfood pizza restaurant and maintained an A average in French Spanish and Latin Its about time management she explained one recent afternoon curled up in an armchair at home That Wednesday she pulled an allnighter She created a   and set up a   alerting hundreds of students about the school board meeting Be there to have a say in your school districts decisions on school start times She then got in touch with  a nonprofit group that provided her with scientific ammunition She recruited friends and divided up sleepresearch topics With a blast of emails she tried to enlist the help of every high school teacher in the district She started an online   The students she organized made hundreds of posters and fliers and posted advice on Twitter If you are going to be attending the board meeting tomorrow we recommend that you dress up The testy school board meeting that Monday was packed Jilly wearing a demure ruffled white blouse and skirt addressed the board blinking owllike The dignitaries faces were a blur to her because while nervously rubbing her eyes she had removed her contact lenses But she spoke coolly about the adolescent sleep cycle You know kids dont want to get up she said I know I dont Biologically weve looked into that The board heatedly debated the issue and decided against the earlier start time The next day Jilly turned to campaigning for a later start time joining a movement that has been gaining support A    by the Brookings Institution recommended later start times for high schools and last summer Arne Duncan the secretary of education posted his endorsement of the idea on Twitter The University of Minnesota study tracked  high school students in five districts in Colorado Wyoming and Minnesota before and after schools shifted start times In those that originally started at  am only a third of students said they were able to get eight or more hours of sleep Students who got less than that reported significantly more symptoms of depression and greater use of caffeine alcohol and illegal drugs than betterrested peers Its biological  the mental health outcomes were identical from innercity kids and affluent kids said Kyla Wahlstrom a professor of educational research at the University of Minnesota and the lead author of the study In schools that now start at  am nearly  percent of students reported getting eight hours of sleep nightly In  the high school in Jackson Wyo moved the first bell to  am from  am During that academic year car crashes by drivers  to  years old dropped to seven from  the year before Academic results improved though not across the board After high schools in the South Washington County district outside Minneapolis switched to an  am start grades in some first and thirdperiod classes rose between half a point and a full grade point And the study found that composite scores on national tests such as the ACT rose significantly in two of the five districts Many researchers say that quality sleep directly affects learning because people store new facts during deepsleep cycles During the rapideyemovement phases the brain is wildly active sorting and categorizing the days data The   the better the information is absorbed Without enough sleep said  a   and assistant professor of psychology at the University of Notre Dame teenagers are losing the ability not only to solidify information but to transform and restructure it extracting inferences and insights into problems Last February the school board in Columbia met to consider later start times It is really reassuring to know that students can have a say in the matter Jilly told them So thank you guys for that The moment of decision arrived at the boards next meeting in March Jilly sat in the front row posting on Twitter and addressed the board one last time I know its not the most conventional thing and its going to get some pushback she said referring to the later time But it is the right decision The board voted  to  to push back the high school start time to  am Jilly kicked it over the edge for us said Chris Belcher the superintendent It is now seven months into the new normal At Rock Bridge High School the later end to the day at  pm is problematic for some including athletes who often miss the last period to make their away games After doing homework it gets to be  pm pretty quickly said Brayden Parker a senior varsity football player I would prefer to get home by dark and have more time to chill out The high schools in the district have tried to adjust for example by adding WiFi access to buses so athletes can do homework on the road Some classes meet only one or two days a week and are supplemented with online instruction More sports practices and clubs convene before school Some parents and firstperiod teachers are seeing a payoff in students who are more rested and alert At  am on a recent school day Rock Bridge High a long onestory building with skylights and wide hallways was sundrenched and almost silent Then like an orchestra tuning up students gradually started arriving some for debate club and choir others to meet in the cafeteria for breakfast and gossip Laughter crackled across the lobby as buses dropped off more students and others drifted in from the parking lots The growing crowds could almost be described as civilized At  am Jilly burst through the north entrance door long hair uncombed and flyaway wearing no makeup lugging her backpack Even when I am late to school now she said dashing down a corridor to make that  bell its only by three or four minutes
