His main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store   In truth she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autismrelated delays  the limb difference was secondary So when a friend shared a   with Wyatt in mind about a team of University of Central Florida UCF students and graduates that made an electronic arm for yearold Pring using a threedimensional printer on campus Falardeau was defensive  He doesnt need this she thought  Her fifthgrader had a different reaction I want one of these robot arms Falardeau remembers Wyatt telling her and her husband I could ride a bike I might even be able to paddle a kayak  There were other things the yearold boy said he would do if he had two hands A proper somersault Clap with two hands Dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading Stuff she hadnt really thought about but he clearly had Falardeau got in touch with the Orlando students through   an online volunteer organization started by Rochester Institute of Technology research scientist Jon Schull to match people who have D printers with children in need of hands and arms The organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at   that can be assembled for as little as  to  Middle and high school student groups and Girl and Boy Scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free The UCF team which operates a nonprofit called   is special because its the only group in the D volunteer network making electronic arms Most D arms are mechanical which presents a challenge for children without elbows With mechanical arms the child opens and closes their hand by bending their elbow The students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their bicep Its really just a stepbystep process of solving problems The first problem we solved was how do we make the hand move electronically And then how do we attach this arm to a child said sophomore Tyler Petresky Its just one problem after another we keep solving Thats what engineering is all about  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about  babies in the United States are born with upper limb deformities each year Comprehensive statistics arent available for the number of children with amputations such as Wyatt  The UCF project started when Albert Manero an engineering doctoral student heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the D printed hand He got involved with ENable and met Alex a local boy teased because of his missing arm and set about designing a robotic replacement They gave it to Alex for free  My mother taught us that were supposed to help change the world   Were supposed to help make it better   The students were blown away by what happened after that The Today Show and other national news outlets featured stories about Alex and Manero and then they got international attention Families in more than  countries have asked the UCF students to help their children In February Microsoft highlighted the team in a   celebrating students using technology to change the world  Each electronic limb takes about  to  hours to make and assemble The students use the printer in the schools manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials  about   through donations Petresky got involved with the design of Prings hand because Manero knew he was good with electronics  He bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches I went over to his house and helped him out with electronics he said I found out he was working on an arm and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world Eventually Manero moved to Germany for a Fulbright scholarship and left Petresky in charge of running the operations in Orlando Petresky says they ask every family about the childs favorite color superhero and interests so the new limb can not just be a piece of plastic  but be a part of them  As theyve designed the bionics theyve learned that kids dont necessarily want to blend in Children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes Disneys Frozen and in Wyatts case the blueskinned men from Blue Man Group For Christmas the group upgraded Alexs plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling Optimus Prime from Transformers We quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal and much more about expressing yourself Petresky said Theres a large aspect of being artistic and being creative The team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including Wyatt He traveled with his mom to UCF last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close  He expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month His mom Cynthia was most excited about seeing Wyatt being celebrated for who he is The adoration of college students was an affirmation that money cant buy He was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself she wrote in her iReport Wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children As they got ready to leave the campus her son told her he cant wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm And someday he said he wants to go to UCF and help other kids like him
