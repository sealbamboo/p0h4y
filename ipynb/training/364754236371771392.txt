Public health advocates have lobbied hard in recent years to clear restaurants bars and other workplaces of tobacco smoke and the winds seem to be at their back Already   and the District of Columbia have enacted some version of an indoor smoking ban to protect the health of workers and patrons and many local communities in other states have followed suit But stateregulated casinos are often  from such restrictions as are of course the casinos on tribal lands Its politics says the University of California San Franciscos   who has spent decades tracing the damaging effects of secondhand smoke to the heart and lungs Tobacco and gaming interests really fight for these exemptions he tells Shots To get a rough measure of whether those exemptions for casinos actually hurt health Glantz and a colleague scrutinized  years worth of ambulance call data from Colorado In particular they focused on    the highcountry home to more than two dozen casinos within about three square miles The researchers compared the number of calls for ambulances in the county before and after Colorado extended its workplace smoking bans to include casinos in  The effect seemed surprisingly strong Glantz says of his   published online this week in the journal   After the smoking ban in restaurants bars and most other workplaces was initially enacted in  the number of ambulancesummoning phone calls that were made from any location   casinos dropped by  percent But the number of such calls made from casinos stayed as high as it had been the year before Then two years later  after casinos banned smoking too  the number of such emergency calls made from the grounds of a casino dropped by a little over  percent Such calls from all locations have continued to stay down years after the implementation of the smoking ban Considered in isolation the findings confirm only a correlation not a causal link Glantz says Other factors such as high gas prices for example or tough economic times could have slightly reduced the number of patrons who visited casinos during some of the years studied Fewer patrons might need fewer emergency calls Plus the database Glantz looked at didnt reveal the nature of each emergency Surely some childbirths dizzy spells and panic attacks were mixed in with the heart attacks asthma attacks and strokes But a   published last week and covering much the same time period suggests that   of some business owners smokefree laws did not have an adverse economic impact on restaurants or bars in any of the states studied according to the authors And in the context of whats known about how smoke affects physiology the way the number of calls decreased after each ban makes it very likely Glantz says that curtailing smoking inside the casinos was what reduced the phone calls about health emergencies All the pieces fit together he says Many other studies have shown that in addition to aggravating lung conditions inhaled smoke can very quickly make platelets stickier and irritate the lining of blood vessels in ways that can lead to the sudden formation of arteryclogging clots that can cause   Glantz says Last fall   showed that once smoking was banned in bars and workplaces the number of deaths from heart attacks dropped within months
