he first sign of trouble was the sound of a smash There on my street in Kentish Town north   was a sheepish looking teenager on a moped another sitting down and a third lying in the road groaning Otherwise the street was deserted At first it appeared the boy on his back who Ill call Nathan was just drunk and embarrassed But the scream when he tried to move his leg suggested otherwise So I called  It was am on Monday morning and three degrees below freezing The events that followed are small in the scheme of things But the inadequacies of the response to Nathans accident raise troubling questions about the state of our ambulance services and the groundlevel consequences of cuts that can often seem like a political abstraction Once the situation was explained the operator said he couldnt be sure when an ambulance would be available Nathans mates left Police believe the moped was stolen Two other neighbours brought blankets and pillows Operators called back a few times to little effect Nathan whos  seemed to be in shock He required repeated reassurance that he wasnt going to die  After half an hour the police arrived Initially they seemed more concerned about the alleged moped theft  theyd had a runin with Nathan and his mates earlier that night  than about his injury But as they realised that he wasnt putting it on their focus changed And they were clearly exasperated Over the radio they were told that an ambulance was out of the question The service was in a surge purple enhanced state once vanishingly rare   and the London ambulance service LAS says particularly so in the last month That status means that only life or death calls will get an ambulance The best estimate they could give on an arrival time for Nathan was   It wasnt even a Friday or a Saturday night one dismayed officer pointed out This is the only real incident were dealing with in the whole borough right now he said and we still cant get an ambulance But what could they do Nathan was getting colder One of the officers was a trained emergency medical technician EMT and he was concerned that the boy was showing signs of hypothermia He wanted to get him to hospital as quickly as possible before things got worse They tried to move him but his screams were so severe that they gave that up pretty fast The trained EMT radioed to ask if he could go and pick up gas and air from the local hospital to administer himself but the request was denied Nathans mum arrived At first she was angry with her son If you were at home in bed and not out on the street this wouldnt be happening she said But she soon softened kneeling to stroke her sons hair as he moaned and shivered Still no ambulance No pain relief Eventually one of the officers puffed out his cheeks OK mate he said It looks like youre going to have to man up Just after  am seven police officers surrounded Nathan unwrapped his duvet swaddling and tried as tenderly as they could to move him into the back of their van Nathan did his best to man up but hes not actually a man yet and he had been lying in the road with a badly broken leg for an hour and  minutes As he screamed his mother wept a few feet away Statistics published by LAS hint at why this has happened after years of reaching their benchmark of getting to  or more of the most serious calls within eight minutes   In May the figure across London was  in October it was  LAS insists this has   They blame a skills shortage and an unexplained growth in serious calls   up on last year They say theyre on a recruitment drive Unison who represent ambulance staff are not impressed    paramedics are leaving London because they can get more money elsewhere and talks about a tidal wave of departures  and neither were the police officers on my street More and more ambulance services were being put on their shoulders they said making it harder for them to do the work that is more properly theirs Nathan was given morphine as soon as he arrived at hospital He turned out to have fractures to his femur and his kneecap On Monday afternoon he was in surgery He was never in danger of dying its true and if he had been an ambulance would have come In a statement LAS said they were sorry that no ambulance could attend blaming a high number of lifeordeath calls But is that the standard we now set And if we now accept that children with multiple fractures are to be left to lie freezing cold in the road in the middle of the night shouldnt we be asking how our expectations got so low  This article was amended on  December An earlier version said the growth in serious calls was up  on last year That proportion was in fact
