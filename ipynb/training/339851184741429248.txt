Hospitals can sharply reduce the spread of the drugresistant bacteria in their intensive care units by decontaminating all patients rather than screening them and focusing only on those found to be infected already researchers reported Wednesday A study involving more than  patients in  intensive care units nationwide found that cleaning   ICU patients with a special soap and ointment reduced all infections including MRSA by  percent For the patients in group that got disinfected no matter what there were  infections per  days in the hospital That result compared with a baseline of  infections per  days beforehand The   published in   is the largest to evaluate strategies for controlling infections with   or methicillinresistant   Infections with these superbugs have become a big problem Patients in the ICU are already very sick and the last thing they need to deal with is a preventable infection said a statement by Dr Carolyn M Clancy head of the federal   which funded the study This research has the potential to influence clinical practice significantly and create a safer environment where patients can heal without harm Some states have started requiring hospitals to screen patients for MRSA This study tried to figure out if that was really the best strategy For the study hospitals were randomly asked to try one of three strategies testing ICU patients for MRSA and isolating those infected testing patients for MRSA and disinfecting those infected or disinfecting all patients The researchers found that disinfecting all patients was much more effective inreducing MRSA and other infections too This study helps answer a longstanding debate in the medical field about whether we should tailor our efforts to prevent infection to specific pathogens such as MRSA or whether we should identify a highrisk patient group and give them all special treatment to prevent infection said   of the University of California Irvine who led the study in the news release The universal decolonization strategy was the most effective and the easiest to implement she said It eliminates the need for screening ICU patients for MRSA The researchers said the approach could also be effective for reducing other emerging infections that are resistant to treatment They cautioned however that doctors will have to watch closely to make sure the germs dont become resistant to the disinfecting soaps and ointments In an   accompanying the study   and   of Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine said the study illustrates the folly of pursuing legislative mandates when evidence is lacking State laws mandating MRSA screening should be repealed they say
