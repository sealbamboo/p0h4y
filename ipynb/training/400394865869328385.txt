In an effort to stop a spate of gonorrhea outbreaks at least one public health department in the Pacific Northwest is offering a helpful service to infected patients anonymous notification of former sexual partners Thats right A government worker will track down and contact each ex for you Awkward for all concerned Yes But at a time when   is becoming stubbornly drugresistant health officials see it as time  and embarrassment  well spent Anna Halloran who works for   in eastern Washington is kind of like a private investigator She tries to find people who dont know they might have a sexually transmitted disease and get them treatment before they spread the infection I feel a big sense of accomplishment when Ive found somebody after Ive been looking for them for weeks she says And its not always easy I try phone I try the mail Halloran says Shell try texting Facebook even tracking people down in person You know its a really sensitive subject And its really hard news for people to get Were not able to listen in on one of her actual phone calls because of confidentiality issues But I ask her to walk me through the process So Ill ask Is this Jessica  Halloran says And then I would ask your birthday and if that matches what I have I would say Im calling from the Spokane Regional Health District And Im calling to let you know that you may have been exposed to gonorrhea And then I would pause for a little bit says Halloran Then I would ask what the person Im talking to knows about gonorrhea The STD is normally completely treatable with a single course of antibiotics But it may produce very few symptoms for quite a while before blossoming into a serious health problem such as pelvic inflammatory disease or infertility Some people cry some people get really angry some people dont want to talk to me at all Halloran says A lot of people are really anxious to know who it was who gave them the infection Of course I cant say anything whatsoever that would identify that Now you might be wondering Shouldnt it be the patients job to notify expartners People dont necessarily do that says   a public health researcher at Oregon State University Studies show that couples  especially young couples  dont communicate about their sexual histories Surprise surprise And telling an ex about an STD infection can be especially difficult Warren says Public health departments just want to make sure the conversation happens Partner notification by a third party is now standard practice in Washington and some other states to help curb the spread of syphilis and HIV Warren says theres an incentive to add gonorrhea to the list It may not always be easily curable Though the Washington cases can still be successfully treated with antibiotics if caught early enough some parts of Europe and Asia are already seeing drugresistant gonorrhea Certainly there is an expectation that its just a matter of time Warren says This fall the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report identifying a form of super gonorrhea as an urgent threat Five counties in Washington are in the midst of   of the STD Halloran says health officials are struggling to explain the rise You know I wait for the time when our numbers go down Halloran says But I have to keep thinking of what the case rates would be like if we werent doing this work Halloran sees the messy side of relationships  lies infidelities Occasionally shes even been asked to notify the current partner of someone who tested positive for gonorrhea On the bright side no one so far has asked her to dump their girlfriend or boyfriend for them I dont do breakups Halloran says with a laugh Halloran says that in her experience most people want to do the right thing and make sure their sexual partners are notified  even if theyre not quite brave enough to make the call themselves
