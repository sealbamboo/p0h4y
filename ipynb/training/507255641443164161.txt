For the past four years doctors offices medical clinics and pharmacies have offered older adults highdose versions of the annual  flu vaccine  The hope was that this alternative would better protect seniors but scientific evidence proving its effectiveness has been lacking Now a study published recently in The New England Journal of Medicine finds that Fluzone HighDose   reducing cases of the flu by  percent compared with the standard version  But some experts warn that it remains difficult to assess the effectiveness of flu vaccines generally in older patients Fluzone HighDose contains four times the amount of antigen an agent that stimulates the immune system found in other flu shots Previous research had indicated this boost produced a greater antibody response in recipients   significant because the immune response becomes less robust with age The Food and Drug Administration asked for more rigorous proof of effectiveness when it approved Fluzone HighDose for those  and older on an expedited basis in   The agency wanted evidence that the vaccine reduced the number of people who had influenza  In the new study scientists working for the manufacturer and at several universities compared  older adults who received the highdose vaccine in  and  to  seniors who got the standard vaccine The key finding was that  percent of the first group contracted the flu versus  percent of the second group A lot of physicians have been waiting to see these results said Dr David Greenberg the chief medical officer at Sanofi Pasteur and an author of the new study Sanofi Pasteur has distributed nearly  million doses of Fluzone HighDose since the vaccine was introduced in  and in the coming flu season expects to exceed the  million doses sold in the  season Dr Greenberg said  The cost of the highdose vaccine is  a dose and Medicare covers one shot a year without a copayment Other experts acknowledged the finding but raised several concerns   We have no way of knowing how the highdose vaccine worked versus no vaccine at all said Michael Osterholm the director of the University of Minnesotas Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy The authors said that the standard vaccine prevents the flu about  percent of the time in older adults But that figure comes from  research that has been shown to be biased and unreliable Dr Osterholm said  The truth is we have very little evidence about the extent to which flu vaccine works in older adults because good randomized controlled studies have never been done in the older population said Lisa Jackson the senior investigator for immunization studies at Group Health Research Institute in Seattle Some evidence comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  In the  flu season the agency found the standard flu vaccine   In the  season effectiveness    But the sample sizes were small and the results probably not very reliable Dr Osterholm said   Another concern relates to the small portion of older adults who came down with the flu in the new study less than  percent   We have probably substantially overestimated how much influenza contributes to deaths in the older population and how much improvement occurs due to vaccination Dr Osterholm said   The CDC nonetheless continues to recommend annual flu shots for all older adults and there is no evidence that the highdose vaccine causes unusual side effects If you can get the highdose vaccine its probably going to work better than the standard dose Dr Osterholm said
