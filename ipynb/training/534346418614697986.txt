 Actavis PLC is nearing a deal to acquire Allergan Inc. in a tie-up that would likely be the year’s largest and could help shield Botox maker Allergan from a hostile takeover.. The boards of Actavis and Allergan are expected to meet in coming days to review a cash-and-stock takeover, people familiar with the matter said, and an announcement is expected this week. The price under discussion couldn’t be learned, but likely would be at a premium to Allergan’s market capitalization of $59 billion.
