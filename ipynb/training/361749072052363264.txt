This is not a   Nor is it an extreme version of   Nope the strategy of socalled  diets is to endure two days a week of minifasting This doesnt mean starving yourself Rather it entails reducing your calorie intake during two days of the week down to somewhere in the range of  to  calories The idea of intermittent minifasting seems to be gaining traction One version of the diet is being popularized by Michael Mosley a British physician and journalist whos written a bestselling book called  and produced a documentary And there are other popular tomes on the topic Take for instance   which claims you can boost your brain power and transform your health by feasting for five days and fasting for two With so much hype I was skeptical so I dug a little deeper into the science behind these diets My first stop was Baltimore where I visiting the National Institute on Aging Its here that researcher Mark Mattson has conducted a lot of pioneering animal studies Hes interested in how limiting calories may fend off agingrelated diseases Hes found that intermittent fasting in rodents seems to improve their blood sugar levels boost performance on cognitive tasks and help keep them lean The bottom line is that the intermittent fasting does a good job in allowing the animals to maintain a low lean body weight Mattson told me Mattson has been following a version of the fasting diet himself for several years His intent is not to lose weight since hes already very lean Rather he says he fasts for about  hours a day several times a week because it makes him feel better My mind is more focused he told me He says hes more productive So whats the evidence that this diet works in people who are trying to lose weight The most convincing evidence comes from a   that was done in Manchester England a few years back About  women all of them overweight were asked to follow a diet in which for five days a week they followed a Mediterranean diet pattern of eating The other two days they ate a lowcalorie diet of lean protein and cut out almost all carbohydrates At the end of the study the women on this  diet lost significantly more weight compared to women whod tried to restrict calories all week long And in addition their insulin resistance improved The hardest time was the first lowcarb fasting day midmorning says Jane Whyatt one of the participants in the study She told me that before the diet started shed developed a few bad habits and was eating out a lot since she had a job that required a lot of travel I dont think I was a massive overeater but I had actually put on about  pounds over a short period of time she says The  diet helped her shed about  pounds over four months Years later shes kept the weight off and is still following this pattern of eating To be honest you actually want to carry on because you do feel quite refreshed and healthy says Whyatt This is something you can do really for life  a research dietitian at Englands Manchester Breast Centre who directed the study says lots of people seem to be able to stick with the  strategy We know that people struggle with daily diets she says Hence our interest in twoday diets And she says once dieters acclimate to the two days of lowcalorie lowcarb eating they seem to get into the habit of eating less overall Shes hoping to do more research to study the longterm effects of the diet And shes published more about the results of her research in a new book
