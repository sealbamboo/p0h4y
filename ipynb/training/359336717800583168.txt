Omega fatty acids have been shown to have many health benefits But they may have risks as well including an increased risk for prostate cancer In a nineyear prospective study scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle took annual blood samples from  men diagnosed with prostate cancer and  men who were cancer free The study   controlled for more than a dozen cancer risk factors Compared with men in the lowest onequarter for omega levels those in the highest onequarter had a  percent increased risk for lowgrade prostate cancer and a  percent increased risk for highgrade cancer They found the association with three different omegas  eicosapentaenoic acid EPA docosahexaenoic  acid DHA and docosapentaenoic acid DPA which are all found in fish and fish oil supplements  but not with alphalinolenic acid which comes from flax seed The findings are an association and do not imply causation But according to the lead author Theodore M Brasky now at The Ohio State University omegas can affect gene expression and in high doses be prooxidative or suppress immunity all of which could promote cancer Still he added the possible increase in prostate cancer risk doesnt preclude a beneficial effect for other diseases
