A Foster Farms chicken plant in central California is open after 10-day shutdown to eradicate an infestation of live cockroaches, company officials said. . The Livingston, Calif., plant reopened Wednesday and called employees back to work after ensuring that a plan with "the most effective treatment protocols" was in place, according to a statement. . U.S. Department of Agriculture food safety officials had shuttered the plant on Jan. 8 after finding live cockroaches for the fifth time in five months. Three Foster Farms sites in California were under federal scrutiny after two outbreaks of salmonella tied to the firm's chicken last year, including one that sickened 430 people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. . Foster Farms issued no recalls. CDC said the outbreak appears to be over.
