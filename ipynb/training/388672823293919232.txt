When model Gisele Bndchen posted a   this summer the snapshot which showed her infant daughter wearing tiny earrings ignited   about the appropriate age for ear piercing But a more serious concern missed in many of the discussions was the delicate necklace of amber beads looped around the babys neck Baltic amber necklaces as they are known have become popular as an alternative treatment to ease teething pain in infants and toddlers in Europe Australia New Zealand and increasingly the United States Retailers claim that when warmed by the babys body temperature the amber releases a painrelieving substance that is then absorbed through the skin into the bloodstream But there is no evidence to back up these claims and a larger concern is the significant suffocation hazard posed by the teething necklaces particularly if children are left unattended The risk is twofold  strangulation and choking said    a pediatrician in Kansas City Mo who has blogged about the dangers of amber necklaces And thats not only for these teething necklaces In general practice the American Academy of Pediatrics doesnt recommend that infants wear any jewelry In  Health Canada the countrys federal department of public health determined that the necklaces were enough of an issue to warrant a consumer product   that highlighted the strangulation risk France and Switzerland have banned sale of the necklaces in pharmacies According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suffocation is the leading cause of death for children under a year old and among the top five causes of death for children between the ages of  and  Vendors of Baltic amber necklaces commonly advertise that the necklaces are safe because the string is knotted between each individual bead so if the necklace breaks only one piece will fall off But one loose bead is enough for a child to choke on said Dr Isabelle Claudet head of the pediatric emergency department at Childrens Hospital in Toulouse France And because the necklaces are produced and sold by smaller vendors the lack of manufacturing standards makes it impossible to guarantee that any safety clasps will come apart as intended if the necklace becomes caught on anything increasing the potential for strangulation A   published in  in The Archives of Pediatrics by Dr Claudet and her colleagues explored why parents continued to put amber necklaces on their children even when some were aware of the suffocation risk In the parents minds they concluded the immediate stress over seeing their child in teething distress typically outweighed the more abstract possibility of choking or strangulation In place of amber necklaces the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends several remedies for teething pain that arent potential safety hazards Doctors suggest lightly massaging the gums of babies who are teething or giving them things to chew on that are cold but pliable like  damp washcloths that have been twisted and frozen and rubber teething rings They caution against giving children teething rings that have frozen solid however because they are too hard for childrens mouths For intense pain a dose of acetaminophen or Tylenol is fine but parents should be wary of giving children younger than two years old oral anesthetic gels and liquids that contain benzocaine like Orajel and Anbesol The Food and Drug Administration has   can sometimes cause a rare but dangerous condition called methemoglobinemia in which the oxygen in the blood stream becomes dangerously low leading to symptoms like pale skin and lips fatigue confusion headache and elevated heart rate When people see their kid suffering they just want a solution said Dr Burgert Homeopathic products like amber necklaces may seem like a safer alternative to medication she said but there are risks associated with those too In addition to the AAP suggestions Dr Burgert a mother herself recommends giving teething children partially frozen fruit
