Men feel more pain than women while recovering from major surgery a study suggests  More than  patients were monitored after operations including heart or abdominal surgery at a hospital in Germany  Interviews with male and female patients presented at the Euroanaesthesia conference showed the men were reporting more pain  Experts said gender differences in pain were still a disputed issue Hormones may play a role  the male sex hormone testosterone can reduce pain and womens pain thresholds are altered by the menstrual cycle Cultural and psychological factors    The data from more than four years of surgeries involving  patients was collected at University Hospitals of the Ruhr University of Bochum in Germany The analysis showed there was no overall difference between the two genders level of pain after an operation However when the researchers divided the operations into major surgery and minor treatments such as a biopsy a pattern did emerge The male patients felt more pain after major surgery while women were more likely to report pain after smaller procedures Dr Andreas SandnerKiesling from the Medical University of Graz in Austria said The influence of gender is a key issue in medicine  The gender differences on pain perception are still heavily disputed both in experimental and clinical fields  Our data do not definitely clarify this issue however based on our findings it can be presumed that the type and severity of surgery may play a pivotal role as females express higher pain scores after minor procedures whereas males are more affected after major surgery Dr Beverly Collett a consultant in pain management and anaesthesia at the University Hospital of Leicester NHS Trust said The study titillates and makes you want to ask more questions but doesnt allow you to probe it Which procedures were classed as major surgery How old were they That will have an effect on sex hormones And pain will be dependent on the parts of the body being biopsied  She said women would report pain when heat was applied to the skin before men did but that differences in pain perception were smaller than animal tests would suggest She said there was also a psychological component to pain and men were known to increase their ability to resist pain when treated by young attractive female nurses compared with unattractive old male ones  Meanwhile entrenched social values from childhood  boys told to get up after a fall while girls were kissed better  also affected pain perception she said Theres been a lot of dispute about pain in men and women and this study does not clarify the issue Dr Edmund Keogh a pain researcher at the University of Bath commented There might be a difference between how men and women respond to analgesics we dont know yet we need to have lots more research He added that the overall picture on gender differences in pain was unclear The results are fairly inconsistent  some studies find differences some dont and theres a lot of variability between them Pain is hugely variable but generally women are reporting more pain in comparison to men Dr Roman Cregg from the University College London centre for anaesthesia said Females are at increased risk for developing chronic pain conditions they are more sensitive to painful stimuli in the laboratory settings compared with male subjects as well  According to the authors overall there was no difference between males and females in relation to the reported pain intensity this is contrary to the majority of previously published experimental material  Ultimately the matter is complex
