Tell yourself during exercise that youre not as tired as you think you are and you could make that statement true a new study shows reminding us that the body intertwines with the mind in ways that we are only starting to understand  For the new experiment which was   researchers from the University of Kent in Canterbury England and other institutions turned to a group of  healthy physically active young men and women and asked if they would be willing to ride a bicycle to the point of limp exhaustion repeatedly Physical fatigue is a surprisingly enigmatic condition Scientists dont fully understand how the body knows when it has had enough Many of us might guess that activity ceases once our muscles have run out of fuel or fluids But in studies with rodents even after they are pushed to run until they drop scientists have found reserves of fuel in the animals muscles Physiologically they remain capable of more exercise although their bodies dont seem to think so  Such experiments have prompted some scientists recently to propose a different theory of exerciserelated fatigue in which the brain rather than the muscles initiates exhaustion after receiving and analyzing inputs from the body An attractive element of this theory often called the psychobiological model is that it allows more wiggle room If exhaustion is determined by the brain and is to some degree subjective then theoretically the right tweaks during training could convince your brain that you can go farther or harder than it would otherwise allow  That possibility motivated the new experiment which was designed specifically to determine whether verbally encouraging yourself during a draining workout can affect your minds calculations and stave off fatigue  To test that idea the scientists first  took a series of baseline physical measurements of their volunteers Then during a separate lab visit the volunteers were asked to pedal a computerized stationary bicycle at about  percent of their predetermined maximum force until they felt that they could pedal no more and quit  Throughout the scientists measured each riders heart rate pedaling power and pace Having attached electrodes to the riders foreheads and cheeks the researchers also monitored their facial muscular contractions  ie grimaces  an accepted physiological indicator of increasing physical exertion And they asked the riders several times during and at the conclusion of the ride how hard the exercise had felt on a scale of zero to  Once each riders measurements had been recorded they were randomly divided into two groups One group was told to continue with their normal exercise routine for the next two weeks Those in the other group were coached in selftalk the kind of verbal banter that many athletes engage in during workouts whether done aloud or silently  For many of us selftalk is haphazard and if the banter turns berating it can be demotivating In this case however the chosen volunteers systematically learned how best to talk to themselves in an encouraging way Provided with phrases that psychologists previously had found to be motivating such as Youre doing well the volunteers were asked also to jot down any expressions  that they had used during exercise in the past A popular choice was feeling good  Each volunteer then chose four phrases that appealed to him or her and was told to start repeating these frequently during subsequent normal exercise sessions The volunteers practiced this selftalk during exercise for the next two weeks Then each group returned to the lab and underwent another cycling test to exhaustion during which the riders in the selftalk group studiously repeated their mantras some aloud some silently  Afterward it was obvious that selftalk had bolstered riders feelings and performance The group that had talked to themselves had pedaled much longer before succumbing to exhaustion than in their first rides and reported that the pedaling had felt easier even though objectively their heart rates and facial expressions had remained the same indicating that the physical exertion had been just as great as in the initial ride  The riders in the other group meanwhile generally repeated their performances from before lasting about the same amount of time before quitting and feeling about the same degree of discomfort On one level these findings indicate that motivational selftalk improves endurance performance compared to not using it said Samuele Marcora the director of exercise research at the University of Kent and senior author of the study But a deeper reading of the data he continued buttresses the idea that physical exhaustion develops to a considerable degree in your head If the point in time at which people stop exercising was determined solely biologically he said selftalk would have no effect But it did  To be effective though selftalk probably has to be consistent and systematic he said Some of the riders in the control group muttered or silently exhorted themselves during the cycling  they werent told not to  but they tended to do this haphazardly and without discernible benefit Better Dr Marcora suggested to deploy phrases that particularly encourage you and repeat them often even on a schedule especially as a workout or competition wears on It is likely we all could stand to hear that despite intimations to the contrary were feeling good
