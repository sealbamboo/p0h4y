The Ironman World Championship in Kona Hawaii is an extreme event  a mile swim followed by a mile bike ride topped off by a marathon Throughout the event racers drink plenty of fluids and eat energy bars or gels Most also take a performanceenhancing substance that is legal and effective  caffeine While Im racing caffeine is actually a pretty important part of my day particularly in the Ironman where its such a long race says   a professional triathlete She integrates calories and caffeine into her raceday diet using energy gels Each contains  milligrams of caffeine which Piampiano calls a shot Before the race I typically take one gel that has one shot of caffeine in it and then when I get onto the bike each hour I take one shot of caffeine explains Piampiano In the last half of the marathon she ups her dose to two shots every  minutes Caffeine has been wellknown to be a beneficial drug to use during sport Its been studied for many years over a variety of different types of sports it will improve your performance says   director of the University of Arkansas Human Performance Laboratory But he says it is important to take the right dose The general consensus is  to  milligrams per kilogram of body mass and it can be quite a bit The example being an kilo individual needing  milligrams per kilogram body mass  thats four strong cups of coffee says Ganio But instead of guzzling coffee many athletes rely on products such as energy gels that allow them to better quantify their caffeine   is CEO of GU Energy Labs which makes gels that blend carbohydrates amino acids electrolytes and caffeine The topend athletes the pros want to be able to meter out caffeine during the course of an endurance event Its always nice to have that second wind late in the race where you can energize the mind stimulate the mind with the central nervous system response of caffeine says Vaughan Some researchers urge restraint University of Connecticut doctoral candidate Evan Johnson says caffeine works best when used judiciously You find a lot of people who constantly ingest caffeine throughout the day and therefore need alcohol or some sort of sleep aid to get to bed and then in the morning are so groggy they need caffeine again Johnson says He calls it a vicious cycle of supplementation Thats   to players on Englands soccer team They took caffeine pills to amp up for a recent World Cup qualifying game and then needed sleeping pills to wind down Some athletes say they avoid caffeine because it makes them jittery or it bothers their stomachs Others like triathlete   of Belgium take a less systematic approach I have a very busy life and a very busy work and I train a lot so I just drink lots of coffee so I am naturally very caffeinated During training and racing I use gels which contain caffeine and its not with any purpose but Im more or less like a heavy caffeine user says Gyde It seems to work for Gyde he has won his age group twice at Kona And you may not have to be an Ironman to benefit A recent Australian   showed that caffeine enabled sedentary men to work out more vigorously The side effects of ingesting so much caffeine are still being elucidated however The Food and Drug Administration   that the agency is investigating several deaths that could be linked to energy drinks
