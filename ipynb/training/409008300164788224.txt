Going to the hospital is supposed to be good for you But in an alarming number of cases it isnt And often its fatal In fact it is the most dangerous thing most people will do Until very recently health care experts believed that preventable hospital error caused some  deaths a year in the United States  a figure based on  data But a new   from the Journal of Patient Safety using updated data holds such error responsible for many more deaths  probably around some  per year Thats onesixth of all deaths nationally making preventable hospital error the third leading cause of death in the United States And  to  times that many people suffer nonlethal but serious harm as a result of hospital mistakes Most of us decide which hospital to go to that is when we get to decide with zero data about hospital safety Information however is gradually reaching the public and it can do more than just help us choose wisely When patients can judge hospitals on their safety records hospitals will become safer Just as publishing health care prices will drive them down publishing safety information will drive hospital safety up 
 
In theory finding this information shouldnt be a problem Hospitals began to track errors seriously around  The federal governments Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began collecting information on hospital quality in  and since  has been posting information on the website   Many states have their own websites Other organizations compile this information as well such as Consumers Unions   which scores hospitals on their safety and the quality of care   which represents employer purchasers of health care scores hospitals on   The hospital ranking site probably most familiar to readers   describes its mission as a very different one  to help patients with very difficult problems choose hospitals All of these groups   which is why a hospital can rank near the top on one list and near the bottom on another Most groups make money by charging hospitals to use their logo and ratings in their publicity Consumer Reports is an exception  it doesnt allow hospitals to advertise its rankings There is no longer a question of whether or not people have a right to information about quality and that hospitals should be transparent and accountable said Debra L Ness the president of the National Partnership for Women and Families Ness is on the board of the   the organization that sets standards for evaluating health care safety and quality Its not so much any longer a debate about whether  its more about how But so far the answer to the question of how is slowly There is a big advance coming  Hospital Compare plans to begin reporting on rates of MRSA or methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus a drugresistant bacteria and Cdiff Clostridium difficile infections this month These are dangerous highprevalence infections  crucial safety issues to track But they are an exception on Hospital Compare Much of what the public wants to know isnt there  and a lot of whats there isnt meaningful Whats your hospitals rate of surgical site infection You can find out if you live in   or    states that collect exhaustive information on hospital infections and post it The rest of us are out of luck Hospital Compare will tell you only about colon surgery or abdominal hysterectomy  no knee replacement heart bypass or any other surgery How often does your local hospital leave a foreign object like a surgical sponge inside a patient Or administer the wrong type of blood Or allow a patient to develop a serious bed sore or a blood clot Hospital Compare is now listing only old data for these errors and has stopped updating those measures on the site What about the hospitals record at preventing readmission in the  days after discharge We can find that out for Medicare patients the data comes from Medicare claims but not for the rest of us Hospital Compare has a lot of bells and whistles but underneath it is nothing said Leah Binder the chief executive of The Leapfrog Group Most hospitals are rated as average on every measure and most measures are not things of great interest Were further along but were really in the dark ages on reporting information in a way the public can use Measuring hospital safety is hard Comparison of course requires everyone to be using the same measures  so how to reconcile the many variations hospitals use And how do we know a measurement actually tells us what we think it does Its easiest to measure how often hospitals carry out processes that are recognized to be best practice such as whether the patient got treatment to prevent blood clots after certain types of surgery or whether the patients temperature was kept steady in the operating room Hospitals track such processes for their own internal quality controls This kind of process information dominates Hospital Compare and some of the independent rating organizations US News rankings lean heavily on a hospitals reputation which earns it   But tracking processes doesnt produce the kind of information patients need Hospitals are doing so well on these measures they are topping out offering no way to compare them Some of the measures are only loosely related to patient outcomes For example Hospital Compare shows that the national average for the practice of discontinuing prophylactic antibiotics within  hours after surgery is  percent Top marks  but there is little evidence showing that this practice is linked to fewer surgical site infections And its outcomes that count Why doesnt Hospital Compare list more outcomes Hospitals argue  and they are right  that it is much more expensive and technically difficult to develop outcome measures than process measures We need measures that have scientific reliability and validity said Nancy Foster the American Hospital Associations vice president of quality and patient safety policy Hospitals need the engagement of medical staff If medical staff doesnt find the data credible then you lose them  they wont be there in the quality improvement  But at times it seems as if hospitals arent trying very hard They like to report process measures on which they score well But with  deaths from hospital error per year their record is poor on key safety outcomes This somewhat dampens their enthusiasm for public reporting And what hospitals want matters a lot At the end of the day the providers have to implement this said Ness There has to be a reasonable amount of buyin for it to work well If you just looked at Hospital Compares process measures youd assume that all hospitals in this country are doing extremely well said Binder This is misleading to the public because of the politics behind the scene of the website Lobbyists for providers have been very effective at making sure what gets reported doesnt have much teeth Hospital Compare chooses what to display mainly using guidelines set by the National Quality Forum which was established in  in response to a government commission on consumer protection in health care At the Quality Forum groups representing health care consumers  patients and the corporations who pay for health care  are represented on all committees and they hold a guaranteed majority on the most important committee But patients cant match the clout of the providers Hospitals are everpresent in this work said Lisa McGiffert who is director of the Safe Patient Project at the Consumers Union and has been a consumer representative on several Quality Forum committees They have lobbyists all over Congress and administration folks They outnumbered us on the committees that I have been on at NQF When I was on the infections committee I was rolled over constantly In a December  meeting the Measurement Application Partnership a committee run by the Quality Forum voted  over the objection of consumer and purchaser representatives  not to endorse reporting on several different serious hospital errors that were already on Hospital Compare Hospital Compare then stopped updating data on air embolism sponges or instruments left in a patient serious bed sores and blood clots among other events No one thought the raw data was unfair to hospitals  the data probably undercounted the number of hospital errors said Foster But hospitals argued that in some cases the perhospital numbers were so small the differences between hospitals might have been random a conclusion supported by an independent review Hospitals have fought changes that would make reporting more complete  so it takes chutzpah to argue that the numbers are too small to publish We agree with the concept Foster said But the way the measures are executed makes them very unreliable and we believe invalid You dont know that what you are looking at is an accurate representation of a hospitals performance Advocates for health care consumers argued that it didnt matter  just knowing the number of errors was important Do you as an American have the right to know if the hospital down the street left an object in a patient said Binder That information has now been taken out of the hands of the consumer by lobbyists We should always tilt towards transparency Poor or irrelevant data keeps patients from finding the information they need Another problem is that the data thats there isnt presented in a way people can easily use Hospital Compare cuts very thick slices Theres below average above average and average which is the score of the vast majority of hospitals And most patients simply dont know about Hospital Compare Thats not the governments fault but it does illustrate the need for translator organizations such as Consumer Reports  which has five categories not three  and Leapfrog which issues letter grades with more detail available for those who want it Leapfrogs twiceyearly data release gets a lot of coverage McGiffert said that when Consumer Reports first came out with ratings for centralline and surgical site infections some hospitals protested that the data was wrong But it was the same data hospitals had submitted for state reports We were using data that had already been on state websites but nobody had paid attention to it she said Agencies are never going to do a media push when they publish these That media push reaches more patients and it forces hospitals to focus on safety These are a major factor in getting hospitals attention said McGiffert She said that hospitals in states that required public reporting were far more likely to adopt qualityimprovement practices Binder said that except for advances in doctors using computers to enter treatment orders hospital safety records as a group are not improving This is hardly surprising What gets measured gets done and many aspects of safety are still not even measured The Journal of Patient Safety study found  detectable deaths per year  the number they eventually fixed on of  reflected the estimate that half or twothirds of all such deaths are never counted Thats a big range said Binder It sounds so high but what more frightening is that we still dont know Nobodys counting the bodies
