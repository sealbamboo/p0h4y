They told me We think you have a kidney infection but we cant confirm for sure so were just going to treat it aggressively and hope thats what it is  Shelton said  He was  years old and weighed  pounds Two years earlier Justins wife Lauren Shelton had had her own medical scare her gallbladder had to be removed because of weightrelated complications At her heaviest Lauren weighed  pounds Their size made everyday tasks difficult too Years ago Lauren was on a plane and the seat belt wouldnt buckle She was mortified and tried to hide from the flight attendants that she didnt fit into the seat  Both Lauren and Justin had been asked not to get on rides at a theme park because of their size But Justins trip to the emergency room was the final straw The Jefferson City Tennessee couple realized something needed to change  Luckily for Justin doctors were right and able to treat his kidney infection without the scan It made me think What if it was something else What if it was more serious What would I have done then  Justin said So in February  the couple began a month journey to take control of their health I was always bigger than the other kids but the pounds really started packing on during high school and continued to do so over the next several years Lauren wrote on her blog   For Justin it was a knee injury at age  that kept him from playing sports The exercise went away bad eating habits continued and his weight got out of control The Sheltons met online seven years ago and their relationship revolved around their eating habits They would go out to eat and indulge in one unhealthy meal after another  They knew that in order to get healthy they needed someone to steer them in the right direction So they sought help from a weightloss management program at a local medical school  A physicians assistant gave them guidelines on what they should and should not be eating and on the amount of exercise they needed Justin and Lauren started their new exercise routine by doing simple activities such as walking around the park and swimming In late  they joined a gym  We go to the gym five to six days a week and take one day off and try to do something fun and active like hiking or swimming Lauren said The couple also started using a smartphone app to track the calories they consumed In the beginning they ate at restaurants only on special occasions and prepared all meals at home Lauren found recipes for healthier versions of the foods they loved Their diet primarily consists of lean meats with lots of fruits and vegetables Even today everything they eat goes into a food journal The weight came off quickly at the beginning Justin lost  pounds and Lauren lost  pounds during the first month alone They tried to keep the weight loss steady after that knowing they couldnt expect to see such a big number month after month without being disappointed  Weekly weighins helped them track their progress We have graphs that show our weight loss through an app It helps us stay motivated and get through the hard weeks Justin said In just  months Justin dropped  pounds and Lauren lost  for a total of  pounds  As they begin to move into the maintenance phase of their diet the couple has allowed themselves to indulge once in a while They now have what they call their Special Sunday Meal where they will cook something they dont typically have during the week This Sunday we may have grilled turkey burgers on a wholewheat bun with some ovenbaked potatoes Lauren said Typically we do not have starches very often and do not keep breads in the house They still give in to cravings from time to time Lauren says she has a sweet tooth but she controls cravings by distracting herself with activities such as walks or naps  What keeps her on track is understanding that No matter how many times you slipped or messed up you just have to start over and eventually youll get there she said You have to stay positive and remind yourself that youre human and nobody is perfect Even though theyve managed to lose a substantial amount of weight  Lauren went from a size  dress to a size  and Justin went from size  pants to a size   the couple struggles with the psychological side effects of such a massive physical change Selfimage has been an obstacle for both Lauren and Justin They admit to having moments when they still see themselves as the obese people they used to be  I dont see myself as quite as small as what the pictures show or people tell us we look like Lauren said Through both the struggles and triumphs they have found support in each other They say that doing this as a team has brought them closer together and they feel like they are almost newlyweds again  Recently Lauren and Justin traveled on a plane and were thrilled to find they could not only buckle their seat belts but needed to tighten them They also returned to the theme park and rode the rides with no problems at all  It was kind of triumphant Justin said We are a lot more adventurous and outgoing Our outlook has changed almost completely
