When you know a loved one  a parent  is declining and receiving hospice care in another part of the country life becomes surreal You find yourself doing mental gymnastics and living in two places at once while rarely feeling fully present anywhere Brandon Curtis lived in that state of unreality for almost a year and a half Based in Los Angeles Curtis learned in April  that his yearold dad in Nebraska had cancer that had spread through his lungs ribs spine and lymph nodes Doctors said he had three to nine months to live I spent a week with him and then I didnt know what to do Curtis  a digital brand manager for Red Bull told TODAYcom I wanted to be there for my dad but I also had work commitments that required me to travel I talked with him about it and he told me I needed to keep living my life Curtis listened to his dad but the idea of leaving him behind in that drab little nursingfacility room made his chest hurt And thats how    and an unexpected tsunami of support for his dad  were born Curtis dad Brian Curtis always described his favorite color as sky blue pink Inspired by sunsets the color describes the spectacle seen in the sky on clear nights A few days after his dads diagnosis Brandon Curtis shared   asking people to cheer his dad up by sending sky blue pink photos and drawings as well as encouraging cards notes and tweets using the hashtag skybluepink Before long Brian Curtis room was covered from floor to ceiling with thousands of sky blue pink images from all over the world Elementary school teachers had their pupils draw sky blue pink pictures for him Other cancer patients shared images and stories with him and offered their support Over a period of  months more than  strangers contacted Brian Curtis and tried to buoy him up  and Brian never stopped being amazed by their efforts He couldnt believe how many were doing this  it completely caught him off guard Brandon Curtis said Hed say Why are all these people taking time out of their day to help me Theyve never met me Theyre from countries on other side of the world How did I get so lucky His sky blue pink room caused such a stir in Harvard Neb that his Hospice care facility attracted an array of visitors and wellwishers  all strangers to the Curtis family One couple from New York who were visiting Lincoln Neb went out of their way to stop by the facility because they saw the skybluepink campaign online Curtis nurses made and wore sky blue pink scrubs to work and the Nebraska band   wrote a song for him called Sky Blue Pink Band members did even more They created a   over a lake because they heard how much Curtis loved fishing before he got sick   The acts of kindness frequently made Brian Curtis emotional  and they also filled him with a comedic sense of vindication When his son Brandon was little he imitated his dad and said sky blue pink was his favorite color too Brandons teachers balked  Id tell my dad that they said it wasnt a color and hed say Dont let your teachers tell you that Brandon recalled Just because its not in a box of Crayolas doesnt mean its not a color When I was little that was a very literal lesson for me but as I grew up it became more abstract Basically the lesson was Dont let other people limit your perspective of reality That really meant a lot to me growing up Brian Curtis died on the morning of Aug   at age  with his son Brandon and his yearold daughter Cindy by his side He couldnt talk much in his final hours but he wouldnt let their hands go I told him he had been through a lot and it was OK to let go now Brandon said I said he lived a good life and he set us up for success and he was the best father anyone could hope for In hindsight Brandon said he and his sister dont know how they would have made it through the past year and half without the kindness of strangers The whole skybluepink project gave me peace of mind when I couldnt always be there Brandon said I loved knowing that as soon as he woke up he had this visual reminder wrapped all around him that people were thinking of him and telling him We love you were thinking about you  He didnt want my sister or me to put everything on hold and wait for his health to decline That would make him feel worse He just wanted to know that we were happy
