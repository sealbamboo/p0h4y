A doctor trained in Fort Worth Texas is now a victim of the Ebola outbreak he was battling Kent Brantly  had been caring for Ebola patients in Liberias capital Monrovia for several months when he noticed he had symptoms of the deadly virus last Wednesday He immediately put himself into an isolation ward He is still conversing and is in isolation But he is seriously ill with a very grave prognosis says Dr David McRay of   in Fort Worth who spoke to Brantly by phone on Monday Kent is a calm confident focused individual with a deep calling for the work that hes doing McRay says After Brantly completed his residency at John Peter Smith Hospital in  he traveled to West Africa with his wife and two children to work with the Christian aid group   Then the   outbreak started in March Samaritans Purse asked Brantly to direct the groups Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia Since then about  people have   with Ebola and more than  have died across Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone Theres no treatment for the disease which spreads when people come into direct contact with bodily fluids such as saliva blood diarrhea and vomit Brantly knew providing health care in Liberia would be challenging  and that was even before the Ebola epidemic But caring for people in need his friends say was always what he wanted to do Even now Brantly wants people to focus on the larger epidemic not just his illness McRay says Many people are infected with Ebola in Africa and many people are not surviving he says And Kent does not see his situation as unique in any way Two other members of Brantlys medical team in Liberia also contracted Ebola One died The other American   is still sick Brantly says he isnt sure how he got infected Hes certain he didnt violate any safety guidelines Samaritans Purse is working with the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify the source of contamination at the ward says the groups spokesperson Melissa Strickland Brantly was working with nearly two dozen Ebola patients but Strickland says he followed strict protocols He covered every inch of his body before entering the Ebola ward in a protective suit It would take at least  minutes to get that suit on properly she says Although the mortality rate has been about  percent in this Ebola outbreak doctors on the ground say good supportive care early does help And ideally Brantly would be evacuated to a hospital in Europe or the US Strickland says So far that hasnt been possible There are organizations that will not transport Ebola patients Strickland says either because they dont have the isolation protocols in place that would be necessary or because of the fear of transporting an Ebola patient Brantlys family returned to the US last week for a visit before Brantly began showing symptoms Its highly unlikely that his family caught the virus from him the CDC says
