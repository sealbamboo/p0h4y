Twothirds of NHS staff would recommend the care on offer at their local trust to their own friends and family an annual poll shows Of  staff questioned for the  NHS survey  said care was fit for relatives  were unsure while  would not recommend the service The survey included GPs ambulance staff nurses midwives and dentists as well as other health professionals  There were improvements on the previous year in  of the  poll categories Some  of staff believed their job makes a difference to patients  are satisfied with the quality of work and patient care they are able to deliver and  say in their role they are able to contribute improvements to the organisation Compared with  more said there was good communication between staff and management and more were being appraised and getting appropriate health and safety training But workrelated stress was up slightly with more than a third saying they had experienced it in the last  months  And a third said they had witnessed or reported potentially harmful errors or nearmisses at work in the last month Only  of staff said handwashing materials  such as soap  are always available with the figure being  in acute hospital trusts Some  said they had been the victim of violence in the last year from visitors patients or relatives  had been bullied or abused by the same group and  suffered workplace discrimination Sue Covill of NHS Employers said abuse and harassment of workers from patients and the public was a concern and more needed to be done to protect staff But she said many of the surveys other findings were encouraging  Staff feeling valued and being valued is absolutely vital to the effective delivery of patient care and we believe it is an important factor behind many of the positive results Peter Carter of the Royal College of Nursing was more critical saying Only  of staff feel that there are enough staff to enable them to do their jobs properly and high numbers of nurses in particular continue to work extra hours  compared with  the previous year  Some  of staff have attended work while not being well enough to perform their duties in the last three months alone It is hardly surprising that there has been an increase in workrelated stress Clearly nurses and other staff are working hard to ensure that patient care is delivered However it is simply not sustainable to have staff stretched too thinly and working beyond breaking point Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said NHS staff have some of the hardest and most respected jobs in our country It is good to see that more staff would recommend the NHS as a place to work and would want friends and relatives to be treated where they work But we know we need to do even more and our response to the Francis report set out how the NHS can promote openness and support staff to raise concerns in order to protect patients and give high quality care
