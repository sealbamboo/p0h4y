It was the Greeks who first counseled to let food be thy medicine And it seems some doctors are taking this ageold advice to heart In New York City physicians are writing prescriptions for fresh fruits and vegetables Thats right scripts for produce If you listen to my story on   youll hear that   is the creation of Wholesome Wave a nonprofit that connects lowincome people with local produce Its led by chef   who was motivated to make healthful food more accessible after his two sons were diagnosed with juvenile diabetes After learning that the Type  diabetes can be controlled or even reversed by good nutrition and exercise hes made this his lifes commitment On a recent Tuesday I met up with Nischan in New York where we checked in on the Rx Fruit and Vegetable program Nischan told me he has pursued this partnership with doctors because so many people rely on their trusted advice When docs write prescriptions for drugs people fill them So why not prescribe healthful food Basically the initiative is designed to nudge the families of overweight kids and teens to change the way they eat And the big incentive Free produce as well as tips on how best to cook and economize Kids enrolled in the program at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center in the Bronx meet with a doctor or nutritionist once a week During the appointment doctors measure their blood pressure insulin levels and weight At the end of the appointment they leave with a prescription that can be swapped for Health Bucks accepted at  farm markets in the city Participants receive  per day for each person in their family So a family of four get  of free produce a week Its a little unusual says Lincoln Hospital pediatrician   because doctors are accustomed to writing prescriptions for drugs I met up with Szema and one of her patients yearold Johanna Terron at the farm market just outside the hospital Terron has been struggling with a weight problem and serious asthma Ill be honest with you Terron says I never touched vegetables She says she used to hit Burger King almost every day and ate lots of junk like chips candy soda ice cream Shed never eaten a pear or cantaloupe she said But over the past year shes swapped greasy fries for peppery radishes and greens And she says shes pretty certain her taste buds are changing I dont know how to explain it but the fresh food tastes better Szema says shes lost more than  pounds and her asthmas much better Shes healthier She doesnt have to use her rescue pump as much Szema says And its easier for her to exercise now that her weight is down Szema says the simple act of prescribing fruits and vegetables doesnt change anything overnight Its just the first step of a long process to slim down But she says shes impressed by what a powerful nudge it can be Shes no longer just telling her patients to eat healthfully  she is actually helping them do it by making it affordable and accessible Youre coaching your patients to put whats healthy in their body Szema says And in Johannas case the people around her are eating better too The whole family is making changes Szema says For Wholesome Waves Nischan who spent years imagining how such a program could work the results are satisfying There are now two years of data from pilots showing that many people who participate actually lose weight The first year  percent of the participants dropped their body mass indexes Nischan told me And in the second year it was  percent of the participants So its working were excited about it And he says hes looking forward to expanding it We have interest from all over the country Nischan says and smiles
