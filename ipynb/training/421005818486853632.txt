Remember that wacky glue commercial from the s Krazy Glue you crazy rat the narrator   Strong enough to hold this man suspended in midair He promises the stuff can bond almost anything a plastic knob a plastic plug a rubber boot a door knob and even a flashlight case Heck a   of the everlasting adhesive is even approved by the Food and Drug Administration to seal skin wounds But superglue cant fix a broken heart  or even a torn artery Yet Now a team of doctors and engineers at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston are getting close to changing that Their unlikely inspiration is a inch worm that lives off the coast of California Cardiac surgeon   and his colleagues have developed a biodegradable adhesive that can patch a hole in a pigs heart or artery The experimental glue is nontoxic and is strong enough to hold up under the high pressures in the human heart the team   Wednesday in the journal   So far theyve tested the glue only in animals So the sealant is far from reaching the operating room or battlefield But del Nido hopes the adhesive will eventually replace traditional sutures and staples for some operations especially heart surgery A glue is the holy grail for repairing hearts del Nido tells Shots Right now we use sutures Every time the needle and thread enter normal tissue they do a little bit of damage Usually it doesnt matter But I repair childrens hearts For those this damage can really be a problem Regular superglues dont work well inside the body Its a skin glue del Nido says You cant use it internally because it hardens as soon as it comes into contact with water And the glues are made from a compound called   which can be toxic To find a safe adhesive that could work on hearts arteries and other organ surfaces del Nido teamed up with bioengineer   also at Brigham and Womens Hospital In our lab we look to nature for inspiration in designing materials Karp tells Shots Solutions are really all around us Karps lab has been looking at   that could lead to better surgical needles For the heart glue Karp and his team turned their attention to critters that stick to slippery surfaces such as slugs spiders and a bristly little worm that glues itself rocks in tidal pools called the   We started looking at how creatures like the sandcastle worm could attach to wet surfaces Karp says After years of experimenting with various chemical cocktails he and his team finally stumbled upon an adhesive thats biodegradable and nontoxic Cells and tissues can grow over the material and into it he says Eventually it just dissolves into the body And the glue only hardens when UV light shines on it So a surgeon can put the glue in exactly the right place before it seals up Although Karp and del Nido havent tested the experimental glue on people yet theyve put the adhesive through a whole battery of tests in animals We made a hole in the heart of a living rat and showed that we can seal it up without removing the blood Karp says The animals were fine six months later They also patched a pigs heart and carotid artery with the glue Even after the pig was given a shot of adrenaline and its heart pressure shot through the roof the patched stayed on the tissue Of course humans are more complicated than pigs and rats And the glue has to be safe for decades in people not months But Karp is so confident that the adhesive will one day reach surgeons toolbox that he has procured  million to start a   to manufacture and test the glue It appears that the glue is safe he says But we do need to do more studies Well repeat the animal tests and then move forward in humans
