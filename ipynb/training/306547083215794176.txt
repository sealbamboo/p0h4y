Its an old joke repeated every year around nurses stations examination rooms and operating theaters Whatever you do dont get sick in July Thats when hundreds of justgraduated medical students begin their residencies The logic goes that come summer youre all but guaranteed to be treated by a novice physician especially in teaching hospitals Better to wait a few months until the new docs have settled in a bit to be seen about that suspicious lump But a recent study of surgeries at more than  hospitals suggests the fear of newbie docs is overblown While patients at teaching hospitals fared slightly worse overall than those at nonuniversity centers the calendar had little bearing on surgical outcomes researchers found Previous July effect studies often focused on a single medical center so a Mayo Clinic research team of radiologists and neurosurgeons decided to go big Their   published in the January issue of the   analyzed the outcomes of more than one million spinal surgery patients over eight years at hospitals across the country The study looked at both teaching and nonteaching hospitals and it looked at outcomes both in July and in other months We were able to look at a huge number of hospitals  so we could really get a big picture of medical practice lead author and Mayo Clinic radiologist Jennifer McDonald tells Shots The data came from the National Inpatient Sample which culls medical records from a wide variety of centers  urban and rural wellfunded and cashstrapped  and includes both teaching hospitals and traditional ones McDonald and her colleagues looked to see whether spinal surgery patients who were hospitalized in July were more likely to die suffer complications or be discharged to longterm care facilities than those who were operated on in say February Residents and fellows are often directly involved in spinal procedures including suturing the wound closed she says If the July effect were real  and the young doctors truly inept  one would expect to see higher rates of infection or reopening of the wounds in summer patients Instead the incidence of poor outcomes in teaching hospitals climbed by just a few tenths of a percent in July a negligible increase McDonald says Though complication rates rose slightly inhospital mortality did not In other words its unlikely that July patients are paying for residents inexperience with their lives McDonald acknowledged that across the board teaching hospitals saw worse outcomes than nonteaching institutions mortality was higher bills were larger and complications were more common But she cautioned this doesnt mean they provided worse care Maybe teaching hospitals get more transfer patients she said or patients that are more complicated to start with than nonteaching hospitals The July effect is apparently real enough to bring up at cocktail partiesand who doesnt love a bit of good medical triviabut not so pronounced that one need boycott all teaching hospitals before Labor Day Patients can sleep well at nighttheyre generally in good hands however young
