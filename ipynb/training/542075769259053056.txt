People who regularly drink from cans and plastic bottles may want to reconsider A new study shows that a common chemical in the containers can seep into beverages and raise blood pressure within a few hours The research raises new concerns about the chemical bisphenol A or BPA which is widely found in plastic bottles plastic packaging and the linings of food and beverage cans Chronic exposure to BPA as it is commonly known has been   cancer and other health problems But the new study is among the first to show that a single exposure to the chemical can have a direct and fairly immediate impact on cardiovascular health The study found that when people drank soy milk from a can the levels of BPA in their urine rose dramatically within two hours  and so did their blood pressure But on days when they drank the same beverage from glass bottles which dont use BPA linings there was no significant change in their BPA levels or blood pressure A single instance of increased blood pressure may not be particularly harmful But the findings suggest that for people who drink from multiple cans or plastic bottles every day the repeated exposure over time could contribute to hypertension said Dr Karin B Michels an expert on BPA who was not involved in the new research Dr Michels said that the design of the new study was impressive and its findings concerning About  percent of adults nationwide have hypertension and BPA exposure is ubiquitous I think this is a very interesting and important study that adds to the concern about bisphenol A said Dr Michels an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Womens Hospital It raises a lot of questions We have such a high rate of hypertension in this country which has risen and we havent really thought of bisphenol A and its use in cans as one of the causes of that  BPA has been used since the s to make countless everyday products like plastic bottles food containers contact lenses and even sippy cups and baby bottles The chemical can leach into food and studies show that the vast majority of Americans who are tested have BPA in their urine The chemical is an endocrine disrupter that can mimic estrogen In  the Food and Drug Administration   in baby bottles and childrens drinking cups Canadian regulators formally   and banned it from all childrens products Not everyone is convinced that BPA poses a risk to consumers The American Chemistry Council an industry trade group   and has opposed federal and state legislative proposals to ban it Much of the evidence against BPA comes from large population studies rather than controlled clinical trials A number have linked high urinary levels of BPA to   and heart and peripheral artery disease But those studies simply show correlations and do not provide evidence that BPA is the cause The latest study published in Hypertension a journal of the American Heart Association was a randomized controlled trial The authors a team from Seoul National Universitys department of preventive medicine in Korea recruited  older subjects most of whom were women and assigned them to drink soy milk from cans or glass bottles on three separate occasions weeks apart A majority had no history of high blood pressure though some did The researchers chose soy milk because it does not have any properties that are known to increase blood pressure And unlike soda fruit juice and other acidic beverages which are more likely to leach BPA from containers soy milk is considered fairly neutral When the subjects drank from glass bottles the study found their urinary BPA levels remained fairly low But within two hours of drinking from a can their levels of BPA were about  times higher As BPA levels rose so too did systolic blood pressure readings  on average by about five millimeters of mercury In general every  millimeter increase in systolic blood pressure   BPA is known to block certain estrogen receptors that are thought to be responsible for repairing blood vessels and controlling blood pressure The chemical may also affect blood pressure indirectly by disrupting thyroid hormone the authors noted Clinicians and patients  particularly hypertension or cardiovascular disease patients  should be aware of the potential clinical problems for blood pressure elevation when consuming canned food and beverages said Dr YunChul Hong an author of the study and director of the Institute of Environmental Medicine at Seoul National University He recommended that people choose fresh foods and glass bottles over cans and plastic containers and he urged manufacturers to develop and use healthy alternatives to BPA for the inner lining of can containers Because of growing consumer concerns some bottles and packaged food products now carry BPA free claims on their labels However these products often contain chemically similar alternatives  like bisphenol S One   found that plastic products advertised as BPAfree still leached chemicals with estrogenic activity  and some of these chemicals were even more potent than BPA Dr Michels at Harvard who published    said she tries to avoid eating or drinking foods from cans and plastic bottles and drinks carbonated water from glass bottles She said labels that say BPA free do nothing to assuage her concerns It doesnt have bisphenol A but on the other hand I worry that the new chemical they put in there may also be a problem she said Exchanging one chemical for another doesnt make me feel comfortable
