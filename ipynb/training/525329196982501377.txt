Have you ever swallowed unflavored rehydration solution or ORS Thats what they call the mixture of salt sugar and water given to Ebola patients Ive taken more than a mouthful  and urgh It tastes dreadful But doctors who were among Nigerias Ebola survivors all agree that they may not have recovered from the virus without having forced down the foultasting but apparently lifesaving fluid Gallons of it The solution often comes in   as powder made of salt and sugar along with unsavory ingredients like potassium chloride and citrate A dose of powder is dissolved in roughly a quart of water  Every day after they began feeling unwell the doctors would drink the ghastly mixture Dr Adaora Igonoh swallowed at least  gallons every day for almost a week She says when youre already frightened and depressed in an Ebola ward feeling weak and battling mouth ulcers and a sore throat getting ORS down your throat is no fun But she and other doctors in Nigeria agree that the rehydration solution was key to their survival Unlike Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone where the virus has killed up to  percent of those infected Nigeria was declared Ebolafree after eight deaths among  cases These patients drank between four and five liters a little more than a gallon every day and this made a huge difference says   a worldrenowned viral hemorrhagic fever expert at the University of South Manchester in the UK NPR reached him when he was in Nigeria where he had been dispatched to help fight the Ebola outbreak ORS is a lowtech and inexpensive approach that is potentially lifesaving he says Ebola victims throughout West Africa often die of severe dehydration that results from diarrhea and vomiting  two common symptoms We cannot have people with a fluid deficit just mounting up day after day he says This disease does not allow you to tolerate the normal degree of dehydration Dehydration and hypovolemia when there is not enough blood volume in the body is the final straw Mardel reckons that the number of Ebola deaths could be halved if health workers taught patients how to rehydrate properly with the packaged ORS mixture  and also told them to avoid taking aspirin which can worsen bleeding The rehydration solution should be mixed with the prescribed amount of water and given to patients at the onset of symptoms And it should be a daily practice And if you dont start right away Youll soon become in a few days too weak to drink it he says And if you become dehydrated your gut wont be able to absorb the nutrients Theyll just come back up he says Mardel acknowledges that its not the best tasting medicine So he recommends packets of fruitflavored ORS When Dr Adaora Igonoh began running a fever at home she drank an orangeflavored solution which was bearable The unflavored version she was given in the isolation ward was not But she was knew that because of her vomiting she wouldnt survive if she didnt keep chugging
