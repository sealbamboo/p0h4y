Many years ago when I was a much younger pediatrician with much younger children I called their doctor to say that one of them was experiencing bad intermittent   As one pediatrician calling another I was well prepared with a list of diagnoses ranging from incipient   to a walledoff abdominal   The pediatrician said Sounds like   Oh no I asked about that I said insulted that he could think I had missed something so basic Sometimes kids dont want to tell their mom he said And he was right I thought back on this as I read a study this month in the journal Pediatrics which looked at almost  visits to the emergency room at the Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh by children  to  years old with abdominal pain Constipation was the most common specific diagnosis   who had any diagnosis made Parents are shocked that thats their childs diagnosis said Dr Kerry S Caperell an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Louisville School of Medicine and lead author of the study The highest rate of constipation he said was found in boys around  My experience is the kids dont like to go to the bathroom at school so theres a sort of voluntary retention that exacerbates itself Constipation is often attributed to deficiencies in our modern diet  not enough   not enough fruits and vegetables  or to the same combination of overprocessed foods and sedentary lifestyle that puts children and adults at risk for   So there is often something judgmental in the air when the subject is raised And mind you it isnt always raised It is not shall we say a sexy topic Children often run into problems with constipation around the age of potty training when toddlers find themselves in a test of wills with their parents Jessica Hankinson a pediatric psychologist at Johns Hopkins Childrens Center said We definitely see around potty training what can be considered withholding behavior They start doing the potty dance crossing their legs bending down Anything in other words to keep from cooperating with the parental agenda Sometimes those patterns persist Some children may be physiologically predisposed Pediatric gastroenterologists and specialty clinics see children with refractory constipation who havent gotten better with the treatments suggested by their regular doctors Maybe the problem has been underrecognized and undertreated said Dr Maria OlivaHemker the chief of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and founder of a constipation clinic there And the longer children struggle with the problem the more severe it can get for reasons both behavioral and physiological We call it defecation anxiety Dr Hankinson said You have hard difficult stools to pass you have a painful bowel movement you start withholding That in turn affects the functioning of the colon In extreme cases children can develop what is called   when liquid stool leaks out around the hard impacted stuff clogging up the colon Parents may be worried about   or angry about accidents when the real problem is constipation Dr Marc Benninga a pediatrics professor at the Emma Childrens Hospital Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam and colleagues have studied   It has a huge impact on both the child and the family he said If you look at the data  percent of the children with constipation still have complaints of constipation after five years of intensive therapy In a  study by his group onefourth of the children   The treatment at Johns Hopkins involves laxatives  for a long time when necessary  combined with analyzing the diet and increasing fiber as well as drinking water if the childs intake is inadequate Behavioral intervention helps children get over their anxieties and learn new habits Dr Hankinson works with parents on positive reinforcement rewarding children for taking their medication and for sitting on the toilet for a specified time after meals Constipation is not just a problem of childhood Theres a fairly large literature in adults in terms of the adverse affects of chronic constipation on quality of life said Dr Arnold Wald a gastroenterologist and professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health who has written about   Many studies have suggested it has an impact consistent with what we see in a lot of chronic illnesses inflammatory bowel disease and so forth Those who deal with the more advanced and intractable cases would like parents to understand that this is a problem to take seriously Dont blame your child or yourself But be willing to discuss the subject and get help if theres a problem When my son was training to be an assistant camp counselor he was encouraged to make jokes particularly dear to the hearts of schoolage boys They told us constipation is very common with kids who are in a new place and theyre feeling stressed he said You want an environment where kids can talk to you about it Because otherwise they wont
