When confronted with an overly active child many exasperated teachers and parents respond the same way Sit still It might be more effective though to encourage the child to run Recent research suggests that even small amounts of exercise enable children to improve their focus and academic performance By now its well known that diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are increasingly widespread among American children The label has been applied to about  percent of those between the ages of  and  according to the latest federal statistics Interestingly past studies have shown a strong correlation between greater aerobic fitness and attentiveness But these studies did not answer the question of which comes first the fitness or the attentional control Addressing that mystery was a goal of a   Researchers at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign recruited  toyearold boys and girls half of whom had ADHD They all took a series of computerized academic and attentional tests Later on one occasion they sat and read quietly for  minutes on another they walked briskly or jogged for  minutes on treadmills After each task the children wore caps containing electrodes that recorded electrical activity in the brain as they repeated the original tests The results should make administrators question the wisdom of cutting PE classes While there were few measurable differences in any of the childrens scores after quiet reading they all showed marked improvements in their math and reading comprehension scores after the exercise More striking the children with ADHD significantly increased their scores on a complicated test one in which they had to focus on a single cartoon fish onscreen while other cartoon fish flashed onscreen to distract them Brainwave readings showed that after exercise the children with ADHD were better able to regulate their behavior which helped them pay attention They responded more nimbly to mistakes like incorrect keystrokes In short the children with ADHD were better students academically after exercise So were the students without ADHD In terms of a nonpharmacological means of dealing with attentionalcontrol problems in children exercise looks as if it could be quite beneficial says Charles Hillman the professor of kinesiology at the University of Illinois who oversaw the study Especially since it seems to also improve the academic performance of children who dont have attentionalcontrol problems Whats more adds Matthew Pontifex now an assistant professor at Michigan State University and the studys lead author You dont need treadmills Just get restless children to march or hop or in some fashion be physically active for a few minutes Coax their peers to join in Of course even as it reinforces the accumulating evidence that exercise is good for brains this shortterm study leaves many questions unanswered How much and what kind of physical activity is optimal Does it permanently lessen attentional problems Does exercise directly affect attention at all In their study the researchers speculate that exercise might sharpen mental focus in part by increasing brain activity in the frontal lobe But understanding its mechanisms may not be needed for teachers and parents to consider deploying movement to counter wandering attentions
