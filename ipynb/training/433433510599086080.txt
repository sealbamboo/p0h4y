Millions more people should be put on cholesterollowering statin drugs to protect them against heart attacks and strokes according to draft guidelines for the NHS in England   The   NICE says the scope for offering this treatment should be widened to save more lives  Death rates have been decreasing in recent years but cardiovascular disease remains the leading UK killer It claims about  lives a year Currently doctors are meant to offer statin tablets to the estimated seven million people who have a  chance of developing cardiovascular disease over  years based on risk factors such as their age sex whether they smoke and what they weigh  NICE is now suggesting that people with as low as a one in  or  risk should be offered statins  Doctors will need to make a judgement about the risks to people who have a less than  risk of developing cardiovascular disease and advise them appropriately say the draft guidelines  The NHS currently spends about m a year on statins If the draft recommendations go ahead this bill will increase substantially although the drugs have become significantly cheaper over the years It is not clear precisely how many more people would be eligible for statin therapy than now but NICE says it could be many hundreds of thousands or millions  Prof Peter Weissberg of the British Heart Foundation said the guidelines did need updating and agreed that more people stood to benefit from taking statins  Cardiovascular disease develops when fatty substances build up in the arteries and narrow them which can lead to heart attacks and stroke  Too much cholesterol in the blood can lead to these fatty deposits Statin drugs work by lowering cholesterol  Eating a healthy diet doing regular exercise and keeping slim will also help lower cholesterol  Like all medicines statins have potential sideeffects They have been linked to muscle liver and kidney problems but only in a very small number of cases  Prof Simon Maxwell of the British Pharmacological Society said Patients should be helped to make a truly informed decision about the benefits and risks of taking longterm preventative therapy that will not make them feel any better in the short term We should avoid misapplication of such a recommendation without proper individual patient counselling
