Everybody loves a messy eater In a study published this month in Developmental Science monthold children were taught new names for foods like jelly and syrup then tested to see if they could connect those names with the foods when they were presented in different colors and shapes The conclusion The toddlers learned better if they had shall we say interacted vigorously with the original samples  in other words   The study was widely picked up by media outlets and headlines trumpeted that a toddlers propensity toward mealtime mess might actually be a sign of intelligence a media trope not unlike the periodic celebration of   On some level it would seem we are all very ready to cheer for the child with a face well covered in chocolate pudding But the experiment brings up a number of interesting questions about how children learn about the role of play and exploration And maybe even about table manners The psychologists who did this research were interested in the question of how babies learn about nonsolid objects We had noticed in our lab work before that children are much better at learning names for new solid objects that they didnt know before said Lynn Perry now a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Wisconsin Madison and lead author of the study Since solid objects have fixed characteristics its relatively easy for a toddler to figure out what makes a cup ball or chair Its harder for them to learn the names of nonsolids Dr Perry said You cant just look and know what it is You have to use your senses and explore a little more The researchers reasoned that childrens most regular context for exploring nonsolid substances comes at mealtime and that putting them in highchairs might help them learn the names of such substances In fact children sitting in highchairs did learn better in the study Parents were also asked to describe their toddlers usual behavior at meals at home and each child was scored for messiness It was the ones who were messy at home who when we put them in the highchair in the lab showed the best learning said   an associate professor of psychology at the University of Iowa who supervised the research So the messy eater experiment is really about the developing brain and the cues and contexts that small children need to create lexical categories  everything covered by a particular word  a challenge especially when the category is not defined by a shape The children who squidged around in the cream of wheat tasted it smeared it did various unmentionable things with it  they were the children who understood what cream of wheat was They could identify it even if it came in a different shape and was doctored with green food coloring The messy eater experiment is also about play and the way that children explore their worlds and learn as they go Toddlers play with their food because toddlers play with their worlds And by playing and exploring they accumulate all kinds of data which helps them put together a picture and a vocabulary for the world around them They literally taste the world by putting things in their mouths by making them make their sounds shaking them said   a professor of education at the University of Delaware and coauthor of  Didactic information just falls flat she said They have to figure out for themselves and the only way they can do this is by messing around Some experts worry that in a world of sophisticated digital entertainments children may find fewer opportunities to create their own explorations And we might wonder whether reallife investigations seem more obtrusive or chaotic to parents accustomed to their childrens virtual messing around But mealtime will always offer opportunities to explore These simple everyday activities like eating that we might take for granted for the child really are rich sources of information Dr Perry said I once worked in a clinic for young children who werent gaining weight  in pediatrics the syndrome is called   Some of the parents had come through refugee camps and times of great hardship and the sight of a small child   food by playing with it was very disturbing We took those concerns seriously with strategies to allow the children to handle their own food and feed themselves without it looking like too much food was being wasted and that helped with nutritional intake So we can celebrate the sophisticated science that toddlers learn in their highchairs matching new substances to those they have already encountered Babies are learning through their play and their exploration and they can build on that for subsequent learning Dr Samuelson said Still I cant leave this subject without a word about table manners Sixteenmontholds are too young for those lessons but at a certain developmental point you come out of the highchair and join those around the table  in exchange for   So maybe we should consider manners and polite behavior the ultimate nonsolids for children to identify and master new reallife learning opportunities that arise when families gather at the table
