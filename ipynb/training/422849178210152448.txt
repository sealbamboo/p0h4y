Older people who took a few weeks of classes to train their brains say their ability to perform everyday tasks declined less than people who hadnt had the training even years later But the difference between them was modest at best and wasnt independently verified So its impossible to know if the people were really doing better at tasks like reading bus schedules or completing order forms or if they just thought they should be During the training we emphasized how valuable the training was and how relevant it was to peoples everyday lives says   a psychologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and lead author of the study The research was designed to find out if cognitive training could help slow declines in daily functioning that are common as people age We think people took something from the training to use in their everyday life he says That practical focus made this program different than many commercially available braintraining programs Rebok tells Shots We actually had practice where people had to set up different medication schedules he says We had them practice memory for grocery lists or memory for things they might want to take on vacation or memory for newspaper articles stories they might want to tell a friend Rebok says We tried to make it as relevant to their everyday lives as we could The  followed  people who were  years old on average when the study began They were divided into three groups that took  classes over five to six weeks in either memory reasoning or processing speed A fourth group of people didnt take any classes All four groups did better on tests of memory reasoning and speed a year later That improvement was predictable since the volunteers in the study had taken the tests before Those gains started waning after three years The people who had training in reasoning and processing speed continued to do slightly better than the control group in tests  years out The memory group didnt When it came to the questionnaire on  tasks of daily living  percent of the people who had training said they were doing as well as they had  years before compared to  percent of the people who had no training These are modest effects Rebok agrees But even small effects can have major public health consequences The results were published Monday in the   In recent years commercial braintraining programs have proliferated promising to improve performance or IQ Proponents of the approach say they have scientific proof on their side But the studies tend to be small and statistically flawed The benefits tend to be narrow and fleeting A    of  studies of memorytraining programs found that they did improve memory over the short term but didnt help with math reasoning or any other forms of thinking And   have shown that training to enhance working memory doesnt improve intelligence In  researchers at Case Western Reserve University were   a study by other researchers that found that brain training boosts IQ One problem with the latest study called ACTIVE for short is that it doesnt have a true control group The people in the control group were a nocontact control meaning they never had training of any sort That means they knew they couldnt be getting any potential benefits That can bias study participants perceptions which is why pharmaceutical trials give control group participants a placebo pill And there was no independent verification of the state of peoples independent living skills so it could be that the people who did have training just expected that they should be doing better People should approach braintraining studies with caution says   professor of psychology at the University of Maryland He has analyzed previous braintraining studies and found that their   were illusory These are very hard studies to carry out he tells Shots And the findings are rarely clear cut Who knows there could be something to it Dougherty says of this most recent study But just as he cant rule out benefits he adds he cant really establish that theyre there in the first place Still he says even if this is a placebo effect in an elderly population there may be some use to improving peoples selfesteem
