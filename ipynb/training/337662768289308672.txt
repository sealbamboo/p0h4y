In his s overweight and in a wheelchair the patient had been seeing doctors and nurses regularly for his diabetes Only recently had they discovered a pressure sore after someone had finally as he put it wanted to examine at my backside The oversight struck me as unimaginable Until I watched another doctor try My colleague a strapping man in his s wrapped his arms around the mans torso to lift him onto the examining table but could hardly budge the patient A few members of the clinic staff came in to help each taking a limb Several minutes later one of the nurses called for security Two burly men in dark blue uniforms joined the fray grunting as they finally extricated the patient from his chair  A nurse lunged forward to unbuckle the patients belt while a medical student began yanking on his sneakers but with each tug and jerk the guards grip on the patients torso loosened Feeling himself slipping the patient grabbed at the shirt of one of the guards to break his fall The guard lost his balance and reached for the wheelchair but its brake was not engaged The wheelchair spun hitting the medical student and nurse and knocking over the other guard as the patient pants half off and one shoe missing collapsed back into its seat   No one was hurt But when my colleague leaned down to ask the patient how he was he stopped himself midquestion Though the patients black baseball cap now partly obscured his face it was clear to all of us what his expression conveyed utter humiliation No doubt the patient is far from the only one suffering such embarrassment as a   on why people with disabilities still receive such subpar care makes clear  Its been nearly  years since the Americans With Disabilities Act a federal law prohibiting discrimination against people with disabilities went into effect Despite its   studies in recent years have revealed that   but also to receive inadequate preventive care and to experience worse outcomes One   in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer in women with disabilities But its been difficult to pinpoint exactly why Just as there are disparities in health care for people with disabilities financing for disability studies also falls short so many experts and advocates have had to rely on small surveys anecdotal samplings and their best guesstimates Now Dr Tara Lagu a physicianresearcher at the Center for Quality of Care Research at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield Mass and the lead investigator of the latest report has   her own patients with disabilities were   With no external support or research grants she and her coinvestigators first created a fictional patient based on many of Dr Lagus real cases The patient was partly paralyzed as a result of a stroke could not get out of a wheelchair without significant assistance weighed roughly  pounds and needed additional specialized medical evaluation The researchers then called more than  doctors offices in four major cities across the country that offered care in areas like gynecology urology psychiatry endocrinology and orthopedic surgery The researchers presented themselves as the doctors that they were and tried to make an appointment for the fictional patient  One out of five offices refused to even book an appointment Some explained that their buildings were inaccessible to people in wheelchairs but most refused simply because they had no equipment like heightadjustable examining tables and chairs specially designed weight scales or trained staff members to help move the patient out of the wheelchair  But even the offices that agreed to see the patient were not necessarily offering appropriate care When pressed some acknowledged that they had no plans or equipment for moving the patient Others said that they would complete only the parts of the exam that they could  and forgo the rest Fewer than  percent of these offices had appropriate equipment or employees trained to help patients with disabilities People assume that just because we are health care providers we are accessible to patients Dr Lagu said But in fact the vast majority of practices are probably doing things that if I were disabled I would not want to have done Many of the doctors practices were eager to explain why they refused to see the patient unaware it seemed of the legal implications of their refusal Some said the patient was too heavy Others brought up the potential litigation risk if the patient or a staff member was hurt during a transfer  Dr Lagu also suspects that time and financial constraints are important obstacles Heightadjustable exam tables for example can cost  or more at least   And even with federal   the additional work of transferring can take up more office time none of which is reimbursed Health care is really one of the last bastions of this kind of discrimination said Dr Lisa I Iezzoni author of an editorial accompanying the study and a leading expert on disability who directs the Mongan Institute for Health Policy at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston But its curious because were talking about health   The situation may improve over the next few years While the Americans With Disabilities Act has improved accessibility it lacks detailed requirements for medical equipment and furnishings Under   a panel of   to discuss specific guidelines and will present a list of recommendations to several federal agencies this summer recommendations that Dr Lagu believes could help address the problems uncovered by her study  Any one of us could become disabled Dr Lagu said But none of us should have to face these kinds of disadvantages
