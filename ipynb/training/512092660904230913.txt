If people need motivation to get up from their office chairs or couches and become less sedentary two useful new studies could provide the impetus One found that sitting less can slow the aging process within cells and the other helpfully underscores that standing up  even if you are standing still  can be good for you as well    For most of us nowadays sitting is our most common waking activity with many of us sitting for eight hours or more every day Even people who exercise for an hour or so tend to spend most of the remaining hours of the day in a chair The health consequences of this sedentariness are welldocumented Past studies have found that the more hours that people spend sitting the more likely they are to develop diabetes heart disease and other conditions and potentially to die prematurely  even if they exercise regularly  But most of these studies were associational meaning that they found a link between sitting and illness but could not prove whether or how sitting actually causes ill health  So for the most groundbreaking of the new studies which was   scientists in Sweden decided to mount an actual experiment in which they would alter the amount of time that people spent exercising and sitting and track certain physiological results In particular with this experiment the scientists were interested in whether changes in sedentary time would affect peoples telomeres If you are unfamiliar with the componentry of your genes telomeres are the tiny caps on the ends of DNA strands They shorten and fray as a cell ages although the process is not strictly chronological Obesity illness and other conditions can accelerate the shortening causing cells to age prematurely while some evidence suggests that healthy lifestyles may preserve telomere length delaying cell aging    For the new experiment the Swedish scientists recruited a group of sedentary overweight men and women all aged  and drew blood in order to measure the length of telomeres in the volunteers white blood cells Then half of the volunteers began an individualized moderate exercise program designed to improve their general health They also were advised to sit less The other volunteers were told to continue with their normal lives although the scientists urged them to try to lose weight and be healthy without offering any specific methods  After six months the volunteers all returned for a second blood draw and to complete questionnaires about their daily activities These showed that those in the exercise group were not surprisingly exercising more than they had been previously But they were also for the most part sitting substantially less than before  And when the scientists compared telomeres they found that the telomeres in the volunteers who were sitting the least had lengthened Their cells seemed to be growing physiologically younger  Meanwhile in the control group telomeres generally were shorter than they had been six months before  But perhaps most interesting there was little correlation between exercise and telomere length In fact the volunteers in the exercise group who had worked out the most during the past six months tended now to have slightly less lengthening and even some shortening compared to those who had exercised less but stood up more  Reducing sedentary time had lengthened telomeres the scientists concluded while exercising had played little role  Exactly what the volunteers did in lieu of sitting is impossible to say with precision said Per Sjgren a professor of public health at Uppsala University in Sweden who led the study because the researchers did not track their volunteers movement patterns with monitors But its most likely he said that sitting time was predominantly replaced with lowintensity activities and in particular with time spent standing up  Which makes the second new study of sedentary behavior particularly relevant Standing is not after all physically demanding for most people and some scientists have questioned whether merely standing up  without also moving about and walking  is sufficiently healthy or if standing merely replaces one type of sedentariness with another If so standing could be expected to increase health problems and premature death as sitting has been shown to do  To find out whether that situation held true Peter Katzmarzyk a professor of public health at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge La and an expert on sedentary behavior turned to a large database of selfreported information about physical activity among Canadian adults He noted the amount of time that the men and women had reported standing on most days over the course of a decade or more and crosschecked that data with death records to see whether people who stood more died younger  The results   are soothing if predictable Dr Katzmarzyk found no link between standing and premature death Rather as he writes in the study mortality rates declined at higher levels of standing suggesting that standing is not sedentary or hazardous a conclusion with which our telomeres would likely concur
