It took only a few days for   involving New Yorks new bikesharing program to begin circulating But experts and growing experience from bikesharing programs in other cities make clear that bicycling can be a safe mode of transportation and the presence of a bikesharing program is a boon to the safety of all bicyclists A number of studies have looked at increased biking and the result is that the more people bike in a community the less likely they are to collide with motorists said David Vlahov the dean of nursing at the University of California San Francisco It is likely due to motorists becoming more aware or expecting more to be riding bicycles Still about  deaths and more than half a million emergency room visits related to bicycling occur in the United States each year Head injuries account for about twothirds of hospitalizations and threefourths of deaths said Dr Frederick P Rivara a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington who conducted some of the seminal work on bike helmets in the mids Helmets would prevent about  percent of head injuries he says Knowing about common dangers as well as avoiding distractions maintaining safe speeds and obeying traffic signals can also help prevent fractures lacerations and more Brendan Kevenides a personal injury lawyer in Chicago who exclusively handles bicyclerelated accidents said that a large majority of his cases involve dooring the alltoocommon event in which a parked driver flings opens a door creating a sudden obstacle for an oncoming cyclist Incidents like these along with drivers failure to give bikers the right of way account for nearly half of all bicyclevehicle accidents The injuries can be significant said Mr Kevenides who works with a group called LOOK Chicago that coalesced after a bicyclist swerved to avoid an opening door and was fatally struck by a truck last fall In the Netherlands where biking has long been part of the urban fabric people are taught in driver education courses to reach across their bodies and open the drivers door with the right hand which forces the driver to look over the left shoulder to see if any bicyclists are coming It is kind of an automatism its in your system said Otto van Boggelen program manager for Fietsberaad a Dutch center of expertise on bicycling policy You have to be conscientious that there might be cyclists everywhere  and there   cyclists everywhere Efforts to prevent injuries to cyclists are gaining traction in places like Chicago where stickers that read LOOK Before Opening Your Door will soon be placed on passenger windows in all  taxis according to the programs coordinator Charlie Short bike safety and education manager for the Chicago Department of Transportation Cabs in Boston were outfitted with similar stickers last month The city also includes bike safety in its training for all new cabdrivers he says Last week the Chicago City Council passed an ordinance doubling the fines for people who open doors in cyclists path now  when the move interferes with a bicycle without incident and  when it causes an accident Bicyclists meanwhile are advised to heed the door zone biking roughly four feet to the left of parked cars For this reason many bike safety advocates favor backin angle parking Its also important for cyclists to stay focused A recent study in the journal Accident Analysis  Prevention found that bicyclists who text or talk on the phone or with a fellow bicyclist are more than twice as likely to engage in unsafe biking behaviors Youre more likely to do silly things on your bike if youre using a secondary device said Kate Terzano a lecturer at the Arizona State University School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning who led the study And by silly I mean enter an intersection without looking Ultimately most agree that creating bicyclefriendly environments is the best way to prevent bicyclerelated injuries and deaths Any solution to bicyclist safety should focus on preventing collisions from taking place not seeking to minimize the damage after a collision has occurred says Ian Walker a psychologist at the University of Bath in England who has done pioneering research on bicycle safety In one experiment he rode a bicycle while dressed as a man and then while dressed as a woman and found that drivers gave less passing room to men a finding that was confirmed in subsequent studies by others in Florida and Taiwan He also found that drivers gave him less space when he was wearing a helmet If we are worrying about bicycle helmets rather than how to stop people from hitting cyclists with cars and trucks in the first place then we are utterly missing the point Dr Walker says Transportation departments across the United States have begun to respond with creative improvements for safer roadways The National Association of City Transportation Officials has developed an exhaustive urban   based on a worldwide literature review experiences from its  member cities and collaboration with traffic engineers city planners and academic researchers The guide informed new citywide bike safety plans for Seattle and San Francisco Recommendations include protected or buffered bike lanes colored pavement shared lane markings special intersection signals and detectors for bicycles and bike boxes the painted areas before intersections that allow bicyclists to get in front of the line of cars at a red light In addition to infrastructure education and policy play a role The League of American Bicyclists named Colorado the second most bikefriendly state in America after Washington in part for being a model for bicycling traffic laws New York is No  For instance in Boulder one of only four communities in the United States awarded the leagues top designation  to  percent of arterial streets include dedicated bicycle facilities More than  percent of the citys elementary and middle schools provide bicycle education Until people and places change city bikesharing programs may be a critical step on the path to improved bicycle safety The single best thing that can happen for the safety of the individual cyclist is to grow the cycling community says Mr Kevenides of LOOK Chicago Its about increasing visibility and awareness And just in time Chicagos bikesharing program starts this month
