Whether its green tea that warms you up or coffee that gives you that morning lift a new study finds   can help cut the risk of suffering a stroke The   published in the American Heart Association journal   included  men and women in Japan Researchers found that the more green tea a person drank the more it reduced the risk of suffering a stroke Its almost a  percent lower risk of stroke in the green tea drinkers who drank four cups a day compared with those who rarely drank green tea explains Dr Ralph Sacco of the University of Miami Hes the past president of the American Heart Association and we asked him to review the study for us And with coffee researchers found just one cup per day was also associated with about a  percent decreased risk of stroke during a year followup period I was still feeling rather surprised about the findings Dr   the studys lead author tells The Salt in an email Kokubo is a researcher at the Department of Preventive Cardiology National Cerebra and Cardiovascular Center in Osaka Japan Kokubo says that green tea contains compounds known as catechins which help regulate blood pressure and   The compounds also seem to promote an antiinflammatory effect Kokubo says coffee which contains caffeine and compounds known as quinides likely influences our health through different mechanisms Its not just the Japanese who seem to benefit from drinking coffee and green tea Over the past few years researchers in the US have documented similar reductions in heart disease risk among Americans The accumulating evidence from a variety of studies is suggesting that green tea and coffee may be protective says Sacco And in addition recent   have linked a regular coffee habit to a range of benefits  from a reduced risk of Type  diabetes to a protective effect against Parkinsons disease Its interesting to note how much the thinking about caffeine and coffee has changed In the s surveys found that many Americans were trying to avoid it caffeine was thought to be harmful even at moderate doses One reason   of the Harvard School of Public Health says back then coffee drinkers also tended to be heavy smokers And in early studies it was very tough to disentangle the two habits So it made coffee look bad in terms of health outcomes says Stampfer But as newer studies began to separate out the effects of coffee and tea a new picture emerged suggesting benefits not risks Researchers say theres still a lot to learn here  they havent nailed down all the mechanisms by which coffee and tea influence our health Nor have they ruled out that it may be other lifestyle habits among coffee and tea drinkers thats leading to the reduced risk of disease And experts say when it comes to preventing strokes and heart attacks no food or drink is a magic bullet Its our overall patterns of eating and exercise that are important Its a whole lifestyle approach and we need to remember that says Sacco So if you are already in the habit of drinking coffee or green tea this study is one more bit of evidence that you can go ahead and enjoy it
