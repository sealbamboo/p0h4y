Good morning everyone and how are you today A spot of rain is falling on the Pharmalot campus but our spirits remain sunny Whenever we see clouds we like to trot one of our favorite sayings courtesy of the Morning Mayor Every brand new day should be unwrapped like a precious gift So go ahead and tug on the ribbon And of course there are some tidbits to digest Hope you have a wonderful day and do stay in touch Johnson  Johnson is withdrawing a surgical tool that can spread cancer in women Novartis apologized for failing to report side effects of its leukemia drugs in a timely manner Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals are spending  million on a voucher in hopes of beating Amgen in a race to get a new class of cholesterol drugs to market and the leanandmean approach to RD espoused by Valeant Pharmaceuticals may boomerang by harming its relationship with the FDA
