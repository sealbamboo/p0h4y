An ideal pregnancy lasts  weeks And it looks like theres also an ideal time   pregnancies The length of time between giving birth to one baby and getting pregnant with the next should be  months or more Women who get pregnant sooner than that are more likely to have a premature baby Women who got pregnant within a year of giving birth were twice as likely to have that new baby born prematurely a study finds compared with women who waited at least  months The most significant birth risks are associated with the shortest birth intervals says   a professor at the University of Cincinnati who led   published Wednesday in the   One in every eight babies born in the US arrives before  weeks of pregnancy according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention That means that they miss the last few weeks in the womb when organs like the brain lungs and liver finish developing That is why   is the leading cause of longterm neurological disabilities in children DeFranco and her colleagues dug into the archives at the Ohio Department of Health and found  birth records from mothers whod given birth at least twice over a period of six years They found that mothers with shorter   as its called were more likely to give birth prematurely and less likely to deliver after the expected  weeks of pregnancy Mothers with less than a year between one birth and the next pregnancy had lower chances of giving birth to the next child at the expected week mark We knew already that shorter intervals between pregnancies are associated with higher likelihood of preterm birth DeFranco tells Shots But we did not know whether or not short spacing led to a lower likelihood of delivering after the due date of  weeks The study also found that black women tended to have shorter intervals between births compared with women of other races which DeFranco says were predominantly white That finding is consistent with the   that black mothers are at a higher risk of giving birth preterm There are other risks that werent looked at in this study including being a young or older mother high blood pressure infection and having previously had a preterm birth Biologically speaking a new mother can get pregnant within a month of giving birth to her last child though health professionals usually recommend that couples wait a month or two after a birth before having sex DeFranco says the biggest factors that determine birth spacing are family planning and access to birth control Many pregnancies are unintended and so the availability of birth control factors pretty heavily into birth spacing she says A previous study has shown that the majority of pregnancies with a short birth interval are actually unintended pregnancies New mothers should be informed about the importance of adequately spacing out their pregnancies DeFranco says Theres variability in that counseling and I think that some physicians are well aware of the adversity in birth spacing outcomes and others arent she says We suggest that the obstetric care provider who sees the mother after the birth of her baby would counsel her on optimal birth spacing on her next pregnancy
