How did you pull this off Roz Chast How did you document the last eight years of your parents lives in your distinctively doodleish drawings and candid prose and make the story highly specific to their escapefromtheCossacks pasts in Brooklyn and simultaneously so universal And how did you make this memoir  tellingly titled Cant We Talk About Something More Pleasant  both heartbreaking and snortingly funny Ms Chast the muchadmired New Yorker cartoonist moved to Connecticut in  and thereafter rarely returned to her native Brooklyn where her parents George and Elizabeth were living in the same apartment  though it had grown grimier  in which shed grown up In  however she felt an oddly powerful need to start visiting them instead of their taking a car service to see her and her family George and Elizabeth Chast inseparable since their marriage in  soon began the trajectory familiar to readers here Their only child acquired unsought expertise in virtually every aspect of elder care the falls the dementia the hired aides the move to assisted living the cycles in and out of nursing homes the guilt and anger and other emotional fallout After her father died in  at  and her mother followed two years later at  Ms Chast began grappling with how to tell their story and her own The Times   Ive been a fan for decades and in fact interviewed her years ago so I was glad to have this excuse to call her up and chat about the stuff nobody wants to chat about Here are edited excerpts from our conversation  You tend not to like talking about yourself much as I recall But this book is intensely personal  Yeah A friend of mine said You must feel like your pants are down   Do you  A little bit But its an interesting story and I wanted to do it  You portray leaving home as a kind of liberation After you were sprung you stayed away for years  Once I had my family and I was living up in Connecticut I gave myself all kinds of excuses and reasons for not going back into Brooklyn to visit them to see how things were going  What do you think was the actual reason  I really didnt want to deal I was happier when I wasnt with them As long as I could hide from myself the fact that they might need me  and when you have little kids thats the ultimate excuse for everything  I just didnt want to  I gather that once you did start visiting regularly you took a stab at what experts call the conversation about what they wanted as their health declined And it didnt go well  No it wasnt good I was as complicit as they were Its a horrible conversation to have We all want to pretend were never going to die  Do you think their families past traumas those immigrant anxieties affected the way they responded  The way they dealt with aging was the way they dealt with everything else Dont ask for trouble I think they felt that by talking about anything in the future theyd invite it in If you dont talk about it it wont happen They were very much afraid of seeing an elder lawyer which was kind of a turning point and a great thing  and Im so glad they did it  but they didnt want to discuss anything I was as much in denial as they were I didnt know what those things were Health care proxy But if we hadnt gotten those papers in order it would have been a lot harder I started to collect information like what medications they were on I did know what a health care proxy was by the time the appointment was over We got their wills updated I found out about some bank account they had about  in Things that would have been much much harder to deal with a few years down the line  You write a fair amount about guilt including your hope that your very frail mother wouldnt agree to major surgery at an advanced age  When my mother was  and a doctor suggested that she might have a colostomy operation I was horrified And I felt so guilty  if I had been closer to her would I have said Life at any cost Just as long as she doesnt die But it was just crazy She could barely walk from the bed to the bathroom She had a hour nurse because she was beyond basic assisted living and she would have had to go to a nursing home otherwise I felt like Hes a doctor he should understand that this is not good  Her sister the retired RN seemed to think it would be no big deal But in the end your mother said no to surgery  I dont think she wanted it She would never have deferred to me if shed wanted the operation And she did live for another few months  We can be a little slow to recognize that immortality is not one of our options  Thats true despite these billionaires who are looking for ways to extend life to  or  Maybe they think that old age is like those people you see on commercials with silver hair walking in the woods  Whereas you show that caring for  old people can take over your life for years  Oh it did Even if youre not with them youre waiting for the bad call Youre on the train and youre listening to a song and reading and suddenly your phone rings and its someone from the nursing home or the assisted living It happens a lot and its exhausting And you know that eventually thats where were all heading This certainly is a cheery conversation  We want The New Old Age to be a place where people can talk realistically about all these issues and we arent chirpy about it The drawings you made of your mother in her bed as she was close to death for example  is that your natural response to events to draw them  It sounds so pompous to say it but its a way of bearing witness in a way being there and not running away from it trying to take it in as much as you can That cartoon of an old lady in bed with an opium pipe  I wasnt completely joking I do think is there some better way of doing this or dealing with it with moving into that part of aging that might be more spiritual or pleasureoriented and less about patching up this breakingdown machine I do think about that
