A friend in my cancer support group suggested a call to   when I arrived at lunch looking bad and feeling worse The program had given her eyebrows Eyebrows I thought would be good Eyebrows seem like something it might be reasonable to want I am not the sort of person who would ordinarily sign up for this sort of twohour workshop Although I have always admired cosmetically creative women I made peace with my face by just trying to look presentable  a short haircut and maybe a little blush or eyeliner After diagnosis it seemed sensible to relinquish makeup as I took off my jewelry like a penitent embarked on rigorous rounds of selfmortification With the weight loss resulting from operations and chemotherapy the precious rings might slip off and get lost   But even penitents have eyebrows Maybe eyebrows seem trivial to you Probably given the grand scheme of things they should be to me Yet it feels somehow vacant to have a face without eyebrows So I made the call Still I was wary The volunteers in the absolutely free Look Good program at the cancer community center might assume that I comprehend matters of femininity about which I remain profoundly ignorant I misunderstood the only question when I signed up The receptionist on the phone asked Light or medium or dark I thought she wanted to know whether I wore very little or a lot of makeup Now I realize that she was inquiring about my complexion  I arrived at the center to find two teachers and just one other patient Nora a young woman from Puerto Rico with colon cancer She was clearly as nervous as I We were given a tote of stuff and told to take out each item and place it in a specific order cleansing cloths moisturizer concealer foundation powder blush eyebrow pencil eye shadow eyeliner mascara lip liner and lipstick all donated by their manufacturers   I had never used half of these things Plus since I had answered the receptionists question with the word light the products I was handed were not meant for a person who used to have black hair and black eyebrows Have I explained that I didnt look very attractive No eyebrows did I mention that blotches on my skin my scalp barely concealed beneath thinning hair and maybe four eyelashes on the top of each eye with nothing on the bottom lid As one of the teachers massaged moisturizer into my face I tensed up If you feel bad can you be made to look good The concealer foundation and powder covered up discolorations here shadows there I put the blush on myself way too much so we had to wipe half of it off Glumly I supposed that instead of looking like a cancer patient I would resemble a corpse that had undergone a makeover by a cosmetologist undertaker  But then came the eyebrow pencil Like most people who spend their lives in schools I love pencils The process involved stroking its tip this way and that Eyebrows are complicated You have to figure out where they used to start and where they used to arch and where they used to end Eventually I could see brown brows on my forehead and this was like returning to real life if not my own real life  Next I tried the eye shadow and needed help putting on the eyeliner and mascara on the four lashes I declined the lip liner as well as the lipstick since I never wore those Finally a carton of dead pelts appeared I needed to be polite and try on a few wigs At this point Nora fingering her head of thick hair explained that it would all fall out next week What to do I invoked Michelle Obama and urged Nora to try bangs To our delight she found a shoulderlength wig that looked adorable As for me I resembled the Church Lady from Saturday Night Live  So I decided to stick with my meager pixie cut though maybe it should be called a troll cut How amazing that the tactful instructors in this program could deal with an eccentric like me I thought as I left with the full tote and what looked like eyebrows on my forehead  maybe the wrong color but still eyebrows My husband greeted me and of course I asked How do I look  He said You always look good   Oh said I Dont you see a difference  He nodded You look more defined It was sad washing the eyebrows off that evening but I was determined to retrace them in the morning Unfortunately I ended up a wee clownish because I accidentally used the lip liner Still they were eyebrows and maybe just maybe I will retrieve the engagement wedding and anniversary bands and put them back on my finger I may not look good but I feel better
