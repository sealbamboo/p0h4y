When UPS told workers that it would no longer offer health coverage for spouses who had their own jobbased insurance it caused a big stir But the shipping giant has plenty of company So many employers are trying to cut back on health coverage for spouses that it has become a trend The practice began well before the Affordable Care Act passed and the connection to the law in some cases isnt that direct About  percent of employers have this provision in their policies says Tracy Watts who heads the health care reform team at   a benefits consulting firm Mercer surveyed employers who have some sort of restriction on health coverage of spouses and found that about half of those employers or  percent have imposed a surcharge for spouses who could get coverage at their own jobs The other  percent exclude spouses who have coverage elsewhere Watts says Thats the approach UPS is taking So is the University of Virginia   the universitys head of human resources says the decision was mostly about simple arithmetic When medical expenses go up which they have for us then we have two choices We can either increase premiums or we can reduce what we pay out in the way of benefits Carkeek says Carkeek says the decision was tangentially related to the health law because every companys health plan is going to pay some extra costs associated with new fees and other requirements next year But the connection to the Affordable Care Act is slight The tendency has been to attribute all these changes to the ACA but we would have been facing all of these changes anyway she says And why are employers targeting coverage of spouses in particular Spouses cost more than the employees Watts says They cost about  a year more Its not entirely clear why but generally spouses covered on employer plans are either wives who are younger and have maternity claims or husbands who are older and have chronic conditions Women incur more claims when they are younger and men tend to incur more claims when they are older Watts says Employers have known this for a while and the idea of charging workers more to cover their spouses is hardly new says Julie Stone a consultant with the benefits firm Towers Watson A decade ago a number of employers were looking at spouse surcharges for employee spouses who declined coverage with their employer she says Stone says the idea lost popularity for a while but now its making a comeback She says theres actually a quirk in the health law that allows for it Employers are not required to offer spouses coverage at all Stone says Theyre required to offer dependent children but not spouses But she says a wholesale dropping of coverage for spouses  even if those spouses could now get coverage through the new health care exchanges  isnt what seems to be happening Were not seeing employers saying Im not going to change my plan rules and Im not going to cover spouses  she says The surcharge and the concept of a penalty for spouses who choose to opt out of their own employer coverage  thats not related to the health care reform law at all The bottom line say benefit experts is that with health costs continuing to rise employers are trying to make sure theyre running their health benefits programs as leanly as possible And for some that means not paying the claims of other employers workers
