In yet another cost-cutting move, the DePuy Synthes medical device unit of Johnson & Johnson is eliminating all travel – except for its sales force – for the rest of the year in hopes of lowering such costs by 25% and meeting 2014 financial goals, according to an internal memo. At the same time, all consulting contracts valued at more than $50,000 must now obtain top-level approval.. This is the second time in recent weeks that DePuy Synthes, which represents the largest portion of the $7.2 billion J&J device business, has cut costs. Late last month, the unit eliminated about 400 jobs, or less than 2% of its global workforce of 23,000 employees, as part of a reorganization.
