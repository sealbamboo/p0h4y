If you show up at a hospital emergency department with a high fever and you just happen to have been traveling in Africa dont be surprised if you get a lot of attention Hospitals are on the lookout for people with symptoms such as a high fever vomiting and diarrhea who had been traveling in parts of West Africa affected by Ebola following instructions from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention On Monday New Yorks Mount Sinai Hospital announced that it was evaluating a patient who had recently been in West Africa Ebola Scare in City the   tabloid trumpeted on its front page Test result looms as NYers wait in fear But those fears though perhaps a boon for headline writers were misplaced Later Monday the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene   that after consultation with CDC and Mount Sinai the Health Department has concluded that the patient is unlikely to have Ebola The CDCs   gives very specific advice on whom to screen for possible exposure and when to test peoples blood for antibodies to the Ebola virus The CDC recommends that hospitals only test people who get a high fever within  days of having a highrisk exposure defined as contact with blood or bodily fluids of someone known to have or suspected of having Ebola So far hospitals around the country have reported  suspected cases to the CDC an agency official said Monday and only four met those requirements for testing Malaria diagnostics should also be a part of initial testing because it is a common cause of febrile illness in persons with a travel history to the affected countries the CDC said in its advisory Indeed two of the four people tested had malaria not Ebola A third also tested negative for Ebola and results are pending in the fourth person Public health officials continue to note that US hospitals are well versed in infection control procedures that would contain the Ebola virus which because it is not airborne is harder to spread than tuberculosis or SARS The standard rigorous infection control procedures used in major hospitals in the US will prevent spread of Ebola here CDC director   wrote in a Twitter chat
