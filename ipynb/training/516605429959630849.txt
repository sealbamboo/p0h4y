The trouble for Daniel Tully then  and an excellent student and athlete in Brooklyn began  months ago when he developed what seemed like a virus that kept recurring each time sending him to bed and keeping him from school for a week In January he came down with an intestinal bug from which he never seemed to recover He developed severe headaches whenever he tried to read or concentrate became extremely weak mentally foggy and unable to go to school at all He vomited violently after meals lost weight and eventually could not walk unaided I had to carry him to the bathroom recalled his father Ed Tully When a child develops such a devastating constellation of symptoms youd think his doctors might consider testing for   an autoimmune reaction to dietary gluten that can destroy the small intestine Awareness of the problem has never been greater But even in the most sophisticated medical settings the diagnosis can be missed or the tests done incorrectly Over four days in a local hospital Daniels doctors performed an intestinal   But only two samples were taken which missed the severe damage in his small intestine He finally saw a pediatric immunologist and was given the blood test specific for celiac disease It was unequivocally positive The diagnosis was confirmed by a second intestinal biopsy this time with the recommended six or more samples Daniel began a strict   five months ago and is gradually recovering With intensive   and a diet rich in meat he is regaining lost strength weight and stamina His doctors say it may take a year but he eventually will achieve    as long as he sticks religiously to the diet Gluten is a protein in grains like wheat rye and barley that contains gliadin peptides In people with celiac disease these can trigger an autoimmune reaction that damages the villi tiny projections lining the small intestine that absorb nutrients from food into the body Like Daniel people with celiac disease must avoid wheat rye or barley or any of the thousands of products or ingredients made from these grains Some must also abstain from oats The disease runs in families Some of Daniels first and second cousins have it and Daniels younger sister is now being tested for it Firstdegree relatives of someone with celiac disease should also be tested for it even if they have no symptoms If another person in the immediate family has the disease seconddegree relatives should be tested Dr Joseph A Murray a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic said in an interview Celiac disease is now five times more common than it was  years ago and thats not just the result of better diagnoses said Dr Murray who is also editor of Mayo Clinic Going Gluten Free to be published in November We looked at old stored blood samples and that showed a real increase in incidence For reasons unknown celiac disease now affects one in  Caucasians Dr Murray said It does occur in other racial groups but is believed to be much less common Hygienic extremes may be to blame for the increase Overzealous cleanliness has been linked to a rise in autoimmune diseases But experts speculate the increase also may have to do with how grains are bred these days or the overreliance on formula to feed infants Although traditionally considered a disease that shows up in childhood people of all ages may develop it One person I know was diagnosed in his s another in her s But the overwhelming majority of people with celiac disease remain undiagnosed The most recent data show that   Those who are not avoiding gluten risk developing a host of debilitating sometimes fatal complications including   A main reason for this lag in detection is the long and confusing list of signs and symptoms some of which may be mild enough to be easily ignored or attributed to another condition like   or an allergy  and   are the most common signs But according to   possible symptoms include chronic or intermittent       weight loss or in children   fatigue   abnormal dental enamel     and   bone loss and fractures   delayed puberty unexplained infertility and   recurring headaches loss of feeling in hands and feet poor coordination and unsteadiness   depression   anxiety and   Doctors have to raise their index of suspicion Dr Murray said At least half of patients dont have diarrhea It can present in so many ways About onethird of his patients had asked doctors on their own for testing he added It is critically important to be tested before going on a glutenfree diet which can disguise the intestinal damage characteristic of the condition Those already eating a restricted diet would have to return to gluten say eating two slices of bread a day for two weeks for the test to be accurate Avoiding gluten has become easier in recent years as companies have loaded store shelves with glutenfree foods A   stipulates that any food labeled glutenfree must contain less than  parts per million of gluten considered harmless for most celiac patients All uncoated unprocessed meats poultry fish beans nuts vegetables and fruits are naturally glutenfree and can be labeled as such But to be safe consumers must read labels diligently to spot hidden hazards like hydrolyzed vegetable protein and learn to ask detailed questions about how food is prepared when dining out Even reusing water in which wheat pasta is cooked can be hazardous
