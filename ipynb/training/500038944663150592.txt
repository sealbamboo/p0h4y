When it comes to protecting themselves from HIV women need more options About   of all women diagnosed with HIV contract the virus through heterosexual sex And right now the   is the only contraception available that stops HIV  and is controlled by the woman These devices can be hard to find and tough to use Now engineers at the University of Washington in Seattle have come up with an experimental technology that may one day make HIV protection for women as easy as using a tampon For years scientists have been developing gels or creams that contain antiHIV drugs known as   But these topical ointments can be problematic Theyre messy to apply They can leak And the medication absorbs slowly so women have to use the gels or creams at least  minutes before sex A new delivery method could solve all these problems say bioengineers Cameron Ball and   The secret An electrically spun fabric High concentrations of the microbicide can be interwoven into the fabric and the material dissolves quickly when it gets wet So the vaginal tissue is infused with the microbicide within six minutes That means women dont have to apply it far in advance of having sex Ball says Theres a race between the antiHIV microbicide to get to the tissue before the virus does So the more quickly it dissolves the better he says Back in June Ball and Woodrow described this potential delivery mechanism in a   published in the journal   Several microbicides that could be used with the material are still undergoing clinical trials But the fabric is already approved by the FDA Ball says Its made from a polymer using nanotechnology Its way better than any Egyptian cotton highcount fabric that you could find he says Each thread is about  times smaller than a human hair That gives the fabric great flexibility so it can be easily shaped in many ways One option is to fold the fabric into a torpedolike shape that could go inside a tampon applicator But the team also wants to see what kinds of shapes or applicators women around the world prefer Its a matter of giving women enough choices and options of what products are available and how they are used Ball says So you meet the needs of as many women as possible Ultimately Ball says the goal is to combine microbicides and a contraceptive spermicide to make a device that protects against pregnancy HIV herpes and other sexually transmitted diseases But theres a long road ahead before this technology shows up on drugstore shelves The next step is testing out the fabric in rabbits and then monkeys After that if all goes well theyll try it out in clinical trials with people All of that will take about  years Ball says But hes still hopeful With this technology he says weve enabled a whole new round of product design to help with HIV prevention
