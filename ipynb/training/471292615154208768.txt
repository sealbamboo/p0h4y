Both participant groups received intensive coaching on successful techniques for weight loss including regular feedback on the meals they logged in journals Participants weighed on average just over  pounds at the start of the study  The results to us were not at all surprising says Hill  While the typical participant banned from drinking diet sodas lost  pounds over  weeks those allowed to continue drinking diet soda lost on average  pounds in the same time period Thats a pound difference Hill says that in his clinical experience many people who have successfully lost significant weight are heavy users of noncaloric sweeteners But why was the diet soda group more successful The most likely reason is that this group had the easier task Cutting calories and boosting exercise takes a lot of willpower Trying to simultaneously give up something else you regularly enjoy  such as diet soda  taxes your ability to stay the course Most psychologists agree that our   So while this study did not track calorie consumption the group blocked from drinking diet sodas most likely ate or drank more calories over the course of the week diet Since the study lasted just  weeks it remains to be seen whether artificial sweeteners are beneficial in the longterm says   a professor of Behavioral Neuroscience at Purdue University  Swithers   last year that found that diet soda drinkers have the same health issues as those who drink regular soda  It found that people who drink diet soda may be at increased risk of excessive weight gain metabolic syndrome type  diabetes and cardiovascular disease according to the study   What the prospective studies actually suggest is that if you go out  years  years  years  years the cohorts of individuals who are consuming diet sodas have much worse health outcomes says Swithers Those studies show a correlation and are not designed to show causation But some researchers like Swithers suspect artificial sweeteners ultimately increase the desire for sweets Doing these shortterm studies that look at weight cant really tell us anything about whether or not these products are contributing to these increased risks says Swithers And its really hard to look at the longterm data and come up with any argument that theyre helping Hill who along with four other researchers designed the study which was selected for funding by the American Beverage Association from among multiple competing proposals The American Beverage Associations membership includes numerous CocaCola and PepsiCola bottling companies  It makes sense that it would have been harder for the water group to adhere to the overall diet than the artificiallysweetened beverage group says Hill He added The most likely explanation was that having access to drinks with sweet taste helps the artificiallysweetened beverage group to adhere better to the behavioral change program In short this study addresses the question of whether a regular diet soda drinker should attempt to kick his or her habit while also attempting to lose weight not whether we should all drink more diet soda in order to lose weight Artificiallysweetened beverages are not weightloss enhancers so its not anything in the compounds themselves that are promoting weight loss says Hill Kristi Norton a regular diet soda drinker before the study began was assigned to the group that required her to kick the habit At the time of her CNN interview she was not aware of the studys findings She says she lost  pounds during the course of the study but the real difference is in how she feels I feel like I could  tell the benefit of drinking water only I felt better I had more energy I felt healthier I just generally felt way better says Norton And I can feel the difference now when I drink a diet drink I can feel this heaviness
