People with swollen gums missing teeth and other signs of poor dental health are more likely to be infected orally with the human papillomavirus researchers reported on Wednesday HPV a sexually transmitted virus causes cancers of the cervix mouth and throat The new study published in Cancer Prevention Research is   but other experts noted that the research found only an association and relied mostly on selfreported data about oral health It is too early to say with confidence that brushing and flossing regularly can prevent oral HPV infection they said The finding is a modest association said Aime R Kreimer an epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute who was not involved in the study We dont know if poor oral health causes HPV infection and would go on to cancer she said This finding suggests another potential downside to deficient hygiene because of a possible association between poor to fair oral health and the presence of the human papillomavirus which in itself is identified with several diseases said Dr Sol Silverman a professor of oral medicine at the University of California San Francisco and a spokesman for the American Dental Association Researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston reviewed data on both highrisk and lowrisk oral HPV infection and oral health in  adults ages  to  participating in the nationally representative  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey known as NHANES The study found that being male smoking cigarettes and having multiple oral sex partners increased the likelihood of oral HPV infection findings similar to those in an   But after controlling for smoking and the number of oral sex partners the new study found that selfrated poor oral health was an independent risk for oral HPV infection The odds of having an oral HPV infection were  percent higher among those reporting poor to fair oral health Throat cancer caused by HPV is increasing particularly along middleaged white men About  cases a year are diagnosed in the United States Many experts believe oral infection with the virus has increased along with the frequency of oral sex What we think might be happening is if you have poor oral health  ulcers gum inflammation sores or lesions any openings in the mouth  that might provide entry for HPV said Christine Markham the second author on the paper and an associate professor of health promotion and behavioral sciences at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston We dont have sufficiently strong evidence to demonstrate that conclusively in the study but thats our thinking Yet the increase in risk is modest said Dr Kreimer less than the two to threefold elevations in risk that cause concern And three of the four measures used to assess the participants oral health including the presence of gum disease were selfreported a limitation of the study One measure  number of teeth lost  was reported by dental hygienists Its the first paper linking selfreported measures of poor oral hygiene and an oral HPV infection Dr Maura L Gillison a professor of medicine at Ohio State University who was not involved in the study Its a strong paper because its a first but does it have public health significance Should people change their behavior I would say no Oral cancers caused by HPV are typically found near the tonsils or at the base of the tongue she added and its hard to see how those regions could be directly affected by periodontal inflammation Experts including Dr Gillison nonetheless called the study an important first step Further study  even though it would be expensive and timeconsuming  should be considered said Dr Silverman
