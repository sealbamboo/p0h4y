      Nurses may be the answer to some of the key health care and employment problems the US is struggling with right now Theyre being tapped to take on the lions share of work as millions of Americans get health insurance for the first time in January and they provide a rare bright spot in the US unemployment picture as nursing graduates get snapped up even before they collect their diplomas But just as the country needs nurses the most a shortage of professors is curbing the capacity of nursing schools to crank out graduates with advanced degrees Its a double whammy  we cant get enough nurses or the faculty to train them says Sarah Keating a nursing professor at the University of Nevada Reno Its so tough when you see these folks coming through and they do so well on the interviews and we have to turn away one in four adds Keating Its too bad  graduates with advanced nursing degrees are almost guaranteed jobs experts say We are graduating  undergraduates baccalaureateprepared nurses and around  to  with advanced practice degrees this year and they all have jobs says Jeannette Andrews dean of the College of Nursing at the University of South Carolina Amanda Langford is one of them She graduated two weeks ago with a doctorate and has a new job lined up as a family nurse practitioner in Charlotte But shell get no break between school and starting her new position  shes currently working as a registered nurse at Springs Memorial Hospital in Lancaster SC  Ive had a job since I got my bachelor of science degree in nursing in  Langford  said in a telephone interview According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing AACN US nursing schools rejected  qualified applicants from baccalaureate and graduate nursing programs in   We are probably turning away a couple hundred a year Andrews says   AACN says a lack of faculty is to blame in most cases and officials point to another study showing  faculty jobs open at  nursing schools The United States has more than  million nurses They already deliver much of the front line health care that Americans need from giving vaccinations to delivering babies The Institute of Medicine which advises the federal government on health matters  than they already do and can help meet ballooning demands as the population ages and as more people get health insurance under the  health reform law   million by      With healthcare reform we expect  South Carolina residents to have new access to primary care says Andrews We do not have enough providers There is a family practice physician shortage as well So clinical practices and hospitals are competing for the very same skilled nurses that the nursing schools need and want  I have five faculty positions open right now Andrews said It is really hard to find qualified doctorally prepared faculty who are willing to relocate or to move out of a higherpaying salary in the field Beatrice Kalisch a distinguished professor at the University of Michigan says her salary was cut in half when she moved from consulting back into teaching Money is not in academia Kalisch said in a telephone interview  Kalisch whos also been a staff nurse and a manager is leaving teaching once again to spend a year at the Institute of Medicine Shes a living example of the demand for welleducated nurses There are all kinds of professions that are seeking the same prepared people she said According to the   nurse practitioners  a year Compare that to  a year for someone teaching with a masters degree And with states cutting budgets staff have to take furlough days so that cuts their pay even more And you have to go into huge debt to get your degree so its like wow why do all that Kalisch says Most nursing schools now want their instructors and professors to have doctoral degrees  either a PhD or a Doctor of Nursing Practice DNP degree Andrews says the University of South Carolinas program requires a  grade point average Our criteria are very rigid she says Yet the university has students from  states The struggle doesnt always end with admission to nursing school Langford says students can wash out halfway through The way South Carolina does it you do two years of prenursing Then you reapply for the upper division You have to reapply because there are not enough faculty to teach the upper courses she says My class size in  went from over  to I think we had  when we graduated It wasnt because they dropped out or they failed They put you on a list and they took the top  Another factor hitting faculty numbers age Nationally the average age of our nurse faculty is  Andrews says When they retire the shortage will be even more acute Keating wants to retire Shes  I keep trying Keating says She moved to Florida a few months ago but is still doing contract work for the university Hopefully by next year I will be really really retired she says Young graduates feel the pressure too Kate Chappell  is working as an assistant professor in USCs school of nursing while she starts her PhD I worked as a nurse through grad school when getting nurse practitioner training she says She started as a nursing professor as soon as she got her masters degree I am teaching nurses and I am a student myself she says Chappell wanted to work as a pediatric intensive care nurse but when she graduated with honors the academic dean of the nursing school pressed her to stay in teaching  The federal Health Resources and Services Administration HRSA has   aimed at helping students stay on an academic track Judy Honig associate dean of student affairs at the Columbia University School of Nursing in New York says five to six students at her school graduate every year using a HRSA loan program that pays up to  of a students loan debt if they go into teaching for two years Some critics ask why anyone would get a PhD in nursing when for just about the same amount of time money and with the similarly stringent academic requirements they could get an MD and either teach in a medical school or become a physician with indisputably higher salaries The   says the average physician faculty at a US medical school made  in  Yet Honig says there is no shortage of very smart very qualified students wanting to go into nursing Many put into their personal statements that they have chosen nursing because of nursings philosophy says Honig who herself has two doctorates  one in education and one in nursing practice They are not defaulting to nursing They are choosing it because it represents the direction they want to practice in It isnt a condition It isnt a disease Its a person As for status Honig doesnt see a difference I am very fast to say a PhD is a doctor a DDS doctor of dental surgery is a doctor and a nurse practitioner is a doctor she says They are all doctors and they are real
