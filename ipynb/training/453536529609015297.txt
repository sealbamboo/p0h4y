Recent research on oral cancer made headlines  and raised concerns  when scientists reported that poor dental hygiene and excessive use of mouthwash containing alcohol could increase the risk of the disease Each year some    and upward of  people worldwide  are diagnosed with oral cancer which can occur in the tongue the floor of the mouth the gum and the cheek Deaths from oral cancer in the US last year were estimated at  The   published in   came from work conducted by the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology with help from Glasgow Universitys Dental School Do the results mean you should cut back on mouthwash swilling To learn more we spoke with   a head and neck cancer surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Here are highlights from our conversation edited for length and clarity Tobacco and alcohol Independently they have a carcinogenic effect The effect when used in combination is multiplicative rather than additive Smokers and drinkers get a big jump in risk for oral cancer The other major factor is   The most common cancer in young men in countries like India and Pakistan is oral cancer attributed to chewing betel nut or   a preparation that includes betel nuts and betel nut leaves Once you get beyond those three factors the other ones are more difficult to link causally Poor oral hygiene and use of mouthwash certainly may be contributing but the extent is difficult to define People who tend to be smokers or drinkers are the ones who tend not to take care of hygiene in general Thats not a universal statement but in general Whether poor oral hygiene caused the oral cancer is a little more difficult to define Studies say the bacterial population in the oral cavity may be contributing to development of oral cancers but these arent large enough to establish a definitive association I would call this a soft factor The same goes for mouthwash use There is a potential association there I tell my oral cancer patients to not use alcoholcontaining mouthwashes  the alcohol is probably the main carcinogen to worry about But I dont tell them not to use mouthwash at all There is no known harm to nonalcoholcontaining mouthwashes I dont believe so We dont know the exact carcinogenic agent Theres still debate about the exact carcinogenic agents in tobacco and alcohol as well Tobacco has about  known carcinogens Its probably a combined effect Betel nut chewing requires a lot of spitting The social acceptance of spitting in the United States is not the same as in other countries That may be a limiting factor The earlier it presents the easier it is to treat More advanced tumors are difficult to treat but we certainly still have the ability to cure them So the key for oral cancer is early detection A good dentist should perform an oral cancer screen Oral cancer is a surface cancer Early tumors often wont show up on any imaging study and are best identified by clinical exam
