Answering the question of whether diet soda helps or hinders dieters efforts to lose weight has been the focus of much research And buzz Unfortunately the answer is still murky On one hand as weve reported   suggest that some diet soda drinkers efforts to lose weight are stymied when they compensate for the zerocalorie beverages by eating more food Call it the Diet Coke and french fry conundrum Or perhaps artificial sweeteners mess up our metabolisms as some have   But theres also research showing that when people   for zerocalorie options they lose weight And when people combine a diet drink habit with an overall healthful pattern of eating the combination seems to work to lower the risk of metabolic syndrome according to   Now a   funded by the American Beverage Association suggests that diet drinks might be more effective than water alone in helping dieters shed pounds We had to ask Really The study published Tuesday in the journal   included about  overweight participants all of whom were enrolled in a weight loss and exercise program As part of the intervention each participant was randomly assigned to one of two groups One group was told to avoid all diet drinks and drink mostly water The other group was told to consume a combination of zerocalorie drinks for example diet soda or artificially sweetened teas and water At the end of three months the participants in the dietdrink group had lost about  pounds on average That was  pounds more than the average of  pounds lost by those in the water group We were kind of surprised by the findings that showed that diet beverages actually did a little better than water in the outcome   one of the study authors tells The Salt Hes the chief strategy officer of the University of Colorados Anschutz Health and Wellness Center So what explains the findings How could diet drinks potentially lead to more weight loss We did see that people in the dietsoda wing of the study reported less hunger during the trial than those in the water group says Peters But he emphasizes that this is just speculation We cant determine mechanism from this trial That speculation doesnt fly with some experts who question using diet soda as a tool to curb appetites Studies suggest that consumption of diet soda makes people continue to crave sugar thereby making it harder to quit says   a professor of health policy at the University of California San Francisco Peters tells me hes aware that people are questioning the results And hes surprised by that reaction to the study so far Im kind of amazed how much people are trying to find a reason   to believe these findings Its possible that many people are still leery about the safety of artificial sweeteners such as aspartame despite years of studies aimed at establishing safety Theres always some lingering question Are these good for you or not Peters says Or it could be that once people hear about the industry link theyre just dismissive of the findings But Peters says he and his colleagues carried out the study completely independently at their academic research sites We responded to a request for proposal that was put out by the ABA to the scientific community to study the effects of diet drinks he says But Peters explains he and the other researchers made an agreement with the industry group in advance that whatever the findings  positive or negative  the results would be submitted for publication As industry funding of nutrition research has become more commonplace there are protocols in place to keep separation between funders and scientists But a    in   found that industry funding increases the odds of results favoring the industrys position Beyond the studys ties to the diet soda industry other researchers say the new research doesnt provide any closure to the murky science of diet sodas This paper is fatally flawed and leaves us with little science to build on Purdue University researcher   tells us She points out that the paper does not include detailed information about what participants consumed in lieu of diet soda beyond the water they were told to drink So its hard to know how many calories they consumed from other beverages Did they switch to regular sodas Did they add sugar instead of artificial sweeteners to their coffee or tea Swithers wonders All in all this paper tells us nothing about the longterm health consequences that should be our real focus Swithers concludes
