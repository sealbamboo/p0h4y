Drug resistant infections will kill an extra  million people a year worldwide  more than currently die from cancer  by  unless action is taken a study says  They are currently implicated in  deaths each year   said the costs would spiral to tn tn He was appointed by Prime Minister David Cameron in July to head a review of antimicrobial resistance Mr ONeill told the BBC To put that in context the annual GDP gross domestic product of the UK is about tn so this would be the equivalent of around  years without the UK contribution to the global economy The reduction in population and the impact on illhealth would reduce world economic output by between  and  The analysis was based on scenarios modelled by researchers Rand Europe and auditors KPMG    They found that drug resistant E coli malaria and tuberculosis TB would have the biggest impact In Europe and the United States antimicrobial resistance causes at least  deaths each year they said And left unchecked deaths would rise more than fold by  Mr ONeill is best known for his economic analysis of developing nations and their growing importance in global trade    He coined the acronyms Bric Brazil Russia India and China and more recently Mint Mexico Indonesia Nigeria and Turkey He said the impact of the would be mostly keenly felt in these countries  In Nigeria by  more than one in four deaths would be attributable to drug resistant infections while India would see an additional two million lives lost every year The review team believes its analysis represents a significant underestimate of the potential impact of failing to tackle drug resistance as it did not include the effects on healthcare of a world in which antibiotics no longer worked  Joint replacements Caesarean sections chemotherapy and transplant surgery are among many treatments that depend on antibiotics being available to prevent infections The review team estimates that Caesarean sections currently contribute  to world GDP joint replacements  cancer drugs  and organ transplants    This is based on the number of lives saved and illhealth prevented in people of working age   Without effective antibiotics these procedures would become much riskier and in many cases impossible The review team concludes that this would cost a further tn by  Mr ONeill said his team would now be exploring what action could be taken to avert this looming crisis This would include looking at Mr ONeill said the support of the Bric and Mint nations was vital He noted that China would be hosting the G summit in  and said he hoped this issue would be a focus of discussion He said scientists seemed more certain that drug resistance would be a major problem in the short term than they were over climate change Dr Jeremy Farrar the director the Wellcome Trust said By highlighting the vast financial and human costs that unchecked drug resistance will have this important research underlines that this is not just a medical problem but an economic and social one too Prof Dame Sally Davies chief medical officer for England said This is a compelling piece of work which takes us a step forward in understanding the true gravity of the threat The review team concludes that solving the problem of drug resistance will be far cheaper than doing nothing and there was cause for optimism that the right steps could be taken    This included university researchers and biotech entrepreneurs teeming with ideas including new drugs vaccines and alternative therapies such as antibodies     Laura Piddock professor of microbiology at the University of Birmingham is focusing her research on bacteria such as E coli and salmonella which are responsible for a growing level of drug resistant infections Both are socalled gramnegative bacteria which have a complex cell wall that acts as a barrier to drugs  If they do penetrate the wall they are vacuumed out by the cell She said My team is looking at what are the switches in those bacteria which turn that vacuum cleaner off and at molecules which would have the same effect  If we can do that we can make the bacteria sensitive to antibiotics Prof Piddock said there had not been enough global investment in finding new drugs She said It is very difficult to find drugs against bacteria like Ecoli because they are so naturally resistant   We need more investment and new business models to ensure the pipeline is filled with promising molecules to ensure that we can solve this problem and make sure the drugs are there when patients need them
