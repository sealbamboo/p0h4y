Many forces can drive a male college student to commit sexual assault But one of the most important may be the company he keeps A number of   on college campuses and elsewhere have shown that having friends who support violence against women is a big risk factor for committing sexual assault Now prevention efforts are exploring the idea that having male friends who object to violence against women can be a powerful antidote to rape on college campuses One of the things that matters most to boys and emerging adult men is the opinion of other men says   a researcher at Oklahoma State University who studies rape prevention among young men One of the most wellknown studies on perpetrators of campus sexual assault is psychologist    undetected rapists   Because few campus rapes are ever reported much less prosecuted Lisak looked for sex offenders hiding in plain sight at   He surveyed about  men asking them a wide range of questions about their sexual experiences To learn about sexual assault he asked things like Have you ever had sex with an adult when they didnt want to because you used physical force When the results came back he was stunned All told  men in the sample or about  percent of the total had raped women they knew Twothirds of those men were serial rapists who had done this on average six times Many of the serial rapists began offending before college back in high school Other   at colleges and in the military have since found similar numbers  usually somewhere around  percent of men admitting to either an attempted rape or a rape with a significant proportion of them reporting a history of repeated offenses I was forced really to accept that these are college students but there is this small percentage of college students who are sex offenders says Lisak They are behaving like sex offenders They are sex offenders Together the  men in Lisaks study were responsible for  rapes None was ever reported But Lisak had no problem getting details about how the men carefully planned and executed their assaults Theyd often ask a girl to come to a party saying it was inviteonly a big deal to a nervous freshman Then theyd get her drunk to the point of incapacitation so they could have sex with her In an excerpt from one of Lisaks interview transcripts a college student using the pseudonym Frank talks about how his friends would help him prep for an assault Alcohol was the weapon of choice for these men who typically saw themselves as college guys hooking up They didnt think what they had done was a crime Most of these men have an image or a myth about rape that its some guy in a ski mask wielding a knife says Lisak They dont wear ski masks they dont wield knives so they dont see themselves as rapists In fact theyd brag about what they had done afterwards to their friends That implied endorsement from male friends  or at the very least a lack of vocal objection  is a powerful force perpetuating the idea that what these guys are doing is normal rather than criminal But in a group of guy friends Oklahoma States Foubert says the opinions that can end up influencing behavior are often just what a guy   his friends think Lets say you have a peer group of  guys says Foubert One or two are constantly talking about Oh I bagged this b  h Many of the men listening to that are uncomfortable but they think that the other men support it through their silence What if that silence could be broken before college  as early as high school At a few high schools in   students are starting to find out what that might look like MVP or   matches upperclassmen with groups of incoming freshmen Throughout the school year the older kids facilitate discussions about relationships drinking sexual assault and rape Xavier Scarlett a rising senior and captain of the football basketball and track teams says he tries to get inside the heads of the freshmen guys he mentors They talk through various scenarios What does it mean to hook up with a drunk girl when youre sober Would you be letting down your guy friends if you didnt hook up in that situation And they spend a lot of time on that scenario Lisak heard about over and over in his  Youre at a big party You see a guy you know with an extremely drunk girl and hes trying to leave with her Scarlett says he talks through all the options with the freshmen in his group Do I let them just leave Or do I grab him or do I grab her Or do I get some friends If I say something then will my friend judge me These conversations are tough often awkward in high school A lot of the mentors still havent confronted this kind of situation in real life by the time they graduate But once they get to college says Iowa State University junior Tucker Carrell a former MVP mentor the scenarios come to life Tucker says that hes not afraid to confront his Delta Tau Delta fraternity brothers when they talk about women in a way that makes him uncomfortable Hell sit down with them sometimes even bringing a woman theyve hit on into the conversation The day we talked Tucker said hed used his MVP training to intervene in a situation just the night before This was at a goingaway party at a bar in Ames Iowa Tucker noticed that a friends female cousin was pretty drunk She was over by the jukebox with two guys who werent part of the party They were strangers Tucker says he was paying attention to her body language and something didnt look right She looked almost cornered So Tucker grabbed a buddy and they went over to the jukebox together We were like Hey lets pick a song So we picked a song And then we were like Do you want to go to the table and see your cousin  They steered her back toward their group of friends And that was it The night went on as if nothing had happened Lisak says by the time yearolds leave for college they need to be hearing this kind of challenge from their guy friends This idea that getting somebody intoxicated plastered so that you can have sex with them is an idea we just simply are going to have to confront and erode he says Just like we have eroded the idea that its fine to get drunk and get in your car There are only a few dozen high schools around the country that offer the MVP program Its been used in high schools around Sioux City Iowa for over a decade now Surveys of participating students suggest their attitudes about sexual assault and intervening in dangerous situations shift after they go through the program but researchers have yet to evaluate how effective it is in reducing incidents of sexual violence John Foubert the psychologist in Oklahoma says its important to remember that  percent of men have never committed a rape The key is opening their eyes to whats going on with the other  percent so they can see it and intervene
