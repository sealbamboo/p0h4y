 Adults who have atrial fibrillation, a common form of irregular heartbeat, and chronic kidney disease could have a higher risk of end-stage renal disease — complete failure of the kidneys. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, have discovered this link, which could lead to new treatment options for people with chronic kidney disease.. The combination of . . In the short-term, people living with both conditions are at .  than people without these conditions.. The study, . , monitored 206,229 adults with chronic kidney disease for five years. Approximately 16,400 of these patients was eventually diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. The afib patients were 67 percent more likely to experience complete kidney failure than patients who did not develop an irregular heartbeat.. "These novel findings expand on previous knowledge by highlighting that atrial fibrillation is linked to a worse kidney prognosis in patients with underlying kidney dysfunction," said kidney specialist Nisha Bansal, MD, an assistant professor in the Division of Nephrology at UCSF on the university's web site.. Doctors are interested in understanding the factors that place patients at greater risk for end-stage renal disease, Dr. Bansal said, because it may be possible to address those factors through medications or lifestyle changes like diet or exercise.. While the short-term complications of the two co-existing diseases have been known, researchers and doctors had not been able to determine the long-term effects of having both. Bansal and her team now believe they have closed that gap. This research could provide doctors with information they need to protect their patients from the long-term effects of an irregular heartbeat combined with chronic kidney disease.
