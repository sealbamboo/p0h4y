We already know how to do it  now we need to act on what we know Whether its by investing resources using proven strategies or coordinating with health care systems we have within our communities the strengths to help people live long and healthy lives Even identifying and focusing on just one issue that can be addressed in each community will make a difference The greatest impact comes when we make the default choice the healthy choice  for example making hearthealthy actions part of the normal course of everyday life  We can make it easier for people to be physically active avoid tobacco and have access to affordable healthy food  We can make it easier for people to get recommended clinical preventive services such as blood pressure management and cancer screening and to have access to good quality health care when its needed And we can make it so that our children are likely to reach adulthood without being addicted to nicotine or facing a potentially lifelong struggle with obesity Here are some examples of communities making a difference   In San Francisco  children have access to safe recreational space because public school playgrounds are now open during nonschool hours  Nearly  residents of Broward County Florida can increase their level of physical activity because their community is improving the safety and accessibility of walking riding bikes and using public transportation These are just two examples of success stories large and small that make the healthy choice easy     The   launched by the Department of Health and Human Services in  brings together communities health systems nonprofit organizations federal agencies and privatesector partners to prevent heart attacks and strokes Americans suffer  million heart attacks and strokes each year which cause one in every three deaths and add more than  billion to our annual health care bill  Million Hearts will reduce these human and economic costs by improving care for high blood pressure and high cholesterol helping patients quit smoking and increasing use of aspirin for those who will benefit from it   Tobacco remains the leading preventable cause of death in this country and in the world Tobacco use is a major factor in four out of the five leading causes of death heart disease cancer lung disease and stroke It causes about a third of heart disease and cancer and most emphysema Getting the last  of Americans who still smoke to quit will make a huge difference in the length and quality of their lives  Most people in this country who smoke started as kids most who have ever smoked have already quit and most current smokers want to quit  We can prevent children from starting to smoke help motivate smokers to quit and protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke by working at federal state and local levels to eliminate loopholes in restrictions on tobacco marketing pricing and products and by expanding smokefree regulations that cover all public places and workplaces without exception   This kind of change requires political will especially when faced with vocal and wellorganized opponents funded by the tobacco industry  Weve learned from health systems around the country that big improvements can come from simple measures that focus clinical attention These include effective use of electronic health records to identify and track the progress of patients who need support teambased care and the use of protocols and prompt data feedback Change is never easy But each year we dont act adds tens of thousands of preventable deaths to the toll We owe it to the American people to do better
