Health authorities in the US are taking fresh aim at a silent killer with a recommendation that all American adults be screened for high blood pressure People should be screened once a year if they are at least  years old if they are overweight or obese if they are African American or if their blood pressure is in the high normal range according to a   released Monday by the US Preventive Services Task Force Adults ages  to  who have no risk factors for high blood pressure should be screened once every three to five years the panel said In one of the studies cited by the task force senior citizens in Ontario Canada who were randomly assigned to have their blood pressure screened by a pharmacy were less likely than their unscreened counterparts to wind up in a hospital for treatment of a cardiovascular condition For every  people who were screened there were three fewer hospital admissions researchers found An estimated  million people in the US have high blood pressure  thats about   But only  of them are controlling their blood pressure with medication according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention High blood pressure or hypertension is much more prevalent in African Americans  than in whites  Latinos  or Asian Americans  People with the condition are at increased risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke both leading causes of death in the US They are also more vulnerable to kidney and heart failure The task force said hypertension caused or contributed to the deaths of at least  Americans in  But many people with high blood pressure arent even aware that they have it In most cases there are no symptoms though in rare cases it can cause headaches or vomiting the CDC says Thats why hypertension is widely known as the silent killer There are two components of a blood pressure reading The systolic number or top number measures the pressure inside the arteries when the heart muscle contracts the diastolic number on the bottom measures the pressure in the arteries when the muscle is resting between heartbeats The task force defined normal blood pressure as anything up to  mm Hg although the   and the   use a cutoff of  mm Hg People in the range of  to  mm HG systolic and  to  mm Hg diastolic were defined as having high normal blood pressure and those exceeding  mm HG were considered hypertensive In February another panel called the Eighth Joint National Committee on Prevention Detection Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure concluded that the   for adults ages  and older should be  mm Hg as long as they didnt have diabetes or chronic kidney disease The task force has endorsed blood pressure screening since  but the new recommendations state that a test in a medical office is only the first step Studies have found that  to  of the people who get high blood pressure readings in a doctors office turn out not to have high blood pressure when monitored over subsequent days Some of this is due to a phenomenon known as white coat syndrome in which simply being in a doctors office causes ones blood pressure to rise This affects an estimated  to  of Americans the task force says The best way to confirm an initial diagnosis of hypertension is for patients to wear an ambulatory blood pressure monitor for  to  hours These monitors automatically take measurements every  to  minutes as people go about their daily routines and while theyre sleeping and they provide the best method for confirming elevated office blood pressure measurements the task force said Other home blood pressure monitors may be acceptable the task force added though the evidence of their efficacy is less convincing The downsides associated with blood pressure screening are relatively minor and shortterm in nature such as the sleep disturbances discomfort and restrictions in daily activities while wearing an ambulatory monitor the task force said However if patients dont use the monitors to confirm their inoffice measurements they could suffer more serious harms of unnecessary drug treatment People diagnosed with high blood pressure can usually keep it under control through medication The firstline drugs include calcium channel blockers which relax the blood vessels and the diuretic thiazide For patients who arent African American the list of initial drugs also includes angiotensinconverting enzyme ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs although people with chronic kidney disease shouldnt take both at the same time The task forces recommendation is   which means the panel believes there is high certainty that the benefits outweigh the risks The task force will accept public comments on its proposal until Jan
