Some influenza-vaccine makers have delayed shipments to U.S. doctors and pharmacies because of production problems, forcing health-care providers to put off vaccinations as flu season gets under way.. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there have been delays in shipments—from big manufacturers, including GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Sanofi SA—that were originally anticipated for August and September. The delayed vaccines included some that were approved specifically for children.
