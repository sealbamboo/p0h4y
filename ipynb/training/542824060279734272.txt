A m online patientrecord system has been fraught with problems and medics concerns seemingly overlooked senior hospital consultants have claimed A letter seen by the BBC reveals management at Addenbrookes and Rosie hospitals in Cambridge were told of serious issues last month It came after the hospitals   The trust said unanticipated issues led to more than teething problems The hospital is the first in the UK to use Epics eHospital system which is used in hospitals in the US The system went live on  October and is intended to allow medical staff to access patient records on handheld devices instead of waiting for notes A month later   found a  drop in AE performance It also found problems with some test results and and issues with pathology services Chief executive Dr Keith McNeil admitted there had been more than teething problems and some of it was anticipated and some of it was unanticipated The unanticipated problems included problems with blood tests and one of the busiest periods in the hospitals history he said He added Were profoundly sorry about that people will understand that you cant do an information technology implementation of this size without some hiccups I think that claims patient safety was in danger was probably overdramatising The BBC has found many of the concerns were highlighted by the Consultant Staff Council in a letter to Dr McNeil and chair of Cambridge University Hospitals Trust Jane Ramsey on  November  In his letter Dr Sam Bass chair of the council and assistant coroner acknowledged the new system had many good points but said serious concerns expressed by fellow consultants have been seemingly overlooked The introduction had been fraught with problems he said Dr Bass highlighted issues with blood transfusion and pathology services and asked if the risk of the potential harm to patients had been discussed The council felt the hospital was less safe than before the introduction of Epic There have been issues with the introduction of this system and it appears that the trust have been less than candid about the problems faced Dr Bass asked for a full account after the external review of the system and called for improved communication In his reply dated  November Dr McNeil acknowledged there had been some significant issues with the system He apologised for disruption and added Meetings have been held with the CQC Care Quality Commission Monitor and HM Coroner to make them aware of the issues associated with the golive process  We recognise our duty of candour and have provided regular updates to these bodies and will continue to do so on a weekly basis Dr McNeil said the trust planned to bring in extra technical staff and American clinicians with experience of using eHospital as well as more nurses to help us cope with the demand for services An external review into the system is expected to be completed in midDecember
