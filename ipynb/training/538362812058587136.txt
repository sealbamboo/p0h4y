At Bradford Royal Infirmarys AE department their usual  to  patients make a busy day Several times this month however more than  patients have turned up in  hours placing even greater strain on the hospitals staff beds and ability to cope Last Saturday they saw  That staff say is when busy becomes superbusy But the way the numbers are creeping up with more than  patients becoming a more frequent occurrence superbusy could easily become their new norm especially with winter just around the corner This rising demand is not unique to Bradford says Helen Barker the hospitals chief operating officer Everybodys finding it really difficult to deliver on the  target the NHSwide duty to treat  of AE patients within four hours of their arrival We are all seeing continued high attendances and a significantly high level of admissions too Those extra  or so patients make it very hard to ensure there are enough beds available for all who need them Usually the difficulties between November and March are followed by an easier spring and summer But not any more Weve not seen any reduction in patients arriving at AE all year really so winter just feels like a month phenomenon Weve not seen any letup this year at all Barker adds The numbers arriving at the hospital went up last winter from over  to more like  a day and stayed up Why is this happening She refers to the acuity of patients  medicospeak for how ill people are Put simply more patients are more unwell than before Theres an evergrowing demand from elderly patients But we also have a lot of patients aged  to  who have breathing conditions chest pains heart problems illnesses linked to their diet such as obesity which is causing diabetes which leads to vascular disease and includes those whose illness has been triggered by drinking too much such as liver disease or malnutrition she adds Bradford is managing this better than most Major efforts to hire extra staff and use of virtual wards in which patients deemed well enough remain at home are cared for by visits from health professionals rather than in hospital all the time mean the   trust is coping  at the moment  with the increased pressures Elsewhere in the NHS though AE performance is so bad in a growing number of places that there is increasing fear of the kind of fullblown winter crisis not seen for many years There is also acute concern inside the government that if the service visibly struggles to cope it may pay a heavy political price at Mays general election Official NHS statistics underline why there is a growing belief that AE is heading slowly inexorably towards a midwinter meltdown Hospitalbased AE units in England as a whole have missed the  target for the last  weeks running Despite mild lateautumn weather performance in recent weeks has been worse than in the depths of last winter Last week  AEs did not manage to treat  of patients within four hours up from nine the week before The worst performer University Hospitals of North Midlands which runs hospitals in Stoke and Stafford managed just  On  and  October  patients at the trust had to wait on a trolley for more than  hours for a bed  something that should never happen  because of very high levels of bed occupancy Other AE warning signs include the fact that last week also saw the highest number of patients ever admitted for treatment in England  The same week also saw the largest number of patients forced to wait more than four hours for treatment  which is just under twice as many as in the same week last year  And the number of patients waiting on a trolley for between four and  hours has more than doubled  last week compared with  in the same week in  Growing numbers of hospitals are pleading with patients not to add to the pressure by turning up with minor problems and to get help from their GP or a pharmacist out of hours doctor or walkin centre instead When Rotherham hospital did so two weeks ago it explained it was currently under extreme pressure with a high volume of patients attending AE On Monday Morriston hospital in Swansea became so busy that at one point  ambulances each containing a patient were forced to wait for up to three hours outside the AE unit because there were too few beds available This is the hospital where pensioner Sonia Powell died in the back of an ambulance in September when she too could not get inside Doctors leaders in Wales are warning that emergency departments will be under severe pressure this winter because of an ongoing rise in the number of frail elderly people needing care and a lack of beds On  November Colchester hospital in Essex declared a major incident when inspectors from the Care Quality Commission found a host of concerns in its AE unit and emergency assessment unit especially staffing The hospital admits that its staff were overstretched and could not cope with the level of demand If you look at where AE performance in November was back in  and  we are probably already in a winter crisis says Richard Murray the director of policy at the Kings Fund thinktank Performance against the fourhour target has already dipped well below where youd expect it to be with some hospitals failing to meet it and some missing the target by a long way However performance isnt so bad that theres a political crisis yet about hospitals not reaching the target The winter crisis the politicians and people in the NHS really fear is when ambulances are redirected because hospitals cant find a bed for the patients because theyve run out of beds and so cant admit them and large numbers of patients are waiting on trolleys adds Murray Thats what used to happen pretty much every winter and what might happen again this year he said Whats different now to previous years is that people arent confident the NHS would get through a very cold winter or a flu epidemic or a lot of people getting norovirus a respiratory bug or the gastrointestinal bugs that close a lot of beds says Murray who was until recently NHS Englands chief analyst AE performance is bad already despite ministers putting a lot of extra winter funding into the NHS and despite all the usual risks  flu norovirus and really cold weather  not being there Dr Cliff Mann the president of the College of Emergency Medicine points out that  of the AE doctors his organisation represents have relocated to Australia As a result the NHS has lost the capacity to see  patients a year at the same time as attendances have risen to m a year Will there be a winter crisis The perfect storm of increased demand in patient numbers and reduced capacity via lost doctors means that performance is already less than this time last year says Mann When any system that cannot control demand is put under huge pressure the first consequence is a reduction in quality and the next stage is a reduction in safety Flu has not emerged as a problem yet but norovirus is looking ominous Public   England says that so far this winter outbreaks of the winter vomiting bug have led to a hospital ward or bay being closed  times more than double the number  in the same period last year An outbreak earlier this month forced Royal Stoke hospital to seal off three wards with  beds for two weeks That caused capacity problems even for a hospital boasting  beds We are expecting the pressures to keep on building this winter says Mann Last year we were very fortunate that we had no flu and very little norovirus But the number of hospitals already having to close wards because of norovirus with the huge knockon effect that has on emergency departments and the bed shortages that affect all hospitals at some point in the week and some hospitals every day mean this winter is going to be more challenging than the last one Barker fears that much of the extra m the health secretary has given the NHS to help cope with winter will go on expensive agency staff to plug the gaps in rotas that affect almost every AE unit Nursing agencies are offering nurses  for a weekend shift plus travel and accommodation It just makes my blood boil Its the equivalent of paying for four nurses but only getting one she says One senior NHS figure says the m was panic money To Murray it shows that ministers are anxious about what winter might do to the NHS If I was Jeremy Hunt or David Cameron Id be very worried that a fullblown oldfashioned winter crisis is a real risk he says  The headline on this article was amended on  November  An earlier version said More patients fewer doctors To clarify while as the article says  AE doctors have relocated to Australia reducing the capacity of the NHS the Department of Health says there are over  more doctors now working in the NHS than in May  including  more doctors working in AE
