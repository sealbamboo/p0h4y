NHS spending on agency nurses has soared in the past two years says the Royal College of Nursing RCN Its head said a payday loans attitude to workforce planning had emerged The trade union said the figure had risen from m in  to m last year in  trusts in England The Department of Health said agency workers had been used to correct historic understaffing  but it wanted to reduce reliance on these staff in the longer term The RCN received responses from  of acute community mental health and specialist NHS trusts in England to a request about spending on agency nurses under the Freedom of Information Act It said the figure for those  trusts could reach m by April based on data from the first two quarters of this financial year  The union estimates the overall bill could soon reach m a year if it goes on rising at a similar rate It found half of the trusts who responded were spending double on agency nurses last summer than they were two years earlier And only  of the trusts were spending less on agency nurses than in  Dr Peter Carter Chief Executive  General Secretary of the RCN said This report shows the true financial cost of a health service which takes a payday loans attitude towards workforce planning What it doesnt show is the cost to patients Overreliance on agency staff is bad for continuity of care and that is bad for patients  The NHS is under immense pressure and it is now time for serious workforce investment and sensible longterm workforce planning The RCN believes the rise in agency spending is partly due to trusts increasing staffing levels in the wake of winter pressures and the Francis report into the Mid Staffs scandal It says there are supply pressures too with NHS pay restraint making recruitment and retention more difficult and leading more nurses into agency work  Under Health Education Englands latest workforce plan the number of nurses in training is increasing by  during this decade A Department of Health spokesperson said Patient safety is top of our agenda and so in the wake of Mid Staffs agency workers have been used to correct historic understaffing Since May  we already have nearly  more nurses on our wards  We want to reduce reliance on agency staff in the longer term and we committed in the recent pay deal to work with the unions to bring the bill down Earlier this week the Commons Public Accounts Committee warned about the rising cost of temporary medical staff Its report recommended that the Department of Health make better use of the NHS position as the dominant employer  Labour has pledged to train  more nurses across the next Parliament  The shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said Nurses whove had a pay freeze for years will find it galling that the agency bill is going through the roof  The overreliance on agency staff is not just wasteful of NHS finances but it can also damage staff morale and result in poorer patient care
