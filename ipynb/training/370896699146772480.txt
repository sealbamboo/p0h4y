When doctors told Pete and Michelle Gallagher that they wanted to remove half of their yearold sons brain the Attica Ohio parents were horrified But a new study shows the extreme procedure may offer some kids their best shot at a normal life We panicked said Pete Gallagher recalling their reaction seven years ago The couple also knew that the dramatic surgery known as a hemispherectomy might be the only workable option to stop the severe seizures more than a dozen a day that were robbing Aiden of his ability to function  and to learn  He had forgotten his alphabet He had forgotten how to count It was all slipping the father said  Today Aiden is a healthy redhaired fifthgrader who goes to regular school and loves to play baseball and basketball He hasnt had a seizure since the rare operation making the boy a poster child for new research that finds the procedure offers realworld success for children suffering from devastating epilepsy  The brain has an amazing capacity to work around the function that it has lost said Dr Ajay Gupta head of pediatric epilepsy at the Cleveland Clinic  In the first largescale study to look at the everyday capabilities of kids who undergo hemispherectomy Gupta and his colleagues reviewed  operations performed at their center between  and  and took a close look at  patients They confirmed what doctors knew but had little practical data to support That removing the diseased hemisphere of a seizureprone brain allows sufferers to learn and grow and in some cases lead normal lives It answers the questions that parents have Would he be able to talk would he be able to see would he be able to read Gupta told NBC News Only a tiny fraction of the  million Americans who have epilepsy are eligible for hemispherectomy which involves either total removal of half of the brain or removing part and disconnecting the links between the two halves Though no one keeps track of how many times this surgery is performed Gupta figures his highvolume center does  or  procedures a year Theyre typically used when antiseizure medications no longer quiet the electrical storms that ravage the brain  Aiden suffered his first seizure at  months Doctors controlled them with drugs until he was  when the medications stopped working and he was seizing virtually around the clock Surgery quickly became the only option They removed almost all of the right side of his brain Pete Gallagher said  The new study published Friday in the journal Epilepsia reviewed records of Aiden and other Cleveland Clinic patients ages  to  mostly children who developed epilepsy before the age of  Threequarters of the patients had daily seizures and another  percent had seizures every week the study found  After the surgery more than half of patients   percent  were seizurefree Another  percent still had seizures but about  percent of them saw a more than  percent reduction in their frequency  Researchers found that  percent of patients were able to walk independently and  percent had satisfactory speaking skills Nearly  percent of kids were able to participate in mainstream schools with assistance and  percent of children older than  had satisfactory reading skills Five of the  adults who had surgery were holding down jobs  Those might sound like mixed results to some but not to Dr Gary Mathern a professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles  Given that if you had not done the intervention most of these kids would be so severely disabled the results are actually pretty positive said Mathern a surgeon whose nationally renowned hemispherectomy program competes with the Cleveland Clinics He was a reviewer on the paper and is now a coeditor of the journal  Without surgery a child with severe epileptic seizures might have an IQ of  With surgery that might jump to  Mathern said The findings in the new study are not surprising but they do serve a valuable purpose especially for parents weighing the risks and benefits of the surgery  It gives them a range of expectations Mathern said  Still few parents reject the surgery that can stop seizures  and the dependence on antiseizure drugs which have their own debilitating effects  In Aidens case his improvement began the minute he woke from the operation and reached for his dad with his formerly useless left hand his dad said A week later he was running at a local playground  I didnt think the recovery would be anywhere near the point that it is Pete Gallagher said  The success of Aidens surgery and the return of calm to family life led the parents to have another child Evann now  They say theyre grateful that both boys can work and play together  Aidens kind of our hero because of all the crap hes been through Gallagher said I think there are absolutely no limitations for him Just when we think there might be something he cant do he does it
