Scientists have uncovered  previously unknown genes which may put people at risk of developing schizophrenia research in Nature suggests The team says the worlds largest genetic study of the disease shows it can have biological causes  putting it on a par with other medical conditions Led by Cardiff University the international group believes this could be a launch pad for new therapies Charities say that holistic approaches to the illness must continue Scientists have debated the relative role genes play in schizophrenia  a condition which affects more than  million people worldwide  for many years  Now a global consortium across  countries has examined the genetic makeup of more than  people with the condition comparing them with some  people without the disease  Scientists found more than  genes that make people more susceptible to schizophrenia  of which have never been pinpointed before Many of these genes are involved in the relay of chemical messages around the brain  And others are known to be involved in the immune system  affecting the bodys natural armoury against disease Prof Michael ODonovan of Cardiff University who led the research said For many years it has been difficult to develop new lines of treatment for schizophrenia hampered by a poor understanding of the biology of disease Finding a whole new bunch of genetic associations opens a window for wellinformed experiments to unlock the biology of this condition and we hope ultimately new treatments Prof David Curtis of University College London and one of the authors of the research told the BBC This study puts psychiatry into the same category as other parts of medicine In the past we have struggled with the view that psychiatric conditions are not real illnesses but early genetic studies had limited successes  Now we show with confidence that there are biological processes going awry  Dr Gerome Breen of Kings College London who was not involved in the current research but will be working on future studies told the BBC I think this is revolutionary  We now have a massive amount of new biology to investigate  a whole new set of ideas which could provide many potential avenues for treatment This is crucial Drug therapy for schizophrenia has not changed significantly since the s Beth Murphy at the charity Mind saidTodays research provides an interesting and promising step in the search for more suitable treatment options than are currently available But it is vital that health professionals recognise the need for a holistic approach in treating those who are experiencing schizophrenia and bipolar disorder right now
