 Only two out of five US children in elementary school met both the physical activity and screentime recommendations from the federal government and the American Academy of Pediatrics researchers found Although  percent of children were getting at least  minutes of moderatetovigorous exercise each day and  percent were sitting in front of a screen for no more than  hours a day only  percent met both criteria according to Tala Fakhouri PhD MPH of the CDCs National Center for Health Statistics in Hyattsville Md and colleagues Remaining consistent with one recommendation did not necessarily predict meeting the other recommendation the researchers reported online in   These findings support the distinct recommendations for screentime viewing and physical activity by the American Academy of Pediatrics and may inform interventions designed to prevent childhood obesity such as the First Lady Michelle Obamas program to end childhood obesity within a generation ie the Lets Move initiative the authors wrote Fakhouri and colleagues examined crosssectional data on  children ages  to  from the  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES A proxy usually a parent reported how much each child exercised and how much time each child spent watching television playing video games or using a computer They also looked at demographic information including an income measurement called the family income to poverty level ratio FIPR There were fewer demographic differences in the likelihood of meeting the screentime recommendation Older children nonHispanic blacks and obese children were less likely to have  or fewer hours of screentime each day compared with their respective comparators Hispanics who were less likely than nonHispanic whites to meet the physical activity recommendation were more likely to meet the screentime recommendation which suggests that screentime viewing and physical activity may be separate constructs and that low levels of screentime viewing do not necessarily predict higher levels of physical activity Indeed the odds of meeting the physical activity recommendation did not differ between the children who did or did not meet the screentime recommendation There were even fewer demographic differences in the likelihood of meeting both recommendations at the same time which was significantly lower only in the children who were older and obese One issue with the findings pointed out by the researchers is that in the  NHANES physical activity was measured only through proxy report which is subject to social desirability bias and can be influenced by the amount of time the parent spends with the child Although activity can be objectively measured with accelerometers those too have some potential problems involving cutoff values sampling intervals inadequate capture of certain activities and expense Because of these measurement issues Fakhouri and colleagues wrote many researchers and physical activity experts are now advocating for the use of multiple methods to assess physical activity accurately Source
