accumulating that a whole host of other activities can help keep our brains young even as we advance in chronological age There is no one magic activity that you need to take on but trying a handful of the following will help Seniors who danced three to four times a weekespecially those who ballroom dancedhad a  lower risk of dementia compared with people who did not dance at all found a  landmark study in the   Why Dancing is a complex activity says study lead author Joe Verghese MD chief of geriatrics at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City Its   so it improves blood flow to

without dementia and followed them over time Whether its the saxophone the piano or a ukulele researchers found that playing an instrument for  or more years was correlated with   in advanced age compared to those who played music for less than  years or not at all Other research shows that even listening to music can help boost your brainpower A study from theÂ Stanford University School of Medicine found that listening to baroque music Vivaldi Bach leads to changes in the brain that   and storing events into memory Being bilingual may help delay the   Individuals who spoke two languages developed dementia an average of four and a half years later than people who only spoke one language in a  study published in the journal   Other research shows that people who speak more than one language are better at multitasking and paying attention Experts say the earlier you learn the bettergrowing up speaking two languages is optimalbut that its never too late and every little of   helps Playing chess bingo checkers and card games may help   A  French study found a  lower risk of dementia among people who played board games versus those who did not And the effects seemed to last over the studys year followup The idea is that this helps build cognitive reserve says Dr Verghese whose study also found benefits to playing board games like Monopoly The more these activities buffer against the disease you may be able to mask the effects of the disease for longer periods of time It buys you extra time Reading in general is good for the brain But reading fewer books and articles so you can give them each of them more   may be even better Our brain doesnt do very well with too much information The more you download the more it shuts the brain down says Sandra Bond Chapman PhD director of the Center for Brain Health at the University of Texas at Dallas Its better to read one or two good articles and think about them in a deeper sense rather than read  Next time you have to read through some documents for work consider changing the typeface before you print them out Chances are the docs came to you in an easytoread font like Arial or Times New Roman but switching it to something a little less legible like Comic Sans or Bodoni may improve your comprehension and recall of the information according to a small study out of Harvard University Likewise a study at a Ohio high school revealed that students who received handouts with lesslegible type performed better on tests than the students who were given more readable materials Its a version of the nopainnogain phenomenon When you exert more effort your brain rewards you by becoming stronger But make sure you keep things new by changing fonts regularly If you think your   proves youve got a strong brain think again Multitasking hijacks your frontal lobe says Chapman who is also the author of   The frontal lobe regulates decisionmaking problemsolving and other aspects of learning that are critical to maintaining brain health Research has shown that doing one thing at a timenot everything at oncestrengthens higherorder reasoning or the ability to learn understand and apply new information   In one study college students who   for  minutes three days in a row improved their working memories and their grade point averages Students who wrote about neutral events saw no such improvements We hypothesized that   unwanted intrusive thoughts says study coauthor Adriel Boals PhD associate professor of psychology at the University of North Texas in Denton Writing gets rid of intrusive thoughts then working memory increases If somethings bothering you dont bottle it up Activities that put your hands to work like knitting crocheting and gardening are proven   and they may also keep your brain young In a  survey of about  knitters around the world there was a correlation between knitting frequency and cognitive function the more people knitted the better function they had People who feel theyve found their purpose in life have lower rates of   and tend to   Studies also show that this   also benefits the brain In one study those who reported having a strong purpose in life were more than twice as likely to stay Alzheimersfree than people who did not profess a purpose To develop a sense of purpose focus on the positive impact you have at home or at work You could also try volunteering for a cause thats meaningful to you Spending lots of time with friends and family especially as you get older may be one of the best buffers against mental decline In one study people who participated in   more often and who felt that they had ample social support did better on several measures of memory as well as mental processing speed Social engagement is linked with mental agility says Carey Gleason PhD a clinical neuropsychologist at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison Companies like Lumosity charge you a monthly fee for   games but playing puzzle games on your kids Xbox may have the same effectsand depending on what you play may be even more effective In a Florida State University study subjects either played games on Lumositycom or played Portal  a popular actionpuzzle game for computers Playstation and Xbox Those who played Portal  scored better on problem solving spatial skill and persistence tests Other research shows that playing Tetris may increase gray matter in the brain Dont spend an hour doing something that should take you  minutes Conversely dont spend  minutes on something that deserves an hour In other words calibrate your mental energy Decide from the getgo how much mental energy you are going to spend on a task says Chapman Giving your   all the time really degrades resources You need to know when to do something fast and when to do something slow Sure typing is faster but writing longhand may be   Studies have shown that students learn better when they take notes by hand because it forces them to process the information as they take it in The cursive you learned in elementary school may be particularly useful First graders who learned to write in cursive scored higher on reading and spelling than peers who wrote in print Go ahead sneak in a   itll recharge your brain One group of German researchers saw improvements in memory among people who dozed for as little as

with dementia have disturbed sleep but bear in mind that sleeping seven to eight hours a night may   and hopefully healthier It may be easier than you think to get the optimal amount of   According to one study washing the dishes cooking and cleaning can add to our daily activity total and are linked with a reduced risk of dementia In the study people with the least amount of total physical activity were more than twice as likely to develop   compared with people reporting the most activity Even playing cards and moving a wheelchair counted Whether its physical activity or mental activity you need to keep pushing your limits in order to reap the benefits You need to   to the next level so you get the benefits says Verghese Dont be satisfied with finishing Mondays easy
