NHS patients in Wales are being turned down for some specialist treatment without any explanation say patient groups Many of the requests are for the funding of cancer drugs There have been calls for more transparency and discussion when applications are rejected The Welsh government said it believed the system was working well but was reviewing how communication with patients could be improved The concerns raised by patients and bodies representing them  including health watchdogs  focus on what are known as individual patient funding requests IPFR These are applications for treatments and drugs which are not generally available through the NHS That is because the medicines may not have a proven track record or limited success or may be for specialised surgery including plastic reconstructive operations Patients need to know exactly why they havent had their request agreed said Catherine OSullivan the acting director for the board of Community Health Councils in Wales That discussion is extremely hard however I speak to too many people who dont know why Whether or not thats the clinician who is reviewing it with them or describing to them why they have not had their treatment funded or whether or not thats the panel not feeding back to them appropriately  That process needs to be tightened up BBC Wales spoke to one patient yearold David Spink from Tredegar in Blaenau Gwent He was diagnosed with bowel cancer in  which has since progressed But a request by his consultant to be given the specialised drug treatment bevacizumab was rejected by the Aneurin Bevan health board I feel very bitter that I am being denied something that has a probability that it can help me said Mr Spinks When your life is on the line and there is a drug there that can probably prolong your life and you are being refused it how would you feel He said the same drug was widely available in some parts of south Wales without the need to go through a funding application You dont even apply for that drug down in Swansea it is given straight away if you require it he said There are pockets in south Wales where you can get it and places that you cant get it  I see patients in the cancer clinic that are being turned down  people are just devastated Ms OSullivan said she accepted that sometimes the funding was rejected for the best reasons  because the drug was not appropriate or may not enhance quality of life for a patient People will clutch at straws when they find additional treatments and quite rightly she said But you are raising an expectation that the treatment can be offered when perhaps the individual is not at that stage in the disease where it would give them any added benefit or added quality of life or even length of life But she said decisions must be carefully explained  adding it was a hard discussion to have for both clinicians and patients Responding to the issue the Welsh government said it believed the independent funding system was generally working effectively A spokesperson said However the Welsh government is keen to ensure there is equity of access to treatment for all patients and that is why in October the health minister announced a review of certain aspects of the IPFR scheme   Officials started preliminary work on the review earlier this month  A formal review group is being established and will be tasked with considering further improvements in transparency consistency of decision making communication with patients and the public and engagement with the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group   The future structure and operation of IPFR panels will also form part of the process The outcome of the review is due to be submitted to the health minister in early spring next year Aneurin Bevan health board said it would consider any future recommendations made by the Welsh government
