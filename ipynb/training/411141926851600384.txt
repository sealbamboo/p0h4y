Its a population known as the working poor They earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not nearly enough to pay for private health insurance  Smith chose to keep her job and prayed she wouldnt fall ill She worries constantly about her atopic dermatitis a skin condition that can be controlled only with a prescription medication cream she cant afford  I have to pick and choose when I go to the doctor Smith said When I get really really sick I have to go to the emergency room Experts hope Obamacare will change that They estimate that  to  of released US prison inmates will be newly eligible for insurance under the   that covers people who earn up to  of the federal poverty level about  a year for a single person  Twentyfive states and the District of Columbia have chosen to expand their Medicaid programs And all states must now cover behavioral health treatments at the same rate as they cover physical ailments So any inmate who qualifies for Medicaid or Medicare and those who can afford health insurance will be able to get help for substance abuse and mental health problems  That care could be the stay out of jail free card former inmates need experts say Whether the infrastructure is in place to support those dreams is another question  Roughly  million people cycle through US jails every year according to Community Oriented Correctional Health Services a nonprofit dedicated to improving connectivity between health care in and out of the justice system  Most are there for short periods before they are determined to be innocent post bail or are sentenced to probation Only  are sent to prison to serve longer sentences  In other words   return directly to the community from jail along with their often untreated health conditions nonprofit President Steven Rosenberg explained Those who end up in prison often have serious health issues Nearly  percent of inmates have one or more chronic health problems such as high blood pressure diabetes or asthma the  PDF estimated in   Inmates are also three times more likely than the general population to suffer from a serious mental illness and four times more likely to have a substance abuse problem said   senior adviser to the assistant attorney general in the US Department of Justice The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that   have a diagnosable mental health problem compared with about    Most private health insurance companies do not cover the incarcerated Inmates who were covered under Medicaid upon entering prison have their insurance suspended or terminated depending on state law because of Medicaids    But the real problem is not caring for this population inside Solomon said its caring for them when they get out  Until the Affordable Care Act takes effect January  inmates are some of the only people in the United States who are guaranteed access to health care To deprive them of medical care would violate the Eighth Amendment which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment the   on two occasions  A prison that deprives prisoners of basic sustenance including adequate medical care is incompatible with the concept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the more recent   PDF on May    But when they leave prison and most do there are no such protections in place Men and women who may have gotten their addictions under control or found the right medication combination to ease mental health symptoms behind bars are released into the community without a backup plan Rosenberg tells of newly released prisoners who purposefully commit small crimes with the intent of returning to jail to get the surgeries they need for free  Access to health care can make a huge positive difference for this population Solomon said If we deliver the right treatment to the right people at the right time then we can improve public health increase public safety and save taxpayer dollars Advocates working to get former inmates the health care they need in the community have a favorite catchphrase continuity of care The goal is to have an appointment set up with a provider before the inmate is even released said Tom Sullivan Marylands director of inmate health services  The former warden remembers how his calls to community doctors used to go Can you see this patient Hes been incarcerated for  years Hes mentally ill Hes violent And he has no insurance so he isnt going to be able to pay for anything It didnt work out too well Sullivan said with a hint of sarcasm At least today Ive taken one thing off the table  Youll be able to be reimbursed  There arent a lot of data on whether access to health care will lower rates of recidivism or the rates at which offenders return to jail But experts know that treatment of mental illness and substance abuse can   PDF   A study done in the early s called the   PDF found that substance abuse treatment in and out of prison reduced the level of criminal activity among participants by about twothirds Since then many studies have showed that addiction programs whether participation is coerced or voluntary reduce recidivism rates  Washington states Dangerously Mentally Ill Offender program identifies prisoners who pose a threat to public safety and provides them with mental health treatment for up to five years after their release The state program has reduced felony recidivism by  among these former inmates   PDF and has saved taxpayers  for every dollar spent on treatment   The guy who robs banks for a living and sells drugs for a living thats what he does Sullivan said And when he gets back out hes going to do it again But when the mentally ill get out they dont rush back in Judges would avoid sending these lowrisk offenders to jail at all if more treatment options were available said Pam Rodriguez president and CEO of Illinois Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities But state funding for community behavioral programs has long been lacking Rodriguez believes its only a matter of time until other states recognize the benefits of expanding their Medicaid programs  Experts have also expressed concern that the   in the United States will only get worse in coming years due to the influx of newly insured patients And although the   provision of Obamacare provides funding for facilities willing to coordinate primary emergency and behavioral health care for individuals on Medicaid with chronic conditions this kind of seamless communication between treatment providers simply does not currently exist in most cities   We are building the plane as we fly it Rodriguez said simply And if anybody tells you differently they are misdirecting you  The bottom line is that the Affordable Care Act holds a lot of potential said Dr Emily Wang cofounder of the   which encompasses  community health centers caring for recently released prisoners But she cautions that it may not be the cureall some are promising for Americas inmates  Just because everyone is insured doesnt mean you have access to primary care  Just because you have insurance doesnt mean you want to go to a clinic or doctor Wang said It doesnt mean you wont feel discriminated in a health care setting It doesnt mean youll feel safe Former inmates are looking for four specific things when it comes to health care outside prison walls she said access to providers within two weeks of release doctors who know they have been incarcerated so they dont feel they have to hide their past community health workers who can help them navigate the system and a health care facility that has strong partnerships with other organizations in the community that can help them find housing employment and legal services  All are essential to encouraging this population to seek consistent care and stay out of jail Wang said  Mercedes Smith is working to address some of these issues as a policy specialist at   an advocacy group in New York run by formerly incarcerated women  I realized upon being released from prison that we usually cling to people who have been in the same situation as us she said I was lucky to have a great support system  so I made myself out to be that support system for sisters and brothers coming home   Smith plans to apply for Medicaid again under New Yorks expansion Until it goes into effect Smith said she will continue to use home remedies to treat her skin condition and will avoid going to the doctor unless its absolutely necessary  My biggest fear is that when I do get insurance Im going to have something wrong with me she said Its going to be too late
