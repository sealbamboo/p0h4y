                  There is a time of year when suicides are more common says Marcia Valenstein MD research scientist at the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Services Research  Development Service But its not when everyone thinks 
                   
                  Most people think the winter holidays are a risky time but suicides are lowest in December and peak in the spring 
                   
                  Its not clear why but it could be due to changing levels of natural light It could be that they have more energy to attempt suicide says Dr Valenstein who is also an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan Depression Center in Ann Arbor 
                   
                  The   of a persons home the higher the risk of suicide according to a  study Suicide rates are about  higher in regions  meters in elevation for example compared to at sea level

                  Suicide is more common among whites in the US than blacks Asians or Hispanics 
                   
                  No one is quite sure why whites are at a higher risk says Dr Valenstein It might have to do with differences in social support 
                   
                  The group at second highest risk is American IndiansAlaskan Natives who have a suicide rate of  per  compared to  per  for whites and about  per  for other groups

                  Fortunately only  in every  to  attempts actually results in death according to Dr Valenstein 
                   
                  To further lower that rate Dr Valenstein suggests taking away the means

                  While Wednesdays are notorious for being bumpy and Tuesdays in some studies have been found to be the deadliest for suicides Dr Valenstein and her colleagues identified a different weekly peakMonday 
                   
                  A  CDC report found the highest number of suicides occurred on   Dr Valenstein says that while it is not clear from studies so far which day is most common for suicides they do seem to occur near the beginning of the week I would assume that the start of the work week is a more stressful time for people
