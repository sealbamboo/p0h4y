Until his bike slid out of control while he was going  miles an hour downhill around a sharp turn Dr Harold Schwartz thought cycling accidents were something that happened to other people Now after recovering from a fractured pelvis Dr Schwartz  the vice president for behavioral health at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut has changed his mind No one is immune he said in an interview Like many avid cyclists he is convinced that it is not  you crash Its when But Rob Coppolillo  who was an elite level amateur bicycle racer for  years led cycling tours in Italy and regularly rides in his town Boulder Colo begs to differ Hes never had an injury more serious than a little road rash he says For the vast majority of us its a pretty safe sport he said Who is right Although many cyclists have strong opinions on the safety of their sport the answer is that no one really knows how safe it is or whether its safety has changed over the years Its not that there is a lack of data Instead it is that the data are inadequate to answer the questions No one has good statistics for example on crashes per mile ridden Nor do the data distinguish road cycling on a fast light bike with thin tires from mountain biking down dirt paths filled with obstacles or recreational cycling on what the industry calls a comfort bike Yet they are very different sports What remain are often counterintuitive statistics on the waxing and waning of cycling in the United States along with some injury studies that could give cyclists pause For instance although there is a widespread perception that bicycling is becoming more popular data from the   show that the sports peak  as measured by the number of people who say they ride  was in  when it reached  million Americans Last year the number was  million Those data go back to  But the National Bicycle Dealers Association has sales figures that go back decades Consistent with the ridership survey  was a good year with  million adultsize bikes sold Last year that number was  million But the record year never surpassed was  when sales reached  million The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps   resulting from bicycle accidents The yearly death rate has ranged from  to  per  population with no particular pattern in  the agency says there were  bicycle fatalities about onefortieth of all road deaths There is no trend said Linda Degutis the director of the agencys National Center for Injury Prevention and Control who added that bicycling seemed no more dangerous than other sports Dr Rochelle Dicker a trauma surgeon at the University of California San Francisco does not see it that way She cares for victims of the worst bicycle injuries people who might need surgery and often end up in intensive care So she decided to investigate those crashes She and her colleagues reviewed hospital and police records for  bicyclists who had been treated at San Francisco General Hospital She expected that most of these serious injuries would involve cars to her surprise nearly half did not She suspects that many cyclists with severe injuries were swerving to avoid a pedestrian or got their bike wheels caught in lightrail tracks for example Cyclists wounded in crashes that did not involve a car were more than four times as likely to be hurt so badly that they were admitted to the hospital Yet these injuries often did not result in police reports  a frequent source of injury data  and appeared only in the hospital trauma registry Dr Dicker is not a cyclist but she said Lots of my colleagues do not want to ride after seeing these injuries Her study seems to give credence to the not if but when camp or at least justify a fear of bicycle crashes Still if the statistics show cycling to be relatively safe why do so many people know or know of cyclists who have had serious injuries Why does the sport seem so dangerous George Loewenstein a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University wonders if part of the problem is that official statistics miss most of what is happening There are all sorts of reasons why bike accidents are likely to be dramatically underreported he said Unlike auto accidents they rarely involve either an insurance claim or a police report And injured cyclists may not go to emergency rooms Even those with a broken collarbone may see an orthopedist instead Dr Loewensteins own accident was typical He cut through a parking lot and hit a huge patch of ice He went down injuring his shoulder But he never went to an emergency room and was not counted in accident statistics Another reason for the perception that cycling is uniquely dangerous is the very nature of the injuries Dr Loewenstein said Unlike injuries in other sports  a stress fracture from running or a rotator cuff tear from swimming  cycling injuries do not come on gradually There is a before and an after and people tend to dwell on that one moment when everything changed There is a focal moment Dr Loewenstein said and it is easy to replay it in a way that undoes it If only I was at the intersection  seconds before or  seconds later These accidents haunt especially because the if only is so intense Still many cycling injuries are nowhere nearly as bad as overuse injuries in other sports I no longer play soccer Mr Coppolillo the Boulder cyclist said I sprained one of my ankles so many times it does not work anymore But he added I rarely meet a person who had to stop cycling because of injuries People fall off their bike but for the most part injuries are niggling things like skin abrasions When a bone does break in a cycling crash it is often the collarbone And compared with a stress fracture or a torn rotator cuff a broken collarbone is not so bad You are back riding indoors on your trainer in a week and riding outside in a month Mr Coppolillo said Andy Pruitt the founder of the Boulder Center for Sports Medicine and an avid lifelong cyclist agrees He also understands the impressions people have of cyclings dangers If you went into my waiting room you would be convinced we are all going to die of cycling injuries he said But that is just not true Dr Pruitt cites his own example Now  he was a bicycle racer and has been riding for the past four decades He covers  to  miles a year In all that time he has had four serious crashes He broke his collarbone twice while racing and had two crashes on a mountain bike breaking a hip one time and spraining a wrist the other Considering all the miles hes ridden and all the risks hes taken racing and crashing down trails on a mountain bike he thinks that injury rate is not so bad Ill take it he said
