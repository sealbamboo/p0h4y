If youve ever seen your waiter sneeze you may have asked for a different server If youve seen one sneeze repeatedly you might wonder why hes still at work serving tainted food See most restaurant workers dont get paid when they stay home sick But some go to work anyway when theyve got the sniffles or worse because they need the paycheck For labor advocates thats a problem The fact that were forcing people to go to work sick is not something we want to do as a society says Maryland state Rep John Olszewski Jr a Democrat We shouldnt put people in a situation where theyre forced to make impossible choices between themselves and their work and their families Last month New York City began requiring employers to provide paid sick days joining the ranks of other cities such as Washington Seattle and San Francisco But while several cities have been willing to impose such requirements states have been more reluctant Olzewskis bill attracted a majority of his fellow state House members as cosponsors but went nowhere this year Instead a number of states  particularly in the South  have passed laws that block local governments from imposing sick day requirements on businesses The problem I see with paid sick leave is not so much offering it but the fact that its mandated says state Rep Gail Lavielle a Connecticut Republican It seems as though the state is determined to do everything it can to discourage businesses from coming here and staying here The more money you make the more likely it is that you can stay home when youre sick and still get paid A big majority   percent  enjoy that benefit among the top  percent of earners Only  percent of those in the bottom  percent have the same privilege   to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Parttime workers are usually out of luck Servers in restaurants and home health workers are the least likely to have paid sick time and the most likely to have contact with the public says Vicki Shabo vice president of the National Partnership for Women  Families A number of womens organizations have embraced the cause of providing paid sick leave House Democrats   the idea as part of their economic agenda for women and families It is not only good for workers but also for businesses who have lower retention costs and greater productivity as well as the broader economy says Rep Rosa DeLauro DConn who has sponsored federal legislation mandating paid sick leave With Congress unlikely to address the issue the action is in the states In  Connecticut became the first state to mandate paid sick leave A   of Connecticut employers released earlier this year by the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the City University of New York suggests that the cost for businesses has been minimal A year and a half after its implementation more than threequarters of surveyed employers expressed support for the earned paid sick leave law the study concludes Thats probably the opposite of what were hearing says Nicole Griffin executive director of the Connecticut Restaurant Association When the paid sick leave bill passed in Connecticut employers felt it was yet another burden wed have to deal with When restaurant workers are sick she says theyre better off trading shifts with other workers That way they can earn tips when they do come in rather than just collecting their base salary Restaurants certainly dont encourage workers to come in sick Griffin says Thats why we have flexible shifts and hours This week the Connecticut House approved changes to the law to simplify the ways companies tally up workers and their hours Its only a tweak says Rep Lavielle No intelligent employer is going to tell workers to come in when theyre sick she says Thats bad for morale and also bad for productivity and retention But the law as written doesnt allow employers recourse if workers abuse the privilege maxing out on mental health days After Milwaukee voters approved a sick leave ordinance in  the Wisconsin legislature passed a law prohibiting local governments from imposing such mandates That move has since been copied by  other states The coalition against paid sick leave often includes the same trade associations that oppose minimum wage increases making many of the same arguments about burdens on businesses They say the existing local mandates have reduced profits and forced cuts to other benefits The paid sick leave bill in our opinion would put thousands of jobs at risk and discourage businesses from coming to the city of Philadelphia Michael Nutter  the citys mayor said last year when he vetoed a paid sick day law Supporters of the idea arent giving up Paid sick leave is expected to be on the Massachusetts ballot this fall I admit theres going to be a cost says California state Rep Lorena Gonzalez a Democrat who has sponsored a sick leave bill However its a very limited cost Gonzalez contends that under her legislation expenses for an individual company would increase by no more than  percent She argues that the societal benefit outweighs the expense Otherwise its the workers who bear the cost There are risks when they decide they cant afford to stay home People with sick leave benefits are more likely to take themselves and their children to see a doctor Gonzalez says rather than waiting until things get bad enough to demand emergency treatment We have  million Californians who cant take a single hour of sick leave she says The public health situation when workers go to work sick creates a dilemma for all of us
