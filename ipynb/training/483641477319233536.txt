Midwives in England say they are prepared to take industrial action over pay More than  of midwives and maternity support workers taking part in a consultation said they would consider strike action  The Royal College of Midwives RCM said there was a palpable sense of anger and frustration among members The RCM will now decide whether to formally ballot members on industrial action The NHS Pay Review Body had recommended a  pay rise for all staff In March ministers announced a basic  pay rise but added that staff receiving automatic progressioninjob increases would not get the  as well The RCM argue this does not meet the increasing cost of living and say the pay deal amounts to a pay cut Cathy Warwick the chief executive of the RCM said We knew midwives were angry about the derisory offer from the Government but this response from our members highlights just how unfairly they have been treated  Such an unprecedented response with such a large number willing to consider action should ring alarm bells with the Government  Midwives and other health workers are seeing their pay falling in real terms as their pay stagnates pension contributions increase and the cost of living rises The Department of Health said it was disappointed and urged unions to put patients first A spokesperson said NHS staff are our greatest asset and we know that midwives across the country are working hard  Thats why they should receive at least one per cent additional pay this year and next  Since May  there are  more midwives helping expectant mothers and we want to protect these increases  We cannot afford a general pay rise on top of incremental pay increases without risking the loss of frontline NHS jobs
