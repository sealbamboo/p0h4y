Does the idea that drinking red wine and eating chocolate can promote better health and help you live longer sound too good to be true According to a new report it just might be  Some studies in   and   have suggested that consumption of resveratrol  part of the family of polyphenol antioxidants found in foods like grapes chocolate wine and apples  can promote longevity and reduce health risks like cancer and cardiovascular disease The data are mixed in human studies but its been one factor cited to help explain why a Mediterranean dietand drinking red wine    The study out Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine focused on a group of  randomly selected men and women age  and older in two small towns in the Tuscany region of Italy The group was studied for nine years during which lifestyle assessments were selfreported three times along with medical evaluation and urine sampling Less than  percent of participants reported taking any type of dietary supplements Using resveratrol measures in urine as a reflection of dietary resveratrol intake from food sources including red wine chocolate fruits and berries the study group was put into four groups from the highest to lowest selfreported dietary resveratrol intake During the nine years of follow up  percent percent of the participants died There were no significant differences in the percentage of people dying among any of the resveratrol intake groups There were also no clear differences in markers of cellular inflammation or the rate of cardiovascular disease and cancer development among people across all resveratrol groups Statistical analyses adjusted for age sex BMI chronic diseases and other variables  These data suggest that the health halo of dietary sources of resveratrol may not be justified  they do not appear to impact health risk or longevity There are many ways to be a healthy eater so if you enjoy a glass of red wine and a piece of dark chocolate continue to enjoy it  in moderation But these data argue against adding red wine or chocolate to a diet for health reasons alone  And while resveratrol supplements are touted to promote a myriad of health benefits conflicting data in both animals and humans about direct health impact along with lack of data of long term highdose supplementation strongly suggest that consumers take a closer look As with other food components translated to a supplement form in much higher amounts than ever naturally seen by the body more may not always be better
