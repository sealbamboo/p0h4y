Taking a tomato pill a day could help keep heart disease at bay say UK scientists who have carried out a small but robust study  The trial which tested the tomato pill versus a dummy drug in  adults found it improved the functioning of blood vessels  But experts say more studies are needed to prove it really works The pill contains lycopene a natural antioxidant that also gives tomatoes their colour Experts have suspected for some time that lycopene might be good for avoiding illnesses including certain cancers and cardiovascular disease  There is some evidence that eating a Mediterraneanstyle diet which is rich in tomatoes as well as other fruit and vegetables and olive oil is beneficial for health  Following a healthy diet is still advisable but many different scientific teams have been researching whether there is a way to put at least some of this good stuff into an easytotake pill Some have started testing theirs out A team at Cambridge University set out to see if a tomato pill would have the desired effect The pill was made by a company called CamNutra but the scientists were working independently of CamNutra and instead were funded by the Wellcome Trust the British Heart Foundation and the National Institute of Health Research for their study  They recruited  volunteers known to have heart disease and  healthy controls who were all given a daily tablet to take which was either the tomato pill or a placebo To ensure a fairer trial neither the volunteers nor the researchers were told what the tablets actually contained until after the twomonth study had ended and the results were in  For comparison the researchers measured something called forearm blood flow which is predictive of future cardiovascular risk because narrowed blood vessels can lead to heart attack and stroke In the heart disease patients the tomato pill improved forearm blood flow significantly while the placebo did not The supplement had no effect on blood pressure arterial stiffness or levels of fats in the blood however Lead researcher Dr Joseph Cheriyan said the findings published in   journal were promising but added A daily tomato pill is not a substitute for other treatments but may provide added benefits when taken alongside other medication  However we cannot answer if this may reduce heart disease  this would need much larger trials to investigate outcomes more carefully Prof Jeremy Pearson of the British Heart Foundation said big studies were needed to see if this could become a viable option for patients
