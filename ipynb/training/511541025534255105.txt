When your child has an earache or a bad cold its hard to think that theres not much you can offer beyond Tylenol and sympathy But most of those infections are mostly caused by viruses that dont respond to antibiotics a study finds Just  percent of acute respiratory tract infections are caused by bacteria researchers at Seattle Childrens Hospital found That means that more than twothirds are viral and antibiotics dont help But doctors prescribed antibiotics for children with those infections  percent of the time the   found In other words children are taking medication thats not going to help them and can hurt because of side effects and the increased risk of   both for that person and for the larger community That adds up to about  million potentially needless prescriptions each year Cutting back on unnecessary use of antibiotics is a pressing concern the authors write in Mondays  More than half of all outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are for respiratory infections they note which includes ears noses and throats But some infections were more likely to be caused by bacteria than others Ear infections were caused by bacteria  percent of the time while strep tests revealed   bacteria causing that sore throat just  percent of the time Last year the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that doctors  when prescribing antibiotics for ear infections That included giving parents a contingency prescription to use if the child doesnt get better in a few days To find this out the researchers combed through studies published between  and  They also looked at doctoroffice visits in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to see what medications were prescribed There was only one study on sinusitis bronchitis and upperrespiratory infections that met study criteria so it doesnt address use of antibiotics for those conditions The big problem is that aside from the strep test there are no quick simple ways to test a child to see whether an illness is caused by bacteria or viruses So parents and doctors have to guess This study does give parents and healthcare providers a bit more information on the odds of getting benefits from antibiotics For instance the researchers suggest that bronchitis upperrespiratory infections sore throats and ear infections in children over age  would be good candidates for waiting a bit before prescribing or offering a prescription if the child gets worse
