Finally the federal HR department has   much of Capitol Hill has been waiting for Theres now an explanation from the Office of Personnel Management on how members of Congress and much of their staff will get their health insurance starting next year At issue is a tiny provision of the health overhaul law that caused a   on Capitol Hill It required all members of Congress and much of their staff to give up their federal worker health insurance as of the end of  and begin taking part in the Obamacare health insurance exchanges instead What was unclear however at least until last week is whether those  or so people would be able to continue receiving the same employer contribution to their health insurance  some  percent of the cost of coverage  as the rest of the federal workforce After some apparently high level intervention President Obama himself promised senators in a closed door meeting he was working on the issue White House officials   that yes those who switch to exchange coverage will be able to continue to receive government insurance contributions towards that coverage The amount of the employer contribution for Members of Congress and official staff will be the same as for other Federal employees said a   issued by OPM But the rule declined to make another key determination exactly who among the  or so Capitol Hill workers will have to drop their federal coverage and switch to the exchanges According to the health law those required to make the switch are all fulltime and parttime employees employed by the official office of a member of Congress Most people   as excluding those working for House and Senate committee and leadership offices OPM however said that Because there is not an existing statutory or regulatory definition OPM believes Congress is best able to make the determination as to whether an individual is employed by the official office of the Member of Congress Under the proposed rule most years Congress will have to make that determination by October This year however members will have an additional  days to decide who gets what kind of coverage Not everyone is satisfied with the solution however Policy analysts from the Heritage Foundation who   that the administration lacked the authority to make any kind of fix to the congressional coverage glitch say the new rules are plainly beyond what is legal for the administration to propose It was bad enough the Congress had to pass the law to find out what was in it wrote Edmund Haislmaier in   Now the Administration is ignoring the law when they dont like what they find
