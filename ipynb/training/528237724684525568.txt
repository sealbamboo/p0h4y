The process starts with a panel of Cleveland Clinic physicians and scientists who submit their ideas These suggestions which Roizen said totaled about  for the  list are then narrowed down and voted on by  physicians in a variety of health fields  Heres what they selected for  Videoconferencing has made its way into ambulances specifically for treating stroke victims on the go Hospital stroke neurologists can interpret symptoms via a broadband video link and instruct an onboard paramedic critical care nurse and CT technologist on treatment This new technology should improve the speed of medical care which is important as strokes   The   reports that about half of the worlds population is now at risk for dengue fever which up until now was preventable only by avoiding mosquito bites The disease is a leading cause of death and illness in children in some countries A new vaccine has been developed and tested and is expected to be available in   For those who hate large needles a nearly painless way to sample blood will be a welcome relief Plus it will be cheaper and provide faster results than todays blood test The new technology takes blood from your fingertip and the Cleveland Clinic reports that over  tests can be performed on just one drop of blood New selfinjectable drugs called PCSK inhibitors have shown to be very effective in lowering cholesterol These drugs may prove to be helpful for people with high LDL cholesterol who dont have good results with   The FDA is expected to approve the first PCSK in   Although   can save lives it can be hard on the body and attack healthy cells as well as cancerous ones A welcome breakthrough in the world of cancer treatment antibodydrug conjugates can deliver targeted treatment without damaging healthy tissue Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to prevent cancer cells from hiding from the immune system allowing the body to more effectively fight these abnormal cells Combined with chemotherapy and radiation treatment the drugs have shown significant longterm cancer remissions for patients with   one of the most deadly forms of cancer Until this point wires have been a necessary component in pacemakers A new wireless pacemaker about the size of a vitamin can now be implanted in the heart without surgery Its lithiumion battery is estimated to last about seven years  is a lifethreatening disease that causes scarring in the lungs leading to breathing difficulties and a shortage of oxygen in the brain and other organs Life expectancy is only three to five years after diagnosis but those numbers may change now that the FDA has approved two experimental drugs that slow the disease pirfenidone and nintedanib   estimates that  women in the United States will die from breast cancer in  The Cleveland Clinic cites multiple chemotherapy appointments sometimes requiring the patient to travel long distances as a hindrance to successful treatment Intraoperative radiation therapy is a new solution It treats a breast cancer tumor during surgery in a single dose reducing time and cost spent on treatment About  million people in the United States suffer from heart failure according to the   It is managed with a combination of drugs but a new drug angiotensinreceptor neprilysin inhibitor has been granted fasttrack status by the FDA because of its ability to cut the risk of dying from heart failure more effectively than current treatments For more information on the annual medical innovations list including descriptions and videos download the   or visit the   A where is it now feature also includes updates on innovations that made the top  list in prior years We look in past to see what we voted on to improve the process Roizen said With one exception weve been pretty good
