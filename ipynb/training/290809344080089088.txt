Are there foods so low in   that it takes as many or more calories to digest them as they contain That is the myth behind diets that claim   through zerocalorie or negativecalorie foods It would certainly make dieting easier if we could munch on caloriefree foods all day But other than water and diet beverages there is unfortunately no such thing as a zerocalorie or negativecalorie food according to Kimberly Lummus MS RD Texas Dietetic Association media representative and public relations coordinator for the Austin Dietetic Association in Austin Texas Apart from foods that have been engineered to be caloriefree like sugar substitutes virtually all foods contain calories Some foods contain very few calories and we do burn a few calories when we chew and digest the foods we eat But the notion that eating certain foods can put us into a negative   just isnt true Some foods do require more energy to digest but digesting foods that are socalled zerocalorie such as celery or cucumbers is not going to have much impact on your total calorie expenditure or weightloss efforts notes Lummus It wouldnt be smart nutritionally to think that you are somehow tricking your body and subtracting calories Foods that are sometimes touted as being zerocalorie or negativecalorie include Lummus points out that you would have to eat such large amounts of these foods to make your body work hard enough to cancel out the calories that it wouldnt be worth it Although these food choices with supposed zero calories arent going to put you into a negative calorie balance there are other great benefits to eating them They are all fruits and vegetables so they are great foods to incorporate into your diet says Lummus These foods are also high in fiber and pack a hefty nutrition punch   tend to be nutrientdense meaning that they contain relatively few calories in comparison to their high level of nutrients Whats more they can help you   Fruits and vegetables can be just as filling as highercalorie foods but with far fewer calories and often a lot more bulk If you are trying to lose weight start by adding vegetables to your main dishes   piling your sandwiches with fresh vegetables and having fruit instead of dessert after your meals This doesnt trick your body into a calorie deficit but it can help you feel full and satisfied while still eating fewer calories and getting lots of vitamins minerals and other essential nutrients One true zero   to make sure you are getting enough of is water Not only is it healthy to drink enough water but substituting water for sugarsweetened beverages can save you hundreds of calories Aim for six to eight eightounce glasses of water each day
