The   from Kraft last week that the company is ditching two artificial dyes in some versions of its macaroni and cheese products left me with a question Why did we start coloring cheeses orange to begin with Turns out theres a curious history here In theory cheese should be whitish  similar to the color of milk right Well not really Centuries ago in England lots of cheeses had a natural yellowishorange pigment The cheese came from the milk of certain breeds of cows such as Jersey and Guernsey Their milk tends to be richer in color from betacarotene in the grass they eat So when the orange pigment transferred to the cows milk and then to the cheese it was considered a mark of quality But heres where the story gets interesting Cheese expert   of the University of Vermont explains that back in the th century many English cheesemakers realized that they could make more money if they skimmed off the cream  to sell it separately or make butter from it But in doing so most of the color was lost since the natural orange pigment is carried in the fatty cream So to pass off what was left over  basically lowfat cheese made from white milk  as a highquality product the cheesemakers faked it The cheesemakers were initially trying to trick people to mask the white color of their cheese explains Kindstedt They began adding coloring from saffron marigold carrot juice and later annatto which comes from the seeds of a tropical plant Its also what Kraft will use to color its new varieties of macaroni and cheese The devious cheesemakers of the th century used these colorings to pass their products off as the fullfat naturally yellowishorange cheese that Londoners had come to expect The tradition of coloring cheese then carried over in the US Lots of cheesemakers in Indiana Ohio Wisconsin and New York have a long history of coloring cheddar The motivation was part tradition part marketing to make their cheeses stand out There was another reason too It helped cheesemakers achieve a uniform color in their cheeses But Kindstedt says its not a tradition that ever caught on in New England dairy farms Here in New England there was a disdain for brightly colored cheese Kindstedt says And thats why to this day we still see lots of naturally white cheddar cheese from places such as   With the boom in the artisanal food movement were starting to see more cheese produced from grassfed cows And as a result we may notice the butterlike color in summer cheeses  similar to what the th century Londoners ate We absolutely see the color changes when the cows transition onto pasture in early May cheesemaker   of Shelburne Farms in Vermont wrote to us in an email He says its especially evident in the whey after we cut the curd and also in the finished cheese Both get quite golden in color kind of like straw with the betacarotenes the cows are eating in the fresh meadow grasses
