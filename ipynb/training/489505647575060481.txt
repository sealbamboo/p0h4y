The   in southwest Houston is in the very heart of Asia Town a part of the city where bland strip malls hide culinary treasures  Vietnamese pho Malaysian noodles Sichuan rabbit and bubble tea Inside the clinic internist Charu Sawhney sees patients from many countries and circumstances Shes a big believer in the Affordable Care Act since most of her patients have been uninsured She actively pushed many of them to sign up for the new plans But now shes seeing something she didnt expect When patients need treatment unavailable at the clinic its been hard to find specialists and hospitals that accept the insurance I was so consumed with just getting people to sign up she says I didnt take the next step to say Oh by the way when you sign up make sure you sign up for the right plan  Understandably a lot of her patients picked lowercost plans she says and were running into   in the same way we were when they were uninsured One of her patients is a Chinese immigrant to Houston who purchased a Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO silver plan Soon after he was diagnosed with stomach cancer Sawhney found an oncologist to coordinate his treatment but she and the oncologist ran into trouble trying to schedule chemotherapy and radiation The process just isnt as easy as we thought it would be she says Thats because the two largest hospital chains in Houston Houston Methodist and Memorial Hermann are not in that plans network Neither is Houstons premier cancer hospital MD Anderson Cancer Center Those are the hospitals that the patients oncologist Paul Zhang calls on the most He says coordinating surgery or radiation usually isnt a problem because most of his patients have insurance plans with wide networks I could not find a surgeon says Zhang Eventually Zhang found one who took the insurance though theyd never worked together After the surgery Zhang tried to set up the patients chemotherapy and radiation at Houston Methodist But that hospital wasnt taking the plan Zhang says he cannot refer patients with these narrow plans to the specialists he thinks are best and thats a problem if the cancer is particularly complicated You have limited options So youre like a secondclass citizen you know Thats my feeling you have this insurance and you cannot see certain doctors he says Sawhney was less surprised by the barriers Medicaid patients have similar problems finding doctors and her uninsured patients have always struggled to find care But she thought the Affordable Care Act would be an improvement Her patient with stomach cancer thought so too He asked not to be identified because he has not shared his diagnosis with close family members The insurance agent said that a lot of doctors will accept that insurance   but when I got sick I found out nobody wants that kind of insurance The biggest irony she added is that even   the countywide public hospital system in Houston doesnt take all the new marketplace plans Yet Sawhney can still send uninsured patients there for cancer treatment As people learn that some doors are closed she worries people will decide insurance isnt worth the money I dont want patients to get discouraged she says I dont want patients when they have a choice again to say You know what Im just not going to sign up because it doesnt matter if I have insurance or I dont have insurance I still have problems getting health care  Narrow networks of doctors and hospitals arent new but theyve   with the rollout of the Affordable Care Act Analysts point out that narrow networks are a powerful tool for insurance companies seeking to control costs  especially since they can no longer control costs by excluding sick people or adjusting premiums by gender or age By restricting the choices in a plan the insurer can promise more customers for the doctors and hospitals that are included In exchange the insurers can get a break on what they pay those doctors and hospitals The industrys position is that patients have choices Plans with access to more hospitals and specialists are available but usually at a higher price Louis Adams is a spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas Our goal was to offer an array of plan choices he says We created more focused networks as a way to offer a broad range of plans with lower premium prices Sawhney and Zhang eventually found a place for the patient to get chemotherapy and radiation Despite the delays and difficulties Sawhney still believes its better to have insurance and she still believes in the law But she says from now on shell tell her patients to shop more carefully taking into account price and whether they have a chronic illness It wont be about the cheapest plan anymore but rather the plan that best meets their medical needs
