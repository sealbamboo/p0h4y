Beleaguered passengers finally fled a Royal Caribbean cruise ship Wednesday after a day vacation cut short by a nasty gut bug that sickened nearly  people One woman aboard the Explorer of the Seas yelled We made it as the ship docked in Bayonne NJ two days ahead of schedule Other passengers stood on deck wrapped in blankets to watch the ship pull in Dave and Danielle Panebianco two firefighters from Farmingville NY told NBC News they were both sick on what was supposed to be a romantic honeymoon voyage  This is my first and last cruise said Dave Panebianco  You cant pay me and Im not going again One person was removed from the Explorer of the Seas on a stretcher and taken away by ambulance Others walked under their own power after the vessel arrived Several passengers recounted a week full of tension and drama but also professionalism and care from the cruise line crew  Some people were terrible said Sue Rogutski  of Bloomsburg Pa who was sick for  hours and quarantined for three days on board the ship We really feared there would be some riotous activity but the cruise line handled it so well Cruise passenger Sal Panto the mayor of Easton Pa agreed  The ship said we have an issue here we are going to deal with it we are going to compensate people and we are going to send them on he said That is the best they can do given the situation I think if you look at any crisis management course you might take they did exactly what they should have done Still the ordeal on the foot ship  whose relaxing voyage to the US Virgin Islands was thwarted by suspected norovirus  may linger a little longer for people still showing signs of the fastmoving infection health officials said  We have passengers who are still exhibiting active disease said Burnadette Burden a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  People who are still sick may be too ill to travel home  and too contagious to use public transportation like trains and buses health experts say Royal Caribbean officials said Wednesday that theyd pay for hotels or make sure that ill passengers get additional medical care  Should a guest feel sick enough that they want to go to the hospital we will arrange for transportation Royal Caribbean spokeswoman Cynthia Martinez said in an email We will work with the small number of guests that still feel ill to make them as comfortable as possible At least  of the ships  passengers and at least  of the  crew members came down with diarrhea and vomiting  classic signs of norovirus Most of the cases occurred early in the cruise which left New Jersey on Jan  and many passengers had already recovered Its hard to say that the outbreak was the worst on record because of inconsistencies in recordkeeping But its a bad one Burden said  It would be fair to say this is one of the largest numbers in the last  years or so she said One of the closest outbreaks to compare occurred in  when a Carnival Cruise ship the Carnival Liberty was hit with an outbreak of norovirus that sickened  passengers and crew on a November trip to the US Virgin Islands   CDC officials have not confirmed that norovirus is the culprit on the Explorer of the Seas though its a common cause of illness on cruise ships Officials said testing was delayed by a treacherous winter snowstorm that closed the agencys Atlanta headquarters and results arent expected until Friday  But if it is the germ its highly contagious for the one to two days when people are actively sick  and for a few days afterward The virus actually lingers in peoples stool for two weeks or more according to the CDC  That means that anyone who fell ill  and those who were around them  should pay extra attention to washing their hands and other kinds of cleanliness said Dr Ruth Lynfield outgoing head of the public health committee of the Infectious Diseases Society of America  The key will be really good hygiene she said People who have been ill with norovirus shouldnt be preparing food Cleanliness will be the key for the cruise line too Officials said they plan another scrub a socalled barrier sanitation program to ensure that any remaining traces of illness are removed from the ship Norovirus is a  to eradicate health experts say  It will be the third aggressive sanitizing procedure the ship has undertaken since we became aware of the issue and will additionally provide a window of more than  hours where there are no persons aboard the ship officials said in a statement  Explorer of the Seas is set to embark on a   to the eastern Caribbean on Friday Royal Caribbean has said it will  s for their trouble The Panebiancos said they were offered a  percent refund on this cruise and  percent discount on another one  That wont happen Dave Panebianco said  But Rogutski a veteran of several cruises said shed go again on a cruise licketysplit Yes Im already signed up Next year on the Quantum of the Seas for  days When things like this happen you cant blame everybody you just have to go on
