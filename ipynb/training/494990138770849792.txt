A project aiming to revolutionise medicine by unlocking the secrets of DNA is under way in centres across England  Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will see the UK lead the world in genetic research within years  The first genetic codes of people with cancer or rare diseases out of a target of  have been sequenced  Experts believe it will lead to targeted therapies and could make chemotherapy a thing of the past Just one human genome contains more than three billion base pairs  the building blocks of DNA This fouryear project which will look at  genomes is being run by   Pilots have been set up at centres across England  including sites in Newcastle Cambridge and London  and the first genome was sequenced on  May The project has now passed the  genome mark with the aim of reaching  by the end of the year and  by the end of  The genome of a patients tumour will be scoured for differences with the genetic code of their healthy tissue People with rare diseases usually children will have their DNA compared with that of close relatives  University scientists and a drug companies will be allowed to access the data for their research  They argue that understanding DNA will soon play a role in every aspect of medicine from cancer to cardiology Cancer is one of the main areas the project will focus on Tumours are caused by mutations in DNA which lead to abnormal cells growing unchecked  Previous genetics research has shown how different cancers can be  for example that    each with a different cause life expectancy and needing a different treatment  And the development of targeted drugs such as Herceptin only given if a patients breast tumour has a certain mutation  has been possible because of genetics research Fifteen thousand families with rare diseases will take part in the project Edward SherleyPrice has firsthand experience of just how little is known about some conditions  His yearold daughter Alysia has regular seizures  She was diagnosed with a developmental delay before her second birthday but the cause was unknown  It took until  for genetic testing to discover what was wrong  a rare genetic mutation in a gene known as STXBP The family say getting a diagnosis has given them a renewed sense of optimism The  Genomes Project could help people like Alysia by identifying a specific mutation which lead to taking part in future drug trials Sir John Chisholm executive chair of Genomics England said In Britain we were the discoverers of the structure of DNA we were huge players in the human genome project and now the time has come for the next major step forward  One hundred thousand sequences is a very large step its a huge commitment  Genomics England will be based at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge which is already a worldrecognised centre of genetics research  Prof Jeremy Farrar director of the Wellcome Trust said I can see a future where genetics is going to come into every bit of medicine from cardiology to oncology to infectious diseases He said there were already targeted therapies for some breast lung bowel and blood cancers Twenty years from now theres going to be a plethora of those we will have a series of mutations which academics and industry will have developed therapies for which will be targeted at you and specific for that cancer He said chemotherapy which attacks all dividing cells in the body would be replaced with such therapies We will look back in  years time and think of blockbuster chemotherapy as a thing of the past and well think Gosh what an era that was David Cameron has announced a series of investments across government industry and charities totalling m He said I am determined to do all I can to support the health and scientific sector to unlock the power of DNA turning an important scientific breakthrough into something that will help deliver better tests better drugs and above all better care for patients I believe we will be able to transform how devastating diseases are diagnosed and treated in the NHS and across the world NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said The NHS is now set to become one of the worlds goto health services for the development of innovative genomic tests and patient treatments building on our long track record as the nation that brought humanity antibiotics vaccines modern nursing hip replacements IVF CT scanners and breakthrough discoveries from the circulation of blood to the existence of DNA
