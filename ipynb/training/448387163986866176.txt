Ever since Cindy Hasz opened her geriatric care management business in San Diego  years ago she has been fighting a losing battle for clients unable to get Medicare coverage for physical therapy because they plateaued and were not getting better It has been standard operating procedure that patients will be discontinued from therapy services because they are not improving she said  No more In January Medicare officials    the rule book for everything Medicare does  to erase any notion that improvement is necessary to receive coverage for skilled care That means Medicare now   for beneficiaries with chronic diseases like multiple sclerosis Parkinsons or Alzheimers disease in order to maintain their condition and prevent deterioration  But dont look for an announcement about the changes in the mail or even a prominent notice on the Medicare website Medicare officials were required to inform health care providers bill processors auditors Medicare Advantage plans the MEDICARE information line and appeals judges  but not beneficiaries   Ms Hasz said she was shocked when she heard the news This is a sea change she said The manual revisions were required in the   filed in  against Kathleen Sebelius the secretary of health and human services by the Center for Medicare Advocacy and Vermont Legal Aid on behalf of four Medicare patients and five national organizations including the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Parkinsons Action Network and the Alzheimers Association The settlement affects   and home health and nursing home care for patients in both traditional Medicare and private Medicare Advantage plans It allows people to remain a little healthier for a longer time and stay a little bit more independent said Margaret Murphy associate director at the Center for Medicare Advocacy And it eases the burden on families who are scrambling to take care of their loved ones she said The change may have the most farreaching impact on seniors who want to avoid institutional care People with chronic conditions may be able to get the care they need to live in their own homes for as long as they need it Ms Murphy said if they otherwise qualify for coverage  Existing eligibility criteria havent changed Although seniors probably wont hear the words plateau or improvement when coverage is denied they can still lose coverage for reasons other than a lack of improvement  For nursing home coverage you must have a doctors order prescribing skilled nursing home care not custodial care and you must have spent three consecutive midnights in the hospital as an admitted patient   Limits on the duration of Medicare nursing home coverage remain the same  Physical and speech therapy ordered by a doctor and provided in a nursing home or an outpatient facility by a skilled professional are subject this year to a  therapy cap Providers can get an automatic exception to the cap for medically necessary treatment until costs reach  At that point another exception is possible after Medicare reviews medical documentation Occupational therapy is provided to patients with separate  and  caps with the same exceptions For home health coverage you must have a doctors order for intermittent care  every few days or weeks  provided by a skilled professional for outpatient therapy social work services or a visiting nurse    The therapy caps do not apply in the home setting so long as the patient is homebound and that doesnt necessarily mean confined to bed Someone who is homebound requires considerable and taxing effort to leave home Ms Murphy said and cannot do so without another person or a wheelchair walker cane or other device   Beneficiaries receiving skilled services at home are also eligible for home health care aides for assistance with bathing dressing and other daily activities The settlement also establishes a special rereview procedure for claims that were denied in the past three years solely because patients were not improving or because their care was intended to maintain their condition   Officials have posted   if they paid for care themselves The form must be submitted by July   for claims with a final denial dating from Jan   through Jan     Requests for review of denials received Jan   through Jan   are due Jan    If the claim is denied again a Medicare spokesman said beneficiaries may appeal through the regular appeals process But what if despite the settlement your provider or a Medicare representative still says you cant continue treatment only because you are not improving    First point them to Medicares   which clearly says Coverage depends not on the beneficiarys restoration potential but on whether skilled care is required And let us know what happens If that doesnt work contact   for help filing an expedited appeal Ask the doctor who ordered treatment for a letter of support   If you receive the treatment and pay for it yourself or are on the hook for the bill Ms Murphy suggests asking the provider to bill Medicare Then you should appeal the denial by following the instructions provided on your Medicare summary notice or in the appeal decision letter  The   provides more details  If all else fails email the centers lawyers at    They are meeting regularly with Medicare officials to monitor compliance with the settlement and will tell the agency about coverage denials prohibited in the settlement Despite Medicares efforts to get the word out the center still receives complaints every week from people denied treatment only because they are not getting better
