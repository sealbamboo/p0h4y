The Environmental Protection Agency proposed new rules on Thursday to protect farm workers including mandatory training in languages such as Spanish and buffer zones to keep people clear of freshly sprayed fields Theyre the first new regulations covering pesticides and farm workers in more than  years and aim to start bringing protections up to the level of other US workers The current rules require training every five years said Jim Jones of EPAs Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention We are proposing training on an annual basis Training would include telling workers not only how to protect themselves by wearing respirators for instance but also how to protect their families by changing clothes Current rules also make warning signs optional The revised rules would make noentry signs mandatory for areas where the most dangerous chemicals have been applied Farm operators dont have to keep records now on which pesticides are used and when but the new rules will require it And for the first time no one younger than  will be able to use pesticides with the exception of those on family farms Between  and  farm workers suffer from acute pesticide poisoning every year and thats almost certainly an underestimate said Amy Liebman of the Migrant Clinicians Network Shortterm effects include blisters and breathing problems while   longterm effects include cancer    and Parkinsons disease Liebman praised the new rules but said her group would like to see more changes including mandatory medical monitoring for workers who use pesticides and regulations to ensure that decontamination supplies are more readily available They are specifically excluded from most of the regulations that protect other workers in this country Liebman said on a conference call EPA says farmers   a year on pesticides The new rules which dozens of members of Congress have been pushing for will be final after a day public comment period
