Ebola has now killed nearly 400 people in West Africa and infected 635, and urgent efforts are now needed to control it, the World Health Organization said Thursday.. “As the number of deaths and cases of Ebola virus continues to rise in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the World Health Organization is warning that drastic action is needed,” WHO said in a statement.. “This is no longer a country-specific outbreak but a sub-regional crisis that requires firm action by governments and partners. WHO is gravely concerned of the on-going cross-border transmission into neighboring countries as well as the potential for further international spread,” said Dr. Luis Sambo, WHO regional director for Africa.. Guinea has the most cases, with 396 infections that have killed 280 people. Sierra Leone has 176 cases and 78 deaths, while in Liberia 63 people have been infected and 41 of them have died.. -Maggie Fox
