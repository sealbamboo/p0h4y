Born in a tiny pueblo south of Madrid Esperanza Puente arrived in the Spanish capital fresh out of high school It was the late s and Spain was reveling in newfound freedoms after its military dictator Francisco Franco died and democracy took hold The end of the s was a wild time in Madrid  alcohol drugs nightlife sex without commitment When I arrived from a small village I ate it up like it was the end of the world recalls Puente now  smiling But I ended up pregnant and my boyfriend suddenly didnt want anything to do with me Puente couldnt bear to tell her conservative Catholic family back in her village that she was pregnant and unmarried So she sought another option Spain had just legalized abortion in  I had this new option of abortion which seemed easy and painless You could get one in  hours Puente says I felt like I didnt have any other alternative But Puente has come to regret that decision Some  years later she now volunteers with an antiabortion group counseling pregnant women who are in the position she once was deciding whether to abort or give birth Shes changed her mind about abortion  and so has Spains government Puentes personal journey reflects a larger backlash against a number of changes in Spanish society in recent years The Spanish government is on its way to creating one of the toughest abortion laws in Europe  a neartotal ban except in cases of rape or grave risk to the mothers health Serious birth defects will no longer be grounds for terminating a pregnancy In Europe only the tiny island nation of Malta has a complete ban on abortion The procedure is legal and widely available across much of the continent  France Germany the Netherlands Portugal Italy Even Ireland with its own deeprooted Catholic society   to legalize abortion in limited circumstances when the mothers life is at risk Spain first legalized abortion in  and then widened its availability with another law in  New legislation to override both those laws won government approval in December and awaits a final vote by Parliament in the coming weeks or months The conservative Popular Party holds an absolute majority in Parliament so passage is virtually guaranteed P  however that more than  percent of Spaniards want abortion to remain legal and accessible like in most of Europe Thousands of protesters march up and down Madrids wide avenues every weekend Many accuse the government of cowing to the Catholic Church At   a dozen topless women chanted Abortion is sacred as they rushed toward a Catholic cardinal pelting him with lace panties Priests closed in on the cardinal and elderly churchgoers used their handbags to swat at the topless protesters Theatrics aside many abortionrights advocates believe the new law will turn the clock back to the s when Spanish women had to travel abroad to get abortions Many women will be packing their suitcases once again for weekend flights to France and England says Luis Enrique Sanchez president of Spains Planned Parenthood Federation This is a situation we cannot endure Itll do so much damage to the Spanish population Tightening Spains abortion rules was one of the Popular Partys campaign promises during the  general elections which the party won by a wide margin In recent months Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has moved toward the right trying to keep members of his conservative party from defecting to new farright political party Vox   to the Tea Party in the US But on abortion Spains conservatives also face another revolt from the center  led by Celia Villalobos the deputy speaker of Spains Parliament She is a conservative and an abortionrights advocate Villalobos has urged fellow conservatives to break with the party leadership and vote their conscience on abortion Sure theres a farright wing of the party thats much more conservative and its pressuring the leadership she said in a recent interview But whats happened is were not in  anymore Were in  and things have changed In the intervening years most of Europe legalized abortion In  years Spain has changed from a Catholic dictatorship to one of the first European nations to legalize gay marriage For some Spaniards  especially older conservatives many of whom happen to sit in Parliament  change has come too fast and its bewildering says Fernando Gortazar with the Family Forum another antiabortion group Sometimes when you introduce a big change and people get these sudden and a bit crazy freedoms of the last years maybe some of the things that should never change are confused with what is real progress Gortazar says Thats the real debate taking place in Spain now whether the freedoms that came with democracy in the s represent true progress or a breakdown of traditional Spanish values Despite fierce arguments on both sides Spains Parliament will almost certainly choose to severely restrict abortion when it comes up for a vote
