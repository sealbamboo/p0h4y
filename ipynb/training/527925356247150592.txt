Dr Ana NavasAcien cant quite recall the moment when she began to worry about arsenic in drinking water and its potential role in heart disease  Perhaps it was when she read a study    And   And    Several years ago Dr NavasAcien an  of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health decided to see if similar links could be found in the United States  She found an ideal group  a stable population relying mainly on private well water  in an ongoing study of Native Americans in the Dakotas and the Southwest Known as the   the project had tracked the lifestyles and environmental exposures of more than  people since the late s  As it turned out Native Americans also were worried about arsenic in their well water Although the Environmental Protection Agency sets a  partsperbillion   only municipal water utilities are required to meet it   In private wells arsenic  resulting mostly from geological contamination of ground water  has been measured in much higher levels in some cases more than one hundred times higher The problem is   in the Southwest the upper Midwest and northern New England  So Dr NavasAcien and her colleagues compared urinary arsenic levels and disease rates among the Native Americans in the study As levels of arsenic rose in individuals she found so did the incidences of atherosclerosis of stroke of heart attack For those with chronic exposure to arsenic rates of cardiovascular illness   even  various lifestyle and genetic risks  On the question of whether arsenic is a cardiovascular risk I would say yes and I would put my hand in the fire to that Dr NavasAcien said  Its a position supported by a growing cohort of researchers and clinical cardiologists who worry that environmental exposures generally are an underestimated risk in heart disease The most troubling are thought to be   metallic elements like arsenic and   such as   and    We need more cardiologists to be thinking about environmental effects on the heart said Dr Gervasio Lamas chief of cardiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Its not just some abstract EPA problem Its actually affecting our patients The growing interest in metallic compounds has led to a new understanding of how materials do harm on a cellular level Arsenic may not be a heavy metal but it shares some similarities including the ability to cause free radical damage to cells stressing delicate blood vessels and thickening arterial walls  Arsenic can stimulate enzymes to produce hydrogen peroxide said Aaron Barchowsky a professor of environmental and occupational health at the University of Pittsburgh Hydrogen peroxide can   in cells Other metals also stimulate hydrogen peroxide production but Dr Barchowsky has found that arsenic also binds to certain receptors on fat cells altering their normal metabolism and disrupting the normal breakdown of fatty materials This tends to encourage the formation of arteryclogging plaques scientists say Arsenic can also scar cells in a way that causes artery walls to thicken restricting blood flow These effects can occur at remarkably low levels of exposure Yu Chen an associate professor of epidemiology at New York University has studied the risks of arsenic at lower ranges of exposure in Bangladesh a country     Dr Chen and her colleagues   in  residents exposed to levels of arsenic in drinking water in only the partsperbillion range Many people in the study were exposed to arsenic for two decades or more Recent evidence suggests that the earlier the age of exposure the more profound the effects  Dr Chen is now planning to look at whether prenatal exposure to arsenic via a mothers drinkingwater consumption can affect blood pressure as early as adolescence  The physical symptoms of arsenic exposure in her mortality study included an increase in irregular heartbeats and a cellbycell thickening of arterial walls She and her colleagues also found that arsenic appeared to amplify the damaging effects of smoking Death rates accelerated sharply among smokers exposed to arsenic Other studies suggest that arsenic may also contribute to the development of diabetes which is another factor in cardiovascular disease As researchers learn more about such risks to heart health they are also pursuing solutions from better education to direct intervention   Dr Lamas is helping to organize a panel at the spring meeting of the American Heart Association that will outline to doctors the dangers of environmental exposure He has also been exploring the idea that chelation  a treatment that helps removed stored metals from the body  might be useful in some cases Dr NavasAcien is continuing to work with Native Americans to reduce their exposure to arsenic Shes planning a new study that will look at whether adding filters to household wells will help bring down cardiovascular disease rates in rural areas   Were increasingly understanding the environmental risks for cardiovascular disease she said Air pollution lead cadmium and arsenic are all proven factors Which leads to a responsibility to do something about that
