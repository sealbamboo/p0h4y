The most indepth look yet at the patients suffering in the current Ebola epidemic provides some important clues about how the virus kills It confirms that bleeding the most horrific symptom of Ebola is very rare It also confirms that people may not be contagious early on in the illness and that treatment even   can save lives And it shows the incubation period is usually much shorter than the  days many focus on  more like six to  days A team of virus experts who have been in Sierra Leone since the epidemic spread there earlier this year documented what they found in the first  patients treated across the country Its the older patients who die the most often   percent of people over age  died in Sierra Leone the researchers report in the New England Journal of Medicine More than half of those under the age of  lived It is really the first time this is possible in an outbreak setting since we were there says Robert Garry a virologist at Tulane University whos part of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium We had people willing to take those measurements fill out the forms we had the laboratory set up there he told NBC News More than  percent of the first patients in Sierra Leone died  a percentage that has stayed consistent On Wednesday the World Health Organization said  people had become infected in the epidemic in Sierra Leone Liberia and Guinea and said  percent are dying Their realtime look at Ebola paints a clear picture of how the epidemics killing people There is a good correlation between how much virus a person has in their blood when they come in and whether they live or die Garry said That doesnt necessarily mean that people who come in after theyve reached the later stages of disease Garry said Some people may be   People that have fatal infections they generally are not able to handle the virus so the viral loads stay high he said There are also some measurements of organ damage that can help doctors predict whos more likely to die The virus circulates in the blood but it attacks the liver and kidneys and perhaps other organs too Measurements of this organ damage  compounds such as creatinine and liver enzymes  were worse in the people who died There is definitely liver damage kidney damage and damage to other internal organs Garry said The virus may well be replicating there Measurements of carbon dioxide also showed who was in the most trouble Carbon dioxide builds up when people pant a sign theyre struggling to breathe The study also confirmed what doctors have been saying in the argument against   traveling back to the US from West Africa If people are    vomiting or suffering from diarrhea  they also have very little virus in their blood That supports the argument that people are not contagious to others when they just feel funny or even if they have a fever I think you can feel a little off and there wont be that much virus in the blood if any Garry said Perhaps most important the study found that   Most of the patients got intravenous saline to replace fluids lost to vomiting and diarrhea oral antibiotics to fight off other infections they might have and supportive care We saw the case fatality rate was definitely lower in patients that getting this treatment Garry said People have the perception that if they are going to one of these treatment centers that they are just going there to die That perception needs to be changed The study also confirmed what the symptoms are   percent of the patients had fever  percent had headache  percent felt weak  percent were dizzy  percent had diarrhea  percent had abdominal pain and  percent had vomiting Only one patient had bleeding The study was only possible because Kenema Government Hospital was already up and running to do research on a different tropical fever  Lassa fever You have to have someone there to take the measurement watch the patient and write it down in a chart Garry said That wouldnt have been possible if the US government and other funders of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium hadnt paid for the team to be there long before Ebola broke out
