This winters frigid temperatures could be having one desirable side effect They may be revving up your metabolism  Shivering in the cold sparks a series of biochemical reactions deep within the body that alters fat cells and bolsters metabolism much as formal exercise does according to a fascinating series of new experiments The findings intimate that exercise and shivering are related in ways not previously suspected    For the new study which was   scientists affiliated with several branches of the National Institutes of Health recruited  healthy adult men and women and invited them to the lab on three separate occasions There the researchers drew blood and obtained small samples of muscle and fat cells  During one lab visit the volunteers completed a short but very intense session of stationary bicycling riding as hard as they could until they were exhausted Then on another day they rode the bike at a gentle easily sustained pace for an hour Throughout these workouts the laboratory temperature was maintained at a moderate  degrees or so  On their final visit though the researchers had each volunteer lie in bed lightly clad for  minutes as the labs temperature dropped from about  to a chilly  degrees Monitors were placed on their skin to measure skin and muscle reactions and by the end of the session the volunteers were noticeably shivering  After each session the scientists gathered more blood and other samples and started checking for changes In particular they wanted to see what was happening with the volunteers white and brown fat Until a few years ago it was widely believed that adult humans do not have brown fat a tissue that is metabolically quite active Unlike white fat it burns calories and generates heat Rodents and rolypoly infants harbor plenty of brown fat which helps to keep them warm since they are not good at shivering But scientists had thought that after childhood humans lost their brown fat and substituted shivering to stay warm Newer studies however have found brown fat stores in humans of all ages But some people have more brown fat than others Scientists were unclear why these differences exist and also why as a species we continue to shiver if we have brown fat Shouldnt one response or the other be sufficient in the face of cold  A   seemed at first to provide some clues In that study animals that produced more of a hormone called irisin had more brown fat than other rodents Irisin the scientists found was created during muscle contractions then traveled through the blood to white fat cells where it actually transformed those blobby cells into desirable calorieburning brown fat Intriguingly the study also found exercise which involves muscle contractions inspired an enormous surge in irisin production and in consequence the conversion of white fat to brown  But many scientists were puzzled by these findings Exercise creates a great deal of heat as working muscle cells burn fuel and generate energy they pointed out In fact in some situations the body cant dump the excess heat and heat illness ensues So why would the body produce a hormone during exercise that would increase body heat still more  The NIH scientists however had a different interpretation They suspected that the proper question was not why exercise would instigate the production of a hormone like irisin Instead they wondered whether irisin production might originally have been sparked by a deeper older biological process And as their experimental results suggest shivering might have been that spark For while the volunteers blood levels of an irisin marker were higher after exercise the markers were just as high after the volunteers had lain quietly in the cold for  minutes not moving except to shiver What seemed to matter the researchers concluded was not the exertion of the exercise but the contraction of various muscles which occurred during shivering as well as cycling  The implications of this finding are subtle but important said Dr Francesco S Celi now a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University but who as an investigator at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases oversaw the experiments  At one level they bolster the idea that exercise increases irisin production leading to larger stores of brown fat in those who exercise But just as important the new study also helps to explain why exercise would cause physiological changes that could so significantly increase body heat he said  We think that shivering came first Dr Celi said In this theory irisin originally was created by the muscular contractions occurring during shivering and exercise increases irisin production not because its exercise but because it is basically an exaggerated form of shivering  Unfortunately there are no indications that exercising in the cold amplifies the production of irisin and brown fat compared with working out in warmer environs Dr Celi said But the new study does suggest that if you cant get to the gym at least consider lingering outside at the bus stop and shivering
