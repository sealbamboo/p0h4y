Alzheimers is a disease without a cure and the available treatments only slow its progression for a bit Now theres evidence vitamin E may help hold it at bay at least for people in the early stages of the disease The finding though inconclusive is a bit of a surprise Vitamin E has gotten a bad rap in recent years A   found that taking high doses of vitamin E increased the risk of death and other studies have shown no benefit in preventing cancer or heart disease And vitamin E hasnt been shown to improve thinking in people with no memory problems or to slow progression to Alzheimers in people mild cognitive impairment But this study found that people with mild to moderate   who took big doses of vitamin E had slower functional declines That slowing effect translates into a delay in progression of about  months over an average of two years The people who took vitamin E were better able to do things like dress themselves and reduced the amount of caregiver help they needed by about  hours a day The study which was published Tuesday in   the journal of the American Medical Association found that the people taking vitamin E also did better than people taking a placebo or Namenda called   generically a drug used to treat symptoms of advanced Alzheimers We are more optimistic says   a researcher with the Minneapolis VA Health Care System who led the study Dysken and his colleagues used to prescribe  international units of vitamin E to Alzheimers patients based on a  study that showed that it helped delay progression of symptoms But the  metaanalysis that showed higher death rates in people who took more than  IU a day dampened their enthusiasm Dysken tells Shots We were very aware of that when we started this trial The group of people in this study taking vitamin E had a slightly lower death rate than the placebo group but the number of participants  patients at  Veterans Affairs medical facilities around the country was too small to prove thats really true It would take thousands of patients to figure that out And other puzzles remain Some of the people in the study were taking memantine along with vitamin E and they didnt see the benefits in the people taking vitamin E alone Dysken says he and his colleagues dont know why They also dont know why   which is an antioxidant might help in the early stages of Alzheimers but not later on Some people think that vitamin E enhances the effect of other Alzheimers drugs like Aricept but this study doesnt prove that But Dysken can see a real benefit for slowing the march of the disease early on I think it would be particularly meaningful for patients in the mild to moderate group Dysken says Patients who are at the end of the illness no one thinks slowing the rate of decline means anything if a patient is six months from going into hospice But earlier in the disease it can be a meaningful difference Lots more work needs to be done to see if this apparent benefit is real according to both Dysken and an editorial accompanying the study And Dysken cautions that Alzheimers patients should be given vitamin E only under a doctors supervision
