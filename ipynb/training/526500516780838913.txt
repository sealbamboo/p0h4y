In the fight against Ebola some government officials in the US are now managing fear not the virus Quarantines have been declared in New York New Jersey and Illinois In Connecticut a West African family of six who recently arrived in the US is in quarantine Others likely will be soon Quarantining those who do not have symptoms is   In fact it will only make matters worse Far worse Why They are not infectious The only way to get Ebola is to have someone vomit on you bleed on you share spit with you have sex with you or get fecal matter on you when they have a high viral load How do we know this Because there is data going back to  from outbreaks in the Congo Uganda Sudan Gabon Ivory Coast South Africa not to mention current experience in the United States Spain and other nations If you dont want to stay in your home or wherever you are supposed to stay for three weeks then what Do we shoot you Taser you drag you back into your house in a protective suit or what And who is responsible for watching you  Quarantine relies on the honor system That essentially is what we count on when we tell people with symptoms to call  or the health department And those challenging it are likely to win Science does not support it If government does not make it tolerable  and they show no signs of doing so other than succeeding in stigmatizing people who are not dangerous  then people will not honor quarantine If you quarantine them you are taking your best professionals offline for three weeks  and there are not a lot of replacements Those who go are heroes who face hell on earth Cant they be trusted to do the right thing and selfmonitor when they get back There is no substitute for that trust None If state and city officials undermine trust out of panic or politics then they destroy the best weapon we have to control Ebola  good science implemented by heroes It may be too late to reverse the leap to quarantine for those politicians deem at risk But it is a leap into an unknown that we are likely to come to regret
