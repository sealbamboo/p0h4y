Many runners in Sundays New York City Marathon may be overlooking a simple way to improve their finishing time according to a new study of marathon nutrition The study finds that consuming the right number of sports gels at the right moments during the race could help average runners achieve betterthanaverage results  No one should be surprised to learn that what and when a marathoner eats will affect how well he or she runs Decades ago physiologists established that runners who consumed plenty of carbohydrates in the week or so before a race were less likely to become severely fatigued during the grueling event But the subsequent vogue for carboloading by downing large bowls of pasta for days before a marathon has cooled as newer science and practical experience have shown that carboloading can result in shortterm weight gain and gastrointestinal distress during the race  Instead the   that eating a carbohydraterich diet on the day just before the race but not earlier can be beneficial for marathoners  Few recent studies however had systematically examined how best to fuel during the race itself and those studies typically had concentrated on elite finishers not slower recreational runners So for the new study which was   in Colorado Springs scientists at Aalborg University in Denmark turned to  local runners who were training for the Copenhagen marathon and asked them about their aspirations for the race as well as their past running history including how they previously had fueled and hydrated during races  The runners male and female most in their mids were experienced but not elite runners In general they expected to finish the marathon in a time between threeandahalf and four hours they told the scientists  To more objectively determine their speed and likely finishing times the scientists asked each runner to complete a kilometer  mile race seven weeks before the marathon Afterward they numerically paired racers whose times were equivalent linking the two fastest runners two slowest and so on  Then they divided those pairs randomly assigning a runner from each unit to one of two groups The runners in one group were told to fuel and hydrate during the marathon however they chose The scientists offered them no advice They had no such reticence with the second group of runners These racers were provided with clear specific directives about how and when to eat and drink during the marathon in order to avoid dehydration  and overhydration  and depletion of glycogen which is the bodys main fuel during exercise said Ernst Hansen an associate professor in the department of health science and technology at Aalborg University who led the study  The specific instructions required each runner to consume two sportsgel packets and a glass or two of water  or  minutes before the start of the race Each gel packet contained  grams or about  teaspoons of carbohydrates in the form of maltodextrin and glucose as well as a small amount of sodium and caffeine  The runners were directed to consume another packet  minutes into the race and another every  minutes from then on until they crossed the finish line They were also told to drink a cup or two of water at the races  water stops in order to stay hydrated and speed digestion of the gels  All  of the runners completed the marathon  Followup questioning by the scientists showed that those runners who had been on their own nutritionally consumed significantly fewer carbohydrates or calories of any kind during the race than the runners on the scientific program  Those racers generally finished somewhere near their hopedfor time  But the runners who followed the scientists plan and consumed far more carbohydrates finished about  minutes faster on average than their pacematched pair notably outperforming their goals in most cases Interestingly the scientists found no correlation between consuming more carbohydrates and experiencing greater digestive upset Some runners in each group reported such distress But those runners generally had a history of gastrointestinal problems while running the scientists found Consuming more or fewer carbohydrates did not noticeably affect how the Danish runners digestive tracts responded  The studys results do not mean of course that all athletes signed up for Sundays marathon should stuff their pockets with gel packets The Danish runners in the scientifically mandated nutrition group practiced their eating schedule during training If you are unsure how your system might respond to so much goo or you have a history of digestive distress while running by all means stick with your familiar and practiced nutritional routine Dr Hansen said But otherwise you might consider eating more during the race he said and perhaps finishing faster
