Maryland health officials have reached an unprecedented deal to limit medical spending and abandon decades of expensively paying hospitals for each extra procedure they perform If the plan works Maryland hospitals will be financially rewarded for keeping people out of the hospital  a once unimaginable arrangement This is without any question the boldest proposal in the United States in the last half century to grab the problem of cost growth by the horns said   a health care economist at Princeton University After months of negotiations with state and the federal officials the hospitals also agreed that their revenue from all sources  private insurance government and employers  will rise no faster than growth in the overall state economy Maryland regulators with the power to cap spending will enforce the agreement which could serve as a model for other states and eventually the nation Enforcement muscle gives Marylands deal a better chance to succeed than a similar measure passed last year in Massachusetts Gov Martin OMalley a Democrat is scheduled to announce the plan on Friday Hospital spending in Maryland grew twice as fast as the states overall economy in the last decade as hospitals added  jobs Starting this year hospitals have agreed that their average spending per Maryland resident will grow by no more than half that rate Specifically statewide hospital revenue for inpatient as well as outpatient care will rise no more than  percent annually  the states rate of per capita economic growth since  Carmela Coyle CEO of the   called the plan historic and a challenge adding We needed to move away from a feeforservicedriven health care system where the incentive was to do more to be paid more and instead move to a system where the incentives are aligned to what we all feel needs to be done The agreement had to be blessed by the federal Department of Health and Human Services which runs the Medicare program offering coverage to seniors and helps fund Medicaid care for the poor In a unique arrangement dating to the s HHS lets Maryland set prices paid to hospitals by Medicare and Medicaid  as well as by everybody else While many argue the scheme has saved money Medicare still pays Maryland hospitals substantially more than what it pays hospitals elsewhere To get HHS approval Maryland officials promised to slow Medicare spending growth more than in the rest of the country over the next five years generating  million in federal savings Hospitals also agreed to sharply   acquired inside the hospital and expensive readmissions of patients discharged up to a month earlier The fact that doctors and other community caregivers arent part of the agreement however could hinder coordination said   a health economist at the American Enterprise Institute This has some policy objectives some measurable financial goals that I think are very difficult to meet Antos said It doesnt necessarily give the hospitals enough tools or the will to make all this work out But hospitals may have concluded that the Maryland plan offers more stability than possible alternatives Elsewhere insurers and employers are starting to pit hospitals against each other presenting the risk of a fierce price war like the airlines Princetons Reinhardt said You could tell the hospitals in Maryland Dont bellyache Youre no worse off than everyone else out there
