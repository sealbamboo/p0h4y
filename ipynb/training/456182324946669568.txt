When actor Philip Seymour Hoffman died of an overdose in February the New York City medical examiner ruled that his death was the result of acute mixed drug intoxication Heroin cocaine and a widely prescribed class of drugs known as benzodiazepines or benzos were found in his system The drugs first burst onto the scene in the s and s and quickly became known as   the mild tranquilizer that could soothe frazzled housewives nerves More than four decades later benzos  including Valium Xanax Klonopin and Ativan  are used to treat anxiety mood disorders and insomnia  the medical director of the behavioral department at St Marys Regional Medical Center in Lewiston Maine says he doesnt go a single day without seeing somebody addicted to them He says when he first took the job  years ago about  percent of the detox patients were alcoholics and the rest were drug addicts Now he says  percent of them are drug addicts whose drugs of choice often include the combined use of   and benzos both are sedatives that can slow respiration Its actually pretty rare to see somebody only using only one he says  and thats incredibly dangerous Benzodiazepines and the opiates both can cause death when you take too much of them he adds But they potentiate each other  they make each other stronger And so one plus one doesnt equal two it equals three or four Sayra Small says that in her early s it was easy to find a doctor willing to prescribe benzos for her anxiety She loved them because they worked so well It makes it so you have no problem she says I mean the house could burn down and youd just sit there saying OK this is all right The problem was she was also addicted to prescription painkillers and heroin And pretty soon Small says she was dependent on benzos too When you first start using opiates you instantly get the rush Well for me I loved the rush but that wasnt about it It was the feeling afterwards of just feeling so content Lots of people call it the nod  she says And that stops happening after a while just using opiates So its the benzos and opiates together that still produce that nod It feels very easy when youre feeling that way too like you could just slip away Small almost did slip away She says she overdosed several times before getting into recovery  but she was lucky Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that the combination of benzos and opioids contribute to about   of opioidrelated deaths Small ended up in the care of Dr Mark Publicker an addiction specialist with the Mercy Recovery Center in Westbrook Maine He says he thinks the risks associated with benzos have been overshadowed by the prescription opioid epidemic They do produce a strong physical dependence that can create lifethreatening withdrawal seizures and other consequences but I think that the perception that theyre harmful is low he says Small learned that the hard way She says her detox for benzos was far more difficult than it was for the opioid painkillers she was also abusing I mean I couldnt move I couldnt eat I dont want to say anything too graphic but anything you had came out one end or the other But emotionally she says you just feel stripped You feel naked to the world Now  Small has been in recovery for a couple of years She still gets anxious but says shes learned to deal with life on her own terms without relying on the medications she thought were her friends
