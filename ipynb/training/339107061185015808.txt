
 There is no question most skin cancers are related to sun exposure yet even with sunscreen sales approaching  billion a year   rates continue to climb   diagnoses have risen   and are increasing even more among young white women Some experts blame inappropriate use of sunscreen saying that people do not apply enough lotion a golfballsize dollop or do not reapply it every two hours as instructed But theres another major concern Until recently many sunscreens with a high sun protection factor or SPF were designed primarily to protect people from ultraviolet B rays the main cause of   These sunscreens may have enabled users to stay out longer but did not necessarily protect them from ultraviolet A rays These are associated with aging and skin damage but some experts believe they may also be implicated in skin cancer Experts are urging people to limit their time in the sun especially at midday and protect their skin with hats shirts and coverups instead of relying exclusively on sunscreen Sunscreen is not a magic bullet said Dr Steven Q Wang director of dermatologic surgery and dermatology at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center in Basking Ridge NJ and a spokesman for the   which receives funding from sunscreen manufacturers Its just one of the defenses against the harmful effect of UV radiation and that message gets lost This summer most of the sunscreen on store shelves must conform to new Food and Drug Administration labeling rules that may help remedy consumer misperceptions Still concerns remain about ingredients in some sunscreens Use of the label broad spectrum protection now means the sunscreen has been proved to protect against both UVA and UVB rays although the UVA protection may be comparatively weaker Any product with an SPF lower than  must carry a label warning that it will not protect against skin cancer Products cannot claim to be waterproof only waterresistant and labels must note a time limit of either  or  minutes before the sunscreen is ineffective Manufacturers can still sell sunscreens with SPFs that exceed  though FDA officials are evaluating whether they should remain on the market said Reynold Tan a scientist in the agencys Division of Nonprescription Regulation Development Its not clear that sunscreens with higher SPFs actually are more effective and consumers may not apply them as frequently Advocates like Sonya Lunder a senior analyst for the Environmental Working Group and an author of its report on sunscreen have criticized the FDA for backing away from some of its own proposals like putting in place a star system that would give consumers more information about UVA and UVB protection capping the SPF values allowed on the market at  and banning sunscreen sprays which may not work as well to prevent sunburn Europe and Canada have tougher standards Ms Lunder said In the US you can make a bad sunscreen and just not call it broad spectrum but still sell it she said In Europe the passfail test is stronger and it must protect against both UVA and UVB Here is some advice to bear in mind when selecting sunscreen   Look for products with an SPF of  to  and that are labeled broad spectrum protection meaning they protect against both UVA and UVB rays Higher SPF values are misleading Its like the gas mileage sticker on a car Its based on test conditions that youll never achieve in the real world said Ms Lunder   Keep babies younger than  months out of the sun as their skin is especially sensitive Sunscreen   If they are outdoors keep them completely covered and in the shade   Try to keep older children inside when the sun is harshest from  am to  pm A bad sunburn in childhood or   doubles the risk of melanoma later in life according to the Skin Cancer Foundation   Avoid sunscreen sprays The FDA has banned sunscreen powders though some products may still be available and has asked for more data on sprays The concern is twofold that not enough sunscreen makes it onto the skin and that the spray may be inhaled into the lungs   Avoid products with vitamin A   or its derivatives such as retinyl palmitate and retinyl acetate At the moment the FDA says there isnt enough evidence to suggest these are harmful but the Canadian health authorities appear to be concerned that the additives increase sun sensitivity They have proposed requiring that sunscreens with retinyl palmitate carry a warning saying     The Environmental Working Group recommends avoiding products with oxybenzone a chemical that may disrupt hormones Though research has found this effect many scientists say the effect is so weak as to be insignificant The advocacy group however recommends products that use   oxide and titanium dioxide as active ingredients These products may leave a milky white film on the skin   Look for fragrancefree products Scents bring more unnecessary chemicals and potential allergens to the mix   Take endorsements and seals of approval with a grain of salt The Skin Cancer Foundation gives a seal of recommendation to sunscreens but only if their manufacturer has donated  to become a member of the organization
