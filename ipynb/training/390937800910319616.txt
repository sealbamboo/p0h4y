Remember how that fight over the budget was all about Obamacare Seems like ancient history now but House Republicans ostensibly shut down the government  days ago demanding   and when that failed a   in the health law When it became clear that President Obama and Senate Democrats werent going to yield to demands to stop or slow implementation of the administrations signature legislative achievement Republicans looked for smaller changes They floated the idea of killing or delaying an unpopular tax on medical devices Many Senate Democrats joined Republicans in   of displeasure on the tax earlier this year The Republicans also looked to take away   for congressional and executive branch   And they proposed to delay a   intended to build a fund to help pay for highcost cases None of those things ended up in   that reopened the federal government and raised the debt ceiling Wednesday night So what did Well there was a little language related to the health law It requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services certify to the Congress that the Exchanges verify that individuals who get subsidies for premiums and costsharing are in fact eligible And that the secretary shall submit a report to the Congress that details the procedures employed by the American Health Benefit Exchanges to verify eligibility for credit and costsharing Sounds like a big deal Not really It so happens that the muchmaligned   thats part of the health exchange already links to the IRS to verify income eligibility So basically the law requires HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to write a letter explaining what the department is already doing But its not just that the Republicans failed to make any changes to the health law in their day tirade against the government News coverage of the shutdown and potential default crowded out stories about   of the health exchanges themselves As s Ezra Klein tweeted Wednesday
