In  when   that would establish prescription drug coverage he called it a promise a solemn promise to Americas seniors Medicare Part D which took effect in  initially made plenty of people angry Some Congressional Democrats had argued that it would privatize Medicare by relying on insurance companies while a number of Republicans insisted that the nation couldnt afford the new program Ordinary older adults learned to fear falling into the infamous doughnut hole coverage gap But in its first few years national data shows Part D did help elderly Medicare beneficiaries make modest progress   Better able to afford their medications seniors were less likely to stop taking them for financial reasons And they were less likely to do without other basic needs  like food and heat  in order to pay for drugs I expected that to keep going said Jeanne Madden a health policy analyst at Harvard Medical School Instead as she and a team researchers from Harvard and the University of Massachusetts report in the most recent issue of Health Affairs those   in  Things improved after Part D continued to improve for a few years and then reversed she said in an interview Moreover having tracked a representative national sample of  beneficiaries Dr Madden said the researchers determined that the people who are more ill and need more medications have particular problems A few numbers In  the year before Part D nearly  percent of elderly beneficiaries acknowledged what the researchers with scientists usual flair for language called costrelated nonadherence meaning people stopped taking prescribed medications skipped or reduced doses to make drugs last longer or delayed refills Its a medically risky strategy and the proportion practicing it dropped to  percent in  then to  percent in  But in  it rose again to  percent The same pattern shows up for forgoing basic needs to pay for drugs Close to  percent of beneficiaries reported doing that in  by  only  percent did But in  the proportion climbed back to  percent  a statistically significant change Compounding the problem is that affordability has eroded the most for people with the greatest needs The study looked at beneficiaries with four or more chronic conditions including cardiac disease hypertension diabetes stroke cancer pulmonary diseases and others In this group nonadherence fell from  percent in  to  percent in  by  it had rebounded to  percent Similarly forgoing basic needs to afford medication decreased from  percent in  to  percent in  before climbing again to  percent Its not surprising that people with multiple health problems are taking the hit They require more medications and with every one even with small copays the total adds up Dr Madden said People are on fixed incomes and may struggle to pay their bills And theyre more likely to hit that doughnut hole which is still there though Obamacare will close it by  The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey from which the researchers drew the data doesnt ask people why they cant afford their prescribed drugs but the Great Recession likely contributed Dr Madden said Seniors too faced foreclosures and shrunken IRAs and other nest eggs and Social Security paid no cost of living increases in  and  But Part D plans have been changing too They appear to be covering fewer medications Dr Madden said Theyre using more tiering strategies putting some drugs in very highpriced tiers They may require preauthorization from a doctor  another hurdle People may be facing more restrictions Possibly data from  and  will bring better news it will take a couple of years for more recent data to become available for analysis In the meantime the researchers suggest working to increase the number of lowincome seniors receiving   many who are eligible   Assisting beneficiaries in choosing the best Part D plan  often a   as Jane Gross has recounted here  might also make drugs more affordable Rep Jan Schakowsky the Illinois Democrat who introduced legislation requiring nursing homes to have registered nurses on duty around the clock has tackled this problem too Her bill   that negotiates with pharmaceutical companies for lowerpriced medications For several years   for Medicare recipients  at a lower than projected cost to taxpayers  so this recent reversal of the trend looks like a fixable problem Otherwise if sick old people must choose between refilling prescriptions and turning up the thermostat and if they skip doses to save money the solemn promise President Bush made has been broken
