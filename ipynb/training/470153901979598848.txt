Local produce just tastes better right That perception is part of whats driving the rush of new farming ventures to supply cities with food grown nearby Some urban farmers are even experimenting with growing food a few blocks away from or even inside the grocery store Call it  local food Most of these new ventures are lead by idealistic entrepreneurs who want to part of the new food system Its not yet clear whether theyll fit in for the long haul Take for example a Whole Foods Market in Brooklyn NY In addition to its artisanal pickle bar beer garden and vinyl section this stateoftheart grocery store has a square foot rooftop greenhouse producing herbs salads and tomatoes The greenhouse is owned and operated by Gotham Greens a company thats selling produce grown in this greenhouse and another one in the city to Whole Foods local restaurants and food vendors The Brooklyn Whole Foods still gets most of its produce from farms big and small all over the world and only  percent of   produce goes downstairs   the companys CEO tells The Salt Puri says his produce is competitive because its extrafresh The longest distance it travels is across the city and the shortest is down a flight of stairs he says And while Gotham Greens produce isnt the cheapest option  a basket of tomatoes costs about five bucks  it is priced similarly to other local organic veggies at Whole Foods But can you really taste the difference between something grown a flight of stairs away versus  miles away To us Gotham Greens rooftop tomatoes werent all that different from the ones youd find at a farmers market But they do give customers more options And since the company grows everything in a computercontrolled hydroponic greenhouse it can offer organic seasonal produce like tomatoes and herbs all year round Theyre very coddled plants Puri says If rooftoptoregister isnt berlocal and berfresh enough for you youll want to check out the   a whole new kind of grocery store where customers can pick their own produce right in the city The prototype shop in Durham NC is built out of a shipping container It sells herbs and leafy greens grown onsite in wallmounted panels as well as local produce from nearby farms You can really see the growing process and understand the value of it says Ben Greene who thought up the project as an industrial design student at North Carolina State University Greene says the shipping container is just a small bite of what hed like to build Hes designed prototypes of an square foot grocery store built out of eight shipping containers with aquaponics included Fish fresh veggies and gourmet mushrooms will all be produced inhouse Greene says This model designed to be in urban neighborhoods Greene tells The Salt And the target customers will be healthconscious consumers He says hes talking to developers but he hasnt finalized where he plans to build the first largeformat   Unlike Gotham Greens and the Farmery   another firm thats focused on supplying local food to cities is doing it big Its business model is based around partnerships with medium and large grocery chains like Giant to which it supplies produce from hydroponic greenhouses Its square foot greenhouse in Bucks County Pa for example grows greens and tomatoes for McCaffreys stores all over Pennsylvania and New Jersey Tiktinsky tells The Salt the company focuses on produce that normally has to travel long distances It also makes it easy for big retailers to get in on the hyperlocal trend Customers want produce that look uniform and consistently delivered Tiktinsky says And thats hard for a small local farm subject to unpredictable weather and seasonal limitations to provide But were not trying to displace local growers The model seems to be working well for BrightFarms which is in the process of developing seven new largescale greenhouse farms   the country Of course  locavores have another option if none of this sounds appealing Build a   in your very own home
