Partly blaming the health reform law United Parcel Service is set to remove thousands of spouses from its medical plan because they are eligible for coverage elsewhere Many analysts downplay the Affordable Care Acts effect on companies such as UPS noting that the move is part of a longterm trend of shrinking corporate medical benefits But the shipping giant repeatedly cites the act to explain the decision adding fuel to the debate over whether the law erodes traditional employer coverage Rising medical costs combined with the costs associated with the Affordable Care Act have made it increasingly difficult to continue providing the same level of health care benefits to our employees at an affordable cost UPS said in The company told whitecollar workers two months ago that  working spouses eligible for coverage at their own employers would be excluded from the UPS plan in  The Fortune  firm expects the move which applies to nonunion US workers only to save about  million a year said company spokesman Andy McGowan UPS becomes one of the highestprofile employers yet to bar working spouses from the company plan Many firms already require employees to pay a surcharge for workingspouse medical coverage but some are taking the next step by declining to include them at all consultants say They are simply saying to the spouse outright If you have coverage somewhere else you are not eligible here said Edward Fensholt a senior vice president at Lockton Cos a large insurance broker We dont see a lot of that out there but more than we used to This year  percent of large employers   by consultants Towers Watson excluded spouses if they had similar coverage where they work Another  percent planned such a change for  according to the survey When healthcare reform came on the scene a few years ago we definitely saw an uptick in companies wanting to explore a workingspouse provision said Steve Noury national sales director for HMS Employer Solutions which monitors dependents eligibility for corporate benefits We have seen them over the past two or three years putting those in place The healthcare law requires large employers to cover employees and dependent children but not spouses or domestic partners UPS spouses may have difficulty finding similar coverage at their own employers The  innetwork family deductible   for example is less than the nationwide average of    the Kaiser Family Foundation Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation Health coverage for spouses became standard in the s when wives were less likely to work outside the home The rise of twoincome households led in many cases to two family health plans but employers have been slow to address the overlap Companies have employed varying tactics to get spouses off their plans The city of Anacortes Wash pays employees a bonus if spouses get coverage elsewhere said human resources director Emily Schuh This year Xerox went the opposite way charging employees who enroll working spouses a  annual penalty which rises to  next year   Spouse and domestic partner coverage at Xerox is intended primarily for those who do not have their own access to employer provided medical coverage said company spokesman Bill McKee One large employer in five collects a surcharge on covered spouses who are eligible for insurance at their own workplace according to the Towers Watson survey Another  percent planned to add such a working spouse penalty next year Now employers are mimicking the city of Richmond Ind which excluded working spouses from its health plan starting in January mainly because too many employees were taking them up on their offer We have all these employers around us who are not covering working spouses said Richmond human resources director Sue Roberson You almost have to do it out of selfdefense The new plan at UPS which    million last year on revenue of  billion affects about a quarter of its US workforce The company is sharing part of the savings with employees reducing premiums for workers whose spouses leave the plan Neither the company nor the Teamsters union would say whether a pending contract for bluecollar workers includes healthcoverage changes for working spouses To explain the switch UPS gave workers a memo obtained by KHN that repeatedly mentions the health act While acknowledging that overall health spending continues to rise the company also blamed cost increases on the Affordable Care Acts   initially  per health plan member then rising to  and an a   of  per member to stabilize new online marketplaces for consumers buying directly from insurers Other factors are the acts ban on annual and lifetime coverage limits and its requirement to cover dependent children up to age  UPS said The laws mandate for individuals to obtain coverage will nudge employees who previously opted out to enroll also raising costs the company said   The health law is one of the reasons that UPS is implementing the changes McGowan said Advocates of the law argue that its costs are minimal compared with the burden of overall medicalinsurance inflation which the ACA was designed in part to control The notion that those are going to be makeorbreak when they are otherwise absorbing  to  percent a year in broader healthcost increases is kind of ridiculous said Jonathan Gruber an MIT economist who advised the Obama administration on health policy Nobody expected the ACA to have a major effect on health costs for large firms The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office   that the laws effect on premiums for large employers would be negligible Consultants point to another health law effect however that could also give employers a reason to dump spouses Excluding wives might help keep companies from paying the Cadillac tax on highvalue plans that takes effect in  analysts said Also women in their childbearing years are a cost driver said Julie Stone a senior benefits consultant at Towers Watson If you have female spouses and you decide not to cover them youre going to bring costs down The Obama administration would not respond directly to UPSs statements but said that employer coverage increased when Massachusetts implemented its own version of the health overhaul  The health care law will make health insurance more affordable strengthen small businesses and make it easier for employers to provide coverage to their workers said Joanne Peters spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services Stone doesnt expect widespread exclusion of working spouses until the health acts public insurance exchanges scheduled to open in October mature Once companies know theres an alternative for working spouses they may accelerate the practice she said But first theyre going to talk about it for a few years she said
