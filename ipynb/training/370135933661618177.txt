The average familys health insurance now costs about  and workers pay more than a quarter of that according to a new survey But health insurance premiums for jobbased family coverage rose a relatively modest  percent reflecting slowed health spending according to a survey of about  employers released Tuesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research  Educational Trust KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation Nonetheless workers are likely to feel an increased pinch from health care costs More than a third have annual deductibles of at least  this year before their insurance kicks in while wages continue to grow far more slowly than health insurance costs  Premiums for the average family plan topped  for the first time with workers paying on average  toward that cost not counting copays and deductibles the survey found The average cost of a single employees insurance premiums rose  percent to  with workers paying an average of  the survey found Workers wages increased  percent on average while general inflation rose  percent The survey was done between January and May of this year   The premium increase this year is very moderate but the pain factor for health insurance cost has not disappeared said Drew Altman president and CEO of the foundation Over time what people pay for health care has dramatically eclipsed both their wages and inflation The increases documented in the report moderate by historic standards come amid ongoing debate over the federal health care laws ability to rein in health care costs  In July the Obama administration granted a   until  in the requirement that employers with  or more workers offer coverage or risk a fine prompting Republicans to call for a similar delay in the rule requiring most individuals to carry coverage Critics and opponents have also sparred over whether the health law will slow premium growth  All sides may find fodder in the report You will have the administration and the Democrats saying Look how the health law is helping moderate health cost increases and Republicans and those against the law will say It hasnt done anything because costs are still four times inflation  said Paul Fronstin director of the Health Research and Education Program at the Employee Benefit Research Institute a nonpartisan Washington think tank The employer survey found that  percent of firms with more than  workers offer coverage down from  percent in the  survey Overall  percent of all employers offer health insurance to their workers down from  percent decade ago  The rate of coverage by employers with  or more workers remained steady with about  percent offering insurance Coverage drops off with firm size with only  percent of the smallest companies offering insurance to workers down from  percent in  Other findings include One of the changes in this report is the growth in deductibles said economist Paul Ginsburg of the Center for Studying Health System Change a nonpartisan research group in Washington The deductibles were likely a factor behind the premium increase being as low as it was Workers in small firms with  to  employees have an average annual deductible of  compared with  for those in larger firms Small businesses generally see more volatile insurance premium rates than larger firms Scott Hauge who runs an insurance brokerage firm in California says his clients have seen increases averaging around  percent a year for the past seven years He doesnt dispute the findings of the survey but added that small businesses are not seeing those minor increases Analysts say premium increases are cyclical with periods of rapid increases such as the doubledigit hikes that marked the late s and the early s followed by periods of slower growth Since about the mids rate increases paid by employers fell below  percent each year with the smallest annual growth tracked at  percent in the  employer survey In what surprised many analysts rates jumped by  percent from  to  before moderating the past two years to around  percent Some employers say changes associated with the health law such as a provision allowing adult children to stay on their parents plans until age  are adding costs Were all seeing it said Forrest Cook vice president of human resources at NCP Solutions a employee company in Birmingham Ala We have around a  percent to  percent increase this year Before that our costs held steady for about three or four years Cook was also concerned with the uncertainty surrounding the health law such as the year delay in the requirement that large employers provide health coverage or pay a penalty His firm does not require workers to pay a large sum before their insurance kicks in because when you have a high deductible plan its going to discourage people from using it Cook said But the firm is enthusiastic about wellness programs as are  percent of employers in the survey who consider them an effective strategy for controlling costs Such programs range widely from providing small gifts to employees for filling out a health risk questionnaire to offering large reductions in premiums for workers who get screened and meet certain goals for weight blood pressure cholesterol or blood sugar  The federal health law   those financial incentives from  percent of the cost of the health coverage to  percentÂ  NCP offers workers financial incentives to participate in wellness programs including getting flu shots and checking blood pressure Those who sign up for a stopsmoking class get credit for paid time off Cook said And the firm discusses health costs with workers Were very honest about the cost of our plan said Cook whose firm is selfinsured We tell people if you control the cost of the health plan if youre lively and well it will cost us less
