Obesity kills far more Americans than we think it does according to a controversial new study that suggests obesity accounts of about  percent of all deaths in the United States  three times previous estimates  The research published in the American Journal of Public Health suggests the latest government estimates softpedal the dangers of obesity And the controversy over the findings show how difficult it is to calculate the costs of being overweight  With a third of Americans overweight and another  percent obese its not a trivial question The federal government has been in hot water over the issue before In  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention slashed its estimates of obesityrelated deaths from  a year to  a year amid a battle over how it made its calculations And a few recent studies have shown that for people over  having a little extra pudge may be protective But Ryan Masters who did the latest study while at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Columbia University says hes found obesity is the cause of  percent of deaths among women and  percent of men We found that obesity indeed has a quite significant effect on mortality levels in the United States and estimates are actually significantly larger than prevailing wisdom has suggested Masters told NBC News Existing literature largely indicates roughly about  percent of all adult deaths in the United States could be associated with overweight or obesity Masters says What we find is that between the ages of  and   about  percent of all deaths that took place between  and  could be said to be associated with high body mass Masters thinks this may get worse Theres now a whole generation of Americans who have been obese from childhood and will be obese their whole lives The effects on them may be much worse he predicts Other experts immediately questioned the way Masters made his calculations He used data from several national health surveys that ask people among other things how much they weigh and how tall they are  which in turn are used to calculate body mass index BMI and show whether someone is overweight or obese The data covers  years from  to  Then he looked at death records for the same people Previous research has likely underestimated obesitys impact on US mortality Masters and colleagues wrote Importantly counter to most extant research obesitys effect on mortality risk grows stronger with increasing age In  and again in January Dr Katherine Flegal and colleagues at the National Center for Health Statistics have found that being overweight may if youre  or older  When you look at the association between weight and mortality the association is weak Flegal told NBC News  although she says younger people who are obese do have a clearly higher risk of dying early Masters says these numbers leave out people in hospitals and nursing homes for one thing From our findings obesity actually has a very strong and substantial effect on old age mortality risk he says Why is this so hard to figure out In part its because obesity isnt a direct cause of death  The CDC doesnt list obesity as a   Instead it lists heart disease as the No  cause killing nearly  people a year while cancer kills  Overall nearly  million Americans died in  People who are overweight or obese are far more likely than thinner people to have heart disease cancer diabetes and to have strokes or heart attacks Usually but not always fatter people are less fit than thinner people and exercise can clearly protect you from death and disease They didnt account for smoking other risk factors like alcohol consumption says Kenneth Thorpe a former Health and Human Services department official who is now an expert on health policy at Emory University in Atlanta The study doesnt account for health insurance status and we know that contributes to mortality rates People who are obese are more likely to smoke than people who are not Thorpe says and they eat more unhealthful foods Other studies have found that the more educated people are the less likely they are to be obese and the more they earn the thinner they are A third of American adults who earn less than  per year are obese compared with about a quarter of those who earn at least  per year the nonprofit Trust for Americas Health found in its   report last year  The groups Jeff Levi says its important to distinguish between whether being fat causes death or whether its just correlated with death Either way its bad Whatever the disagreements among researchers we know that obesity is not good for your health Levi says This years report finds Louisiana has passed Mississippi for the dubious distinction of being the state with the most obese people It finds rates of adult Americans with a BMI of  or higher have grown in the past  years from  percent to  percenta  percent increase  Even if the nation holds steady at the current rates Baby Boomerswho are aging into obesityrelated illnessesand the rapidly rising numbers of extremely obese Americans are already translating into a cost crisis for the healthcare system and Medicare Levi says Former Health and Human Services secretary and Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson says this finding demonstrates why Medicare should pay for obesity treatments and why obesity should be classified as a separate disease He applauds the   If we are going to get a handle on healthcare costs obesity is front and center he said in a telephone interview  We simply must stop waiting for people to get sick and then spend infinitely more trying to make them well again he added Covering obesity is a nobrainer and we must begin behaving rationally if we are going to come to grips with rising health costs and a population thats getting sicker
