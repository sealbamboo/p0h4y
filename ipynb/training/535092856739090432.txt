                  These medications almost all work better to prevent allergy symptoms than they do to treat them so people should not wait until theyre having symptoms to start taking their medicines says David Rosenstreich MD the director of the Division of Allergy and Immunology at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx New York 
                   
                  Same with asthma Dont skip controller meds until youre short of breath Its easier to fix the problems when theyre mild People should make an effort to be aware of the pollen count and when the pollens are out that bother them says Dr Rosenstreich

                  Grasses and trees start releasing pollen at sunrise with levels peaking in the late morning and early afternoon I always suggest people run after work in the late afternoon or evening she says 
                   
                  Exercising when pollen counts are lower Dr Rosenstreich agrees can make an enormous difference And if pollen counts are going to be high on a given day opt for a less strenuous workout Room air purifiers and filters are an extremely effective way to remove pollen animal dander dust and other allergens from indoor air Find out   
                   
                  But unless you close the doors and windows in the room where youre using one its basically useless because theyre only meant to filter roomsize areasnot your entire house or the great outdoors If you need to carry an EpiPen an auotinjector because youre at high risk of a serious allergic reaction check every year to make sure its expiration date hasnt passed and replace it if it has Dr Rosenstreich says 
                   
                  Its also a bad idea to keep your EpiPen in the car where it can be exposed to temperature extremes that make it less effective 
                   
                  Be sure to learn how to use it properly Dr Rosenstreich advises You dont want to start reading the label in the middle of an attack Finally he adds be aware that once the safety cap is off the needle will inject anything it touches Stuffed animals are cute cuddly and unfortunately major magnets for dust a common allergy trigger 
                   
                  If your child has piles of fluffy friends and he or sheor anyone in the householdhas allergies youre better off storing or giving them away Many charities collect stuffed animals to give to needy kids or even as puppy play toys 
                   
                  Its best to limit youngsters to a select few which can be occasionally washed rather than a whole collection Dr Rosenstreich says Adults can become allergic to pets or pollen after years of allergyfree living 
                   
                  If you need antibiotics for sinusitis every spring you may have a pollen allergy says Dr Nguyen who recommends a visit to the allergist Repeated use of antibiotics is not necessary can lead to drug allergy and doesnt help the pollen allergy she says 
                   
                  You can become allergic to a pet and not know it because symptoms are subtle and chronic If youve got allergyish symptoms that never go away get it checked out Love that cozy comforter It might be trouble particularly if youve had it for a long time 
                   
                  Feathers can be very allergenic and become even more so as they age and break down says Dr Rosenstreich Ill have people tell me Ive had this feather pillow for  years I brought it from Romania its never bothered me before he adds Thats precisely the point 
                   
                  Synthetic pillow stuffing like polyester fiberfill is a better choice for people with allergies You can make your pillows even less sneezeinducing by getting dust miteproof covers for them and while youre at it for your mattress It may seem sweet to snooze with your pup or kitty at night but its not a great idea if you have allergies 
                   
                  Even if youre not allergic to animals pets can bring in pollen dust mold and other allergens from the outdoors Dr Rosenstreich notes Its best to avoid letting your dog or cat hang out on your bed 
                   
                  Your bedroom should essentially be an allergyfree zone he says For the same reason youre better off with bare floors in the bedroom or only using a rug or two that you can throw in the wash periodically Sorry folks but theres no such animal as a truly hypoallergenic pet Beyond a snake or lizard 
                   
                  While   experts say any furry animal can cause symptoms in susceptible individuals 
                   
                  Even hairless cats and dogs are allergenic its not the fur that makes people sneeze but flakes of skin called dander and proteins found in the animals saliva and urine People can be allergic to birds too Dr Rosenstreich warns 
                   
                  A single big bird can cause a lot of problems for people and often they will not realize it because allergy can take a long time to develop he says 
                   
                  Allergists advise against living with an animal if youre allergic to it If you cant or dont want to find a new home for your beloved pet consider allergy shots which can help reduce symptoms in some people
