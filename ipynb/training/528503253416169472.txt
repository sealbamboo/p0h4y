For the past  years Jill Andrews has been making extravagant dresses for brides and whimsical costumes for actors But this past weekend the yearold   from Baltimore used her sewing skills to create a different kind of garment an antiEbola protection suit Andrews was one of  people taking part in an Ebola suit design challenge last weekend organized by global health nonprofit   and Johns Hopkins University There were engineering students public health workers and virologists in the mix And one seamstress Andrews But she wasnt really an oddball choice for the event We first heard about Andrews on an   with Public Radio International Intrigued we reached out to her Turns out wedding gowns and personal protective garb arent an odd couple They have to be very carefully constructed and thoughtfully taken off and put on she says Between disinfecting the outer gloves removing the goggles and washing your hands there are  steps to     if you count the inspection protocols before and after the suit comes off Health workers must perform each step with great care in case there are bits of virus on their gear But accidental exposure can happen if theyre tired hot and in a hurry So suits need to be cooler and easier to take off says   senior technical advisor at Jhpiego Andrews says when organizers demonstrated how to take off a protective suit step by step it was akin to watching a horror show You just saw so many  literally  holes in the process she says The demonstrators were doing it in an airconditioned room and they werent tired and they were making so many mistakes One womans hair kept falling in her face and Andrews says it made her cringe each time a suit wearers hands got close to his or her face The participants formed eight teams and went straight to work By the end of the weekend theyd used plastic sheets zippers and even cardboard and pipe cleaners to build prototypes Andrews says they will meet up again this Sunday to refine their designs Madeleine Clegg a biomedical engineering student at Hopkins got an adrenaline rush from doing so much in so little time She says the quick pace helped narrow ideas to the best We aimed for solutions that were tangible to design in a relatively short amount of time Thats because the ideal designs and modifications would have to be implemented in just a few months This is an emergency says   vice president of innovations at Jhpiego and one of the events organizers In a challenge like this the diversity of unlike minds is key he says Engineering students like Clegg knew about medical devices public health workers made sure designs were suitable for the working environment and virologists taught everyone how a virus is contracted There was even an architect who helped his team design a special tent to treat patients As a gown designer Andrews knows how to make clothing for different body types And being a costume designer for some  years gave her a creative mind I had to make costumes all kinds of crazy she says Something as simple as making an actors pants fall off at just the right moment is so ridiculously hard Her theatrical experience got her thinking about how workers can take off their suits without having to touch any parts of their bodies Her sewing experience was also a big plus At one point there was a little line of people holding zippers and Velcros asking me Can you sew the gloves onto this Tyvek arm she says with a laugh And were there sweetheart necklines and long trains for the PPE Andrews says that for the moment shes sworn to secrecy about the designs
