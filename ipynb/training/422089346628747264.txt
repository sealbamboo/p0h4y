Spencer brushed off his questions He was  and curious about the world around him She was exhausted trying to care for two young boys and her husband who had chronic health issues Her own health had fallen to the bottom of the todo list  But Logans last question hit her like well the elephant in the room  If you got skinny would you be able to play with me  My heart broke Spencer   And from that moment forward I began the transformation into a healthier lifestyle for my children  When Spencer stepped on the scale in June  the number  came as no surprise More than a dozen people had asked her over the past few years whether she was pregnant Two had rubbed her belly when there was no baby at all    The extra weight caused pain in Spencers hips when she walked and the doctor warned that she was on the verge of type  diabetes  She had tried dieting after her second son Brody was born Weight Watchers helped her drop  pounds but she quickly gained  back Her sister a health nut encouraged her to try different cleanses All left her feeling like a failure  She was depressed anxious and overwhelmed  You know I started every Monday dreaming I could change my life Spencer remembered It was nearly a decade of that  Logans question made her realize she was missing her sons lives  and her own Spencer started counting calories keeping her daily total under  She also began going on short walks around the block and parked her car in the farthest spot from the grocery store door  A few months later Spencer and her husband separated But instead of using food to cope with the rush of emotions as she once would have Spencer turned to exercise  I used that as more motivation to stay healthy for the boys she said My goodness if Im going to have to do this on my own and be an example for them I have to be strong  Working out was difficult at first the pain in her hips prevented her from moving very far very fast But over time she joined a walking club at work and started strength training one or two days a week  She focused on losing just  pounds at a time because the thought of losing  pounds to reach a healthy BMI was intimidating Reaching each smaller goal inspired her to keep going  By March  she had lost  pounds  When youre that heavy you feel like youve lost hope Spencer said When you finally reach your goal its the most amazing thing Every Sunday the Spencer family goes on a mile bike ride near their home in Aurora Colorado They eat nosugar cereal and skim milk for breakfast Lean Cuisine meals or veggie smoothies for lunch and lean protein with vegetables and brown rice for dinner Water is Spencers secret weapon  Her diet has become a lifestyle Shes careful about what she eats but allows herself treats in moderation Deprivation is not the way to keep the weight off she knows  Spencers energy is up and her pain is gone But the happiness she feels cant compare to the joy on her sons faces when she joins them on the playground  I am able to take my kiddos to the park and actually play with them instead of sitting on the sidelines
