he   was a major topic of discussion in the runup to Scotlands referendum on independence Those pushing for a no vote said its  spending on health per person in  compared with Englands  showed how the UK helps its devolved nations through the Barnett formula  arguably at the expense of England Few make such arguments for   Like Scotland it has run its own NHS since  and has similarly removed the marketstyle divide between commissioners and providers of care that is still in place in England But in  Wales spent only a little more than England on healthcare  despite a  opinion from the National Audit Office that the relative needs of the Welsh exceed those of Scots as well as the English Unlike England and Scotland the Welsh government reduced NHS spending in real terms in the early years of this decade blaming underfunding by Westminster As a result Welsh NHS staff have plenty of experience of austerity including its chief executive Andrew Goodall Before moving to the national job in June as chief executive of Aneurin Bevan University health board in southeast Wales he took part in the South Wales Programme Earlier this year those involved agreed to concentrate acute services including emergency consultantled maternity and childrens care at five centres with some hospitals losing services as a result Goodall says that the Welsh NHS built its case through a consultation process that gathered comments from  people You do need iterations You have to show the public they are involved all along the way he says with consultations needing to be honest with the potential to change plans He adds You want to make sure that where its a clinical issue you have a clinical consensus The last few months have brought an easing of the financial pressures with the Welsh government  budget adding m of spending on health and wellbeing in  including   as a result of increased allocations in the chancellors autumn statement This adds up to a  increase to bn A further m is set to follow the year after while other areas including local government are facing cuts However Goodall says that the extra money will help health services keep pace with demand rather than allow new activity After several years of pay restraint the increase will allow some recognition of pay pressures and negotiations with unions are taking place If were able to recognise the living wage that would be a good way to use some of that money he says but adds Whatever we do will still be under a pay restraint envelope The extra money is based on research the government commissioned from the Nuffield Trust which said that the Welsh NHS could remain affordable  but only if it continued to reshape its services such as by saving money on inpatient admissions through good management of patients with chronic conditions The government has set up a m fund to move some treatment for conditions including eye care and heart disease from hospitals to primary care nearer patients homes Goodall says Wales can reorganise more easily than England as its seven health boards manage all the services in their areas Shifting work from hospitals to primary care requires a board to make internal changes rather than one organisation losing out to another We can pull together different parts of the system he says Some of the frustrations that can happen negotiating across organisations  we have the opportunity to do that differently He adds that the small size of the Welsh NHS which includes three trusts providing specialist services provides staff with strong opportunities They can develop full care pathways within their organisations and it is easier to form networks with peers which can connect to national decisionmaking Were able to bring people in a room and understand their own views on how they want to develop good services Goodall says People can talk about what they want to change in Wales and were able to do something about that He says NHS Wales is also working to improve the quality of services including the consistent handling of reviews of deaths in hospital across Wales and measures to check services at district general hospitals The latter followed poor care at the Princess of Wales hospital in Bridgend which led recently to two nurses admitting to multiple charges of wilful neglect Goodall is wary of entering a politicallycharged area but does say Ive worked for the NHS for  years I work in it because of the values that I have and I know that is true of all of our staff who work in the NHS who come to work to do a good job adding We need to continue to shout about the good work and progress we are making in Wales
