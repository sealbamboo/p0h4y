More than  of babies born in  owe their lives to in vitro fertilization and fewer of them were twins or triplets according to new figures from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology A total of  babies were born as a result of  attempts to use assisted reproduction treatments the   says Both figures represent small increases from  Nearly all of these babies were conceived as a result of   Fewer than  of the attempts involved   GIFT and   ZIFT both of which are more invasive than IVF Women younger than  had the most success with these fertility treatments In this age group attempts involving a womans own fresh eggs resulted in live births  of the time In cases where women used their own eggs that had been frozen and then thawed the success rate was  The older the patient the lower the birth rate For women between the ages of  and   of assisted reproduction cycles using fresh eggs ended with a baby along with  of cycles involving previously frozen eggs In the to age group live births resulted in  of ART cycles using fresh eggs and  of cycles using thawed eggs For women who were  or  the birth rate was  when using fresh eggs and  when using previously frozen eggs In cases where women were  or older  of cycles using fresh eggs and  of cycles using thawed eggs led to a baby For the first time the medical society published figures on assisted reproduction attempts involving embryos donated by couples who did not plan to use them for their own families In   such embryos were implanted in women and  of those transfers resulted in a live birth The most striking figures in the report involved the number of embryos women elected to transfer at a time The hefty expense of fertility treatments  which   by health insurance plans  prompts many women to transfer many embryos at once to maximize the chance that at least one will implant and make it to term But that also makes triplets quadruplets and other higherorder multiples more likely  and thats dangerous for both mother and children So fertility specialists have made a point of encouraging women to   at a time And it seems to be working Twentythree percent of women under  opted for a single embryo transfer in  up from  the year before Overall women in the youngest age group transferred an average of  embryos per cycle involving fresh eggs The older the women the higher the average which ranged from  for the to cohort to  for those  and older In cycles involving eggs that had been frozen the average number of embryos transferred was below  for all age groups The result was  twin births and  triplet births in  down from  twins and  triplets in  The goal of reducing the incidence of multiple pregnancies is extremely important Dr James Toner the president of   said in a statement Patients can see from the data that fewer embryos transferred do not mean a lower chance of pregnancy
