Mental disorders can reduce life expectancy by  to  years as much as or even more than smoking over  cigarettes a day a study finds We know that smoking boosts the risk of cancer and heart disease says   a psychiatrist at Oxford University who led the study But aside from the obvious fact that people with mental illnesses are more likely to commit suicide its not clear how mental disorders could be causing early deaths The researchers looked at data on  million patients drawing from  recent scientific reviews and studies from mostly wealthy countries Comparing the effects of mental illness and smoking helps put the stats in context Fazel tells Shots It was useful to benchmark against something that has a very high mortality rate They found that the mortality risk for women with   was more than seven times higher than that of a heavy smoker People with substance abuse disorders and   had higher mortality rates than smokers as well And while chain smokers generally die eight to  years earlier than nonsmokers schizophrenia can shave off up to  years The   was published Thursday in the journal   The numbers suggest that governments need to make mental health care more of a priority Fazel says So much emphasis has been placed on reducing smoking and smoking deaths Mental illness doesnt receive the same attention in public health and public policy About  percent of people in the United States and the UK smoke he adds  around the same   of people who suffer from mental illness Risky behaviors and suicide are clearly involved but other factors may also be at play Fazel says Mental conditions can take a toll on peoples physical health We know that depression worsens your prognosis of a range of illnesses Fazel says And people suffering from some mental conditions are sometimes less likely to go to the doctor and may not be able to manage their own health care Stigma may also play a role There is still quite a bit of stigma associated with mental illness he says Studies   that people with mental illness may get unequal treatment at the emergency room And as NPR has   health care providers often arent trained in how to effectively help patients with mental disorders The best way to tackle these problems is to attack from all sides Fazel says To start the medical community can find better ways to accommodate and help the mentally ill And beyond that he says we can address the stigma in the general population
