The Lords has backed a Labour plan to ban smoking in cars carrying children despite opposition from the government Labour peers tabled an amendment to the   detailing their proposal for England which they said was about protecting children  Ministers had argued that the new law was a blunt instrument and public information campaigns were preferable But the BBC understands that government backbenchers will not be pressed to reverse the change in the Commons  Instead they will have a free vote on the amendment when the bill returns from the Lords A Downing Street spokesman said earlier that Prime Minister David Cameron was ready to listen to the arguments  The amendment empowers but does not compel the government at a later date to make it a criminal offence for drivers to fail to prevent smoking in their vehicle when children are present   Labour has said that if the measure does not become law before the next election it will be included in its manifesto  Smoking was banned in England in workplaces and most enclosed public spaces in July  following similar legislation in Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland The law prohibited smoking in vehicles used for work The amendment to the Children and Families Bill was brought forward by Lord Hunt of Kings Heath Lord Faulkner and Baroness Hughes  Conservative peer Lord Cormack argued that any law which brings the state into the private space of individuals is to be deplored But Lord Hunt said I was very surprised by research that has been identified by the British Lung Foundation which shows that a single cigarette smoked in a moving car with a window half open exposes a child in the centre of a backseat to around twothirds as much secondhand smoke as in an average smokefilled pub of days gone by The level increased to  times when the car was not moving with the windows closed he said  Lord Hunt went on Some Lords will argue a car is a private space and that we should not legislate for what happens within such a space But there are more important principles than that For one for me is the need for child protection Unlike most adults children lack the freedom to decide when and how to travel they lack the authority most adults have to ask people not to smoke in their company And in those circumstances I think it is right for Parliament to step in to protect children Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham told Sky News the move had strong public support  Campaigners say the developing lungs of children are much more vulnerable to the effects of secondhand smoke  which can be concentrated in cars  increasing their risk of illnesses that range from asthma and colds to lung cancer  They have been calling for action for some time In   But the prosmoking group Forest disputes such claims Director Simon Clark said Legislation is completely unnecessary Most adult smokers accept that smoking in a car with children present is inconsiderate and the overwhelming majority choose not to Education not legislation is the way forward Forest also argues that banning smoking in private vehicles would be almost impossible to enforce and a serious invasion of peoples private space  Health Minster Earl Howe said We all want to eradicate smoking in cars carrying children  The government believes that encouraging lasting and positive behaviour change by making smokers aware of the significant health risks of secondhand smoke will be more effective than resorting to legislation which is a blunt instrument to tackle the problem I believe we should only consider resorting to using legislation if our work to promote positive changes in behaviour is shown not to have the required effect He also argued there were substantial challenges with enforcing a ban on smoking in cars particularly vehicles travelling at speed questioning whether people would comply with the law if they knew there was little chance of it being enforced But at the end of the debate peers backed the Labour amendment by  votes to   Calls to prohibit smoking in private vehicles when children are present have been raised in Parliament on several occasions since the  ban came into effect In  proposals from Labour MP Alex Cunningham cleared their first legislative hurdle before facing significant opposition from MPs of all parties The following year Lord Ribeiro introduced a private members bill to make offenders liable for a  fine or attendance at a smoke awareness course It won approval in the House of Lords although supporters admitted they did not have government backing for the move  The Labour amendment backed by the Lords was initially proposed by Croydon North MP Steve Reed last April He won the support of organisations including the British Heart Foundation Asthma UK the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health  Although childrens minister Edward Timpson said at the time that a ban would not be easy to enforce the government was researching the issue and Mr Reed withdrew his amendment The Welsh government has said it would consider a ban should an awareness campaign not lead to a drop in childrens exposure to secondhand smoke Meanwhile in Scotland Lib Dem MSP Jim Hume has indicated he will be presenting a bill this year to bring in a ban while Northern Irelands health minister has announced plans for a consultation on the issue
