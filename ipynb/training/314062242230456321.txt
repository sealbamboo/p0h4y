Mammography outcomes from nearly a million US women suggest which ones under  would stand the greatest chance of benefiting from regular screening those with very dense breasts Thats been a bone of contention ever since a federal task force   that women younger than  shouldnt routinely get the test A   in the latest   also provides reassurance that its safe for women over  to get mammograms every other year  even if they have dense breasts or have taken hormones to reduce symptoms of menopause Biennial mammograms for women between  and  are another flash point in the debate over the current US Preventive Services Task Force   In addition to recommending against routine mammograms for most women under  the guidelines favor screening every two years for older women  lead author of the latest study tells Shots that its an attempt to get beyond this kind of simplistic view of who should get regular mammograms based solely on age We try to say what puts people at highest risk Kerlikowske says and particularly at highest risk for tumors that are more likely to be aggressive Those are the people we really want to screen and try to find the tumors early Some women in their s probably have a higher breast cancer risk than some older women she says and some women in their s and s probably have lower risk than most somethings So the idea was to ask Are there people at higher risk who should be screened differently Kerlikowske says And are there people at lower risk who maybe shouldnt be screened as often Her group focuses on two risk factors  especially   and prior use of   particularly the combination of estrogen and progestin Highly dense breasts not only make it harder to spot breast tumors on mammograms but are intrinsically more likely to give rise to cancers The study found that the women under  who benefit from annual mammograms are the  to  percent who have extremely dense breasts That is the test is more likely to find dangerous tumors that are larger or more advanced at diagnosis For the other  percent of under women theres no added benefit Annual mammograms dont find more latestage tumors or those that are larger at diagnosis But annual screening doubles their already high risk of   and   that seem to find cancers that arent really there I want to be clear Kerlikowske says This study does not say women in their s should undergo screening mammography But for those who want to the study supports the idea of annual mammograms for those with extremely dense breasts Among women over  Kerlikowske thinks theres been a slow shift away from annual mammograms since the federal task force issued its controversial guidelines in  Our data reinforce the idea that women can be reassured they can be screened every two years even if theyre at high risk by virtue of having dense breasts or having been on hormone replacement therapy the University of California San Francisco researcher says The new data come from the   a network of mammography centers across the nation that record characteristics of women undergoing mammography Those traits can then be correlated with later outcomes Did the women have a diagnosis of breast cancer Were their tumors advanced or large at diagnosis Did their mammograms raise a false alarm The consortium really represents the demographics of the United States as far as urbanrural economic status ethnic groups Kerlikowske says Its a huge population Earlier controlled studies of mammogram screening from Europe have been criticized as not being applicable to the US population The current study looked at  women diagnosed with breast cancer and  without breast cancer While it is not a randomized controlled trial it does collect data on women prospectively  before theyve had a diagnosis of breast cancer a falsepositive or an allclear That reduces the chance that researchers distorted the results by retrospectively choosing which women to look at This is the first time weve actually looked at outcomes by risk factors Kerlikowske says It comes at a time when   are requiring doctors to inform mammography patients if they have dense breasts so they know theyre at higher risk of having difficulttodiagnose tumors Californias breastdensity notification law will take effect April  New York Connecticut Texas and Virginia have similar laws and a dozen other states are considering such legislation The problem is theres no consensus on whether women with dense breasts should get additional tests beyond conventional mammograms The next thing were focusing on is if someone has highdensity breasts do they need a different kind of imaging Kerlikowske says The mammography consortium collects data on women who get   and   but she says so far not enough women are getting another type of test called   to draw conclusions about its usefulness
