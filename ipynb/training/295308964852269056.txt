One out of three American adults is obese and childhood obesity has more than doubled in the past  years Its an epidemic with very serious health risks from heart disease to diabetes to cancer Its also taking an incredible financial toll Studies have put the national healthcare cost of obesity at over  billion a year Behind these staggering figures are measurement tools that the medical community uses to determine who is at risk One of the most common is body mass index BMI The problem is that BMI alone doesnt tell the whole story BMI is a    weight in pounds divided by height in inches squared multiplied by   to calculate an individuals body fat An adult with a BMI of  or higher for instance is considered obese But because BMI is based on   rather than body composition it doesnt take into account how much of that weight is from muscle bone or water as opposed to fat BMI is a useful number in general terms but it doesnt tell us where the fat is distributed or distinguish between fat and muscle said Subhashini Ayloo MD a bariatric surgeon at University of Illinois Hospital That means an athlete who has more muscle mass and strong bones could have a high BMI that would categorize them as overweight or even obese On the other hand older people who have lost muscle may have a deceptively lower BMI While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers BMI a reasonable indicator of body fat it doesnt recommend it as a diagnostic tool Its not perfect but its definitely a useful tool said Ellen Demerath an associate professor of epidemiology and community health at the University of Minnesota It should be the first step in measuring an individuals health assessment but other tests can also be useful One simple alternative to BMI is measuring   which as Demerath points out can be an indicator of risk for many obesityrelated diseases Men with a waist circumference of more than  inches and women with a circumference of more than  inches are at a higher risk for developing obesityrelated conditions like type  diabetes high blood pressure and   In a new study out this month socalled appleshaped people who carry more fat around their bellies are also at a higher risk for kidney disease If someone has a pear shape and their weight is in the hips and thighs which is classically a female body shape they dont have the same risk factors said Eric Westman MD an internist at Duke Health Center in Durham NC Another method of measuring fat thats becoming more popular and accessible is bioelectrical impedance  a device resembling an ordinary scale that measures body composition by sending a low electrical current from footpad electrodes Its a more accurate way of measuring the actual percentage of fat Dr Westman said You see them a lot now in health clubs and theyre available for home use BMI is still a valid and inexpensive screening tool But its just one piece of the puzzle The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute recommends that any weightrelated health assessments should be based on a combination of BMI waist circumference and other individual risk factors such as high blood pressure cholesterol or physical inactivity The guidelines for   are not hard and fast rules theyre a consensus that most doctors agree on Dr Ayloo said Right now one of the criteria used is BMI because its easily accessible but its not perfect on its own
