Harrison Sakilla a yearold former teacher cant stop smiling I have to smile he says Im the first survivor for the case management center here from Ebola Former patients like Sakilla whove recovered from the virus lift the collective spirit at at the Doctors Without Borders Ebola center in Liberias northern town of Foya He was admitted to the highrisk isolation unit which is part of a cluster of large tents that make up the bulk of the center While health workers busy themselves caring for patients on one side  with all the stress hard work death and sorrow that entails  theres an oasis of joy and relief on the other side where a few brick buildings stand to the right Thats where Ebola survivors congregate But their smiles may mask deep sorrow Im very fine even though Ive lost seven family members says Sakilla He starts to list them My father my mother my sister my niece my big brother and my nieces daughter he says But right now Im alive Im very very very happy You see me smiling  nothing but smiling Sakilla and other survivors gather together in their own little center beyond the popup tents Several are helping Doctors Without Borders looking after orphaned children and performing other tasks Thats the case of yearold Bendu Borlay With a sleeping infant tied to her back she tells NPR that the person she loved most  her big sister who raised her as a child after their mother died  has died of Ebola She was the sister who gave me courage Even at the Ebola treatment center she was still there for me as a mother Borlay says through an interpreter She was encouraging me to eat well take my drugs drink a lot of water But I learned that she was not doing what she encouraged me to do  and she died Now Borlay doesnt have anybody else to look up to as a mother But shes finding a way to give back for her own survival watching over Mamaya Kane the monthold baby girl strapped to her back Borlay never met the infants mother who died of the virus The babys grandmother she adds was being cared for in the isolation unit Thats the reason Im still at the Ebola treatment center volunteering to take care of this baby she tells NPR The grandmother tested positive but the baby tested negative so Doctors Without Borders was looking for somebody to volunteer to take care of the baby Borlay says that if she gets any money from volunteering she will go back to school when school opens Now I have to be selfsupportingshe says The only person who supported me throughout my life is gone She adds I want to finish high school and make sure I graduate An hour and a halfs drive away in Barkedu a dusty village that has been badly hit by the Ebola outbreak two yearold friends  Alieu Manor and Musa Bayor  still look slightly dazed and timid Both were living in Monrovia Liberias capital city when they caught the virus They too are survivors recently discharged from the Foya Ebola Unit Manor shares something in common with Borlay The words tumble out of the teen at the end of our interview I wonder how my baby is After recovering the teenager explains he took care of monthold Elijah Blamo whose mother had died of Ebola I felt sad for the child he recalls The family of the childs mother  they were all there but they were afraid to touch the child The doctors were looking for a caregiver I said give me the child and I will care for the child Manor says through an interpreter So thats how they handed the child over to me Do you love that little boy I ask Yes he answers I thought I could have stayed there for the child to be very well until the childs father can come But I had to leave the baby there because my parents were worried and needed me back home But he smiles shyly and says hes following up on Baby Elijahs progress I feel so attached to the child he says Thats why I smiled when you asked me the question With moist eyes Bayor stands listening to his friend Bayor is quietly emotional as he shares his own story of survival and slow psychological recovery from Ebola after his older brother who was his main benefactor died of the virus I never thought I was going to survive he says through an interpreter  I thought I was actually going to die While he was sick all he thought about was going home So I put a lot of strength in myself to take my medicine and drink a lot of water because I actually wanted to come back home to Barkedu he says These Liberian survivors are still grieving  mourning the loss of family members to Ebola But they say theyve lived through a nightmare and are now determined to live life to the full
