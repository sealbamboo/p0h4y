Ministers have failed to honour a pledge to move patients with learning difficulties out of hospitals and into community care the National Audit Office NAO says There were still  such inpatients in mental health hospitals in England in September  the NAO said A commitment to move patients was made in the wake of the Winterbourne View abuse scandal Care Minister Norman Lamb said the government was stepping up efforts But Margaret Hodge chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee said the failure was unacceptable Ministers pledged in December  that any inpatient with a learning disability or challenging behaviour who would be better off cared for in the community would be moved out of hospital by June  The promise came after BBCs Panorama programme exposed abuse of patients by staff at the Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol But the NAO said ministers had underestimated the complexity and level of challenge involved in discharging so many patients into the community The governments NHS reforms meant they lacked the traditional levers to implement the necessary changes its report added It said figures from NHS England showed that by March  there were still more than  inpatients with learning difficulties That number has remained broadly stable according to figures from September  While NHS England set a new ambition in August  to transfer half of the  inpatients to more appropriate care by the end of March  the NAO said that so far only around  had been moved The report also showed that from the  patients in Winterbourne View at the time of its closure  were still in hospital  were living in residential care five were in supported housing  had their own tenancies and one had died Ms Hodge said People with learning disabilities admitted to hospitals for assessment and treatment have been badly let down by government  More than two years since its response to the abuse of patients at the Winterbourne View hospital it is unacceptable for government to have failed in meeting its core commitment to move people out of mental health hospitals and into the community In a joint statement the charities Mencap and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation said the report showed abject failure to tackle the issue Mr Lamb admitted the government had not gone far enough He added  I am looking at legislative options to give people with learning disabilities and their families a stronger voice and more rights  and Im looking at how we can increase specialised housing options so that more people can live independently but with the support that they need
