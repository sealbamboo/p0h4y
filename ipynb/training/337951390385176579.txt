Quite a few medical school students have something against obese people and most of those who have such a bias are unaware of it Thats the conclusion of study appearing in the July issue of  It was conducted at the   in WinstonSalem NC The studys author says the subconscious judgments could affect how patients are treated Heres how the study was done Researchers gave thirdyear medical students Harvards  on weight The test is designed to get at peoples subconscious biases by measuring how long it takes for them to associate a positive word such as love laughter or pleasure with a drawing of a person who is either thin or obese Psychologists have shown that peoples subconscious biases affect how fast they can associate a positive trait with someone they think poorly of More than onethird of the students had a moderate to strong bias against obese people as measured by the test whereas only  percent had an antithin bias Twothirds of the students were unaware of their antifat bias Since this study was only done with students in North Carolina the researchers cant say for sure these attitudes apply to medical school students elsewhere But given the fact that   have shown that doctors have a similar subconscious bias against overweight patients its likely the Wake Forest students are fairly typical The researchers for the North Carolina study say medical education should include strategies for recognizing these subconscious biases and guarding against their affecting medical judgments How would bias affect the way doctors take care of obese patients Several ways study author   told me in an email If doctors assume obese patients are lazy or lack willpower they will be less likely to spend time counseling patients about lifestyle changes they could make he said Doctors also may be less likely to recommend formal weight loss programs if they assume their patient is unlikely to follow through  Miller said bias might also make doctors less effective If a patient senses his or her doctor doesnt like them or doesnt respect them he said that will damage the trust that is key to an effective patientphysician relationship
