It has been seven years and two months since I woke from my coma My eyelids were taped shut and my arms were cuffed to some unknown object The first sense that came back was sound I could hear the voices of doctors and nurses chatting about the weather I distinctly remember a doctor poking my bare feet with a scalpel Vegetable I heard him say Everything was blackness God help me what have I done I thought Im in hell and I put myself here My demon was methadone A difficult pregnancy and cesarean section had caused nerve damage and the Vicodin and Percocet werent cutting it anymore Postpartum depression exhaustion and an unhappy marriage compounded the pain Doctors sent me to specialists whose cures were backed with commercials free pens and a day supply free from the sample drawer The doctor at the chronic pain clinic assured my mom that Id be closely monitored and that pharmaceutical use was documented and safe Methadone is for heroin addicts she said I left with a months worth of pills that day Soon I was under the care of a psychiatrist pain specialists and family practice doctors I was getting up to  different meds I couldnt tell where my pain came from anymore Side effects led to new drugs and more side effects My husband  once friend and partner  was now my jailer controlling access to my pills he kept locked in a safe A single Xanax turned into five if I could sneak them And the methadone went from one to two to four until I drifted off into a drooling heap at Quiznos I became too medicated to parent my son so he moved in with my parents Motherhood became a burden I despised My husband and I spent our time quarreling drinking and sleeping Friends disappeared Finances were obliterated by medical bills and time off work My addiction owned me Once a girl obsessed with my appearance I was now a greasy slovenly woman who could no longer perform even the most basic hygiene Although a diehard atheist I begged God to make me die Of all things Carrie Underwoods Jesus Take the Wheel came on one day and I broke down sobbing What happened next is family lore as I have no memory of it My husband found me passed out on the bathroom floor and put me to bed The next day he called my mom and asked her to check on me I was blue By the time we got to the ER I had stopped breathing The medics revived my heart twice With two collapsed lungs and failing kidneys my prognosis for survival was less than  percent I was informed of this after waking up two weeks later When the ventilator was removed a nurse asked me why I did it Did what I said Try to kill yourself A relative cleaning the house had found my empty bottle of methadone I had taken a months worth in the  hours after filling the prescription During my coma I experienced a phenomenon that brings skeptics out of the woodwork and of which I have no proof But I recall being lifted into the most beautiful white light and looking down from the sky at Earth amazed at its perfection I watched a droplet of water fall from the sky into the forest The images were vivid and perfect I had lost it all by not recognizing the beauty of what it means to be alive Today I am a yearold mother of two My husband and I divorced I got remarried to a man I met in recovery We have a son as well as my first son who has no memory of me as an addict If you passed me on the street youd never suspect my junkie past I feel no shame when I say Im a recovering addict The battle has made me a warrior As someone lucky to have survived I want to tell others not to give up Life can be pain and suffering but numbing that pain also numbs the love that heals it
