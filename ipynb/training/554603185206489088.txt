So you think tobacco is bad for your health Try telling that to a tobacco hornworm His stinky nicotine breath is the only thing keeping him off the evening dinner menu scientists say In a   published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences researchers discovered that   moth larvae use a form of defensive halitosis to ward off ravenous wolf spiders As a tiny leafcreeping caterpillar   will gorge on coyote tobacco plants all day consuming more than a milligram of nicotine in a hour period  the rough equivalent of one cigarette While nicotine will paralyze most insects the hornworm is immune to the stuff Through a series of experiments researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology determined that the caterpillar stored nicotine in its blood or hemolymph then exhaled a tiny amount  less than   through its spiracles or respiratory openings that run along the length of the insect In a series of experiments senior author and biochemist Ian Baldwin and colleagues placed individual nicotineladen caterpillars in plastic cups with individual wolf spiders that had been starved for  hours Despite the spiders hunger they rejected the meal Yet there was no finicky behavior when the ravenous spiders were presented with caterpillars that had been fed nicotinefree tobacco or tobacco that had been genetically engineered so that it silenced the caterpillars bead breath genes The spiders quickly tore into their prey Spiders usually assess their prey after capture by tapping it with chemosensory endowed legs and palps the authors wrote Wolf spiders were clearly rejecting nicotinefed larvae before penetrating their prey with their mandibles to inject their mixture of digestive enzymes and poisons In true scientific fashion it took the researchers some time to figure out how the caterpillars were processing the nicotine they digested and who it protected them from The realization came about they said at a research ranch in Utah where they had planted regular coyote tobacco and nicotinedeficient tobacco After taking a count of all likely predators in the area researchers placed caterpillars on each group of crops and monitored their rate of survival They found that the insects disappeared much more quickly at night and even more quickly on the nicotinedeficient plants The wolf spider a nocturnal hunter was singled out as the prime suspect Another hornworm predator the socalled bigeyed bug hunted during the day and showed no aversion to nicotinespiced meals Researchers said experiments involving the genetically modified tobacco provided additional insights into the function of specific caterpillar genes but that they would not have been possible to conduct if it werent for the field experiments Our work demonstrates how predators can assist in the process of elucidating the function of herbivore genes the authors wrote
