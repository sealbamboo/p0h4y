When I wake up in the morning I will pray to God to give me strength and focus says yearold Sorie Fofana His job is collecting the bodies of those who die from Ebola in Monrovia Liberias capital city of roughly  million people Before Fofana was an artist making designs for Tshirts The new job pays better   a month But every morning the lanky laidback Fofana has to steel himself to go out and do the job Fofana serves on one of four government teams of specially trained body collectors in Monrovia funded by the   Its a critical task as the Ebola epidemic worsens in Liberia with more than  suspected and confirmed cases and nearly  deaths In the densely populated city when someone dies of Ebola many more people may become infected by coming into contact with the body On a recent morning the body collectors pull up to their first stop a dirt lot at the edge of a steep hill overlooking a river Theyve come to collect the corpse of Rachel Wleh The men change out of jeans and sneakers into surgical scrubs and rubber boots Alexander Nyanti  used to study economics at a local college But the college is closed along with every other school here because of the Ebola outbreak Nyanti is slender and softspoken He looks a little nervous at the thought of going into Wlehs house I dont feel fine he says But I have to go there I must go there Mark Korvayan is the team leader Hes a longtime employee of the Ministry of Health and a father figure to the crew The men gather up their gear and begin the difficult hike down the hillside carefully picking their way over rocks strewn with trash and drying laundry At the base of the hill they walk past a cluster of cementblock homes at the rivers edge People stream out of the doorways The whole neighborhood is turning out to watch Wlehs husband was the doctor at the local clinic Thats also where the family lived He came down with Ebola earlier this month and died a few days ago Wleh took sick soon after She died the day before Wlehs four children ages  to  stand to one side They hug their arms to their chests and hang their heads She was vomiting says Larry the oldest She said she was just feeling weak As Larry describes his mothers symptoms Korvayan strides up to warn him that he and his brothers and sister absolutely must get tested for Ebola If they touched their mother while she was sick theres a good chance theyve been infected too Wlehs kids just stare back at him panic flickering in their eyes Finally Larry speaks up He mumbles that their health is fine Their problem is a different one In the space of a few days theyve become orphans We dont have a father We dont have a mother The team dons the last layer of protective gear They unfurl white plastic jumpsuits and pull them on Next come face masks and goggles They tape their sleeves shut with meticulous care and check each other for exposed skin Their life depends on getting this right The corpse of a person who dies of Ebola leaks bodily fluids loaded with the virus Anyone who comes into contact with those fluids can become infected Their last defense is a prayer The men gather in a circle and touch hands God our father  as we are going in  may you be the protector We will take the precautionary measures but may you seal us with your holy spirit and with your angels  Korvayan claps his hands twice to signal its time to go in They enter the house slowly single file and head into a bedroom They emerge a few minutes later Theyve packed Wleh in a green body bag and drag it across the floor They pause at the door to figure out the best way to lift the body safely then proceed out of the house As they carry Wleh past the crowd several women begin wailing Others join in The cries swell to a chorus Wleh was beloved in this neighborhood This is the closest thing shell get to a funeral The hike back up the hill is excruciating At the top the men stop under a tree and collapse against it Korvayan says the state of Wlehs corpse was unnerving When I saw the body he says my skin creeped She was lying on a bed blood leaking from her mouth The men carry Wlehs body over to a long flatbed truck They heave it in and drag it to the back Now comes the most dangerous part getting out of their protective suits They arch their backs and contort their limbs in an awkward shimmy to avoid touching the outside of the suit Then they spray each suit with disinfectant and place the suits in a trash bag Despite the pay  generous by Liberian standards  the men say their families do not want them doing the work Nyanti the economics student says his parents wont even let him stay in the house Theyre worried hes going to infect them all Fofanas parents have begged him to quit My mom and dad dont want me to do this job he says But I feel I should do it to save my nation Like the other men Fofana says that what started as just a job has become a calling He is seeing firsthand how crucial this work is to stopping Ebolas spread He knows the risks But he says someones got to do it Im going to save my country If I die I die for my country The men close up the back of the truck Korvayan says he cant even guess how many bodies hes picked up since he started this work I cannot give you a specific number Ive gone far I have picked up enough But their work is never done Theyve got six more bodies to pick up today and after that a long drive to the citys crematorium Tomorrow theyll do it all over again
