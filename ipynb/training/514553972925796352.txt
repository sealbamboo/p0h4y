Two of the worlds top health organizations released predictions Tuesday warning how bad the Ebola outbreak in West Africa could get Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization agree that the epidemic is speeding up But the CDCs worstcase scenario is a jawdropper If interventions dont start working soon as many as  million people could be infected by Jan  the agency   in its   Health officials at the CDC in Atlanta dont pull the fire alarm if there isnt a fire But  million cases by the end of January Are they trying to scare us Figures of that kind certainly have shock value says Christopher Dye who directs strategy for WHO in Geneva WHO   its estimates for the epidemic in  Its prediction is more conservative more than  Ebola cases by early November The agency didnt extend the prediction beyond that month These kinds of projections are not to say that this is what is going to happen Dye explains These projections say If there arent further measures put in place these are the kinds of case numbers wed expect to see  So what about the  million cases by late January Unlike the WHOs model the CDCs model includes compensation for the fact that many cases probably havent been reported So the known cases right now  about   is probably much lower than the actually number of people who have gotten Ebola since the epidemic began When this socalled underreporting isnt included in the CDCs models the agency predicts about  cases by late January The CDC is modeling out that far into the future to show the enormous cost that comes with delaying aid to Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea says the agencys director Dr Tom Frieden For each month of delay he says there is a big increase in the number of cases and it gets that much more difficult to control the epidemic But he doesnt think a doomsday scenario is likely Hes confident that the most dire projections will not come to pass Both agencies agree on how to turn the tide of this epidemic Get  percent of sick people into isolation and treatment centers Right now Dye says fewer than half the people who need treatment are getting it If all goes well Dye expects the goal of  percent could be reached in several weeks But the data have revealed another problem Our great concern is this will be an epidemic that lasts for several years he says The epidemic has hit such a size  and become so widespread geographically  that Ebola could become a permanent presence in West Africa If that happens there would be a constant threat that Ebola could spread to other parts of the world
