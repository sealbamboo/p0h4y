The VersaClimber is the most ignored piece of fitness equipment in the gym but it shouldnt be says Jacques Devore owner of the yearold Sirens  Titans gym in the Westwood neighborhood of LA The simplelooking foottall rail with hand and footpegs that move up and down in a ladderclimbing motion a machine invented in  invariably is empty because people are afraid of this brutal allbody aerobic workout Thats why VersaClimber devotee Devore put  of them in a room and began offering possibly the worlds first group VClimber workout The vertical orientation with hands overhead rockets your heart rate like nothing else he says In  minutes of   and second intervals you get an aerobic workout that blows away everything else I sat in on a full class one Tuesday as he cranked up the music and started barking out instructions Sirens  Titans  Westwood Blvd LA   Mix of men women beginners and hardcore runners and triathletes The music was pulsing techno intermittently broken up by the instructors commands  Tough from beginning to end With technique not an issue you just move your arms and legs up and down you focus on going allout on the short intervals each of which is followed by a brief recovery The workout is a total of  minutes of activity and  minutes of rest believe me you need that rest Driven by the inherent competition  your VClimber is set up on a tripod with two others and several times you go to the board to write down the total feet climbed from your digital monitor  I pushed to the point of nearcollapse When it was over everyone was energized and ecstatic One woman told me the class helped her lose  pounds the hardcore athletes said the allbody intensity not only improved their cycling and running but also allowed them to train less  Devore is part coach and part mad scientist ordering various lengths of intervals at certain intensities The latter half of the session switches from competition to teamwork as tripod partners aim for cumulative group totals It ends on a rousing high note as the whole class pulls together for a group goal
