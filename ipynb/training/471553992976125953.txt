One of the toughest money decisions Americans face as they age is whether to buy longterm care insurance Many people dont realize that Medicare usually doesnt cover longterm care yet lengthy assistedliving or nursing home stays can decimate even the bestlaid retirement plan Longterm care insurance is a complex product that requires a longterm commitment if youre buying it So how can you tell if this insurance is right for you Suzanne and Bob ODonnell of Marshfield Mass were in their mids when a financial adviser convinced them longterm care insurance made sense  as did buying it before they got old And that has turned out to be true Bob says because later on a lot of our friends have tried to buy it and either been rejected or their premiums are prohibitive  Shopping before health problems set in improves your chances of being accepted while tempering the cost of each months premium The ODonnells now retired covered the three main bases for a worthwhile policy when they bought it  years ago a goodsize monthly benefit inflation protection and ample years of coverage Suzanne says they also covered more personal needs We just wanted to not be a burden to our children she says and we also wanted to be more secure in where wed be able to end up Shed seen her grandmother spend years in a nursing home that Suzanne didnt like Their policy is expensive The premium recently rose to  a month Thats partly because they bought a  percent inflation rider that in just a dozen years has raised their initial  monthly benefit to more than  Thats about what a nursing home in the Northeast costs these days Scott Bunker an insurance broker in the Boston area says the ODonnells arent typical in seeking the insurance before they need it He sees a lot of people who look into buying a policy in their s and early s  then hesitate They explore it they look at it they think Geez this makes an awful lot of sense but its so long between now and when I expect that Im going to need it And so theyll put it off for a little while he says And then a year or two goes by and youll get a phone call and people will say OK were ready to move  Bunker says thats often because theyve seen that a family member is starting to need care As with any insurance youre playing the odds that youll need it Tony Webb at Boston Colleges Center for Retirement Research has been studying the care needs of todays retirees And we find that men aged  have a  percent chance of ever going into care and women aged  have a  percent chance of ever going into care Webb says Those odds are for all types of care  from expensive nursing homes to assisted living in your own home or a facility A good insurance policy covers all three places Most people average less than a year in care The risk is that it can go much longer Another risk is that policy buyers wont realize theyre taking on a longterm commitment If youre taking out a policy in your s the claim may be made in  years time and therefore you have to be confident of being able and willing to pay the premiums for a very long period of time Webb says If you stop paying youll lose your whole investment  Broker Scott Bunker says there are two ways to frame that question When I talk to folks I talk in terms of a fullinsurance strategy or a coinsurance strategy he says Fullinsurance would be about  or  a month Coinsurance he says would be a policy that paid out something more like  per month in that case the holder of the policy would be expected to come up with another  to  out of pocket each month for care  In short people who are between rich and poor who want or need to protect assets for a spouse or for heirs If youre wealthy you can bypass insurance and count on being able to pay for care yourself If you have few assets you can risk going without insurance and watching those assets melt away before Medicaid kicks in Heading into retirement the ODonnells think they got a good deal with their policy even though the years of premium payments add up Weve had it for  years and in  years weve spent about   which as I understand it wouldnt be one year of good quality care Suzanne says And Bob says buying while still in their s got them more coverage than if theyd waited I think we were lucky  better than wise he says I think because we did it earlier the amount of money we were going to spend afforded us a lot more bells and whistles than if we had waited longer to do it  Be sure that ratings agencies say the insurer youre dealing with has a very strong longterm financial position Youre entering what could be essentially a plusyear marriage with this company so you want to be sure your insurance partner is there for you in sickness  not just in health
