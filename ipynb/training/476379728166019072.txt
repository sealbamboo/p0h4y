Just in time for Fathers Day British researchers say they have genetically engineered mosquitoes so they only produce male offspring Male mosquitoes dont bite so they hope they could use their labproduced mosquitoes to make populations of the insects plummet in mosquitoridden areas Their labengineered mosquitoes are fertile But the scientists damaged the X chromosome that the father mosquito would normally pass along to its offspring so that the only young mosquitoes that would hatch alive would be male Lab tests showed these altered mosquitoes virtually bred themselves out of existence after a few generations researchers reported in the journal Nature Communications Just like people mosquito sex is determined by the X and Y chromosomes Males have one X  inherited from the mother and one Y  inherited from the father Females have two X chromosomes one inherited from each parent So if one is damaged the female offspring cannot survive Usually about half a males sperm will carry an X and the other half will carry a Y Female eggs carry one X The team at Imperial College London has been working for years to create maleonly mosquito families but the method they used to damage the X chromosome ended up killing all the mosquito larvae Now theyve perfected the method Roberto Galizi Andrea Crisanti and colleagues report The researchers spliced a gene into the mosquitoes that slices up the X chromosome when sperm is produced Shredding of the paternal X chromosome prevents it from being transmitted to the next generation resulting in fully fertile mosquito strains that produce  percent male offspring they wrote Female mosquitoes drink blood when they are producing eggs male mosquitoes sip nectar What is most promising about our results is that they are selfsustaining said Nikolai Windbichler who helped lead the study Once modified mosquitoes are introduced males will start to produce mainly sons and their sons will do the same so essentially the mosquitoes carry out the work for us Its likely that mosquito populations would rebound after a few years so researchers would have to continually reintroduce genetically engineered mosquitoes But in theory the approach could be used to fight all types of mosquitoes  not just the Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes that transmit most malaria but also Aedes aegypti and other species that transmit dengue Chikungunya   and other deadly viruses The research is still in its early days but I am really hopeful that this new approach could ultimately lead to a cheap and effective way to eliminate malaria from entire regions said Galizi Outside experts said wiping out mosquitoes would be unlikely to disrupt any ecosystem The mosquitoes are not keystone species in their ecosystems  No other animal is dependent on them for food and we dont rely on mosquitoes to eat anything said Luke Alphey of Britains Pirbright Institute Other teams are using genetic engineering to fight dengue One approach introduces a flaw that kills off young mosquitoes before they mature These mosquitoes are being tested in Brazil and federal authorities are checking into allowing them to be  Florida where dengue is threatening to make a comeback Another team is  with a bacteria called Wolbachia that kills the mosquitoes while they are young and also seems to prevent them from carrying dengue Its being  The World Health Organization says malaria infects more than  million people a year and it kills close to half a million children The parasite that causes the disease can evolve resistance to drugs and theres no vaccine yet Theres also no vaccine against   West Nile or   Dengue infects as many as  million people a year Mosquitoborne diseases kill  people a year according to the Gates Foundation
