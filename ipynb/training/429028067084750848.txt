A lot of us can agree that lowfat ice cream is a sad substitute for the real deal Its not as creamy and it just doesnt taste as good Now researchers are saying it may even   different Researchers from the   have found that people can actually smell differences in dietary fat in food The researchers had  participants in Philadelphia and the Netherlands sniff samples of milk with different amounts of fat Once the results were tallied up it was clear that the participants could actually distinguish among the samples based on their fat content The   was published this month in the journal  Psychologist   the studys lead author says the findings make sense because from the evolutionary point of view you need energy to survive And fatty highcalorie foods are a great source of energy In our caveman days detecting fat would have been very valuable for us Lundstrm tells The Salt A quick sniff and youd know which foods had more of the calories we craved Lundstrm says he doesnt think that the ability to smell fat is a learned skill For one thing participants from the US and the Netherlands were equally good at sniffing out fat even though the Dutch drink a lot more milk than Americans he says The participants weight didnt affect their abilities either  overweight participants did the same as everyone else in the sniff tests And Lundstrm says hes confident in this studys results The researchers made sure they were isolating just the fat in milk by using powdered milk rather than the farm fresh stuff The only thing that these powders differed in was the amount of fat Lundstrm Otherwise the samples are identical And each bottle of milk the participants sniffed had the exact same concentration of powder The findings build on   that showed humans can smell fatty acids in their pure form The next step Lundstrm says is to see whether were able to isolate the smell of fat in more complex foods like burgers There are a lot of other unanswered questions as well For one Lundstrm says we dont know   were able to smell the fat Fat molecules in milk are not very volatile he says In other words they are not very likely to fly around in the air so you can smell them It is possible that the fat molecules attach themselves to other compounds that do like to stink up the air Lundstrm says And while the study makes it pretty clear that humans are able to smell different concentrations of fat whats not yet known is how that ability affects our behavior Lundstrm says Do people crave foods that smell fattier Or do those smells help keep us from overeating Those are the kinds of questions scientists must still figure out Lundstrm says The answers could be key in helping us step away from that tub of Ben  Jerrys in the freezer
