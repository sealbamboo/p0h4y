A new study suggests that underexercising rather than overeating may be at the heart of Americas obesity epidemic Researchers from Stanford University School of Medicine report a strong correlation between the rise in obesity and a striking drop in the amount of time Americans spend exercising when not at work over the last  years Their analysis uncovered no evidence that Americans have increased their daily calorie count in the same time period We wouldnt say that calories dont count but the main takeaway is that we have to look very carefully at physical activity The problem is not all in the intake of calories said Dr Uri Ladabaum a professor of gastroenterology at Stanford Medical School Ladabaum is also the lead author of the study that will be published in the August issue of the American Journal of Medicine The study relies on data collected by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from  to  which Ladabaum and his team used to look for trends in obesity abdominal obesity physical activity and caloric intake in the last two decades The most startling finding in the study is the drop in the amount of exercise Americans do in our free time The researchers found that from  to  the percentage of adults who reported doing no exercise in their free time grew dramatically from  to  in women and from  to  in men We suspected there was a trend in that direction but not that magnitude said Ladabaum People can get exercise in other ways but most people dont walk or bike to work and most people are not in jobs that require physical activity At the same time the researchers found that the prevalence of obesity increased from  to  in women and from  to  in men In that time period the proportion of normal weight men and women dropped while the proportion of overweight men and women remained the same But here comes the surprising part The researchers did not find any evidence that people were ingesting more calories on a daily basis in  than they were in  The one caveat here is that the amount of calorie intake was based on self report so it is possible people were not recalling correctly what they ate or not reporting correctly said Ladabaum Ladabaum notes that the study can tell us only that a major drop in time spent exercising occurred at the same time as a rise in obesity not that one caused the other The study looks at trends and certain associations but does not prove any cause and effect between these he said He also wants to make clear that the fact that the average caloric intake did not change substantially does not mean that caloric intake has been optimal at the population level or at the level of individuals We simply did not detect a substantial increase over time he said Even with all those caveats however this study could still be used to inform policy on managing Americas obesity epidemic Even though it is very difficult to prove directly that public health interventions promoting physical activity will make a difference I think they will he said This study should serve as a reinforcement of the message that we need to think of a multicomponent solution where diet is a big part of it and physical activity is a big part as well However there is a big difference between telling people that they should be exercising and actually getting them to do it The finger wagging Puritan in me wants sedentary folks to get off the couch and exercise but my public health background cautions me to go beyond the data tables and look at the lives of Americans today writes Pamela Powers Hannely managing editor of the American Journal of Medicine in an editorial She notes that single mothers in particular may have difficulty figuring out how to work exercise into their already hectic lives She also wonders if this may explain why the rise in obesity has been most prevalent in women between the ages of  to
