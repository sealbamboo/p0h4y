For months now the Ebola virus has been wreaking havoc in the West African countries of Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone More than  people have died and it seems that doctors are nearpowerless to help With the threat of the disease tearing communities apart its hard not to think of a legendary novel from almost  years ago Albert Camus   is set on the Algerian coast The novel follows Bernard Rieux a doctor in the city of Oran who becomes alarmed when he notices an increasing number of rats dying in the town streets Its not long before the mysterious disease has spread to humans killing a hundreds of people a week and causing some residents to try to leave the city in a panic    doesnt have a happy ending of course though its not quite as hopeless as you might think Initially Dr Rieux is a little resigned to the disease thats threatening his city One hardly knows what a dead man is after a while Camus writes And since a dead man has no substance unless one has actually seen him dead a hundred million corpses broadcast through history are no more than a puff of smoke in the imagination But it is perhaps a human instinct to search for meaning in every tragedy Whether its a civilian airplane shot down by a missile a seemingly neverending war or a deadly virus that shows no sign of abating we cant help but ask Why even if we know theres no answer Eventually Dr Rieux concludes It has no importance whether such things have or have not a meaning all we need consider is the answer given to mens hope Of course the answer isnt always the one we want But if Camus teaches us anything its that even when tragedy is inevitable we have no choice but to look for that meaning and to find it in one another Just when it looks like the plague will destroy the entire city of Oran it recedes though not before its killed countless residents Dr Rieux manages to live through it several of his friends arent so lucky As Dr Rieux says of the plagues survivors For some time anyhow they would be happy They knew now that if there is one thing one can always yearn for and sometimes attain it is human love
