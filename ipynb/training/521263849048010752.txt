Sometimes you can tell a lot about a country just by walking its beaches Thats what I did on my last day in Freetown the capital of Sierra Leone where I was on assignment covering the Ebola epidemic Standing at waters edge facing the sea The smooth blue rollers come splashing in steady hypnotic  like oceans anywhere in the world But turn around and face the city and youre smacked by a shoreline fouled with plastic bottles and spray cans and yellow sewage To the right tangled in the brown seaweed lies the stiff bloated corpse of a dead dog Beyond across the boulevard is the gray cement skeleton of an abandoned building project Alie A Koroma struggles over the sand on his metal crutches to talk to me He has time to wander the beach Hes out of work Akuroma tells me he used to cater to foreign tourists We used to take them on excursions on the islands we have beaches Thats over now he says because of the Ebola Further down the beach I meet four beaming girls They look to be about  or  years old One balances a small plastic tub on top of her head and in it is a collection of beach bounty including a headless naked Barbie The kids have also managed to grab some wildlife from the surf Is fish I find a fish one tells me We chat for a bit as they show me their haul They ask me my name then dance down the sand giggling as they go All the seaside restaurants and nightclubs and boutiques are shuttered because of the Ebola emergency But an outdoor fitness club a kind of Muscle Beach Freetown is open Under the palm trees there are thick rusted barbells and a wooden bench press sitting in the sand Four pairs of breathless young women are running through selfdefense drills It turns out they are rehearsing for an antidrug movie called   Shouting commands to the women is a hulking presence in a tight blue polo shirt master trainer Ansumana Bangura This is an action movie he tells me So they are training to get their physical fitness so that we got a very good thing when theyre shooting Bangura says   tells the story of someone whos working to prevent drug use among young people and fighting corrupt government officials One of the actors hes instructing is a petite yearold named Frances Nicol Shed love it if her fight scenes in   lead to a starring role It actually depends on the director We dont know what the director has for us But somehow its an action movie so were getting ourselves prepared beforehand And so even in Sierra Leone in the midst of the devastating Ebola epidemic a young actor can still hope for her big break
