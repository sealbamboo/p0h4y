Common pain relievers like ibuprofen and naproxen  called nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or Nsaids  are the goto drugs for headaches and pulled muscles arthritis and menstrual cramps Their labels have long warned that overuse may increase the risk of heart attack and stroke but we rely on them as we do on few other medications And for good reason They work Occasional use of Nsaids is not likely to lead to cardiovascular consequences But an authoritative and ambitious new analysis that included data from over  trials including detailed case histories of more than  patients concludes that people who take high doses of Nsaids daily increase their cardiovascular risk by as much as a third compared with those taking a placebo The one exception is naproxen which may actually have a protective effect against heart attacks The absolute risk of cardiovascular trouble for those who take high doses of other Nsaids regularly is still quite small Nonetheless the findings suggest that people who rely on them may want to explore alternative pain management methods especially if they have other risks for heart disease or a family history of it There arent really good choices for chronic pain said Dr Marie R Griffin a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who wrote a commentary on the new study published last month in The Lancet In addition to the potential harm Dr Griffin said painkillers like Nsaids often dont really do the job when it comes to chronic pain If these drugs are making your life a lot better that may be worth the risks she said But a lot of people will tell you I cant tell if theyre doing anything I just take them every day anyway  Nsaids include ibuprofen sold under the brand names Motrin and Advil naproxen sold as Aleve Naprosyn Anaprox and Naprelan and celecoxib sold as Celebrex and available only by prescription Aspirin also an Nsaid is primarily used in low doses to prevent heart disease and was not included in the analysis The cardiovascular risks associated with Nsaids first came to light more than a decade ago when studies of drugs like Vioxx Bextra and Celebrex found increased risks of heart attacks and strokes Merck withdrew Vioxx from the market in  and Pfizer withdrew Bextra a year later Since then evidence has been gathering that nearly all Nsaids pose some cardiovascular risks in heavy users said   the director of the   at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the new reports authors The consistency of the cumulative findings in genetic mouse and human studies is extremely rare said Dr FitzGerald The analysis financed by the   and the   and published online on May  was five years in the making Diclofenac which is not used much in the United States and COX inhibitors like celecoxib marketed as Celebrex account for three heart attacks and strokes a year on average  one of them fatal  among every  patients taking high doses regularly the study found Officials at Pfizer which makes Celebrex say it is not approved for use at doses higher than  milligrams a day and they have maintained for years that it does not carry the same risks as other COX inhibitors an assertion that Dr FitzGerald said is not borne out by the data Ibuprofen taken at high daily doses of  milligrams also significantly raised heart attack risk possibly doubling it But data about ibuprofen is scant making it difficult to precisely assess the risk It may also be that ibuprofen dilutes the benefits of lowdose aspirin therapy among patients at risk for heart disease Dr FitzGerald said but it was difficult to determine this without detailed information about patients use of aspirin For those who can tolerate it the safest therapy appears to be naproxen Even at high daily doses of  milligrams naproxen does not increase cardiovascular risk and may actually have a protective effect similar to that of aspirin the analysis found Unfortunately it also appears to cause more gastrointestinal problems than other Nsaids while the COX inhibitors like Celebrex generally seem to cause fewer such complications All Nsaids  including naproxen which may protect against heart attacks  increase the risk of heart failure the study found Nsaids may also cause damage to the liver and kidneys and raise the risk of high blood pressure Still some doctors worry that all the focus on cardiovascular risk will dissuade people who live with chronic severe pain from taking advantage of treatments that statistically speaking are unlikely to cause them harm and can substantially improve their quality of life People get very worked up about the cardiac risks and they are real said   a rheumatologist and associate professor at Georgetown University But these are populationwide risks There are people with arthritis using these drugs every day or most days and most of them never have a problem So how do consumers choose the right pain relievers Here is some advice from the experts   For people who cant function without daily use of Nsaids our advice has always been use the lowest dose you can for the least amount of time you can said   chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic   If you have heart disease or risk factors for it your doctor should assess the risk of chronic Nsaid use based on your personal medical and family medical history A history of gastrointestinal problems should be part of the equation as well   Naproxen is a good first choice for chronic pain as long as your stomach can tolerate it   If you are on a lowdose aspirin regimen to prevent heart disease avoid Nsaids containing ibuprofen which may weaken the beneficial effect of aspirin   If you struggle with chronic pain you may want to explore alternatives like cognitive behavioral therapy suggested   of Oregon Health and Science University a pain expert
