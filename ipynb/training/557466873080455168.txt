A plan to stop daily meals on wheels deliveries to older peoples homes has been criticised by the commissioner for older people and the SDLP The South Eastern Health Trust said it has taken a cost effective decision to deliver  frozen meals every two weeks instead of an every day service It said carers will still visit those who need help to heat or eat meals But the commissioner for older people said she was very worried about the withdrawal of a vital service Claire Keatinge told the BBCs Talkback programme Across the UK and Ireland  of older people admitted to hospital from home suffer from malnutrition  of patients at risk of malnutrition come from their own homes She said it was absolutely appalling that  older people affected by the move had not been consulted before the matter was raised in the media The proposal was revealed in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Monday by the SDLPs health spokesman Fearghal McKinney He said the South Eastern Health Trusts plans to stop daily deliveries would reduce older peoples contact with carers  They are the eyes and ears a safety check if you like to report on the changing health needs of older homebound adults he told the assembly He said while the current Transforming Your Care health review plans were aimed at provision in the community to keep people out of hospital the trusts actions may put them in hospital in a weakened state However the South Eastern Health Trust has taken issue with his remarks Its director of nursing and older peoples service Nicki Patterson said any older person who needed help with their frozen meals would still receive daily visits from health care staff I would like to reassure people that the nutritional value of the meals is as good if not better than the current meals Ms Patterson said If an individual needs further services such as help with heating and eating meals then that service is provided by our staff and there will be no change Currently Northern Irelands five health trusts deliver meals to older people in their own homes on a daily basis in what is known as a community meals service The Belfast Trust is the biggest provider supplying  community meals each week to  people The Western Health Trust commissions approximately   community meals per week to  people  The Southern Health Trust pays contractors to provide hot daily meals rather than a chilled or frozen service but deliver to a relatively small number of people  Only  people receive its community meals The Northern Health Trust provides  community meals per week to  clients but there have been very few new referrals for several years The South Eastern Health Trust currently commissions approximately  community meals per week to  eligible older people It has not consulted those who receive the meals about the change from fresh to frozen Ms Patterson told the BBCs Nolan Show that the process of awarding a contract to a frozen meal provider had already gone out to tender but was not yet complete She said all the older people who are set to be affected by the move are to be individually engaged with What we need to recognise is that in a very challenging financial climate throughout the public sector in Northern Ireland and theres certainly been considerable coverage of that in the budget agreement over the last  hours it is incumbent on all of us who work in the public sector to review how were providing services If we can provide as good a service as previously in a more cost effective way then we absolutely need to consider that However the commissioner for older people said the way the South Eastern Health Trust had gone about the process was entirely unacceptable Ms Keatinge complained that the change was effectively de facto The process is already out to tender and the individual needs of todays and tomorrows older people appear not to be taken into consideration the commissioner said  In a statement on Monday the South Eastern Trust said that the frozen meals were carefully specified by experienced trust staff and were in line with strict dietetic guidance
