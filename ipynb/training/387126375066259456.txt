Short care visits to elderly and disabled people are disgraceful and on the rise a charity has claimed In England  of councils use minute visits which are not long enough to provide adequate care Leonard Cheshire Disability says The charity says such visits can force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet The government said the Care Bill would prevent inappropriate short visits but would not outlaw minute visits Leonard Cheshire wants a ban on what it calls the scandal of flying minute visits lobbying the government to prevent the practice in England Care minister Norman Lamb said the government cant ban these short visits completely because they are useful in some circumstances such as when a carer visits to give someone medicine But he told the BBC a minute visit was completely inappropriate when people needed things like feeding or bathing Were actually introducing an amendment to the Care Bill this week which will require councils to focus on an individuals wellbeing when theyre organising care on their behalf and so this sort of very short visit for personal care would not meet that standard he said He also said the government plans to force the NHS and local government to work better together and end the ridiculous split between health and social care  said short visits simply do not allow enough time to deliver goodquality care It said data from  local authorities pointed to a  rise in such visits in the last five years and said some in councils more than  of care visits were carried out in less than  minutes The charitys latest research looks at England alone but in August Unison accused many councils in Scotland of providing care on the cheap by arranging minute home visits and in June the union said  of Welsh councils were doing the same Research by the UK Homecare Association published last year suggested  of home visits in Northern Ireland lasted  minutes or less the highest proportion in the UK  in England and  in both Scotland and Wales Separate care bills are currently going through the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly Chief executive Clare Pelham said visits should be at least  minutes long It is disgraceful to force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet by providing care visits as short as  minutes long she said Ms Pelham said most people need  minutes to get up washed dressed and have breakfast We are treating disabled and older people as if they are robots to be serviced rather than real people who deserve to be treated with kindness and consideration she added But the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services Adass which represents care managers argued it was totally wrong to suggest all caring tasks require more than  minutes Sandie Keene the associations president said some short visits were fully justified and fully adequate It was frankly naive to believe that simply by abolishing minute slots a magic wand will have been waved and improvements automatically achieved in our care services she added Ms Keene said social workers and their managers had to make horrendously difficult choices every day to give the best possible care with limited resources Leonard Cheshire wants peers to back a ban on short visits by amending   when it is debated in the House of Lords on Wednesday Speaking to BBC Radio  live Rosaleen a Thames Valley care worker who gave only her first name said minute visits usually overrun But she said the short time available still forced carers to make choices such as whether to leave someone alone with a hot drink which they might spill on themselves or sit with them while they drink but fail to get them ready for bed Asked if peoples safety was being compromised by visits being too short she replied Their safety their independence their dignity Another care worker told the BBC that travel time was not included in her pay so she would work unpaid time every day travelling between appointments Sally Lubanov  who is housebound said even in minute visits nothing got done because carers would take some time booking in checking what the previous visitor had done and preparing for whatever tasks needed doing She said minute visits might be fine for giving someone medicine but for people living alone it was wonderful to see someone and short visits allowed no time for conversation The Local Government Association LGA said social care was substantially underfunded and councils were under increasing pressure Significant cuts to council funding mean local authorities are struggling to meet the rising demand for home care visits said Katie Hall chairwoman of the LGAs community and wellbeing board She said minute visits should never be the sole basis for care but added In some circumstances such as administering medication they can be appropriate but only as part of a wider comprehensive care plan involving longer onetoone visits Leonard Cheshire Disability said a survey of  people found  of those who expressed an opinion agreed  minutes was not long enough to support a disabled or older person to do everyday things like wash dress and get out of bed in the morning
