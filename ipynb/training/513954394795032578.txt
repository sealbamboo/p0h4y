On Friday NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell   following the release of a video that showed former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice assaulting his thenfiancee Goodell apologized for his role in the NFLs handling of the matter He also vowed that the NFL will mandate trainings on preventing abuse for all players and staff What the trainings will entail remains to be seen But researchers say that to truly cut back on violence among players the NFL should address at least one major risk factor a culture of acceptance in professional sports Of course the type of people who engage in domestic violence is disturbingly diverse  some accountants judges even clergymen hit their partners But lately the question has been Why the NFL Especially when the vast majority of NFL players will never abuse their wives or beat their children Football is not even the most violent sport says Richard Gelles a professor of social policy at the University of Pennsylvania Why arent we hearing about wrestlers or boxers You know the old joke I went to a fight and a hockey game broke out  Gelles has been studying domestic violence since the s He has done a lot of research on sports but he also has looked into family violence among members of the military combat infantry soldiers trained to kill an enemy The US Army brought in Gelles to conduct an internal study in the s It wanted to find out if men trained to kill were more likely to beat their wives or hit their kids Gelles found that rates of domestic violence in the Army were slightly higher than in the general population But the most startling finding was that the highest rate of domestic violence in the Unites States Army was not in combat infantry or Special Forces he says It was those people who worked in supply Supply  as in ordering things and receiving them Restocking for missions So the training of people to be violent and violence as part of your work culture is not a sufficient explanation for whats going on in the NFL Gelles says Its challenging to measure rates of domestic violence because most incidents are not reported to the police or anyone else but Gelles is not convinced that rates in the NFL are significantly higher than in the general population He also notes that even when aggression is the goal its quite difficult to train people to be violent In World War II only about  percent of combat infantry actually fired their weapons So where   people who abuse their partners and children learn the behavior How farreaching should these NFL trainings be  a psychologist at the University of Michigan has spent his career trying to figure out what makes some people violent Much of his research points to childhood experiences Children are great imitators Huesmann says Children who grow up with physical abuse and domestic violence are learning that this is a way you deal with other people when you want to make them bend to your will he says You hit them  the Minnesota Vikings running back recently indicted by a grand jury on a child abuse charge for his method of disciplining his son says his own father whipped him as a child Peterson even chose the same instrument his father used to discipline him a switch cut from a tree No NFL training can change what players experienced as children But that sort of education can address the biggest risk factor for committing acts of violence having committed such an act before Researchers say its much easier to be violent if youre getting a message that violence is acceptable The NFL has at least indirectly and   been sending that message for decades It doesnt just reach players says   a violence prevention educator It trickles down to fans  even the youngest ones Millions of boys across the United States have big posters of football players on their wall says Katz You can bet that they know whats going on here Katz works with NFL players in a program called   Mentors in Violence Prevention  a training program thats just the sort Goodell promised Friday to mandate for all NFL players In August NPR   and how its used with high school boys to prevent sexual assault Katz has trained players in the NFL for almost  years But except for consistent work with one team the New England Patriots hes been brought in only occasionally he says Its never been systematic in the NFL Katz says Weve argued for years that we could do so much more if they wanted us and wanted to make it happen He hasnt gotten a call from the NFL about the new mandate But in order to make a difference in players behavior he says the trainings will have to go beyond a oneshot presentation What were talking about here is culture change Katz says Were talking about setting a tone where abusive behavior is seen as completely unacceptable In the meantime Richard Gelles says that even the delayed reaction to Ray Rices abusive behavior is progress This year Gelles says is the first time that I have seen a professional athlete really rung up and sanctioned for domestic violence Gelles can rattle off a long list of baseball players basketball players and football players who were not arrested and who were allowed to keep playing even after particularly brutal assaults of their wives and girlfriends But he suspects those days in professional sports might be coming to an end because what has been private is now becoming public he says in the form of YouTube videos and the   that follows Thats something institutions like the NFL can no longer ignore
