It hasnt been a good week for the Affordable Care Act After announcements by the administration of   Republicans returned to Capitol Hill and began piling on This law is literally just unraveling before our eyes said Rep Paul Ryan RWis at a   I dont know how you can conclude that this is not a total fiasco But this isnt the first time a major health law has gotten off to a rocky start In the beginning things didnt look so good for the now very successful   either About this time in  the percentage of people who had an unfavorable opinion of the law was actually higher than those who had a favorable opinion says Sabrina Corlette a research professor at the   So there was a lot of uncertainty and a lot of questions about whether this program was a good idea Corlette who recently   on the lessons learned from the implementation of the Medicare drug law says many of the same complaints being made about the Affordable Care Act today were also made about the Medicare drug program then The Medicare invited private insurance plans to compete to offer prescription drug coverage to seniors and the disabled A lot of folks really questioned the design of the program she said They thought it was going to cost way too much there were a lot of concerns about it Many of those concerns of course were   They were infuriated that Republicans were getting credit for adding a drug benefit known as   The Democrats werent anywhere near as vitriolic about the Medicare plan as Republicans have been about the health law but there was still quite a   remembers Mike Leavitt who was secretary of health and human services at the time There is always a political backdrop to the implementation of a controversial law said Leavitt in an interview With Part D clearly the Democrats did not believe this would succeed and I think in their heart didnt want it to succeed I suspect the inverse is true in the context of this Affordable Care Act law And if you think the Republicans have been critical of the Obama administrations efforts to promote the Affordable Care Act you might not remember the howls from Democrats about the Bush administrations promotional efforts for the Medicare drug expansion Those mostly involved a   that featured top administration officials as well as representatives of private companies I went to  cities myself Leavitt recalled at a   Im sorry   cities and did  events The bus traveled over  miles we had  events that we ultimately orchestrated Yet perhaps the most memorable part of the rollout of the Medicare drug law was when it first went live on New Years Day in  Things   Computers couldnt talk to each other properly Seniors ended up on endless phone holds It took several months to work out many of the kinks This time   is overseeing the implementation of the health law for the Department of Health and Human Services He said at the Brookings session that he and his staff learned a lot of important lessons from the Medicare drug law experience Oct  its all hands on deck he said referring to the day after the health exchanges open for people to start signing up Cohen said he and his staff will be prepared for the fact that things arent going to be absolutely perfect right out of the gate And I think were trying to communicate that to make sure that people understand that this is big it is complicated but over the course of time we will get there and we are mobilized to try to address whatever issues will come up Which is eventually what happened with the Medicare drug law Eight years later its inconceivable that we wouldnt have a Medicare drug benefit says Georgetowns Corlette Its an enormously popular program no matter what your political persuasion All of which hardly guarantees a similar success for the health law But the history of not just the Medicare drug law but Medicare itself has shown that lessthansmooth launches havent necessarily signaled a failure to follow
