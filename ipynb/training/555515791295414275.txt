Twenty children or adolescents were hospitalized for firearmrelated injuries every day in  and  died of their wounds a new report says The   provides one of the most comprehensive recent efforts to tally the number of children hurt nationally in gunrelated incidents It was published Monday in the journal Pediatrics A national database of patients younger than  who were admitted to hospitals in  shows that boys represented nearly  of the total and that the rate of gunshotrelated hospitalizations for African American males was  times that of white males Blacks ages  to  were  times more likely than their white peers to be injured by gunfire And  of all black children hospitalized for gun injury compared with  of all white children injured by firearms were classified as victims of assault Latino children and adolescents were three times likelier than white children to be hospitalized with a firearmrelated injury Hospital care for youths injured by gunfire cost  million in  according to the report but that is a fraction of the overall cost of the injuries It doesnt include physicianrelated services rehabilitation and ongoing care and rehospitalization and does not take into account many victims loss of future productivity Past research has found that almost half of children hospitalized for gunrelated injury are discharged with a disability The latest estimate boosts the number of those younger than  hurt by firearms in  to  from  For years public health researchers have relied on the National Epidemiological Injury Surveillance System to track gunfirerelated injuries in the United States Though that system is to be expanded under an Obama administration initiative launched last year it has based its national estimates of all kinds of injuries  including those resulting from gunfire  on a yearly sampling of  hospital emergency departments across the country The database used in the latest research samples a larger number of hospitals and is thus likely to generate a more accurate accounting of firearms toll on children and adolescents The database covers all but six states covering  of the US populace In the latest accounting researchers from the medical schools of Yale and Boston universities asserted that decades of aggressive injuryprevention efforts have driven down the pediatric toll of poisonings household fires and drownings By contrast they said there have been no robust public health efforts to reduce firearms injuries They suggest that is largely because since  federal law has essentially blocked the use of taxpayer dollars for research that might bolster calls for gun control measures Meanwhile the researchers wrote gunrelated injuries have followed a pattern of inequality seen elsewhere on the American health landscape Victims are far more likely to be poor and members of an ethnic minority than they are to be white and affluent Victims ages  to  made up  of the children brought to the hospital with gunshot wounds and twothirds of those injuries were attributed to assault Among these older children roughly  of the cases were considered unintentional Suicide attempts accounted for  of  of those firearmrelated hospitalizations Among younger children accidental firearm injuries were most common Of the  children under  brought to the hospital in connection with a firearm injury roughly threequarters were considered victims of an accidental or unintended shooting Thirtyone children younger than  and  ages  to  were injured in gunrelated assaults in  Among Latino youths firearmrelated injuries were three times higher than among white children the data show And African American girls were more than six times as likely as their white counterparts to be injured by gunfire Suicide attempts accounted for  of the gunrelated hospitalizations  a total of  kids in   of whom were younger than  Onethird of these children and adolescents died a fatality rate roughly eight times higher than that of assault or unintentionalinjury victims
