A national charity for patient safety and justice has called for a review of patient safety in Northern Ireland The charity has written to Health Minister Edwin Poots seeking an independent urgent review Action Against Medical Accidents said it had been contacted by a family after an investigation into their loved ones death revealed a series of failings  The family only became aware of the details a year later after a BBC Spotlight investigation  Charlie Patterson  died after a lengthy wait in the Royal Victoria Hospitals emergency department in January  Spotlight reporter Declan Lawn said There were significant delays in getting him the treatment he needed But crucially his family werent told that at the time  They first heard of it two days after the Spotlight programme went out when they got a call from the Royal to ask them to come in and read a report into his death An investigation is under way into several deaths at the Royal Victoria Hospitals emergency department in which delays in treating the patients may have been a contributory factor in their deaths On Tuesday night  March Spotlight will look again at the latest developments in the story It will also speak to the family of Mr Patterson Charlie lay on a trolley for several hours said Declan Lawn He was becoming more and more unwell and eventually he lost consciousness By the time the doctors realised how serious his condition was he had an internal haemorrhage inside his head It was too late  He was moved up to a ward and he died three days later He had waited too long to see a doctor he had waited too long to get a cat scan And he had waited too long to get the drugs that he needed and that might have helped him One of the most difficult things for the Boyle family is that they werent told that Charlie was even in the emergency department until am   seven hours after he had arrived So they missed those last crucial hours with him when he was still conscious and they didnt get to say goodbye BBC Northern Ireland health correspondent MarieLouise Connolly said  Spotlight reveals a catalogue of failings into Mr Pattersons care resulting in a safety and quality learning letter issued by the Health and Social Care Board to all local hospitals The chief executive of Action Against Medical Accidents Peter Walsh  said the family felt let down upset and angry  The organisation  is now calling for the introduction of a statutory duty of candour such as is being introduced in England where organisations would have a legal obligation to be open with families   Mr Walsh said There could not be a clearer example of why a legal duty of candour is needed in Northern Ireland   This lack of openness with patients and families must not be tolerated and those responsible should be held to account   As things stand a hospital is not breaking any statutory law rule or regulation in withholding information of this kind  Mr Walsh said there were problems with emergency pressures across the UK but those in Belfast were really extraordinary What really adds insult to injury for the family of Charlie Patterson is that not only were they denied the opportunity of speaking to him when he was in the emergency department before he lost consciousness not only potentially could something have been done which may have  saved his life but also theyve had to suffer the knowledge that the circumstances of his death have been withheld from them for over a year he told the BBCs Nolan show on Tuesday Mr Walsh said the circumstances of Mr Pattersons death were the subject of a formal internal investigation and the failings in care became the subject of a learning letter issued by the health board A health system or health organisation whos prepared to tolerate coverups or withholding of information of this type is not only lacking in ethics it is lacking in a patient safety mindset he said This is something that has to be addressed and addressed urgently Speaking to BBC Newsline on Tuesday Mr Poots the health minister said All of the evidence that would be indicated to us is that there are a small number of incidents where care falls short Theres  people go through our emergency departments theres five SAIs serious adverse incidents relating to people who have not been treated as well as they should have where they have actually died So we are looking at a situation where its very very sad that thats the case but we need to reflect that many many people who are using these services are getting excellent care
