Velveeta, a processed cheese that some say would survive the apocalypse, is getting yanked off the shelves in 12 states for not having enough preservatives. Kraft Foods is recalling 260 cases of 32 oz. "original" flavor Velveeta from Wal-Mart stores because their sorbic acid levels are too low. This could lead the food to spoil or people to get sick. The mainly Midwest states the recalled Velveeta could have wound up in are Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. There are 12 boxes in each case, bringing the total recall to 3,120 boxes. Their UPC code is 021000611614.
