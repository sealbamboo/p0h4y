Using the labor of dozens of undergraduate students scientists have built a customized yeast chromosome from scratch Its a milestone in the rapidly growing field of synthetic biology where organisms can be tailored for industrial use In this case the nearterm goal is to understand the genetics of yeast and eventually the genetics of us This was quite an undertaking Yeast have about  genes packed in  tidy bundles called chromosomes Each chromosome is an enormous molecule of DNA packed in proteins The story started about  years ago when   a prominent Stanford University geneticist stood up at a science meeting and declared that someday someone would build a yeast chromosome from scratch I remember saying to myself Why on Earth world anyone do that  says geneticist   who was then working at Johns Hopkins University About  years later Boeke bumped into a Hopkins colleague   at a coffee shop and they started talking about huge molecules they could synthesize Boeke suggested they could build a yeast chromosome from scratch and he looks at me incredulous and said  Really Weve got to do it Weve got to do it  Boeke recalls Chandrasegaran was practically jumping up and down with excitement Boeke says At first Boeke tried to buy some of the DNA strands they wanted to use from a commercial outfit But the first small batch took nearly a year to arrive I realized I would be dead long before the project could ever be completed he says So it suddenly hit me that there were all these students on the undergraduate campus who would be dying for a great research opportunity Boeke and his colleagues put together a class called BuildAGenome and got undergraduates at Hopkins to do the painstaking labor of constructing long strings of DNA These would eventually become segments of their yeast chromosome They   evidence of their success Thursday in   The team built yeast chromosome No  from scratch More precisely they assembled the DNA strand thats the core of the chromosome and put it in a yeast cell which then proceeded to package it up in proteins and coil it into the compact structure of a chromosome To make the chromosome useful for research theyve deleted some parts of the DNA that they believe are not essential and then we add a number of bells and whistles to the chromosome that we think will make for a more interesting version that we can play evolutionary games with in the laboratory Boeke says Theyre interested in going after big questions such as what is it in the DNA that keeps one species separate from the next Of course this deep manipulation of DNA also raises ethical questions  about everything from patenting lifeforms to the potential misuse of biotechnology for weapons or other nefarious purposes So part of the class involved an ethics discussion led by Debra Mathews a bioethicist at Johns Hopkins Its not just this particular project Mathews says noting that yeast arent likely to be the starting point for anything that might harm humans But she adds the students are learning techniques that are transferable to many other organisms and because you have this fantastic power to modify DNA it comes with responsibilities Ronald Davis who long ago suggested that someone would eventually do this says hes impressed with the result He says you might be tempted to dismiss this as a stunt but when its with yeast its not a stunt Its a milestone event in my opinion If scientists can build all  yeast chromosomes from scratch theyd have an entire set of yeast genes to tinker with That could be a big advance for understanding how genes work in yeast  and by extension in humans We have similar chromosomes You can look at a car and you think you understand a car Davis says But if you really understand a car you should be able to build one Jef Boeke is now working to build other yeast chromosomes He recently became director of the Institute for Systems Genetics at New York Universitys Langone Medical Center and hes become part of an   that aims to build the remaining  yeast chromosomes from scratch So far people were working on all but one of them If theres a millionaire out there who would like chromosome  named after them tell them to get in touch Boeke says and smiles
