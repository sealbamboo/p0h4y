As Congress mulls changing Americas border and naturalization rules a study finds that immigrant workers are helping buttress Medicares finances Immigrants contribute tens of billions of dollars a year more than immigrant retirees use in medical services Immigrants particularly noncitizens heavily subsidize Medicare the   in the journal   Policies that reduce immigration would almost certainly weaken Medicares financial health while an increasing flow of immigrants might bolster its sustainability The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund which pays for Medicares Part A inpatient hospital care skilled nursing facilities home health and hospice for the aged and disabled had assets of  billion at the start of  but is projected to run out of money in  as the population ages according to   It is financed by payroll and selfemployment taxes Researchers look at the effect of  million immigrants counted in the Census on the financing of the Medicare program It included those who had become US citizens as well as those who hadnt but the authors noted probably excludes many illegal immigrants who avoided the survey The study found that in  immigrants contributed  billion to the trust fund nearly  percent of total contributions They received  billion of expenditures about  percent giving the trust fund a surplus of  billion People born in the United States on the other hand contributed  billion and received  billion decreasing the trust fund by  billion according to the papers lead author   a researcher at Cambridge Health Alliance in Massachusetts Between  and  immigrants generated a cumulative surplus of  billion for the trust fund the study found Most of the surplus contribution came from noncitizens The immigrants created a net gain primarily because of demographics There are  immigrants of working age for every one elderly immigrant but only  workingage native citizens for every one retiree Although that ratio could change in the future the report notes that the Census Bureau projects that the share of immigrants in the United States will increase for the next  years In addition care for immigrants also costs Medicare slightly less The average expenditure was  for immigrant enrollees and  for enrollees born in the US a difference of borderline significance according to the paper written by Zallman and colleagues at the City University of New York and Harvard Medical School The researchers wrote that changes in the nations immigration policy that would create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants would increase revenues for the trust fund as many workers would shift from underthetable employment to work where payroll taxes were collected Also they would have an easier time getting higherpaid jobs However letting the undocumented become citizens would also increase the number eligible for Medicare and therefore the expenditures on their behalf The researchers did not factor in the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund which finances Medicare Part B to pay for physician services and outpatient care into most of their calculations Thats because the financial trajectory of that fund is less clear as it relies on enrollee premiums and annual appropriations from Congress There was no significant difference between the amount spent on immigrants and USborn people from that fund the study noted The authors interjected personal views normally not found in academic papers of this sort The paper anticipates that the immigrant surplus to the hospital trust fund will continue for many years as most of those workers are decades away from retirement In an interview Zallman said If we continue to have a steady influx of working age immigrants were likely to see the subsidy continue for many years to come
