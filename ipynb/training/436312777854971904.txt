An increasing number of unders with mental health problems in England are being treated on adult psychiatric wards it has emerged And many children are having to travel hundreds of miles across the country to receive hospital treatment  Treating young people in such units should happen only in exceptional circumstances The Department of Health had promised this would stop by  The DoH said children and young peoples mental health was a priority Using Freedom of Information requests the BBC and   found the number of unders being treated in adult units was in its hundreds  and rising    Data returned by  of the  NHS mental health trusts in England showed that  unders have been admitted so far to adult mental health wards in  compared with  two years earlier The figures also reveal that  unders have been admitted so far in  compared with just three in  Of  trusts that provided outofarea placement data  had sent children more than  miles away for care The furthest distance was from Sussex to Bury Greater Manchester   miles Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said it had to make the admission because there was no bed available nearer home   Data obtained from the Care Quality Commission confirmed that the social care regulator had received an alert about a yearold being admitted to an adult psychiatric unit Dr Michael McClure consultant child psychiatrist and clinical director of childrens and adolescents mental health services at Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust said doctors were faced with this problem every week Sometimes we have to make  to  phone calls around the country looking for a bed They young people shouldnt be shunted around into inappropriate facilities however much the staff there try to help them said Dr McClure It may be the first time theyve had a breakdown They need to stay in touch with the people they know and love and if theyre having to move  or  miles its very difficult for the family to stay in touch Dr McClure said funding for mental health services had been cut particularly for child and adolescent services in the community   That means there is more difficultly in looking after these young people in the community so there is greater pressure on the inpatient services he said One mother who did not want to be named said her yearold daughter was sent from Hull to a psychiatric unit in Stafford  miles away  One time she got upset because she didnt want me to go and they had to prise her off me the mother said They put her in a room and as I was leaving the unit she was shouting out the window Mummy Mummy dont leave me please Dont leave me Mummy Its not just like breaking an arm its emotionally draining And to cope with that as well as having to travel  its the most difficult thing a mother could ever have to deal with Nicola Mattocks  from London has been admitted to a mental health ward on four occasions The first time was when she was    Each time she was sent more than an hour from home making it difficult for her father  her primary carer  to visit and impossible for her friends She said it was uncomfortable and unsettling and often frightening I couldnt see my dad as often as Id like and my friends couldnt get there as it was so far away I felt quite alienated she said A DoH spokesman said the experience could be very distressing for children and their families  Our mental health crisis care concordat reinforces the duty on the NHS to make sure that people under  are treated in an environment suitable for their age according to their needs he said He said the DoH had invested m to improve services through better monitoring sharing best practice and improving access to specialist talking therapies for young people  Dr Jacqueline Cornish NHS Englands national clinical director for children young people and transition to adulthood said treating children with mental health problems in adult settings was totally unacceptable in the majority of cases  NHS England is conducting a threemonth rapid review into the situation she added Marjorie Wallace chief executive of mental health charity Sane said The traumatisation of young people exposed to often frightening conditions on adult wards is another symptom of the crisis in the mental health system and is the predictable result of both the acute shortage of beds for all ages and the cuts to local community services  There is little point in the pledges being given by health ministers if they do not make it possible for trusts to reopen closed units and ensure that young people receive treatment before they become too seriously ill Sarah Brennan chief executive of the charity Young Minds said the increase in children placed on adult wards was predictable following cuts to early intervention services over the last four years  The lack of help early on means we are letting childrens problems escalate to serious levels she said This alongside the lack of accurate data about the mental health needs of our nations children and young people means commissioning has been based on outofdate inaccurate information leading to outofdate provision
