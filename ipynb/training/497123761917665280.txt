Sure money cant buy you love but its hard to imagine that winning rewards wont make us happy It does researchers say but only if our immediate expectations arent bigger than the size of the payoff Disappointment squelches happiness Your happiness increases only if you do better than you expected says   a neuroscientist and senior research associate at University College London Just having a bigger salary isnt enough to make you happy Rutledge and his colleagues are trying to figure out how the brain calculates the determinants of happiness which they think could be useful in diagnosing and treating depression and other mood disorders To find this out they first had  students play a decisionmaking game with small financial rewards It turned out that the ultimate amount of money they won didnt affect their happiness Instead it was much more dependent on expectations and rewards moment to moment as they played the game Then the researchers had tens of thousands of people play the game through the online   which they created to see if free smartphone games could be used to   They think that the large number of people participating compensates for the lack of controls Its one of   to use phone games in neuroscience Using all that data they were able to predict exactly how happy people would be as they played the game based on the rewards they had just received and their expectations of winning or losing In other words our brains are quickly recalculating our happiness levels as we go through the day Medical applications of this are far far away but it does raise the question of whether it makes sense to gain the system You cant really make yourself happier by cheating the system Rutledge told Shots The best thing is for your expectations to be accurate Thats because expectations affect happiness long before the reward Looking forward to an evening out with friends a job promotion or the birth of a child can bring great joy And though not overhyping may help prevent shortterm disappointment Its good to give people positive expectations Rutledge adds You dont want your boss to expect nothing from you The   were published Monday in the
