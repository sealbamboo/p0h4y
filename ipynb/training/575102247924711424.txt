Women on HRT pills should be aware that there is a small chance of an increased risk of blood clots and possibly stroke according to a study  The link was made by the international Cochrane group which looked at medical trials involving some  women While HRT pills can ease menopausal symptoms and may offer some protection against heart disease this must be weighed against other possible harms Women facing the dilemma should discuss it with their doctor experts say  The Cochrane researchers say their study is not the final word on HRT  more investigations are needed to get a clearer picture of all the benefits and risks  Experts also point out that many women now take HRT as a patch or gel rather than a tablet  the study did not look at these formulations Over the years there has been a lot of research into and negative press about HRT  Its use has been linked to breast and   as well as blood clots  But while risks do exist most experts agree that HRT can be a good and safe treatment to help many women control unpleasant menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes  One million women in the UK are on some form of hormone replacement therapy  be that pills patches or gels  The Cochrane Review only looked at women taking oral HRT tablets  It found HRT may But   were not clearcut  the effect varied according to a womans age when she experienced the menopause and how long she had been taking HRT  For example the heart protection was only seen in the youngest women in the study  those younger than  when they began taking HRT or women who had started the treatment relatively soon after reaching the menopause  And in terms of absolute numbers the risks were small  By the researchers calculations if  women under  years old started hormone therapy and stayed on it for seven years you might expect to see five extra cases of blood clots and four more strokes compared with  similar women not on HRT  At the same time there would be six fewer deaths and eight fewer cases of heart disease in the HRT group  Lead researcher Dr Henry Boardman said the findings needed careful consideration  This is a complicated health issue where the same treatment offers benefits in some women but harms in others The risk of stroke and blood clots is listed in the product information for women and prescribers And experts already advise that women on HRT should have regular health checkups and their need to continue treatment should be reassessed at least annually Maureen Talbot of the British Heart Foundation said This study supports what we already know and indicates a possible increased risk of stroke or formation of a blood clot in some women It is important that women have a full understanding of the risks and benefits of HRT and should talk this through with their GP Janice Rymer is professor of gynaecology spokeswoman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and a member of the British Menopause Society  She said that women should not be scared off from seeking help and treatment for menopausal symptoms  If you are severely overweight and have a family history of clotting problems then it probably isnt going to be for you  But we know about the risks and for most they are small The absolute numbers are very small
