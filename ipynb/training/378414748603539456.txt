Try to imagine someone who is supremely calm while at the same time bursting with energy and youve got a pretty good idea of what   is like Hes a cancer researcher physician cyclist kayaker and cook not always in that order He approaches each activity with incredible passion But to really understand Olson you have to watch him in action with patients My remarkable visit with him a part of my series   begins on the top floor of Seattle Childrens Hospital Its a Wednesday pediatric tumor clinic day and Olson is zipping down the hall while I try to keep up We enter a small windowless room where the pediatric cancer team gathers before seeing patients Olson checks the chart of Carver Faull a yearold boy with a   the most common type of pediatric brain cancer Carver had surgery about  months earlier to remove his tumor Hes just had an MRI scan This is his first brain scan after his therapy and its always a nervewracking one for the families to be wondering what its going to look like Olson says Olson studies the scan for a few seconds then heads down the hall and walks into an examining room Thats where Carver his hair slicked into a mohawk is sitting quietly on a stool next to his mother We have really good news for you Olson tells them No brain tumor A nurse has already leaked the good news so while Carver and his mom are pleased to hear it from Olson theyre not surprised But as good as the news is about the cancer Carver still has serious health problems Olson plops down on a stool and scoots it a little closer to Carver When he speaks to the boy his tone is gentle but direct  mantoman So since your last visit here what are the things youre most worried about Olson asks I guess what people think of my eye Carver says in a quavering voice His words come slowly And um maybe I wont be able to run and jump like everyone else Carver pauses for a few seconds He looks like hes trying to remember something Sorry what was the question he asks Carver has shortterm memory loss He has eye problems He has walking problems None of these issues was a result of his tumor They were all caused by the surgery that successfully treated his brain cancer The surgeons didnt do anything wrong The problem is that right now to cut out a medulloblastoma surgeons must splay open the brain to find exactly where the malignancy is And that exploration itself can cause brain damage Then once they find the tumor they want to remove all of it But cancer cells dont look all that different from healthy brain cells so inevitably surgeons wind up removing some healthy brain tissue too To try to avoid these sorts of problems in future patients Olson and his colleagues have been working on a substance they call   Its a molecule that consists of two parts One is a protein that can go into the bloodstream and all by itself find a cancerous tumor The other part is a fluorescent dye so when a surgeon shines a light on the tumor it glows The hope is that   will allow surgeons to more easily distinguish malignancies from healthy tissue so that operations can be less invasive and less damaging Its taken Olson more than a decade to transform the paint from an idea into reality Hes had preliminary success with animals and studies in human patients are set to begin later this year Later on back in his office Olson tells me more about treating these desperately ill children And thats when I start to really understand what drives Olson forward  in his work in his life Too often he says he has to go into a room and say to anxious parents waiting for news about their childs tumor something like this And thats the easy part of the conversation What too often comes next is heartbreaking This is a tumor thats going to take your childs life more than likely sometime in the coming year Olson says he is sick to death of having to say this Sick of seeing the devastation on peoples faces Sick of feeling helpless And hes made it his lifes goal to change things Olson draws inspiration and strength from his patients and their families His decision to work with kids he says goes back to something that happened  years ago when he was still in training A yearold girl he was caring for died and the loss tore at his heart But his reaction was complicated The night that she died I was walking home and I was almost skipping or dancing Olson says I was really light and I was singing and humming out loud Neither of these things is typical for me And it was so absurd to me that this really profound event had happened that day and I was feeling so opposite So he sat down on a bench and tried to figure out what was going on It didnt take him long to realize his mood had to be related to a conversation with the girls parents Hed assumed that after their daughters death theyd want to get as far away from the hospital as possible But no They actually tracked me down and came up and gave me a beautiful warm hug Olson remembers And they said Her death to us was as beautiful as her birth and the reason for that was because of the words you shared with us as we went through this And we just want you to know that you have a gift that when medicine doesnt go the way you want it to that you can still help families recognize a life doesnt have to be  years long to be beautiful And so I sat there and thought about that for a long time and I realized that this was a gift that I had he says And not many people would recognize the gift or have it or want to share it But for me it felt like a calling of sorts Olson tore up the applications hed written for other medical specialties and committed himself to pediatrics Yet he also wanted to do research So he wound up going to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle where he could practice medicine and be a scientist too In the past  years or so Olson has cared for hundreds of children with brain cancer Though many have survived many havent Olson says he mourns the loss of every child But he doesnt see tragedy in the death Instead he sees beauty in their lives Its a perspective he learned early in his career from one family that lost a child Kathleen Strum first brought her son Hayden to see Olson in  when he was  years old Hayden had a way of as we say collecting hearts says Strum He was a very charming little guy He would run into radiation every day and say Heres me Its my turn its my turn  Strum says Haydens illness taught her that when your child has brain cancer you cant put anything off to tomorrow You have to try to make each moment magic For example one day there was a rare snowstorm in Seattle Hayden and his older brother Gunnar wanted to go outside and have a snowball fight but Hayden was too weak to get out of bed There was a big window in Haydens room and Strum says that gave Gunnar an idea Gunnar says I know Ill go outside and Ill throw snowballs at the window And we had play dough You throw the play dough at the window So I watched my two little boys have this play doughsnowball fight through the window It was beautiful she says As Olson watched how this family dealt with cancer he realized something fundamental For children facing death enjoying life  taking in all that life has to offer  means something very different than most adults imagine A child who is going to die from their cancer isnt mourning the high school prom theyre not going to get to go to Olson says Theyre not mourning the fact that they wont drive their first car For a child its are they happy Are their parents happy Are people crying in the room Is a cute dog going to come in and visit them at  oclock in the afternoon Its all about that moment that day Olson remembers the day he had to tell Kathleen and her husband that Haydens tumor had come back and it was going to take his life Their response to that was remarkable Olson says I went up to see how they were doing about  minutes later and Hayden was lying in his bed His parents were on the other side of the curtain that separated his bed from the rest of the ICU And they were saying to Hayden This is just like when youre going to be dead Im still here youre still there We just cant see each other Then they would open up the drapes Olson says  See Im still here youre still there Close the drapes See Im still here youre still there Thats what its going to be like after you die And Ive never seen a family do such a beautiful parenting move in my life How do such emotionally wrenching experiences affect Olson as a scientist He knows hes not going to find a cure for cancer tomorrow I dont wake up each morning saying damn we failed again There are no more kids surviving today than there were yesterday he says Feeling that way would be a burden too heavy to carry He says it would make him less creative less productive And he has no trouble explaining where the strength to keep at it comes from Theres nothing more powerful to drive you forward than to walk into a room with no real hope in your pocket he says Above all else Olsons an optimist The work that were doing he says can change the world
