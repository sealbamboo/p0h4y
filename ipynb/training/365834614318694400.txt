Looks like Arabian camels might be hiding more than just fat in those furry humps Scientists have found evidence that dromedary camels  the ones with just one hump  may be carriers of the lethal coronavirus in the Middle East which has infected at least  people and killed  since first appearing in Saudi Arabia last year The findings   Thursday in the journal   offer a new clue about where people might be catching the virus  one of the big mysterious surrounding the Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS Virologist   and her team at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands looked for signs of previous MERS infections in  retired racing camels in   which borders Saudi Arabia to the south The team also tested  camels in the   Spain off the coast of Western Africa All  Omani camels had antibodies in their blood to the   virus or a close relative And to Koopmanss surprise  percent of the camels from the Canary Islands also tested positive for the antibodies There is something like MERS infecting camels on the Spanish islands Koopmans tells Shots But the levels of antibodies were much higher in the Omani animals The camels in Spain may have been exposed to the virus sometime longer ago So far all the MERS cases have originated from the Arabian Peninsula  although a few travelers have   the virus to France Germany Tunisia and the UK Antibodies are molecules made by the immune system to fight off an infection They typically are specific to a particular pathogen but if two viruses look very similar one antibody could recognize both So we cannot be  percent sure that those antibodies we found were triggered by MERS Koopmans says But we think its likely that they were Weve done many tests to rule out other coronaviruses MERS is in the same family of coronaviruses that cause the common cold But its also a cousin to the SARS virus infected more than  people and killed more than  in  Until these new findings several signs had pointed to bats  or their excrement  as a likely source for MERS The flying mammals like to hang out in date trees in eastern Saudi Arabia where many cases have occurred And MERS is most   to a bat virus But Koopmans says the bat hypothesis didnt really make sense to her Bats all over the world have nasty viruses she says But we rarely see those in people It would be strange if all the sudden you have so many people infected with that virus Camels seem like a better candidate she says But they cant say for sure until they find the MERS virus itself in the animals and check other livestock on the Arabian Peninsula At least now Koopmans says they have a better idea about where to look
