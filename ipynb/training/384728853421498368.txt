Now and then you learn something about caring for the elderly that stops you in your tracks Like this Until last month federal regulations did not require all nursing homes to have automatic sprinkler systems Its a bit staggering isnt it Automatic sprinklers the most effective protection against fires have been mandated in any new nursing home certified by Medicare and Medicaid or in new construction added to an existing facility since  But for older nursing homes there was no such regulation until August   and the industry complaining about high costs was given five years to comply That deadline passed last month but more than  older nursing homes still do not have sprinklers or have only partial systems federal records show Most of these places have some sprinklers  perhaps only in laundries and kitchens perhaps in residents rooms but not hallways What partial means in this context is unclear a Medicare spokeswoman told me But about  homes have no sprinklers including  in Illinois  in Texas and  in North Carolina You can see   though it may contain some reporting inaccuracies and may not reflect very recent changes A fire in a nursing home is a horrifying prospect No one can expect every sick frail and disabled resident to escape smoke and flames We have residents who cant get out of bed without two staff members to assist them said Robyn Grant director of public policy and advocacy for the   a nursing home advocacy group She pointed out that many residents also have cognitive limitations and may not understand how to respond to an alarm or to staff directions Besides nursing homes often do not have enough staff for quick evacuations Fires often happen at night when theyre particularly understaffed Ms Grant said Thats what happened in  a particularly grim year In February a resident of the Greenwood Health Center in Hartford Conn set her bedding afire at  am causing a blaze that killed  people Then in September a sixalarm fire  also at night  killed  residents at the NHC Healthcare Center in Nashville These disasters triggered national attention Ms Grant said The fires also led to sprinkler requirements in some states including Connecticut and Tennessee But federal regulations requiring automatic sprinklers did not take effect until five years later and the compliance deadline came five years after that Meanwhile the National Fire Protection Association reported an average of five firerelated deaths a year in nursing homes from  to  though in some cases they actually occurred in group homes or assistedliving facilities It is not surprising that federal agencies move well deliberately It is surprising that more than  facilities still do not have adequate sprinkler systems a decade after two fires that involved multiple fatalities Thats not a negligible proportion of the nations  nursing homes We expect that number to come down in the next couple of months a spokeswoman for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told me when I called to find out what would happen now Were working swiftly to be sure institutions are in compliance The next time these nursing homes undergo federal inspections which take place within a  to month period or when theres a complaint the surveyors will note whether they have the required sprinkler systems If not the facilities will receive a deficiency and must file a plan of correction within  days they then have  days to make those changes Medicare and Medicaid will start denying payment for new admissions if they do not comply  The advocates at that National Consumer Voice wanted faster action immediate fines and signs posted in nursing homes I wonder what they would say Warning This Place is a Fire Trap Ms Grant points out that if a nursing home was inspected just recently it could be more than a year maybe even  months before it could be forced into compliance Only  states have some sort of sprinkler regulation But according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services nearly full compliance will probably come much more quickly Besides shutting down more than a thousand nursing homes and forcing the relocation of their residents is not a great alternative The National Consumer Voices advice for family members Look up If the nursing home your relative or friend lives in does not have sprinklers throughout the building you probably want to push the issue especially since even facilities with nosmoking policies had to grandfather current residents who smoke allowing them to continue in at least some area of the building You can also see fire inspection results on   Look for sprinklers too if youre visiting several facilities before choosing one If theyre not there turn around and walk out the door Ms Grant said
