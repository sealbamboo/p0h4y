Learning a musical instrument as a child gives the brain a boost that lasts long into adult life say scientists Adults who used to play an instrument even if they have not done so in decades have a faster brain response to speech sounds research suggests  The more years of practice during childhood the faster the brain response was the small study found The Journal of Neuroscience work looked at  people in their s s and s  The volunteers in the study listened to a synthesised speech syllable da while researchers measured electrical activity in the region of the brain that processes sound information  the auditory brainstem Despite none of the study participants having played an instrument in nearly  years those who completed between four and  years of music training early in life had a faster response to the speech sound than those who had never been taught music   The study took place at the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory at Northwestern University in Illinois US  As people grow older they often experience changes in the brain that compromise hearing For instance the brains of older adults show a slower response to fastchanging sounds which is important for interpreting speech It could be that learning an instrument in childhood causes a fixed change in the brain that is retained throughout life Or music classes somehow prepare the brain for future auditory learning say the researchers  by the same team found younger adults were better listeners if they had been taught an instrument as a child  Experts also believe musical training  with an emphasis on    can exercise the auditorysystem But these studies are all relatively small and cannot ascertain if it is definitely musical training that is causing the effect  Arguably children offered the opportunity to learn an instrument which can be expensive may come from more privileged backgrounds and this may have an influence   Commenting on the study Michael Kilgard from the University of Texas who was not involved with the research said Being a millisecond faster may not seem like much but the brain is very sensitive to timing and a millisecond compounded over millions of neurons can make a real difference in the lives of older adults
