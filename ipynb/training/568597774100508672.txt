Sure nobody really thinks of worm sperm as being cute and cuddly  assuming one thinks about them at all  but who would have thought they were stone cold killers In a   published Tuesday in PLOS Biology a team of researchers who apparently enjoy watching nematodes get jiggy were shocked to learn that male sperm will conduct searchanddestroy missions on females and hermaphrodites of other worm species Instead of simply fertilizing the partners eggs and being done with the whole exercise the sperm of male   nematodes who mate with other species will not only bully milder sperm and cause sterilization theyll also destroy body tissues like a metastasizing cancer authors say Our findings were quite surprising coauthor Asher Cutter an evolutionary biologist at the University of Toronto said in a statement The study provides new insight into assortative mating  the tendency for animals to reproduce with similar creatures  as well as the evolutionary pressures posed by aggressive sperm Punishing crossspecies mating by sterility or death would be a powerful evolutionary way to maintain a species barrier senior study author Eric Haag an evolutionary biologist at the University of Maryland said in a statement Animals of the same genus but different species may mate and produce offspring but that animal is usually sterile An example is the mule  which occurs when you breed a horse and a donkey The case of the worms however is more drastic Researchers mixed and matched three  species crossbreeding male female and hermaphrodite worms  worms capable of producing both sperm and eggs in order to reproduce The males researchers said mated indiscriminately when given the opportunity The hermaphrodites however would attempt to avoid copulation by crawling away from the breeding area when they sensed a male of another species Study authors learned why this was the case when they examined sterile and dying worms under a microscope Fluorescent stains showed that once the male sperm had entered the hermaphrodite worm they overpowered the hermaphrodites smaller sperm and blocked ovulation After that things just got worse The aggressive sperm invaded the worms ovary and caused its eggs to mature prematurely The sperm then traveled deeper into the worms body causing tissue damage and eventually death Authors wrote that while hermaphrodite worms suffered the most in crossspecies breeding damage was also done to female worms in the form of compromised reproduction and reduced longevity Study authors surmised that the aggressiveness of the males sperm was the result of competition with other male worms of the same species When females worms mated with multiple males their sperm were obliged to jostle for superiority within the females reproductive tract The authors described this development of ever stronger sperm as an evolutionary intraspecies arms race Whether or not these aggressive sperm were also intended to hamper the reproduction of other species is unclear authors said It remains to be tested whether  sterilization by sperm could also be coopted as a weapon in interspecies resource competition when multipleÂ   species inhabit the same resource patch
