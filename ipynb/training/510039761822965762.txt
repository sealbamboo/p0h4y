But tracing works only if you have a list of the contacts and their addresses When Levine arrived at a Ministry of Health office in Sierra Leone she found that the database she needed was pretty much in shambles  Many contacts addresses were missing or were vague like down by the farm road In all only  to  of the contacts in the database had a usable address  That meant the local contact tracers werent able to do their jobs properly  They were really unfamiliar with what contact tracing was she said And they didnt have the resources they needed  According to the United Nations only  of  zones in West Africa have sufficient contact tracing  This inability to do complete contact tracing is a major reason  perhaps the major reason  that the Ebola outbreak continues to spiral out of control according to public health officials and experts  Theres a lot of infection out there Contact tracing breaks down Then you have a real problem Dr Bruce Aylward assistant directorgeneral of the World Health Organization said August    Top WHO officials have said there arent enough contact tracers to get the job done and the organization forecasts an exponential increase in the number of Ebola cases in the coming weeks Donald Thea isnt surprised that the system is breaking down in many areas An infectious disease epidemiologist at the Boston University School of Public Health hes worked in Africa for more than  years  Like Levine he often found that people had no address  or had one that even locals couldnt decipher Residents moved a lot and when they did many times they took their doors and locks with them to save money They wouldnt change the number on the door so the streets ended up with a mishmash of addresses  Add that to the fact that people are   with the tracers sometimes even throwing stones at health care workers They fear that they or their loved ones will be put in the hospital theyve seen firsthand that people who go there often dont return  The community perceives this as a death sentence he said Relinquishing your loved one is tantamount to death  And health care workers have very little to offer people as an incentive to cooperate  With smallpox we could offer people a vaccine a carrot in essence to induce them to be cooperative With Ebola we have nothing Thea said  In Sierra Leone Levine an officer with the Epidemic Intelligence Service at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention remembers the words of her agencys director Dr Tom Frieden Battling Ebola is like fighting a forest fire Miss even just one contact and you could be leaving behind a burning ember that will reignite the outbreak  When Levine arrived in Sierra Leone on August  she brought software on a thumb drive to manage cases and contacts The software was designed by the CDC and was far more effective at organizing thousands of names than the unwieldy Excel spreadsheet that the local health care workers had been using  With the help of other organizations she also got the workers more computers and training in how to do contact tracing Now hundreds of contact tracers are assigned to go out into the neighborhoods in her district every day  She says the death and illness all around her spur her on  Each one of these heartbreaking stories just makes me want to cry she said Its more reason to try harder and think of more creative solutions
