No animal died to make this burger No bleating calf was separated from its mother no manure polluted the waterways no blood was shed on the slaughterhouse floor But vegetarians and vegans arent lining up to get a mouthful just yet On Monday Netherlandsbased researcher Mark Post served his labgrown burger   in front of a carefully invited audience in London He says hes grown the meat entirely in the lab using stem cells from cattle nourished in a broth of chemicals and carefully engineered to grow into strips resembling muscle tissue Supporters say its a crueltyfree food may be more healthful to eat than meat from a real animal and might eventually be made using far fewer resources than it takes to turn grain into muscle fat blood and bones  One of the worlds most vocal animal welfare organizations  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals    is on board with the idea of cultured meat But its leader Ingrid Newkirk says she wont be trying it herself anytime soon And most vegetarians and vegans seem to feel the same way I dont need to Newkirk told NBC News Any flesh food is totally repulsive to me But I am so glad that people who dont have the same repulsion as I do will get meat from a more humane source This gets rid of the yuck factor Post has said he spent  developing the burger made using engineered muscle stem cells grown in a broth made from a calf blood product Thats enough to repel Liz ONeill a spokeswoman for the   It is not an animalfree food yet says ONeill who adds her group wasnt invited to Mondays tasting  Like Newkirk ONeill says it may be good to have the option The Vegetarian Society is keeping an open mind she said Some people are excited by it Some people miss the taste of meat Charles Stahler isnt one of them Stahler a spokesman for the Baltimorebased  VRG says there are too many tasty meat alternatives on the market now from Tofurky to vegetarian chicken nuggets I grew up eating meat said Stahler whos been a vegetarian since  In my family instead of eating cookies we ate salami But he says he doesnt miss eating meat The VRG commissioned a Harris Poll in  that asked people what types of food they would eat It included a question about buying a meat alternative grown from animal cell DNA obtained  years ago which does not currently involve the raising of animals  Just  percent of those polled said theyd buy it and just  percent of vegans said they would Four percent of people identifying as either vegans or vegetarians said theyd buy such a product  Four to five percent of the country is vegetarian or vegan Stahler said citing a VRGcommissioned Harris poll on that question So some people may try it Itll eventually come down to taste and economics he said In  years he might even try it himself he says  While the meat might be acceptable to some vegetarians its not kosher in the true sense Labgrown beef would be considered kosher according to Rabbi Joshua Strulowitz of the West Side Institutional Synagogue in New York but only if it was made using tissue from a ritually slaughtered kosher animal Post used a biopsy from a live cow as living stem cells are needed for the process The animal would need to be slaughtered according to Jewish law before harvesting the cells because meat from a live animal is not kosher says Strulowitz What about wannabe vegetarians who feel guilty about eating meat but just cant give it up Id buy it said Marta Nelson of Morrison Colo Id pay extra money for meat I could eat without feeling guilty about it Newkirk says thats the appeal of the engineered meat  to attract meateaters Her group is offering a   to someone who can make a chicken in a test tube PETA sees it as a way to reduce suffering Americans for example eat a million chickens an hour in this country said Newkirk And then you think if you can grow the chicken flesh from a few cells thats a lot of birds that wont be suffering  People who already eat meat shouldnt be put off by the details of Posts burger she said It is a real burger made of real meat Its as real as real can be The thing that is different about it is that it is not from a filthy slaughterhouse but from a sterile laboratory Most vegetarians say they want to avoid being cruel to animals But they cite protecting the environment as a close second among their reasons in avoiding meat David Pimentel of Cornell Universitys College of Agriculture and Life Sciences says the grain used to feed US livestock could feed  million people if fed directly to them He calculates that raising animals for protein requires more than eight times as much fossil fuel as the equivalent in plant protein Even the US government not only recognizes that a vegetarian diet is healthful it recommends eating a plantbased diet with only a little meat as desired  So if you care about the environment you cannot eat the meat that is in the store argues Newkirk  Nelson a fan of Boca burgers and soybased sausage says shes not sure she needs artificially grown beef Bacon  thats what we need she said Id sell my soul for some good artificial bacon
