The Goreliks live in a region called Gomel Belarus which was heavily hit with radioactive fallout from the worst nuclear accident the world has ever seen  On April   explosions at a reactor at Chernobyl in Ukraine produced radiation effects almost  times greater than the  Fukushima Daiichi disaster in Japan and  times more powerful than the  atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima More than  million people in Belarus were affected by the Chernobyl disaster   Twothirds of the contamination from the accident fell in Belarus diminishing the quality of life in the region  Hope for Chernobyls Child helps  to  children living in Belarus find host families and dental and medical care in Washington state every summer The organization also helps families on the ground in Belarus by delivering humanitarian aid  Medical and dental care are lacking in areas affected by the disaster Hope for Chernobyls Child says Families there often earn little money and have limited job opportunities making it difficult to provide food clothing and medications for their children  Ask Gorelik whether her sons health problems are caused by radiation and she says Yes of course  But the reality is much more complex People who lived in the areas that received significant contamination from Chernobyl in  have been the subject of many scientific studies But researchers havent looked much at health problems in the regions children who werent yet born at the time of the disaster said Scott Davis epidemiologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center at the University of Washington  The lack of hard evidence doesnt mean that lingering radiation isnt causing harm in some ways Davis said but it would be difficult to establish that anyones particular disease or condition stems from lowdose radiation exposure over a long period in that area  This is a major problem in talking with people who either themselves or someone close to them are sick he said To say Well we dont see any risk  people just cant get their head around that The issue is complicated because cancer for example caused by radiation looks exactly like cancer that developed for other reasons experts say Theres no Chernobyl name tag on tumors in people who suffered radiation exposure  Scientists know radioactive iodine got into the human body when people drank milk from cows that ate contaminated grass said Dr Fred Mettler professor emeritus of the Department of Radiology at the University of New Mexico This led to higher incidences of thyroid cancer in people who were children at that time  such as Yulia Gorelik who underwent treatment at age   More than  such cases were diagnosed from  to  but its impossible to say which ones were caused by Chernobyl radiation Mettler said the iodine is unlikely to have caused cancer in anyone born later  especially because iodine has a halflife of eight days so in about two months its almost undetectable  Another radioactive chemical from the reactor explosion Cesium has a halflife of about  years so it stays around a lot longer than iodine and can still be measured in some soils and foods in several areas of Europe Still the dose to which people in the area have been exposed isnt very high Mettler said The doses from cesium contamination are low and insufficient to cause effects had there been any said John Boice professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and president nominee of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements A lot of the issues become Are the health things really due to Chernobyl or are they things which would have occurred anyhow Mettler said  For Jennifer Henning president of Hope for Chernobyls Child theres no question that the ailments the children in the program suffer are the result of radiation exposure  Ive seen the health effects firsthand Henning said I know that its there A physical education teacher in one of the schools that the organization works with told her that children there are getting weaker and weaker Henning said  That there are serious health problems among many youths in Belarus is not in dispute  In  nearly  of adolescents in Belarus had chronic diseases and disabilities   Risk factors according to this report included smoking and using alcohol and drugs  Experts say that what organizations such as Hope for Chenobyls Child are doing to help children with medical problems  providing assistance in Belarus and flying them to the United States for medical respite  is great Several other organizations also operate in regions devastated by the Chernobyl accident such as   the   and   But rather than radiationrelated illness according to the   The most pressing health concerns for the affected areas thus lie in poor diet and lifestyle factors such as alcohol and tobacco use as well as poverty and limited access to health care The cause of Chernobyl evokes greater sympathy from the public than some other causes might Mettler said  Its a very unique scary accident he said Everybody in the world knows about it But if you were to say Ive got children starving in the Sudan people would go huh whatever It wouldnt get their attention Henning points to a   published by the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences rounding up evidence that radiation has had a lasting effect on the health of the population in contaminated areas In Belarus for instance cancer morbidity increased  from  to  the report said and girls age  to  born to irradiated parents had an increase in malignant and benign    Mettler counters this with the  and a   which both had stamps of approval from representatives of the governments of Russia Belarus and the Ukraine The Chernobyl Forum report said that while increases in congenital malformations in children have been reported in Belarus since  the rates are not related to radiation and may be the result of increased registration  ie more people reporting their familys health problems The majority of the contaminated territories are now safe for settlement and economic activity although certain restrictions need to remain in place on the use of land in some areas the report said  More than  million people in Belarus Russia and Ukraine living in contaminated areas received wholebody radiation from the accident but in doses not much higher than the natural radiation in the environment the report said  Does that mean that a healthy person could safely move to an area that has been cordoned off for decades and not have an increased risk of cancer Davis isnt so sure  but said he believes it hasnt been studied extensively enough Common sense would dictate that its probably not a great idea to live in a highly contaminated area and eat produce produced in the fields that are contaminated or be in constant exposure mode Davis said  Both international reports highlighted the mental health toll as well the Chernobyl Forum report called this the greatest public health problem that the accident caused More than  people were relocated from the hardesthit areas which was a deeply traumatic experience for many There is no question that people who either are exposed to radiation or think they might have been suddenly are very nervous and every time something happens they go Oh my God what is this Do I have a problem And they dash off to the hospital Mettler said  Studies have shown that this population has a higher level of anxiety and are more likely to report that they have physical symptoms that they cannot explain according to the Chernobyl Forum report Theyre also more likely to say they are in poor health The report noted that as the media began to speak of Chernobyl victims and governments offered disasterrelated benefits rather than perceiving themselves as survivors many of those people have come to think of themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future Gorelik was not evacuated after Chernobyl She grew up in the region of Gomel the same area where she and Daniel live today About a minute drive away is the Dead Zone where entire villages have been abandoned since  Gorelik and Daniel stayed with Hennings family in the Seattle area during part of the summer They returned to Belarus at the beginning of August Henning said During their time in the Pacific Northwest they saw the ocean mountains and a rainforest in addition to various doctors Daniel put on  pounds during the sixweek stay  Yulia and Daniel saw various doctors and it was determined that many of their health issues could be attributed to the poor nutrition that is so common in this area of Belarus Henning said in an email  Among the nine children and two adults including Gorelik who spent this summer in the United States through Hope for Chernobyls Child a total of  cavities were filled four wisdom teeth were pulled and  blood tests were taken Henning said The Belarusians gained a combined total of  pounds  Gorelik said in July that   has given her not only material help but also mental support The gratitude she feels toward the organization and her hosts is immeasurable she says Reflecting on her situation her words about lack of control are reminiscent of the Chernobyl Forum Report If you are living in bad conditions sometimes you feel like you are alone You dont have control of your life You dont have any support You dont have any hope maybe There is only one hope to God But if you meet some people who can give you their hands and their help it is making you stronger it is making you happy really happy Thats why Im grateful with all my soul  Gorelik and Daniel left for their long journey back to Belarus on August  including a hour layover in Frankfurt Henning and colleagues arranged for them and the others in the Hope for Chernobyls Child group to rest in a lounge at the airport  Such crosscultural friendship has become part of the fallout of Chernobyl
