On September  the   the nonprofit that manages the nations transplant system will hold a public hearing to discuss ways to   in how organs are assigned to patients across the country Each organ has a different system for handling its waiting list and the network has seen a particular problem with donated livers Currently a donated liver is supposed to go first to the person who is most likely to die without a transplant but the system also takes geographic factors into consideration That means the sickest person in the country doesnt always get dibs  Instead the system uses a local regional and national algorithm There are wide disparities in the number of organs available in the countrys  regions In the South and Midwest donations are high Donations on the coasts are low  So if you live in California an area that has one of the lowest liver donation rates you would probably wait longer to qualify for a transplant than someone who lives in Tennessee in a region where the donation rates are much higher Thats why Apple cofounder Steve Jobs   to get his liver transplant even though he lived thousands of miles away in California These are disparities the organ network considers   PDF The biggest problem is a serious shortage of donated livers Although about  liver transplant operations happen each year thats only a fraction of those who need them There are   on the waiting list right now   An average of  people die each year while waiting for a liver transplant across all regions whether there is a generous donor community or not And the number of people needing liver transplants is expected to rise With the nations obesity epidemic fatty liver disease has become a growing problem with more     We lose someone every week who never got a shot at a lifesaving liver transplant because of where they live said   chief of transplantation and immunology at Yale and chairman of the   considering the change That same person would have had a shot if they lived in Kansas or Georgia or Louisiana  To address this disparity Mulligan says his committee is open to ideas Right now it is considering a variety of mathematical models  One would reduce the  US transplant regions to four or eight Centers on the West and East coasts could see a  to  increase in volume with this shift according to some estimates  These models worry doctors who live in the regions where the supply of donated organs is better Doctors in Kansas benefit from a   and dont want their region to be an organ farm for the parts of the country where not as many donate Kumer says What they are attempting to do is say Hey those guys have all the organs Lets go over and poach those instead of having their own grassroots campaign to identify new donors Kumer said    director of transplantation at The University of Kansas Hospital thinks the organ networks committee is looking at the problem the wrong way  Instead of shifting regions he believes it should focus on signing up more organ donors Thats where we should devote all our energy rather than just shuffle the organs around the country Schmitt said I think everyone in UNOS and in the transplant community wants to save more lives that is a nobrainer But we feel that geographic disparity is more a reflection of other broader problems This week Schmitt and doctors at dozens of transplant centers in the Midwest and the South sent a letter of protest to the organ network urging the committee not to make any changes until all available data are considered  If the network implements the concept proposal and broadens the geographic boundaries for sharing  donor livers it would represent the most drastic change in liver allocation ever the authors wrote and would significantly disadvantage many areas of the country currently able to serve their patient populations A congressional delegation from Georgia also sent a letter in April asking the network to put a hold on the remapping process  argues that the changes could reduce the number of liver transplants performed in Georgia by  and inevitably drive up costs decrease survival rates and waste precious resources in an already constrained sector of healthcare Transporting organs longer distances could cost health care centers  million more annually according to some estimates Mulligan argues that cost would be offset when doctors have to take care of fewer people with endstage liver failure   Mulligan says his committee will make sure it does not hurt the regions that have been successful with organ donation He believes that ultimately a new system will save hundreds of lives every year  We are totally aware that there are certain parts of the country that will see big shifts and that will be scary to them but we have to take off our hats that represent our individual centers and think about what is best for patients all across the country Mulligan said   Both sides of the debate agree though that no matter how the system will change it is only a temporary fix akin to rearranging the deck chairs on a sinking ship Mulligan said We are going to continue to have this problem if people dont donate To become an organ donor register at
