If you think the fight against Ebola is going well heres a grim new number  Thats how many new infections were   in Sierra Leone in the past week Its the highest weekly tally in any country since the West African outbreak began International governments and aid groups have scrambled to open Ebola treatment centers in the country But because of safety concerns many of these centers are accepting only a fraction of the number of patients they were built to serve In the meantime most sick people are being directed to makeshift governmentrun centers Some of these are simply schools or other government buildings repurposed into a community care center  a place for people with   symptoms to be isolated Bai Marrow Lamina Ngbathor who heads up a chiefdom of several hundred villages in Sierra Leones rural north is helping transform a school into one of these care centers The facility is a lot more basic than the fullfledged treatment clinic that is supposed to serve this Districtbut which is only treating about ten patients while it scales up That place was built with funding from foreign governments including the US and has a sophisticated inground plumbing and sanitation system Here at the school workers are digging a big hole in the ground Those are the toilets for the suspected cases to use Lamina Ngbathor says The treatment offered at the school center will also be a lot more limited  medication to bring down a fever and rehydration salts that patients can drink with little help or supervision In contrast at some   patients are getting intravenous drips for fluid replacements and direct attention from staff Still though Lamina Ngbathor and his team have stood up this community care center in a matter of days He walks into a room where there are  metal cots This place was a classroom Lamina Ngbathor says A chalkboard on the wall still has a lesson written on it My name is Hawa Im a girl Im  years old Lamina Ngbathor reads off the board These community care centers  and larger holding centers  were originally conceived of as temporary triage outposts Health officials intended them to be places where people who might have Ebola could be isolated while they waited for an Ebola test result If the test came back positive then a person would be sent onto a proper treatment facility But right now theres no better place to go So sick people are getting stuck at these triage centers many will likely dire here Effectively the main function of this place seems less to help sick people than to prevent them from infecting others If we allow those sick to be in the community Ebola will spread says Lamina Ngbathor And all of us will die But a few miles down the road at a similar but larger holding center I Dr Corrado Cancedda with the aid group   is trying to change this approach He says this idea that so many Sierra Leoneans have to die while the international response scales up is unacceptable Cancedda asks Why should people here get a lower standard of care than Americans or Europeans Everybody deserves the same level of care That should always be our goal and our guiding principle So Cancedda has begun turning this existing holding center into a fullfledged treatment facility with IVs Hes also bringing in medical workers from overseas and trainers in a matter of days not weeks And Cancedda totally rejects the idea that Ebola has to be such a deadly disease Ebola kills so many people here in Sierra Leone because theres not the resources to take care of patients properly he says As soon as possible he wants to start using lab tests to monitor organ function and tweak electrolyte levels  the things that American and European hospitals have been doing to support their Ebola patients Lets bring the tools and then the mortality rate will go down Cancedda says Theres no reason why it couldnt be  percent or  percent if you diagnose patients early enough before theyre sick The key to getting there Cancedda says is to maintain a sense of moral outrage  the conviction that as long as people are dying what youre doing is never enough
