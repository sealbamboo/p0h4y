We know that eating highlyprocessed carbheavy foods is not great for us But we tend to gobble up the food and move on with our lives telling ourselves well eat healthier at the next meal But evidence is building that at least for some of us our brains dont quite work that way  A small study published this week shows that hours after we eat a highlyprocessed meal with lots of carbohydrates  think white bread or potato chips  we start to crave  of these junk foods  Highly processed carbohydrates might program us to crave food in general says David Ludwig lead author of the paper published this week in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition And fastacting carbohydrates in particular might be setting up these cycles of high blood sugar followed by low blood sugar food cravings  and then overeating Researchers gave  obese young men two test meals  milkshakes that were not only identical in calories and carbohydrates but also contained indistinguishable sweetness appearance smell and overall deliciousness The only difference was the nature of the carbohydrates  one shake contained highglycemic index carbs and the other had carbs of lowglycemic index Foods with a high glycemic index or GI raise blood sugar or blood glucose levels higher and faster than foods with lower GIs  But as far as the young men who participated in the study knew  the shakes were the same The two shakes were given to the young men in a lab environment on two different days and researchers tracked their blood sugar and hunger levels periodically for four hours after the meal At the fourhour mark the men were given brain scans using functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI  basically a way of measuring brain activity They found that the areas of the brain related to reward craving and addictive behavior lit up for the men in the high GI group as their brains reacted to the fastacting carbsThats important Ludwig explains because four hours after a meal is the key time when decisions are made about how much to eat at the next meal Weve seen the connection between junk food and cravings before as past studies have shown a link But previous research used foods like cheesecake versus virtuous fare like boiled vegetables  in other words foods you know and would have a strong psychological reaction to This new research is an attempt to divide the biology from learned behavior Ludwig explains  Madelyn Fernstrom NBC News diet and health editor advises that this study comes with a few limitations For one its a very small study looking at the brain scans of just  obese men  plus the fact that all the subjects were obese something that Ludwig says was done because the overweight among us are in general the ones having the most trouble maintaining a healthy weight Still at this point its too early to say that these cravings lead to obesity says Fernstrom who adds that an important followup study would be to do the same experiment using lean people  In real life we dont exactly have the option of choosing between a healthy and less healthy milkshake  unless youre planning on switching to   Elisa Zied a registered dietitian in New York City advises dieters to think about all the delicious and nutritious foods you can eat  rather than trying to immediately eliminate all processed foods at once Of course limiting processed foodsespecially the kinds that are loaded with trans or saturated fat sugar and sodiumis a good idea says Zied But taking a positive inclusionary approach to food and eating may very well be a more effective way to alter your diet than being more extreme So if junk food lit up the areas of the brain involved with addiction  then is junk food addictive  Its not that simple The idea of a food addict is a bit ridiculous in the first place says Fernstrom Ph D CNS We  to eat to survive we dont  to consume alcohol or smoke cigarettes for example so these terms are not interchangeable The notion of food addiction is controversial and the study doesnt answer that question Ludwig says But it provides I think evidence for the possibility that highly processed food  apart from its calories apart from its tastiness  could be tricking our brain into craving more food than we actually need So the bottom line is Limiting these fastacting carbs that have invaded our diet in the last  years may help overweight people avoid overeating Ludwig says
