When it comes to choosing between sodas and juices in the beverage aisle the juice industry has long benefited from a health halo We know that juice comes from fruit while soda is artificial In particular the sugars in juice seem more natural than high fructose corn syrup  the main sweetener in so many sodas After all weve gotten rid of most of the soda we used to offer kids at school but we still serve them lots of juice But a   published online in June in the journal   shows that on average fruit juice has a fructose concentration of about  grams per liter only a bit less than the average of  grams per liter for sodas The sneakiest  and sweetest  juice is Minute Maid  percent apple with nearly  grams of fructose per liter Thats more than the  grams per liter in CocaCola and the  grams per liter in Dr Pepper  the director of the Childhood Obesity Research Center at the University of Southern California led the study He says he decided to measure the fructose specifically in juices and sodas because of a growing body of evidence suggesting fructose is a riskier substance than glucose The human body isnt designed to process this form of sugar at such high levels Goran said in a   Unlike glucose which serves as fuel for the body fructose is processed almost entirely in the liver where it is converted to fat which increases risk for diabetes cardiovascular disease and liver disease Gorans assertion is not universally accepted Other health researchers like Fred Brouns at Maastricht University in the Netherlands say sugar is basically sugar He has   that we should spend less time fixating on fructose and its role in the emerging chronic disease epidemics and more time looking at sugar and overconsumption overall Goran says that while high fructose corn syrup in soda and food has become a focal point for researchers and public health advocates in recent years theres been less attention on the link between fruit juice and obesity and diabetes But its hard to imagine why any theres reason why juices wouldnt be as harmful as sodas if theyre delivering the same amount of sugar he tells us One of the biggest problems Goran notes is that nutrition labels only tell us the total grams of sugar  so its hard to know how much fructose is in any product The term sugars on the label   sucrose which is a combination of glucose and fructose lactose and other variations But Goran adds if were getting fructose from whole fruit thats a different story The fructose in whole fruit comes with fiber which slows down and reduces the absorption of the sugar in the body serving as a sort of antidote to the negative effects of fructose metabolism  a leading obesity researcher and professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill agrees that fruit juice consumption is associated with health risks because of the high sugar content Yes from our longterm huge studies in Singapore Australia the US and Europe I think  percent fruit juice is as bad as sugarsweetened beverages for its effects on our health he tells us And Popkin adds every longterm study on the effects of  percent fruit juice intake on diabetes risk shows a very significant risk too Popkin notes that only about nine countries have banned fruit juices from schools However all countries now say a maximum  ounces of fruit juice whereas  years ago we said unlimited he adds So whats a juice lover to do with so many supersweet products on the market As   some beverage makers are now starting to cut the sugar Goran recommends diluting juice you buy at the store with  percent water From a public health perspective were going to need to change the cultural norms about how sweet things like juice really need to be he says
