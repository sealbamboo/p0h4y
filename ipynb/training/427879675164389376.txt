Oh just put a pillow underneath your hips during sex then youll definitely get pregnant a good friend told me That did the trick for us  twice Now the friend is a smart woman She has a PhD in biology for Petes sake So she must know what shes talking about when it comes to conception right No not at all Theres no evidence to support that says   an obstetrician and gynecologist at the Yale University School of Medicine Maybe the idea seems logical and some older clinicians still tell patients that but studies have found no difference Turns out my friend and I are not alone A surprisingly high number of women ages  to  are a bit clueless about the insandouts of babymaking Illuzzi and her colleagues   Monday in the journal   More than a third of women surveyed think that elevating the pelvis during sex or using specific positions boost the chances of conception And just  percent of women know the optimal time to try each month to get pregnant A remarkably low number of women are aware that you have to have intercourse before ovulation to get pregnant Illuzzi tells Shots About  percent including myself thought the best time was after ovulation The peak window of fertility is the two days   you ovulate Illuzzi says Its probably good to have sex on both days Some doctors tell couples to have sex every other day but then they might miss their fertile window And sorry guys Having sex more than once a day wont boost your chances of putting a bun in the oven In fact that frequency may hurt you in the long run Illuzzi says If he ejaculates too often his sperm count goes down After talking with patients for years at the Yale clinic Illuzzi started worrying that women around the US were less informed about conception and pregnancy than she and her fellow doctors thought So last March her team gave  women an online survey to assess their knowledge about reproductive health The survey included women across various races ethnic groups and socioeconomic levels around the country We didnt find very big differences in knowledge across socioeconomic groups Illuzzi says More educated women were only slightly more informed the survey found In general all women had big gaps in knowledge Illuzzi says especially in terms of risk factors for infertility and birth defects More than half the women surveyed didnt know that folic acid supplements need to be taken at least a month   conception to prevent neural tube defects And although most women realize that getting pregnant becomes harder and harder as you get older many didnt realize that aging raises the risk of miscarriages and chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome About a quarter of women didnt know that obesity   and irregular periods can all decrease fertility  and that the same goes for a sexually transmitted disease If youve had   or   in the past  and youre having problems getting pregnant  its definitely important to see a doctor Illuzzi says Your tubes may be blocked by the infection The No  thing women identify as their risk factor for infertility is stress she says But the literature doesnt really support that as a risk factor Its good to destress your life she adds But in the end stress probably isnt whats keeping you from getting pregnant So where can women go to figure out what the problem is when infertility strikes Talk to your doctor Illuzzi says And for more information check out medical websites run by universities and physicians organizations such as the
