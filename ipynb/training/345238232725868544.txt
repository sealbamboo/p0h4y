An obviously unhappy Judge Edward Korman has approved the Obama administrations proposal to make just one formulation of the morningafter birth control pill available over the counter without age restrictions But in a testily worded   the federal district judge made it clear he is not particularly pleased with the outcome He has been overseeing the case in one way or another for more than eight years The deal Korman wrote in his Wednesday night memorandum makes it likely that the version called   will for now be the only product available on retail shelves Thats even though it is the most expensive at a cost of between  and  The deal proposed by the administration he wrote confers a nearmonopoly that will only result in making a onepill emergency contraceptive more expensive and less accessible to many poor women Late Monday the administration said it would drop its appeal of   that would have made all products using the hormone levonorgestrel available within  days without age or prescription restrictions Up to that point the products mostly sold under the Plan B label were available to those age  and over without a prescription but were kept behind the pharmacy shelf Younger teens still needed a prescription And those old enough not to need a prescription could obtain the products only when a pharmacy was open They also had to request them and show proof of age On April  just days before the judges deadline the FDA proposed   It approved a new label for Plan B OneStep that would make it available on pharmacy shelves rather than behind the counter But it would still require a prescription for those younger than  And the agency   ruling But when the Justice Department asked Korman for a stay of his ruling while it appealed he said   but excoriated the government for behavior he called something out of an alternate reality It was a surprise last week when a panel of the federal nd Circuit Court of Appeals   of Kormans ruling at least in part The appeals court would have required that generic twopill versions of the emergency contraceptive pills be made immediately available That signaled that the government was not likely to succeed in its appeal and led to Mondays proposal But the idea that only Plan B OneStep and not any of its generic equivalents would be immediately available made the plaintiffs in the lawsuit very unhappy Exclusive overthecounter access to a single pharmaceutical company will allow for exorbitant monopoly prices placing emergency contraception financially out of reach of millions of women and girls said Mara VerheydenHilliard executive director of the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund which brought the original lawsuit Imposing unjust financial barriers to access sacrifices the rights of millions of poor and young women solely to benefit a pharmaceutical company In his memo Korman urged the FDA not to grant additional exclusivity to   the patent owner of Plan B OneStep even though the company conducted a study that under drug law should make it eligible for protection from generic competition Whatever expense Teva incurred it did not mount a legal challenge to the   of its original request to allow the drug to be sold without age restrictions in  Korman wrote Instead it entered into an agreement with the FDA which allowed it to market Plan B OneStep to women  and over thus leaving in place burdensome pointofsale and photo identification requirements Korman also made it clear that if the FDA does not act without delay to approve Plan B OneStep without age restrictions as it promised the plaintiffs will have a remedy available Presumably meaning they could go back to court
