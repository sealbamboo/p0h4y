If youre gay or lesbian or bisexual or transgender odds are that youve had a doctor flinch or flounder through an appointment The next generation of physicians needs to do better the Association of American Medical Colleges announced Tuesday The organization published a page  intended to change medical school curricula so that future doctors are competent in helping patients who are LGBT gender nonconforming or born with sex differences in development Hows that going to work We asked   an assistant professor of child psychiatry at Northwestern Universitys Feinberg School of Medicine Leibowitz studies gender identity in children and teenagers and was part of the committee who wrote the manifesto This is an edited version of our conversation There are surveys that clearly show that doctors arent comfortable around this issue And the many health disparities that continue to exist for these patients are clearcut and well documented Many people dont trust their health care providers I think theres good reason behind that We all have blind spots even wellmeaning providers do But we want everyone to feel welcome and to feel that their unique needs are being met Some medical schools are already doing a good job usually there are a lot of studentled initiatives and also faculty champions But even in the best of medical schools a significant barrier is faculty not all the teachers are up to speed on this Weve moved away from trying to add extra content Its not adding a lecture on gay or lesbian people its not adding a lecture on transsexual people because that continues to reinforce the idea that they are other Instead we translated the issues into the language of what we call competencybased medical education in preexisting courses Were not saying add an endocrinology course on what it means to be transgender Were saying when youre already teaching on the hormonal axis say For transgender people this is how it would be We give them very useful examples heres where you could potentially insert this in your preclinical years heres how you could potentially insert this in your clinical years I cant say more strongly how revolutionary this document is Weve set the bar really high by defining  competencies that all medical students need to have But theres a lot of work that needs to take place Being able to develop rapport with all individuals is one of the competencies that we address regardless of gender identity gender orientation or body type Nonverbal facial reactions can sometimes make a patient feel judged or feel like theyre not going to be able to disclose what theyre truly ashamed about And that may mean theyre not going to get care that they need Even if its something positive like positive healthy sexual development for someone who engages in maletomale sex Doctors need to be able to promote positive images of sexual health to individuals who may be having a different type of sexual behavior than they are Everyones entitled to positive sexual health
