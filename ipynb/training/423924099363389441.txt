The US Department of Agriculture has crunched some numbers and its conclusion is that Americans are munching less And on more healthful stuff On average workingage adults were eating about  fewer calories per day in  compared with five years earlier according to a   released Thursday So what are we eating less of Saturated fat Researchers documented a  percent decline in calories from saturated fat between  and  And fiber consumption is up Fiber from foods fruits vegetables and whole grains was up by  percent compared with  We have made significant progress but our work is not done Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack wrote in a release about the report The new report is based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey which collects details on eating habits and other healthrelated information from a nationally representative sample of about  people in the US So what explains the drop The recession of  seems to have played a role Americans cut back significantly  percent on the amount of money they were spending on food at restaurants and fastfood joints On average Americans were eating three fewer meals out during that time Researchers conclude that  percent of the improvements in the quality of diet are explained by this drop in eating out And with people eating at home more they tended to eat more frequent family meals which tend to be more healthful and lower in calories Whats more peoples attitudes and attention to food also seem to be changing The report finds that more than  percent of older adults reported using the Nutrition Facts Panel when making food choices Also whether its shows like The   the   or workbased wellness programs nudging us to exercise more and eat less more Americans seem to be getting the message So cutting  calories may seem trivial But experts say if the trend holds its more significant than you might realize As   eating  fewer calories a day can result in weight loss of almost  pounds over the course of a year Heres how the math works There are  calories are in a pound of fat So if you take out  calories x  days   calories This gets you just past that pound mark Two caveats Metabolisms vary from person to person so this is a rough estimate And as weve previously reported theres growing evidence that   and   those calories could also make a difference Still this simple calculation is a reminder that incremental changes can help chip away at the obesity epidemic And as we   this past summer top leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say we may have started to turn the tide For the first time obesity among young children is on the decline in  states and US territories Of course as we reported yesterday in terms of making healthful food affordable and accessible the US still has
