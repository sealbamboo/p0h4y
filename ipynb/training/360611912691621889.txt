Come summertime some of us here at Shots are reminded as we lounge on decks and venture into overgrown gardens that we are irresistible to mosquitoes As we gripe about our itchy pocked limbs we cant help but wonder just why they unfailingly devour us and pass over our friends and loved ones And when it comes to repellent its hard to tell just what works best So we called up   chief of the branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that tracks insectborne viruses to get some answers to our summertime mosquito quandaries Q So why is it that backyard mosquitoes swarm and feast on some people while others seem to be less palatable to them Is there any truth to the claim that some blood is sweeter A Well first off lets remember that here in the US we have  species of mosquitoes and a relatively small number of them feed on people But theyll feed on anything that has blood The mosquitoes that feed on people are attracted to over  gases and other compounds emitted by human skin And whats attractive for one mosquito species might not be attractive to another The most wellknown compound is carbon dioxide They can detect that fairly far away from about  to  feet They will fly towards carbon dioxide and so in a lot of cases in the backyard thats you and me Other compounds various mosquitoes like are lactic acid and water So it can be the composition of the sweat you exude that makes you more attractive but the research doesnt show that hygiene really has anything to do with it We also know that pregnant women are a little more attractive as are people drinking alcohol But its really a very complex set of cues that mosquitoes use so its hard to make gross generalizations Q Sounds like that would make coming up with repellents very complicated A Yes it does Q Has mosquito repellent been getting stronger over time A No we have had    that stuff thats  to  percent DEET  for a long time Q So what trends are you seeing around repellents A Were seeing a real proliferation of new registered products that have different chemicals and are giving consumers more choices Weve also seen significant advances in formulation chemistry  meaning how the active ingredients are packaged with other compounds One innovation is time release so low concentrations of DEET or other active ingredients that can provide longlasting protection For example the Department of Defense now sends soldiers out into the field with timerelease DEET and uniforms treated with   There are actually a lot of treated clothing products available these days  the permethrin lasts even after several washings Q Do you have any concerns about the repellents we use today A There are two concerns I have about repellents One is that there are products coming onto the marketplace that have not been demonstrated as effective The products we recommend on   are DEET picaridin IR and some oil of lemon eucalyptus and paramenthanediol products There is a body of scientific literature showing these products to be effective And theyre   The other trend that concerns me is people dont use repellents  theyre underutilized especially in   Even when these outbreaks are publicized we have not been successful at getting more people to use repellents effectively Q Is there any evidence of mosquitoes becoming resistant to DEET or other products A No were not seeing any evidence that mosquitoes are ignoring the repellents The reason is that humans dont provide the primary blood source for mosquitoes  they mostly feed on animals like birds So were not selecting for the behavior that would lead to resistance DEET is still the gold standard Q Does it matter whether your repellent is  percent or  percent DEET A The amount of DEET can affect how long it lasts But the research suggests that once you get about  percent DEET its not going to make a lot of difference The variable is how much you are putting on your skin Q So how do you protect yourself from mosquitoes Or given that youre an expert on mosquitoborne diseases do you just prefer to stay inside A When Im going camping and hiking in the Colorado mountains  and we actually can have a lot of mosquitoes up there  I am using a topical repellent for my skin and wearing treated clothing With those two you get optimum protection
