Kidney disease doesnt get the attention funding or concern associated with cancers of the breast or prostate But it actually kills more Americans   a year  than both malignancies combined Even when it is not fatal the cost of treating endstage kidney disease through dialysis or a kidney transplant is astronomical more than fivefold what Medicare pays annually for the average patient over age  The charges do not include the inestimable costs to quality of life among patients with advanced kidney disease Much is known about who faces the greatest   and how it can be prevented detected in its early stages and treated to slow or halt its progression But unless people at risk are tested they are unlikely to know they have kidney disease it produces no symptoms until it is quite advanced Perhaps no one knows this better than Duane Sunwold  a culinary arts instructor at Spokane Community College in Spokane Wash whose compromised kidney function was not uncovered until a blood pressure crisis landed him in the hospital A physician assistant found that abnormal amounts of protein were spilling out in his urine Mr Sunwold then only  was referred to a nephrologist who diagnosed a condition called minimalchange disease damage to the tiny blood vessels within the kidney that filter wastes from the blood to make urine Protein is not supposed to be among those wastes Although Mr Sunwolds personal physician was treating him for high blood pressure a leading cause of kidney failure the doctor never checked to see how well his vital organs were functioning Such a lapse is hardly uncommon Kidney disease often is not on the medical radar and in as many as threefourths of patients with risk factors for poor kidney function physicians fail to use a simple inexpensive test to check for urinary protein This fact has turned Mr Sunwold into   with a potentially lifesaving message for  million Americans who have kidney disease many of whom dont yet know it and an additional   million at high risk of developing it Make sure your doctor checks the amount of protein in your urine at least once a year After his diagnosis Mr Sunwold brought all his risk factors under control and succeeded in improving his kidney function He   and recipes for good kidney health which are also good for the heart diabetes and weight control A study published in April online in The American Journal of Kidney Disease demonstrated how common lifestyle factors can harm the kidneys Researchers led by Dr Alex Chang of Johns Hopkins University followed more than  young adults for  years Participants were   were obese or had diets high in red and processed meats sugarsweetened drinks and sodium but low in fruit legumes nuts whole grains and lowfat dairy Only  percent of participants with no lifestylerelated risk factors developed protein in their urine an early indicator of kidney damage while  percent of those with three unhealthy factors developed the condition known medically as   Obesity alone doubled a persons risk of developing kidney disease an unhealthy diet raised the risk even when weight and other lifestyle factors were taken into account Overall the risk was highest among AfricanAmericans those with diabetes high blood pressure or a family history of kidney disease and those who consumed more soft drinks red meat and fast food In commenting on the study  Dr Beth Piraino president of the National Kidney Foundation said We need to shift the focus from managing chronic kidney disease to preventing it in the first place  Which is exactly the approach Mr Sunwold has adopted I had been feeling like I had the flu  bonetired exhausted all the time he said Im now a wannabe vegan Meat makes up less than  percent of my diet In just two weeks after changing my diet to one that is plantbased I really felt much better He also swims laps every day and maintains his foot frame at  pounds His kidney function which is now normal is checked every three months and he religiously takes medication to control his blood pressure Dr Leslie Spry director of the Dialysis Center of Lincoln in Nebraska and   for a kidneyhealthy lifestyle noted that people with high blood pressure Type  diabetes or obesity who manage to avoid a heart attack or stroke remain at risk for kidney disease which he likened to the third rail Having just one risk factor raises the chances of developing kidney disease from one in  to one in three Dr Spry said A family history of kidney disease is not the only genetic risk In addition to AfricanAmericans Hispanic Americans AsianAmericans and American Indians are more likely than white Americans to develop kidney disease People cant change their genetics Dr Spry said in an interview But I wouldnt have to work so hard if they didnt smoke reduced their salt intake ate more fresh fruits and vegetables and increased their physical activity These are things people can do for themselves They involve no medication He also urges everyone with any risk factor for kidney disease to be screened annually with inexpensive urine and blood tests That includes everyone  and older for whom the cost is covered by Medicare Free testing is also provided by the   for people with diabetes The urine test can pick up abnormal levels of protein which is supposed to stay in the body compared with the amount of creatinine a waste product that should be excreted The blood test called an   for estimated glomerular filtration rate measures how much blood the kidneys filter each minute indicating how effectively they are functioning Anyone found to have kidney disease should be referred to a nephrologist a specialist who can work with the family physician to control the disease Two medications commonly used to treat high blood pressure can often halt or delay the progression of kidney disease in people with diabetes angiotensinconverting enzyme ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs Careful control of blood sugar levels also protects the kidneys from further damage
