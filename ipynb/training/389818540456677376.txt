Arunachalam Muruganantham had his light bulb moment when he was  years old and holding a sanitary napkin for the first time Examining the cotton pads he was buying as a gift for his new wife the Indian entrepreneur realized that the multinational company that produced them was probably spending cents on raw materials and making a huge profit Women in Murugananthams village in Tamil Nadu including his wife would often forgo these expensive pads for rags they used repeatedly through their cycles Even more uncomfortably sometimes they utilized husks or leaves during menstruation The exorbitant cost of the foreignmade pads cut into their families meal budget Given a choice between fresh pads and fresh milk they chose the latter A new movie   documents how at great personal cost Muruganantham created a   to address   for rural women on the subcontinent But as director Amit Virmani points out the products traction may have more to do with   than with health concerns Women whose   buy Murugananthams machine can make more than a dollar a day  close to a    selling the pads Sanitary napkins from global companies are in Indian stores for about  for an eightpack The ones from Muruganthams machine wholesale at about  cents for an eightpack the womens groups can sell them at whatever retail price they choose retaining the profit The cost of the machines ranges from about  to  depending on the features The primary impulse when people are struggling to make a living is either How can I make more money or How can I save more money  Virmani said If you address those needs your innovation stands a better chance to be adopted to spread  The machine which Muruganantham began to research in  has three stages of production Inside a stainless steel container a motor fluffs cellulose to prepare it as the core material for the napkins Hand and legoperated tools are used to form the core of the napkin A heat press is used to seal and apply the outer cover to the napkin Its sterilized and packaged and then ready to sell Murugananthams invention was already spreading across India when Virmani found him last year with  machines sold and an innovation award from Indias president under the entrepreneurs belt But getting there had been all uphill  Once Muruganantham had prototyped the machine he needed testers But his wife and other family members refused as did girls at the nearby medical college So Muru as Virmani calls him decided to become a tester himself He filled bottles with animal blood and attached tubes that would press the blood into his drawers as he biked and walked around town His rural village shunned him viewing this with suspicion And his wifes suspicions  that he was chasing medical college girls around town for something other than product testing  ended his marriage Still for six years Muruganantham pressed on yup pressed  and now more than  of his machines have been sold in India Theres also been global interest in replicating the model from Afghanistan to Rwanda  Virmani said he attributes Murugananthams success to the inventors understanding of his core audience starting with the rudimentary nature of the machine Its wooden and its got pedals where he could have had motors Virmani said He knows how to motorize the damn things but the more complicated you make the machines at some point theyll break down Virmani said The way hes engineered it its pretty much something that the rural women can repair themselves and they dont have to keep paying for servicing   he wants to see India become a  percent sanitary napkin country in his lifetime As for   its   and will be available on iTunes in January
