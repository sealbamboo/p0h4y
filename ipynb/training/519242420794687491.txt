Bipartisan legislation that increasingly rare phenomenon will soon bring greater federal oversight to hospice programs across the country The Impact Act signed into law today by President Obama is chiefly concerned with how nursing homes rehab centers and home health agencies   But tucked into the legislation are provisions increasing the frequency of hospice inspections and allowing Medicare to review programs in which a large proportion of patients receive care for six months or more considered a long hospice stay Thats good news said J Donald Schumacher president of the   A lot of things can go wrong when no ones looking he told me Like nursing homes and home health agencies which also rely heavily on Medicare and Medicaid hospices undergo periodic state surveys in order to be recertified for reimbursement But until now no federal law specified how often those surveys must take place Medicare aimed to conduct surveys every six years but after budget cuts extended that to every eight years   compared with every three years for home health agencies and every  months for nursing homes A lot of hospices dont draw even that limited scrutiny Investigations by the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general found that in  about  percent of hospice organizations   By  that proportion had climbed to  percent Depending on the state you can get a hospice license in this country and not get surveyed for seven to  years Mr Schumacher said In Oklahoma Idaho and California for example most hospices werent surveyed within six years For years national hospice organizations have asked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid for more frequent inspections The response has always been There are no fundsâ€Š Mr Schumacher said The Impact Act   and supplies  million over  years to make that happen It also calls for reviews of hospice programs with a high proportion of longstay patients those receiving care for  days or more Medicare hasnt yet set the threshold that would trigger a review but administrators are talking about a  percent to  percent range said Angie Truesdale the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organizations vice president for public policy The median length of stay for hospice patients in recent years has been fewer than  days  probably much too short in many cases  so a hospice that provides six months care for half its patients is a true outlier In  only  percent of patients were in hospice for  days or longer They want to ascertain whats going on Ms Truesdale said of Medicare officials Is there a geographic or cultural difference Is it a diagnosis Or is it a business strategy Business strategies have always played a part in hospice policies officials have to pay salaries and buy supplies after all and Medicare reimbursements have been shrinking But they may have become more central as the industry expands and changes The number of hospices has grown rapidly in recent years from  organizations caring for about  patients in  to  caring for  million in  In the process what we could once refer to without irony as the hospice movement has morphed from a largely nonprofit local effort with many volunteers into an industry Forprofit hospices now dominate the field and many are attached to national chains Perhaps growth required that transformation but forprofit ownership is also linked to    patients being discharged before they die  and to rising criticism If reviews of hospices who carry dying people on their rolls for months leads to patients getting   this change wont bring happy consequences for them or their families But national hospice leaders think the reviews will make hospices more accountable I think it will benefit everyone Mr Schumacher said So back pats may be due Senator Ron Wyden Democrat of Oregon and Representative Tom Reed Republican of New York the major catalysts for this hospicerelated legislation Death is nonpartisan Mr Schumacher said
