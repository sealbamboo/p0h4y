Of all the threats to Americans health  a list that includes bird flu measles and West Nile virus  few get Dr Tom Frieden as riled up as electronic cigarettes Ive treated so many adults who are desperate  desperate  to get off tobacco They all started as kids Frieden said I see the industry getting another generation of our kids addicted To me as a physician when  million of our high school kids have tried an ecigarette and a lot of them are using them regularly  thats like watching someone harm hundreds of thousands of children In addition he said people have a misconception that the tobacco epidemic is a thing of the past Tobacco still kills more Americans than any other cause It still kills more than  people a day As a doctor I can tell you it kills them in really unpleasant ways  gasping for breath with emphysema with cancer with heart disease What does that have to do with ecigarettes Ecigarettes are a tobacco product he said Actually the batteryoperated devices   Instead as my colleague Monte Morin reported they heat nicotine propylene glycol and glycerin into a vapor which is inhaled by the user Still Frieden rattled off five reasons why ecigarettes are as dangerous as tobacco cigarettes If they get another generation of kids more hooked on nicotine and more likely to smoke cigarettes thats more harm than good he said If they get smokers who would have quit to keep smoking instead of quitting more harm than good If they get exsmokers who have been off nicotine to go back on nicotine and then back to cigarettes more harm than good If they get people who want to quit smoking and would have taken medicines to think ecigarettes are going to help but they dont more harm than good If they reglamorize smoking its more harm than good Just for good measure Frieden threw in two more problems with ecigarettes People who use them can expose kids teens and pregnant women to nicotine via secondhand smoke and enterprising smokers can put marijuana or hallucinogens in an ecigarette tank Frieden acknowledged that stick to stick theyre almost certainly less toxic than cigarettes and that many people have quit smoking tobacco cigarettes with the help of ecigarettes However he said the plural of anecdote is not data Just last week the FDA announced it would   by forbidding sales to minors and requiring manufacturers to include health warnings on the devices Frieden called those moves a good first step The challenge that the FDA has is that they will be challenged by the tobacco industry as they have been at every step of the way he said The federal agency tried to regulate ecigarettes earlier and they lost to the tobacco industry  So the FDA has to balance moving quickly with moving in a way thats going to be able to survive the tobacco industrys highly paid legal challenge    and like   on Facebook
