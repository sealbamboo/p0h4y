The number of people using insulin to treat diabetes trebled between  and  researchers from Cardiff and Bristol universities have found They say the increase is due to a large rise in the number of people with type  diabetes using the drug But the figures are a wakeup call on how the condition is treated their study says  Diabetes UK said many people with type  diabetes needed to use medication to manage their condition  looked at the number of patients receiving prescriptions for insulin using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink CPRD It found that UK insulin users increased from  to  while people with all kinds of diabetes rose from m to m During the same period there was an increase in the prevalence of insulin users with a diagnosis of type  diabetes from  to  per  population  The researchers also found that the number of people receiving prescriptions for insulin for type  diabetes during the nearly year period overtook the number of people with type  diabetes  In  more people using insulin had type  than type  diabetes However by  this situation had reversed with the total number of people with type  diabetes injecting insulin increasing from  in  to  in   Prof Craig Currie lead author of the study and professor of applied pharmacoepidemiology at Cardiff University said the findings were worrying and questioned the clinical need for so many people with type  diabetes being treated with insulin Insulin is very expensive and some of us believe that it involves too many serious side effects in people with type  diabetes The rising prevalence of insulinuse probably reflects both an increase in incidence and longer survival of those who already have type  diabetes The increase in the number of people with type  diabetes using insulin is a wakeup call for all  not only in terms of lifestyle choices and how we treat people with type  diabetes Prof Currie added that the financial cost of insulin to the NHS in the UK was estimated to have increased from m in  to m in  In my view every effort should be made to keep them off insulin It should only be used a last resort he said Simon ONeill director of health intelligence at Diabetes UK said it was important to remember that insulin was an essential treatment for many people with diabetes Some people with type  diabetes are able to manage the condition with physical activity and healthy eating alone when they are first diagnosed but as the condition is progressive most people will eventually also need to use medications which can include insulin to help them effectively manage the condition  By making sure that people with diabetes are getting the recommended checks and support they need to manage their diabetes we can help them avoid complications which are not only a personal tragedy for all of those involved but are also hugely costly to the NHS
