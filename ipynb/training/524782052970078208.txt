Intense highly demanding exercise has many health benefits and one signal drawback It can be physically unpleasant which deters many people from beginning or sticking with an intense exercise program An encouraging new study however suggests that listening to music makes strenuous workouts feel easier and may nudge people into pushing themselves harder than they had thought possible  Strenuous exercise especially in the form of highintensity interval training has interested many scientists and exercisers in recent years Highintensity intervals are brief bouts of hard draining exercise interspersed with rest periods Past studies have shown that  or minute sessions of interval training   and   as effectively as much longer bouts of moderate continuous endurance training  In other words highintensity interval training promises a hefty fitness bang from a small time investment  But as those of us who have experimented with this type of exercise quickly learn that time short as it may be is punishing Many people find the experience aversive said Matthew Stork a graduate student at McMaster University in Hamilton Ontario who led the     Mr Stork and his colleagues at McMaster who have conducted many studies of highintensity interval training wondered if it would be possible to find ways to modify peoples perceptions of how little they were enjoying the exercise You cant reduce the actual intensity substantially he knew without reducing the physiological benefits But perhaps you could alter peoples feelings about the difficulty  He and his colleagues thought immediately of music  Many past studies have found that listening to music changes peoples experience of exercise with most people reporting that listening to energetic songs  make a workout feel easier and less monotonous But those studies have generally involved standard endurance exercise such as  minutes or so of continuous jogging or cycling Few have examined the effect that music might have during intense intervals in part because many exercise scientists have suspected that such training is too draining The physiological noise bombarding people from their own muscles and lungs during intervals many scientists have thought would drown out the music making any effect negligible But Mr Stork was unconvinced So he recruited  young healthy adult volunteers none of whom previously had dabbled with highintensity interval training Then he brought them into the lab and had them learn how to work out quite hard  The precise regimen that the volunteers followed was simple enough Using stationary bicycles they completed four second bouts of what the researchers call allout pedaling at the highest intensity that each volunteer could stand Each second bout was followed by four minutes of recovery time during which the volunteers could pedal gently or climb off the bike and sit or walk about Throughout the allout intervals meanwhile the scientists tracked the volunteers pedaling power output and asked them how hard the exercise felt and whether they were having fun Or not  After that workout the volunteers sat down and listed their favorite songs which the researchers then downloaded and used to create custom playlists for each volunteer  Then each volunteer returned twice more to the lab grunting through two additional sessions of the highintensity intervals During one they listened to their chosen playlist In the other they did not listen to music  Afterward the researchers compared the riders power outputs and reported feelings about the workouts difficulty   The volunteers all reported that the intervals had been hard In fact their feelings about the difficulty were almost identical whether they had been listening to music or not  What is interesting is that their power output had been substantially greater when they were listening to music They were pedaling much more ferociously than without music But they did not find that effort to be more unpleasant Without music the workout struck them as about the equivalent of an eight or higher on a zero to  scale of disagreeableness with  being unbearable  With music each interval still felt like about an eight or higher to the riders but they were working much harder during each second spurt The intensity increased but not the discomfort  Polled by the scientists at the end of the experiment all  riders said that if they were to take up interval training on their own after the study they definitely would listen to music to get themselves through the workout  How music affects performance and perceptions during intense exercise remains unclear Mr Stork said but it likely involves arousal responses The body responds to the rhythm of the music with a physiological revving that prepares it for the demands of the intervals  People may also turn to music in hopes of ignoring their bodys insistent messages of discomfort Music cannot of course override those messages altogether Mr Stork pointed out But it may mute them and make you more eager to strain through another session of intervals sweat and playlist streaming
