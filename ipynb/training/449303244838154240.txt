Back in the s a geneticist named MaryClaire King decided she needed to figure out why women in some families were much more likely to get breast cancer It took  years for King and her colleague to identify the single gene that could cause both breast and ovarian cancer During that time many people discounted her work saying that genes couldnt cause complex diseases like cancer She proved them wrong by mapping the location of the gene she named BRCA In  after an international race of four years among competing laboratories the BRCA gene was successfully cloned King  her experience in Thursdays issue of the journal   The discovery revolutionized genetics and cancer treatment Simple genetic tests now let women know if they have mutations in their BRCA genes that increase cancer risk They then can act on that knowledge as actress Angelina Jolie did King now a   at the University of Washington talked with NPRs Audie Cornish on Thursday about how she slowly but surely built evidence to prove that BRCA did indeed cause cancer The conversation has been edited for length and clarity For breast cancer there was very good evidence that some families were at high risk of the disease but without an explanation why that could be true In the absence of any other explanation I was driven to consider genetics Our strategy was to use the idea of mapping a gene as an epistemological tool We felt that we could prove the existence of a gene by showing where it was And thats what we did It took  years from  to  but by  we really had incontrovertible proof that there was a gene that lived on chromosome  in a particular physical locale Youre right  anyone can loop up a gene for free It costs nothing and it takes  seconds on the   Youre also absolutely right that the Human Genome Project had not yet begun when we began working on this project The Human Genome Project and the effort to find BRCA were essentially born at the same time A challenge we face as scientists and a challenge our physician colleagues face is how to interpret this very rapidly growing amount of information in a way that can best empower our patients Our goal is to be able to inform women of genetic information that will lead them to make the best choices for themselves We need to provide data that is complete and accurate And we need to be able to do that inexpensively and effectively We now are in a position to say genetics only goes this far beyond this we need to think about environmental causes Now the understanding of environmental causes and genetic causes are moving hand in hand rather than in conflict As a young scientist it can be liberating to not have expectations placed on you if you can work quietly and if you can obtain funds for your work And I could obtain modest funds for my work in the s and I could work in a way that allowed me the time and space to develop evidence until I was convinced of it Thats of course the highest bar  that you convince yourself that your evidence is good Once you present your evidence then of course youre no longer being ignored Youre being attacked from all sides Then you need to defend your evidence But if youve had  years to develop your evidence then youre in a much better position to defend it well When one is a child of affirmative action one needs to anticipate that people particularly those who didnt benefit from affirmative action wont take you seriously for a while But theres a wonderful phrase from Simone de Beauvoir For a woman to be taken as seriously as a man she must be three times as effective Happily this is not difficult
