Its a different way of fighting a war on cancer Instead of focusing on treatments drugs and experimental surgeries it looks at what is going on in our environment and what we are eating and considers what role those factors might play in the cancer epidemic Its not a popular place on the spectrum of debate about cancer Frankly the corporations that pollute our environment and process our food dont want to go anywhere near the message that comes from   It is simply not good for business  So I am riding to help people think about what causes cancer Sure there is a genetic component to all of this But thats just part of the story The other part of the story for me is a very personal journey Fourandahalf months ago I had an accident that   One of my goals for returning to normalcy was to get back on a bicycle  something that was very important to me before I lost my arm I probably wouldnt have decided to ride  miles over two days without the LessCancerorg event As a matter fact if I did you might think I was a little bit crazy As it is a lot of people think it is illadvised to set the bar so high so soon after my accident  And Ive been thinking a lot about why I have been pushing so hard so soon Over the past few weeks I have been talking with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr Sanjay Gupta about my recovery During my time with Sanjay he repeatedly expressed incredulity over the pace that I have been keeping since I returned to my life minus an arm  He like so many others wonders if Im going too fast and not taking enough time to pause reflect and grieve When I stop to think about it I too wonder if I am ultimately doing myself a disservice Should I be spending more time taking care of myself But then I think about how I would feel if I put myself on the sidelines at this point  I would be left wondering what I can do and what I may not be able to do I simply need to know now There might be a time bomb of grief ticking inside me that will explode later but at least Ill know my abilities when that time comes I also think about the challenges that I have set for myself Three months after the accident I was with my longtime friend and colleague Kate Tobin camping on a Denali glacier in Alaska for a story we are doing on climate change We snowshoed for miles and I was shooting a lot of video in some very arduous conditions  including at the bottom of a foot hole in the ice  I had definitely jumped into the deep end of my first big assignment after the accident I was really nervous about how it might go but after we had done the trip and we were sitting in the airport for our respective flights home Kate turned to me and said I didnt see a bit of difference in your performance on this trip I could not have asked for better medicine than that So I guess setting big goals in short order isnt such a bad idea assuming you reach them This goal   miles on a bicycle in two days  is a reach to be sure But I am going to do my best  I have a fallback plan or two including a tricycle called Monomano that is ideally suited for a onearmed rider and a cousin who has a tandem bicycle with a seat reserved for me If all else fails theres always the   for a segment or two But heres what will keep me pedaling I will be thinking about my sister my mother my exmotherinlaw both of my grandmothers my girlfriend and everyone else I know whom I lost or nearly lost to cancer  Their courage and grace while fighting this disease is an inspiration to me and should be to all of us Yes I have a new challenge in my life but frankly it pales by comparison when I consider what its like to be caught up in the cancer epidemic  We must find a way to stop it I am neither a doctor nor a scientist  although I play the latter on TV But in reality what can we do For me the answer is to pedal hard and long to Mackinac
