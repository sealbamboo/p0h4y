One in four people has not heard of outofhours GP services figures show The National Audit Office survey of  people in England also found one in five was unaware of the new  urgent phone service The poll was part of a wider review which found the numbers using outofhours services had fallen by a third in six years to  million in  The watchdog said the drop could be a result of people being unaware of the service or lacking confidence in it The report noted the drop in people using outofhours had occurred as visits to AE had risen But it also said it could be related to the launch of the  service last year which has started handling some of the outofhours calls The findings come after a turbulent few years for outofhours care GPs were allowed to opt out of providing services in   and nine in  have done so leaving it to local health bodies to find alternative providers Over the years reports have emerged of patients struggling to access services or being unhappy with the care they have received In the most recent patient survey  released earlier this month   reported they felt services were poor NAO head Amyas Morse said NHS England has much to do to help secure improvements throughout the system and to increase its oversight It should also work to raise public awareness of how and when patients should contact outofhours GP services and needs to be prepared to take the lead in integrating these services effectively with other parts of the urgent care system In terms of cost it estimates the amount spent on the service stood at m last year  m less once inflation is taken into account than eight years ago However it said as  had taken on some of the workload it was hard to make cost comparisons Dr Cliff Mann of the College of Emergency Medicine said there needed to be a rethink over the way outofhours services were designed because attempts to encourage patients to use them had so far failed He said Rather than persuade patients to find their way to services we need to provide a range of services where the lights are on   That is why we are strongly advocating that outofhours care should be colocated with AE services This isnt a marketing problem to solve but a real life patient care issue Patients Association chief executive Katherine Murphy added Unless this issue is addressed we will continue to see more pressure on an already overstretched AE system as patients visit emergency departments But Health Minister Lord Howe said improvements were already being made  He said  was helping direct patients to the right place while GPs were now taking on more of a role in challenging outofhours care where their patients have concerns
