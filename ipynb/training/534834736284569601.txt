The   that oversees many American healthcare workers volunteering in Ebolastricken regions of West Africa says theres been a significant decline in the number of people who are willing to go International aid groups attribute that drop to the mandatory quarantine rules implemented by New York and New Jersey last month Once the restrictions were issued we definitely had people who said Im going to have to back out says Margaret Aguirre the head of global initiatives at the   in Los Angeles The group has about  healthcare workers volunteering in West Africa Aguirre says Ebola assignments can last six to eight weeks at a time because of all the safety training thats required Many of these people are volunteering their time And to be able to ask them to leave their work and families for that long stretch of time  plus the three weeks day quarantine  thats just prohibitive for people Aid groups have been warning about a possible chilling effect on volunteers since the two states rules were announced in late October And now there is some data to back up those claims The United States Agency for International Development which handles applications from medical personnel volunteering to serve in West Africa says applications declined by about  percent after October th when the rules for mandatory quarantine rules were announced There was an unquestionable dropoff says USAID spokesman Matt Herrick And unfortunately that decline has continued There could be other explanations for the dropoff in volunteers including the upcoming holiday season or the inherent dangers of treating the Ebola virus But public health experts believe the mandatory quarantine rules are partly to blame New York and New Jersey implemented their rules after a healthcare worker in New York City Dr Craig Spencer tested positive for Ebola after working with Doctors Without Borders in Guinea Spencer has since been treated and released with no further Ebola cases reported The governors of both states say the mandatory quarantines are needed to protect the public New Jersey Governor Chris Christies administration did not respond to our request for comment today But he defended his policy vigorously at a campaign appearance in Rhode Island in late October Your first and most important job is to protect the health and safety of the people who live within your borders Christie said And the fact is were doing the exact right thing Public health officials arent so sure The word is out on the street if you go youre at risk of losing your liberty says   a professor of global health at Georgetown University Law School And people dont volunteer because of it Gostin points out that Ebola patients are only contagious when theyre showing symptoms of the disease And hes worried that mandatory quarantine rules may ultimately hurt more than they help by discouraging volunteers I call this a kind of misguided selfinterest he says We think its in our selfinterest But in fact its probably harmful to our own interests Public health experts say its in everyones interests to end the Ebola epidemic at its source in West Africa And thats going to take a lot more volunteers
