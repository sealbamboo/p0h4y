Last month a friend and I rode bicycles  miles up the spine of Texas from the Rio Grande to the Red River dodging oilfield trucks and yipping Chihuahua dogs All that pedaling had us burning about  to  calories every day And so the day journey  eight days of it riding into a headwind  became a movable feast There were hero sandwiches Tater Tots loaded baked potatoes ribeye steaks   cheese enchiladas fried shrimp cheeseburgers french fries hot dogs barbecue brisket beef jerky chocolate glazed donuts Snickers bars and fried pies It was the diet that a caloriecounting cubicle dweller can only dream of Imagine eating anything you want and never having to worry about belly fat Lots of endurance athletes  such as    get to eat this way all the time though they tend to practice more conscientious performance nutrition that probably doesnt include chocolate donuts With our caloric deficits at days end in mind I contacted a noted sports nutritionist before we dipped our back tires in the Gulf of Mexico and began our journey  professor emeritus in the department of kinesiology and health education at the University of Texas Austin thoughtfully created for us a detailed fueling program to limit muscle damage and counter fatigue spelling out what to have for breakfast lunch and dinner An example About  minutes before bedtime have a highprotein snack such as some turkey breast sliced ham Greek yogurt or a package of almonds Menu choices were severely limited in the Texas towns like Raymondville or Kingsville or Beeville where we slept Are fresh vegetables illegal in Kingsville Without a vehicle to find a grocery store for items like turkey breast and yogurt we promptly broke his program and ate whatever we wanted At a Subway sandwich shop in San Benito I split a footlong Italian sub with my ride partner Hawk Mendenhall Neither one of us actually remembers eating it  the sandwich seemed to transmogrify instantly into fuel Did I forget to chew said Hawk wiping mustard from his beard At the end of every sevenhour day on the saddle we dashed into a convenience store for the best recovery drink on the planet    Its got it all carbs protein calcium and water When the ride was over and we dipped our front tires in the Red River I called up John Ivy again and sheepishly told him about our laissezfaire attitude toward his careful nutrition plan He was entirely forgiving  especially about our regular diet of greasy TexMex food You got all the macronutrients you needed he reassured me Enchiladas with rice and beans is not a bad meal A lot of people gain weight on Mexican food because its calorically dense but you needed lots of calories I love longdistance cycling because its a leisurely gentle humanpowered way to appreciate the landscape It makes a person feel completely alive Moreover it transforms that postride meal  whatever is on your plate  into a glorious recharge for the body Our bicycle odyssey across Texas celebrated the original meaning of the French word  food that restores Back home in Austin as I rested my legs and sat down to a restrained meal of quinoa salad and chicken tikka masala I realized I missed the eating as much as the pedaling
