Abortion rights activists are working on a counterattack to the  bills that have passed in states across the US since  In the past three years Republicanled legislatures have backed bills to regulate abortions and the doctors and clinics that perform them Bills to ban abortions at  weeks are among the laws that cropped up three years ago and have now passed in about a dozen states This year North Dakota pushed to end abortions at around six weeks of pregnancy It really has been a wave of abortion restrictions moving across the country and it has affected providers and women and their families says Elizabeth Nash who tracks the laws for the Guttmacher Institute About a dozen clinics in Texas stopped providing abortions after a new law passed last summer At least a dozen other clinics have closed across the country because of laws that say doctors must have admitting privileges at local hospitals or because of another regulation requiring clinics to become mini surgical centers So abortion rights activists say theyre pushing a new legislative strategy In New York lawmakers introduced the Womens Equality Act in  backed by Gov Andrew Cuomo Why the state of New York asked Cuomo Because the state of New York has had a long and proud history of being the first one to stand up on issues like this on issues of inequality It includes pay equity for women and strengthens domestic violence laws Andrea Miller president of NARAL ProChoice New York says it also codifies Roe vs Wade the decision that legalized abortion It says you have this right to make these decisions prior to the th week of pregnancy or thereafter if your life or health is at risk Miller says Its quite simply Roe vs Wade put in state law to make sure that its always there The bill didnt pass this year but it will come up again in  Those who oppose abortion including the New York State Catholic Conference oppose the measure Kathleen Gallagher the conferences director of prolife activities says its too broadly written In our review its an expansion of lateterm abortions here in New York which we dont believe New York needs Gallagher says Abortion rights activists dispute that and say theyll work hard to get the package through On the other side of the country an abortion rightsfriendly bill in California did pass It expands the group of medical professionals that can provide abortions allowing nurse practitioners physician assistants and nurse midwives to perform firsttrimester procedures Dr Joseph Speidel a professor at the Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health in San Francisco says the law sets a precedent for other states The basis of the law change was a careful study that showed that the advance practice clinicians could do abortions as safely as physicians Speidel says Activists point to what they say is another success the Pennsylvania Agenda for Womens Health a package of bills spearheaded by the Womens Health Caucus in the legislature A portion of the agenda was recently introduced by state Rep Dan Frankel a Democrat We want to change the conversation Frankel says We want to talk about really how do we enhance womens health Frankel says women who are poor have limited access to health care including abortions He says the agenda including workplace accommodations for pregnant women and creating buffer zones around clinics where abortion protests take place would help Those who are sincere in wanting to promote womens health in Pennsylvania ought to be able to endorse and help us pass this package of bills he said The Pennsylvania bills may face an uphill battle as legislators there have passed stricter laws  especially since an illegal abortion clinic was discovered in Philadelphia Its operator Kermit Gosnell was convicted of murder in the death of one woman and several viable infants who were born alive and then killed Abortion rights activists call Gosnell an outlier but those who oppose the procedures have used the case to lobby for more restrictions across the country including in Texas where Republican Gov Rick Perry signed a new bill into law last summer The Texas measure bans abortion at  weeks and requires nearby hospital admitting privileges for doctors performing abortions Abortion rights groups say theyre mobilizing in opposition to the Texas law and around state Sen Wendy Davis now a Democratic candidate for governor who conducted an hour filibuster on the issue Activists say her decision to speak up inspired new supporters Weve had a lot of increased interest in volunteering with our work says Merritt Tierce executive director of the Texas Equal Access Fund a group that helps lowincome women pay for abortions The most important thing that has come out of this is a conversation about abortion that needs to continue that needs to intensify and that needs to stay focused on the complexities Nash calls the effort a starting point What we have been missing has been a bill to rally around and to express the values of those who support reproductive health and rights she says
