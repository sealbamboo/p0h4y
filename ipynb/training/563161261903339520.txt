People are being encouraged to spend five minutes talking about mental health as part of the second annual Time to Talk day But talking isnt the end goal argues Mark Brown If more of us speak about mental health problems the belief is that judgemental attitudes will fall away  Thats the aim of Time to Talk day  a campaign which aims to tackle stigma challenge attitudes and change behaviour around mental illness  Its been organised by the people behind    a programme led by the charities Mind and Rethink Mental Illness  Mind say that since  two million are said to have a more positive view of mental illness  based on figures taken from the most recent   It seems more people in the UK are talking about mental health than ever before   Despite this admitting to personal difficulties is still hard for many people because of a fear of the consequences Its what we call stigma and it can bring a feeling of personal shame If you raise the subject and get a positive response though it can be liberating  Some liken Time to Change to other campaigns in the disability world which use simplistic slogans like see the person not the disability Its said theyre more about being nicer to individuals than changing those laws and circumstances which put disabled people at a disadvantage While talk might be an accessible entry point for the general public it doesnt necessarily help those who experience facets of mental illness like hearing voices which carry a heavier degree of stigma  A subsection of campaigners have argued that focusing on personal stories from people with mental health difficulties has moved the debate away from bringing concrete social changes They say its systematic prejudice and discrimination that are the biggest problems not shame In this months   commentator Lawrence CarterLong from the National Council on Disability in Washington DC brings his perspective He says having the conversation is a crucial first step and allows people with mental health difficulties to find others who have been going through the same so they can then build community  He says one of the biggest problems is isolation Those with mental health difficulties dont come across other people that have dealt with these issues know how to navigate those waters that theres going to be light at the end of the tunnel or a different mood at the end of the day  Awareness campaigns can start the conversation he says but its up to us to bring it forward  Beyond getting people to talk about their mental health Time to Change work with organisations to help them shape policy and practice around discrimination and target black and minority ethnic communities to tackle specific cultural prejudices But their most prominent call to action has been encouraging people to have that important first conversation about mental health  The conversations that Time to Change encourage from five minute chats to political pledges are an attempt to build the platform for a wider change But there is a danger that talking is thought of as the final goal rather than the first step in the right direction
