From coast to coast, .  claiming to help women achieve the lithe physiques of professional ballerinas have become all the rage. . , a workout created by Mary Helen Bowers — Natalie Portman's trainer for the film .  — aims to give women "very long, lean streamlined muscles.". But what does science tell us about whether we can change our predetermined body shapes – not how fat or thin we are, but whether we're shaped like an apple, pear, hourglass, or string bean? Can a person with a stocky build achieve lean muscles with the right conditioning?. "Doing certain types of exercises, you might be able to make yourself longer and leaner for you," says Susan Joy, MD of Cleveland Clinic, "but someone with the body of a true prima ballerina is very genetically different than a lot of other people.". Dr. Joy says science is revealing more about how people's muscle fibers respond differently to training, but it's not clear to what degree a certain aesthetic can be achieved through mere conditioning.. Bowers admits there are limits to any workout's ability to transform body shape. "I can't make you any taller than you are, but we can stretch your legs and outer limbs out and give you a look much longer and leaner, and just a little more pulled up and elegant."
