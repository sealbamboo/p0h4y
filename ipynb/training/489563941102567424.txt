We often think about people spreading diseases around the world This spring vacationers brought   from the Caribbean to the United States Businessmen have likely spread Ebola across international borders in West Africa And health care workers have carried a new virus from the Middle East to Asia and Europe But what about womans best friend From shelter mutts to purebred show dogs canines across the state of Texas are becoming infected with a parasite that causes a potentially deadly disease in people scientists   Wednesday in the journal   Although the dogs arent spreading the parasite directly to people they are helping to make the disease more prevalent in the southern US Not to mention the parasite can make dogs sick and even kill them The disease is called   And its transmitted by an insect known as the   Dont let the name fool you This isnt a friendly bug The insect bites the faces and lips of sleeping people then passes on the Chagas parasite through its fecal matter The parasite is a protist called  About  people in the US are infected with the Chagas parasite Researchers have   that the disease cost the US about  million each year in lost work time and medical bills Many people with Chagas disease dont even know it They have no symptoms But for about a third of those infected the parasite damages the heart or digestive tract And there are no drugs to cure a chronic infection So once the parasite takes up residency in somebodys tissue it never leaves Most people with Chagas disease in the US likely caught it in Latin America where about  million people are infected with the parasite But in the past decade researchers have found evidence that Chagas disease is spreading locally in Texas and around New Orleans The new study in dogs points up how widespread the problem is says microbiologist   at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston It shows that active transmission is going on in the US says Jain who wasnt involved with this research Having infections in dogs in the US serves a role in maintaining the infection cycle of Chagas disease In the study veterinarian   and her team at Texas AM tested  shelter dogs across Texas for signs of chronic Chagas infection About  percent of the dogs in every part of the state tested positive The study was just on shelter dogs Hamer says But were also looking at other dogs in Texas  working dogs show dogs you name it They are all exposed to and have Chagas Its common in dogs in Texas But the chances of a dog spreading the parasite to its owner is very low Hamer says The last thing we want to do is put a bad taste in peoples mouths about shelter dogs she says Shelter dogs are not posing a direct risk to humans Why Because for the parasite to move from the dog to a person it needs to go through the kissing bug And the dog can pass the parasite to the bug only at the beginning of the infection So for a person to catch Chagas from their pooch a kissing bug would have to bite the dog and then its owner right after the dog gets infected We dont have kissing bugs in our homes Hamer says so the chance of that happening is small Thats not the case in South and Central America In many poor communities kissing bugs live in the roofs of thatched and mud homes Scientists in Argentina have   that having a dog or two in the family greatly boosts your chance of getting Chagas disease Jain says Theres been a lot of research on this question in Argentina she say When the dogs live around the house they are certainly important for spreading the disease there The dogs harbor the parasites and serve as a source for humans infections
