For months Liberia was the country worsthit by the Ebola outbreak But the wards in Liberias Ebola treatment units now stand virtually empty The number of newly reported cases   from almost  cases a week in midSeptember to fewer than  by midOctober But that doesnt mean its time to take it easy In fact Liberian President Ellen JohnsonSirleaf has just announced a new campaign Ebola Must Go which focuses on the role of the community Liberia still records  new cases each day says Kevin De Cock the doctor leading the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Ebola effort in Liberia At least half are in the capital Monrovia a city of more than  million There are also pockets of the virus in the countryside We cannot rest until Ebola is eliminated De Cock says Great progress has been made but elimination of the disease is not yet in sight De Cock spoke with NPR about what still needs to be done The interview has been edited for length and clarity Theres a great danger of complacency and accepting this disease as the new normal when in fact we are now at the same stage in intensity of the outbreak we were in late June early July Just a year ago this situation would have been completely unthinkable Well one of the effects of this epidemic has been that its transformed the way the world thinks about Ebola Weve always considered this an important infection but a kind of isolated and exotic one It was something one read about in tropical medicine textbooks All of a sudden this disease is being discussed at the highest levels of international and US governments on the floor of the United Nations at the Security Council Really its a crisis in global health And yet  theres a danger that when the epidemic becomes more invisible again this continual presence of Ebola becomes accepted as the new normal We cannot allow that to happen What were seeing are clusters erupting in different counties somewhat unpredictably About a third to a half are apparently initiated by somebody from Monrovia having traveled  and then locally spread The country with all of the international agencies and organizations is getting better at responding to these clusters but theyre all their own minioutbreaks and each of them needs to be addressed and extinguished And this is continuing to happen So this is an ongoing epidemic Its an aspirational target and such aspirations are to be encouraged and supported We follow the data which show that there is substantial transmission of Ebola still ongoing And Christmas is pretty near but well see what happens The state of emergency has been lifted Theres discussion of reopening schools All this is very positive but one has to balance that with a false sense of security that this is all over And its not over Its a balance now between continuing to address the acuteness of the situation and the longerterm commitment as the health system reopens Hospitals begin to focus on the problems that have been neglected in these last few months  you know maternal health tuberculosis HIVAIDS malaria etc I think what the president is aiming at is that the community has to want a society that is free of Ebola That its not just a job for the Ministry of Health or the government or the external partners  communities have to be involved I personally believe communities have played a substantial role in the impressive decline in the epidemic particularly in Lofa County northeast near the Guinea border We need that across the whole region Its encouraging that the president is committed to this and is really trying to mobilize the people Thats an interesting question because there was this perception that something special happened in Liberia The answer is yes and no Liberia did what we know needs to be done which is you isolate the sick you provide best treatment and safely bury the dead You protect health care workers base your response on data and do contact tracing In some parts of the country communities played an active role particularly rural areas So theres nothing special And yet on the other hand the fact that they did it in a country that is among the  poorest in the world is encouraging and impressive I think in Sierra Leone theyre very reassured to hear that theyre doing the right things but they accept that there needs to be increased intensity And what I think has happened in Freetown the capital perhaps is that theres been somewhat of a slowness in isolating the sick and waiting for the right facilities to be in place when actually you cant wait You have to use what youve got to do the best you can Press on We need to continue with a vigorous response based on addressing Ebola as we know how to do it  with case finding isolation of the sick treatment and care of the sick and very very importantly at this stage contact tracing And as the health care system reopens protection of health care workers
