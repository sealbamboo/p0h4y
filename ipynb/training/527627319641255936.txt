A UK national sperm bank  charged with reversing a growing shortage of donor sperm  has started work in Birmingham Fertility clinics have become increasingly dependent on imported sperm giving rise to the socalled Viking babies phenomenon Meanwhile   shows a th of IVF cycles are dependent on donated sperm or eggs And a third of procedures using donated material were for samesex couples or single women The number of UKbased sperm donors has been increasing since  However demand has increased even faster Denmark and the United States have become major suppliers of sperm to British women  The Department of Health has given  to fund a national sperm bank which will be based at Birmingham Womens Hospital There will be a corresponding campaign to change the face of sperm donation which will be run by the National Gamete Donation Trust  Sperm donors in the UK are mostly white which leaves people from other ethnicities struggling to find a donor  The project will start in Birmingham before being extending to cover the whole country Dr Sue Avery the director of the Birmingham Womens Fertility Centre told the BBC News website The idea of the campaign is to focus on sperm donation as a tremendously positive thing to do and that the men who do this are very special Theyre helping to build families Were spending this money to start something that we hope will grow to the point where nobody has to import sperm Eventually the national bank could act like a brokerage house that connects donors in one part of the country with those in need elsewhere The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said the proportion of imported donor sperm was increasing every year  In part this is because the time and resources needed to recruit UK donors can sometimes make importation more viable the body said  People who need donated sperm included men who have had cancer treatment or had a genetic defect leaving them incapable of producing sperm  The HFEA data also shows a rising number of women who are single or who have a female partner receiving treatment with donated sperm  Dr Allan Pacey the chair of the British Fertility Society told the BBC We are importing as a nation more and more sperm from overseas without being xenophobic it kind of just doesnt feel right its a problem thats not going away He argued simple economics could make it easier to import sperm than increase the number of donors  But said the practice created problems such as making it much harder for children to meet their biological parents if they lived half a world away Also I think there will always be some patients who with regards to sperm donors will want an individual that is more closely related to them in culture and language and outlook He added that sperm donation needed to become more ethnically diverse and it made sense to start the bank in multicultural Birmingham  Ive gone to the Birmingham clinic about twice a month for the past nine months  I initially started doing it because I had a friend who was struggling to have children and it made me want to help I want to help other people some who really go through it I just think why not  Obviously you are concerned but I have faith if someone has gone through this to have children they will go to the effort to make sure they have a good life  I dont think of babies conceived from my sperm as my children as I think the parent is the person who brings them up  I dont feel an emotional bond to the children At my age now I dont know I would be a good parent  Laura Witjens the chief executive of the National Gamete Donor Trust said When people think of sperm donation they often only think about the physical act of producing sperm  Lets face it that can be offputting and detract from the real issues Were all set to change that outlook  Sperm donors are very special men who are doing something they and their families can be exceptionally proud of  These are men who are doing something lifechanging for themselves and for others Its time to shout about how fantastic these guys are
