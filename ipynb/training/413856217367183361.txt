Mapping the genetic code of fertilised eggs could double the success rate of IVF researchers claim The new screening method to detect healthy embryos could raise the success of IVF to  or more according to a Peking University and Harvard University team Trials of the procedure in China offer hope to older women they say The research in the journal   should be viewed with caution said a UK fertility expert IVF involves joining a womans egg and a mans sperm in a laboratory dish then transferring embryos into the mothers womb  In order to maximise the success of IVF various screening procedures can be used by fertility clinics to select the most healthy ones for implantation These approaches often involve removing cells from the growing embryo and may not pick up all genetic problems  The new method studied in  fertilised eggs from volunteer egg donors was based on removing leftover fragments of cells known as polar bodies from the early developing embryo and analysing their full genetic code Lead researcher Jie Qiao of Third Hospital Peking University said Theoretically if this works perfectly we will be able to double the success rate of test tube baby technology from  to  or even more The technique allows DNA contributed by the mother to the growing embryo to be screened for genetic abnormalities that might lead to IVF failure miscarriage or genetic problems in the child said coresearcher Xiaoliang Sunney Xie of Harvard University It would be of most use to women with repeated failures of IVF and could improve the success rate of fertility treatment particularly in older women he said In this paper we have a proof of principle  the clinical trial has already started he told BBC News It does offer hope to women with repeated failure of IVF However a UK expert urged caution Commenting on the research Dr Yacoub Khalaf consultant in reproductive medicine and surgery at the Assisted Conception Unit at Guys Hospital London told BBC News The area of screening is appealing in theory but in practice has not delivered If screening eggs or screening embryos is not robust and reliable it could cost women their eggs or their embryos both of which are precious and finite Infertility affects up to  of couples around the world with many turning to IVF to have a child
