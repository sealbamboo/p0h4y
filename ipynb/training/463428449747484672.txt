Fewer people died in Massachusetts after the state required people to have health insurance according to researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health In each of the first four years of the state law  fewer Massachusetts men and women died than would have been expected Thats one life extended for every  newly insured residents Massachusetts passed its mandatory universal health coverage law in  under thenGov Mitt Romney The hope was that when people have health insurance they would be more likely to get preventive care go to the doctor when they become ill and live longer Now theres evidence of that link according to a   published Monday in the   In the first four years of universal health insurance the states death rate dropped  percent when compared to similar counties outside Massachusetts that did not expand health coverage White residents are living longer but the biggest improvement in life expectancy came for blacks Asians and Latinos whose death rates dropped  percent   executive director of the Boston Public Health Commission says the study builds on   showing that health coverage is reducing income and racial disparities in Massachusetts Shes hopeful the state is on a path to eliminate health disparities altogether I would be surprised if we didnt see a closing of the gap that could be attributed to improved coverage rates Ferrer says But she continues We have to be a little bit wary that you cant just insure people without making sure that they have access to high quality services But certainly in Massachusetts were able to do both  an assistant professor of health policy and economics and the studys lead author says the most significant decline was in conditions including cancer infections heart disease and other ills that could be prevented or delayed with medical care Meanwhile in some other causes of death that are less amenable to health care such as car crashes homicide suicide we didnt find any statistically significant changes he says Sommers coauthored the paper with   of the Urban Institute and   of the Harvard School of Public Health They say the findings are encouraging for states in the early stages of implementing the Affordable Care Act But Douglas Hotlz Eakin president of the American Action Forum is skeptical He says the study does not prove that coverage lowers death rates The authors he says dont directly observe how people interact with the medical community  They reach their conclusions by inference and process of elimination Theres a limit to that He says to beware of drawing too many conclusions from this one state If theres one thing weve learned about health care reform Massachusetts doesnt look like the rest of the country People are always skeptical about expanding to the whole US the findings from a Massachusetts experiment  director the National Academy for State Health Policy says many opponents of the Affordable Care Act acknowledged that there would be health benefits to insuring more people through the federal law but that they dont feel that the nation can afford it or that its an appropriate role for government And if thats the basis of your opposition I think additional evidence that it might improve peoples health is unlikely to change your overall view of the law This study takes the research into role of health insurance a step further says author Sommers We already had a large body of research that showed the uninsured rate had dropped people were able to access services and that they   Sommers says This adds another important piece to that which is that people are living longer
