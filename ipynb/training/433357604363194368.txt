The HPV vaccine was created to protect women against the virus that causes cervical cancer But it also helps prevent genital warts a common sexually transmitted disease caused by the same virus a study finds Girls and women who got two doses of the HPV vaccine got almost as much protection from   as people who got the recommended three doses according to a  published Tuesday in   the journal of the American Medical Association This study looked at the health records of more than  million girls and women ages  to  using Swedens national health registry The researchers could see when participants had had HPV shots and when they were diagnosed with genital warts The girls and women who got just two doses of vaccine had  more cases of genital warts per  personyears compared to those who had three doses Thats a pretty small difference overall I believe we have more questions to answer before we know if two or three doses offer the best protection says   an associate professor at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm who led the study Those questions include whether girls who start the shots when theyre  or  as recommended would get better protection against the   and whether that protection wanes over time Therefore clinicians and patients should stick to the recommended dose schedule until other recommendations are made Arhneim Dahlstrom tells Shots The results echo those of smaller studies looking not at genital warts but infection with the HPV virus They also found that fewer than three shots still offered some protection If this turns out to be true it will be good news because doctors have found it hard to get teenagers and young women to complete the recommended vaccinations Just onethird of girls ages  to  have gotten all three doses the CDC   in  About half have had a single dose Cost and inconvenience are big issues as well as parents concerns about safety and potential effects on sexual activity There are   on the market for HPV One called   protects against HPV types  and  which cause  percent of genital warts The warts also called condyloma arent dangerous but they can be uncomfortable Having genital warts at a sensitive age can be very stressful Arnheim Dahlstrom says Though many people are able to clear the infection themselves without treatment others have recurrent infections even if treated
