At least  children in Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone who have lost one or both parents to Ebola this year face being shunned the UN childrens organisation has said Carers were urgently needed for these orphans Unicef said A basic human reaction like comforting a sick child has been turned into a potential death sentence it added The World Health Organization WHO says more than  people have died of Ebola in West Africa It is the worlds most deadly outbreak of the virus The figure on the number of Ebola orphans follows a twoweek assessment mission by Unicef to the three countries worstaffected by the outbreak An earlier version of this story said that  children had lost parents but the correct figure is  It found that children as young as three or four years old were being orphaned by the disease Children were discovered alone in the hospitals where their parents had died or back in their communities where if they were lucky they were being fed by neighbours  but all other contact with them was being avoided Thousands of children are living through the deaths of their mother father or family members from Ebola Unicefs Manuel Fontaine said in a statement These children urgently need special attention and support yet many of them feel unwanted and even abandoned Orphans are usually taken in by a member of the extended family but in some communities the fear surrounding Ebola is becoming stronger than family ties  It is the right thing to do and to send a strong message to the Liberian people If we were just disciplined enough and everybody was obeying rules we wouldnt be here today Im sleeping in a room all by myself  my husband has moved into the guest room  At home I use my own utensils I disinfect them myself so others dont get infected Physically I am fine mentally like any other human being there is the fear of the unknown My husband my children have been supportive The difficulty is the way we used to sit down in the evening everyone watched TV together laughing and joking These days they are in their rooms to watch their own TV and Im in my room to watch mine I have my grandson here who I cant hold He will walk to me and I will tell him Go back to your mummy The number of Ebola orphans has spiked in the past few weeks and preliminary reports suggest that it is likely to double by midOctober Unicef said There was an urgent need to establish a system for identifying and caring for Ebola orphans it added Unicef will be holding a meeting on the issue in Sierra Leone next month but before then it wants potential carers to come forward  Ebola is turning a basic human reaction like comforting a sick child into a potential death sentence Mr Fontaine said We cannot respond to a crisis of this nature and this scale in the usual ways We need more courage more creativity and far far more resources Meanwhile the head of the new UN mission to combat Ebola says there needs to be significant progress in fighting the disease within the next  days  Anthony Banbury said  of infected people should be receiving treatment and  of burials should be done safely within that period  Its an extremely ambitious target and the only way it will be achieved is through this international effort he told reporters The UN Secretary General Ban Kimoon set up the UN Mission on Ebola Emergency Response earlier this month
