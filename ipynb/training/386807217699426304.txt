What will it take to make intrauterine devices sexy IUDs are highly effective forms of contraception but fear of side effects lack of training for doctors and costs can keep women away Health organizations and private companies are trying to change that by breaking down misconceptions and broadening access The contraceptives are inserted into the uterus and can prevent pregnancy for years And theyre reversible Shortly after theyre taken out a woman can become pregnant IUDs are more than   The World Health Organization  they are the most widely used reversible contraceptive method globally But few women in the US use them the percentage is only in the single digits in part because IUDs have a checkered past The Dalkon Shield IUD marketed nationwide beginning in  was found to raise the   Medical complications and deaths sparked lawsuits with   So we had a whole generation in the s and s  where doctors and clinicians werent trained and women didnt have that option says Dr Jeffrey Peipert a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University in St Louis That training gap remains even with newer and safer IUD models Peipert says And family medicine residents may no longer be required to get training in contraceptive counseling as NPR   The   intrauterine devices in the US are ParaGard which releases copper to interfere with sperm and Mirena which prevents pregnancy with the hormone progesterone There is still a slight risk of pelvic inflammatory disease But Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals the maker of   says fewer than  percent of users of its device get the infection More common side effects for women using IUDs are irregular bleeding or cramping Upfront costs also limit access the price of the device and getting it inserted can cost hundreds of dollars But Mirena works for up to five years and the copper IUD up to  So over time they can actually be cheaper than monthly payments for say the pill And IUDs like other contraceptives approved by the Food and Drug Administration are   for most users under the Affordable Care Act Peipert and his colleagues figured that if they provided trained experts educated women about their options and helped with costs more women would choose IUDs For their   they enrolled  teenagers and women ages  to  Fiftyeight percent of participants opted for intrauterine devices Compare that to about   of women using contraceptives who chose IUDs from  to  in the US Plus the researchers saw a drop in teen pregnancy and abortions in the study group The initiative known as   is expanding to other cities and even possibly to Africa Peipert says Family planning initiatives are gaining traction worldwide according to Anne Pfitzer family planning team leader for the nonprofit   Pfitzer who is helping to implement USAIDs   says this trend was encouraged by an international gathering of public health providers and governmental organizations in July  The London Summit   make family planning a global health priority IUDs are a part of that trend Taking more time between births   for the health of women and their babies and Jhpiego project director Elaine Charurat says that discussion should happen when women are pregnant Charurat says in developing countries where access to health care is limited women are more likely to come to a clinic for their babys sake than for their own contraceptive purposes If mothers do opt for contraception immediately after pregnancy an IUD is a good choice Pfitzer says because of its longterm convenience and because the copper IUD doesnt give off hormones which could interfere with breast feeding Talking to women when theyre at the clinic is one way to open access to IUDs  improving the efficacy of training is another Jhpiego for example is using lightweight relatively cheap   to more easily train local health providers in Pakistan The company   is working on making the insertion process simpler to cut down on the technical training needed Shuchi Khurana   of the medical startup says Bioceptives inserter automates some of the trickier parts of the process letting the provider know where to place the device and safeguarding against perforating the uterus Studies   that tearing of the uterus happens about once or twice for every  insertions the risk is higher with inexperienced operators and women whove had fewer children In July Bioceptives inserter was   in the same international contest that Jhpiego had been a part of in    The challenge looks for groundbreaking prevention and treatment ideas for women and newborns in poor rural communities says Wendy Taylor who helped spearhead the challenge Taylor director of USAIDs   says there have been fewer ideas around family planning submitted But she says theyre trying to encourage more projects in this area it may just be a matter of tapping into the right communities Back in the US Peipert says Were just getting past the period of the myths and the lack of training and the misconceptions about these methods For one thing there has been confusion over who should use IUDs Marketing for Mirena for example has been geared toward  But in September  the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists   stating that implants and intrauterine devices should be offered as firstline contraceptive options for sexually active adolescents A new brand is designed specifically with younger patients in mind Peipert says   is basically a new version of Mirena slightly smaller with a lower level of hormone It works up to three years as opposed to five with Mirena Another hormonereleasing IUD could be on its way In June a nonprofit pharmaceutical group in San Francisco   with the global pharmaceutical company Actavis aiming to reduce cost as a barrier to contraception Peipert expects even more invention around IUDs in the future I think were also going to see in the future other alternative devices I think were going to see this market expand he says I think the CHOICE Project has provided good evidence that IUDs are safe effective highly desired and I think were going to see companies coming up with new ideas new IUDs maybe lowercost alternatives
