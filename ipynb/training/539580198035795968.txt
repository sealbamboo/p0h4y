A personal DNA test that has sparked controversy in the US has launched in the UK The UKs Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency MHRA says the andMe spit test which is designed to give details about a persons health risks based on their DNA can be used with caution But critics say it may not be accurate enough to base health decisions on The company Californiabased andMe stands by its test Backed by Google the firm offered US customers details of health risks based on gene variants they carry But in November  the US Food and Drug Administration FDA   from marketing its service in the US claiming andMe had failed to provide adequate information to support the claims it made about results A month later the company stopped offering genetic tests related to health An MHRA spokesperson said it regulated such tests in the UK to make sure they met minimum standards  People who use these products should ensure that they are CE marked and remember that no test is  reliable so think carefully before using personal genome services  If after using the service you have any questions or concerns you should speak to your healthcare professional She added If you are concerned that you have an incorrect result due to a faulty product you can report this to MHRA at aicmhragsigovuk or    The UK Department of Health said it was behind the idea of using gene tests to guide patient care within the NHS but echoed the MHRA advice on giving careful consideration before opting for services like the one offered by andMe  The Alzheimers Society went a step further saying If you are worried about your memory your GP should be the first port of call  not a home DNA testing kit Research has identified a number of genes that may play a role in the development of dementia but we dont know enough to use these as a diagnostic tool andMe chief executive Anne Wojcicki said The UK is a world leader in genomics and we are very excited to offer a product specifically for UK customers  Ms Wojcicki is separated from but still legally married to Sergey Brin the cofounder of Google  which has invested millions in andMe The company had previously offered results on a customers risk for  diseases and conditions including identifying genes linked to heart disease and breast cancer There was also information on how individuals might respond to certain medicines But the FDA said the reliability of such tests had not been proven to its satisfaction It was also worried that some customers could make lifechanging decisions based solely on their results The UK Department of Health said the product launched in Britain was very different to the service halted by the US regulator Many of the drug responses inherited conditions and genetic health risks that were of concern in the US have been removed a spokesperson told BBC News In October andMe said it would sell kits in Canada  these too contain only a handful of healthrelated results I think a large part of it is trying to expand their markets said Professor Hank Greely director of the Center for Law and the Biosciences at Stanford University in California They may also want to make it clear to the public to their investors to their employees that theyre alive and kicking Dr Marcy Darnovsky executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society in California said the UK and Canadian launches could be a way of placing pressure on the FDA by demonstrating that regulators in other countries found no fault with their product Genetic testing is an important medical tool in certain situations but for healthy people as a way to predict common complex diseases its pretty useless she told BBC News Most complex diseases and almost all the common ones  with some exceptions such as the BRCA  and  genes implicated in breast cancer  are multifactorial with many genes and other biological social and environmental causes What happens to the data gathered by andMe also concerns some people Its not entirely clear what their business plan is  whether they want to make money by selling kits to consumers or whether they want to make most of their money by   Prof Greely told BBC News But Ms Wojcicki believes the information provided to customers is empowering andMes mission is to ensure that individuals can personally access understand and benefit from the human genome she said Commenting on the announcement Mark Thomas professor of evolutionary genetics at University College London said For better or worse directtotheconsumer genetic testing companies are here to stay  One could argue the rights and wrongs of such companies existing but I suspect that ship has sailed
