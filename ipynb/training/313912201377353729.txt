A controversial government proposal to test the anthrax vaccine in children would be unethical without first conducting much more research a presidential commission concluded Tuesday The federal government would have to take multiple steps before anthrax vaccine trials with children could be ethically considered   who chairs the   tells Shots It would not be ethical to do it today Health and Human Services Secretary   asked the member commission to review the possible medical experiment after critics raised questions about whether it would be ethical They questioned whether the risks of the testing were necessary given that an anthrax attack may never happen This assignment was one of the most difficult that any bioethics commission has been given Gutmann says  has long been considered one of the most likely weapons a bioterrorist might use Its relatively easy to make and spew over a large area And the toxins produced by anthrax spores can be deadly especially if inhaled We want to make sure were taking care of the kids says   of the Childrens National Medical Center who chaired a   that started   to study the anthrax vaccine in kids The vaccines been given to more than  million adults in the military but no one knows how well it would work in children We want to know what were doing to them Does this really work And how does it work Whats the bodys immune response to it Those are the types of things that we need to glean Fagbuyi says But other experts are skeptical They wonder whether its worth exposing kids to the vaccine for a theoretical risk which means they wont directly benefit So Sebelius asked the commission to vet the proposal There is something to be gained by going ahead with research on children There is a common good to be gained in being prepared Gutmann says But Gutmann says that has to be weighed against an important principle We have a longstanding ethical requirement in this country that children not be used merely as means for the public good Gutmann says So after holding hearings and picking apart the scientific and ethical nuances the commission outlined a series of steps researchers would have to take before any testing on children would be ethical Those steps would have to include research to convincingly show that children would face no more than minimal risk Gutmann defines that as the level that a child routinely encounters in daily life for a medical checkup that poses absolutely no substantial risk or threat to the child In addition to modeling and testing in animals the commission said researchers should first try testing the vaccine in younger adults If that goes OK they might try studying the vaccine on the oldest kids and work their way down very slowly to the youngest Other experts praised the commissions conclusions We can overreact to the threat of bioterrorism and other terrorist attacks says   of Georgetown University When we really dont know whether when or if we will get any kind of an attack it seems to me that we really do need to have very rigorous ethical safeguards Gostin says But those pushing for the testing like Fagbuyi are disappointed Hes worried what might happen if theres an attack while were waiting Parents will be frantic but doctors wont know what to tell them about how well the vaccine works or whether its safe During a time of an emergency when theres enough chaos going on and discord is that the time we really want to be explaining that Well we dont have all the evidence at this time and we could have done this earlier and we did not The Department of Health and Human Services which will make the final decision about whether to move forward with the testing issued a statement saying officials would review the commissions report
