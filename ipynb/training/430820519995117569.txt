The question of how often women should get mammograms remains contested with advisory panels and medical societies disagreeing on how early and how often they should be used to find breast cancer But those discussions rarely mention cost And the financial implications are huge If women got screening mammograms every year starting at age  as the American Cancer Society   it would cost  billion a year according to an   published Monday in   Thats compared with  billion a year to screen women ages  to  every other year or  billion to follow the recommendation of the US Preventive Services Task Force That group calls for biennial mammograms for women between the ages of  and  and screening based on personal risk factors for women under  and over  The difference in price tags  billion or twice the annual budget of the National Cancer Institute the worlds largest funder of cancer research according to an  accompanying the article Those numbers got   thinking that there might be a better way to spend some of those billions Shes a professor of surgery and radiology at the University of California San Francisco and the senior author of the study Here are highlights from our conversation edited for length and clarity I first started looking at this when I was in business school in the s I got interested in looking at the different ways people approach screening in the United States and Europe Theyre really quite different Whats interesting is that everyone is afraid to talk about cost What I realized is that there really is plenty of money in the system to make changes What if I told you OK you can just keep doing what youre doing for breast cancer screening or why dont you come in and well do a comprehensive risk assessment Well look at all the different genetic predispositions well look at your breast density Then Ill assign you an age to start mammograms and the frequency of screening and well put this all in a big database and well learn as we go and well change your recommendations based on what we learn Were starting at the end of the year in University of California Health Systems hospitals Were trying to put all the work flow in place Im actually trying to to fund it by using the money thats in the system Well have to raise some startup costs but it is clear that if you do this at the end of five years its costsaving even putting all the money into doing the tests and the profiling and the counseling Youd make changes in treatment that would make it costsaving Thats what personalized medicine is all about We need to figure out how to do more when its needed and less where more only adds a burden and morbidity I am actually inviting them to help me study this riskbased screening approach These are the questions we all want to answer I think we all can agree on that Even without the numbers in my paper The weight of the evidence suggests that unless youre particularly highrisk screening every other year is OK Not everyone agrees But there are implications to that For any given person its not a lot of money But if you screen  million women its a huge amount of money I think we need to think about health care a little bit differently With our clinical care dollars at least  percent of everything we spend should be invested in research and development just like any innovative company We should be looking at opportunities to improve what we do And we should be looking for ways to use our resources better
