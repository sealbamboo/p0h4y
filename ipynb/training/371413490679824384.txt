Organizers of the   called off their million competition Thursday just two weeks before teams were set to begin work on  highquality human genome sequences in  days at a cost of less than  per genome Writing in the   XPrize Chief Executive Peter Diamandis said that the decision was an acknowledgment that the field of genetics didnt need the extra push of a prize competition to get inventors and scientists working on better more affordable genome sequencing technologies Genome sequencing technology is plummeting in cost and increasing in speed independent of our competition Diamandis wrote Today companies can do this for less than  per genome in a few days or less  and are moving quickly towards the goals we set for the prize For this reason we have decided to cancel an XPrize for the first time ever Harvard Medical School geneticist   a leader of one of the two teams that were planning to compete called the decision strange Everything was ready to go Church told the Los Angeles Times There was nothing left for the teams to do and nothing left for the prize to do but to have the competition  Its mindboggling to me The Archon Genomics XPrize was announced in  three years after scientists sequenced the first complete human genome  Teams in the competition would have to sequence the DNA of  people who had lived to be   quickly accurately and inexpensively  and scientists would then be able to mine the sequenced genomes to look for rare genes that protect against disease or promote health and longevity Organizers of the competition already had their DNA from  centenarians they had also developed a software system to check the accuracy of the genome sequences the teams produced But in recent months some began to question whether holding the competition would square with the prize foundations mission to encourage scientific work that otherwise couldnt get support Having only two teams sign up to compete was seen by some as a tepid showing and a sign that the contest might be   In  senior prize director Grant Campany said it cost more than  million and took  months to sequence one complete genome  Today he said companies can get the job done in a fraction of the time and for prices around  We began to reassess Is there really a role for XPrize in this space he said We concluded the market itself provides  million is not incentivizing anything that the market isnt at this point Church said he found that reasoning hard to understand  especially so late in the game I think they underestimate how big an impact they had in dangling  million in front of a group like ours where that amount of money is a big deal he said Why call off the World Series when theres no rain and everybodys healthy and the stadium is full of people Campany said work wouldnt end with the cancellation of this particular contest The foundation is talking with partners to go ahead and sequence the centenarians DNA and make it public There are also plans to make broader use of the validation software the contest devised he added In the meantime the prize foundations     and   are ongoing ALSO
