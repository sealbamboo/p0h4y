A good nights sleep is rare for Judy and James Lee They are on parenting duty  for their son Justin Justin who has cerebral palsy and was born missing parts of his brain also has a seizure disorder which has gotten worse lately Hes often silent during his seizures which means he has to sleep with his parents so they can tell when he needs help Judy says caring for Justin is a lot like taking care of a newborn Youre in that kind of survival mode those first few months where your babys schedule is your schedule And you sleep when they sleep and you eat when they eat And all your focus and attention is on them she says Except Justin is not a baby He just turned  and weighs  pounds He cant talk he cant walk and hell always require aroundtheclock care Like the estimated  million people in the US taking care of their specialneeds kids Judys days largely consist of making sure Justins needs are met He receives music therapy occupational therapy and tutoring He also gets physical therapy and though some may question what effect it may have James and Judy believe its about giving Justin the best life they possibly can While physically we know he has so many restrictions my hope is that cognitively hes able to express what he knows express his needs and his wants  especially as we get older and other people will be naturally having to care for him Judy says The Sacramento Calif couple knows that day is coming As far as they know Justin has a normal lifespan Theyre both in their s and have no other children James says its something he thinks about often Im sure theres going to come a time when were going to need to be cared for ourselves so theres going to be three of us in here all needing some sort of care I dont know whats going to happen then James says I really dont know Juno Duenas executive director of Support for Families of Children with Disabilities says that as parents age its important to get a support system in place for the child One technique weve used here is to bring the community together that knows that youth and have a discussion about So what are we going to do in the future  Duenas says The faith community is a major source of support for James and Judy Lee Every Sunday the family attends Mass at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Sacramento James welcomes peoples empathy but he rejects their pity He recalled a man at a support group once asking him if he hated God because of Justins disability I said No Im actually thankful that he chose us to take care of Justin  he says It was faith that helped Judy get through her initial grief and accept Justins diagnosis Through prayer Ive been given just the grace and the strength to meet those challenges and to see the positive because there are so many positives Judy says I mean Justins a great kid Hes sweet Hes loving I cant help but be happy being his mom The Lees also know theyre fortunate compared with other families in their situation James and Judy have flexible work schedules enough money to buy Justin the ramps and wheelchairs he needs and each other to lean on They also receive some state help from the InHome Supportive Services program which pays Judy about  an hour to provide care for Justin They hope this will all be enough to care for their son for many years to come
