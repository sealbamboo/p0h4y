The US surgeon general says about  Americans   as a result of smoking But a new analysis suggests the true figure may be closer to  The  causes of death that have been officially blamed on smoking accounted for  of the actual deaths among smokers who were tracked in a   published in Thursdays edition of the New England Journal of Medicine Researchers from the American Cancer Society the National Cancer Institute and elsewhere combined data from five large ongoing health studies the   the   the   the   and the   The researchers included  men and women who were being tracked as of Jan   and who had told interviewers about their smoking status Between  and    of the  smokers died as did   of the  former smokers and   of the  people who had never smoked according to the study Smokers were more likely than nonsmokers to have died from one of the established smokingrelated diseases the researchers found These included most kinds of heart disease stroke chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pneumonia influenza and tuberculosis atherosclerosis aortic aneurysms and other arterial diseases diabetes acute myeloid leukemia and cancers of the lung pancreas colon and rectum kidney liver bladder larynx lip and oral cavity stomach and esophagus These diseases were responsible for the overwhelming majority of deaths among men and women who were still smoking at the end of their lives But not all of them Another  of deaths among female smokers and  of the deaths of male smokers were traced to other causes In nearly every case the diseases in this second group were more likely to kill current smokers than nonsmokers according to the study For instance female smokers were  more likely to die of breast cancer than their nonsmoking counterparts and men who smoked were  more likely to die of prostate cancer than their nonsmoking peers Rare cancers were  more likely to kill men if they were smokers the researchers found The risk of death due to infections was more than twice as high for smokers than for nonsmokers Ditto for hypertension hypertensive renal disease and a range of digestive diseases Smokers were  to  times more likely than nonsmokers to die of liver cirrhosis and  to  times more likely to die of kidney failure Hypertensive heart disease some kinds of respiratory diseases and ischemic disorders of the intestines were also more likely to kill smokers than nonsmokers the study authors calculated The more cigarettes a person smoked per day the greater his or her risk of dying from infections breast cancer or kidney failure Among those who quit the longer it had been since the last cigarette the lower the risk of dying from infections or breast cancer according to the report The researchers laid out the biological mechanisms that could plausibly explain why some of these diseases would be more likely to kill smokers In the case of infections for example cigarette smoke is known to hinder immune function Smoking is also known to reduce blood flow to the intestines potentially explaining the link to intestinal and digestive diseases Compared to the US population as a whole the people included in this study were more likely to be white and to be highly educated That limits researchers ability to generalize the findings to the entire country Still the study authors didnt hesitate to say that the   should go back and check the math Our results suggest that the number of persons in the United States who die each year as a result of smoking cigarettes may be substantially greater than currently estimated they wrote
