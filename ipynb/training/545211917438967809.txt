Inaccuracies in a hospitals cancer waiting times figures were caused by managerial incompetence rather than bullying of staff investigators found An inquiry into Colchester Hospital in Essex found evidence of suboptimal care but nothing to suggest systematic data manipulation A separate review found evidence of serious managerial failures The hospitals chief executive apologised to patients who received poor care or delayed treatment I am very pleased there appears to be no evidence of systematic data manipulation at the trust said Dr Lucy Moore It is important that we now rebuild confidence in the cancer services provided here in Colchester Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust was placed in special measures in November  after inspectors from the Care Quality Commission CQC raised serious concerns about staff coming under pressure from managers to manipulate cancer waiting times in order to meet government targets The trust conducted a retrospective review of  cancer patients cases who were treated between  and  following the CQCs report It found  cases of possible deliberate and inappropriate data entry but reviewers did not find a deliberate intent to falsify figures Evidence of poor documentation and record keeping was uncovered as well as a number of patients who experienced suboptimal care diagnosis or treatment The report said it was impossible to establish the extent to which patients suffered as a result but there was clear evidence of harm to at least one patient The East of England Strategic Clinical Network which reviewed the report said there was evidence of inaccuracies in the cancer waits data but this was as likely to negatively affect the trusts performance as it was to enhance it This suggested the issue was one of effectiveness and competence in the cancer management team rather than a deliberate manipulation the network said A separate but related inquiry was led by former Anglia Cancer Network chair Carole TaylorBrown and former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of England Prof Pat Troop The report was overseen by health regulator Monitor It found evidence of poor governance and poor knowledge of whistleblowing policies  By Julian Sturdy BBC East investigations editor After a torrid year at Colchester Hospital the allegations of bullying and falsifying cancer records are finally dismissed The inquiries have been timeconsuming and demoralising but now the hospital can start to concentrating on patient care The task ahead is enormous morale in some departments is low theres a shortage of staff high employee turnover and just last month inspectors found staff talking abruptly to patients failing to treat them with dignity Managers still need to get a grip   Its financial fortunes are also grim It has gone from a surplus last year to a m deficit this financial year But fixing the money would mean cancelling operations delaying clinics and freezing recruitment It needs a clean slate to get through this winter Patients have suffered from negligence in the past This is Colchesters chance to start again A chance to change the culture and finally put people first But it stated At no time were individuals instructed or bullied to amend cancer or any other data inappropriately by any senior manager  There was criticism of the way former Finance Director Mike Baker supported by former Workforce Director Rob Bowman carried out an original investigation into the allegations in    Mr Baker resigned when the CQC revealed the allegations  He told the BBC last December I was planning to retire and when I read the report I decided to bring it forward and I resigned I feel I let my people down Those who conducted the inquiry were told a new validation process was introduced to the cancer service in  When one of the team members began to notice changes to the data  which they believed were incorrect  they raised concerns with senior managers including associate director of the cancer department Mark JarmanHowe who believed the data was correct  An investigation into the concerns began in February  which has been described as flawed and mismanaged The report said Mr JarmanHowes decisions about how to validate data were out of step with his colleagues understanding of Cancer Waiting Time Guidance Mr JarmanHowe left the trust in  Cancer services manager at Colchester Hospital Rachael West was suspended on full pay in November last year while the allegations were investigated Both Ms West and Mr JarmanHowe along with other senior manages were cleared of any bullying and harassment and deliberately manipulating data Dr Moore told the BBC that Ms Wests future at the trust would be discussed in light of the report The trusts Chairman Peter Wilson said although no evidence was found of a systematic culture of bullying the issue is taken very seriously Adam Cayley regional director at Monitor said Todays report should bring a very difficult chapter in the history of this trust to a close  It is reassuring to find that there is no evidence of staff being bullied into changing cancer data but it is even clearer that there were serious managerial failures at the trust The new management team at the hospital is already delivering improvements for patients  a process we expect to see continue he said
