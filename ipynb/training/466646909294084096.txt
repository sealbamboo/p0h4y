Oh to be a lucid dreamer To be fast asleep at  am and then realize Im in a dream I can walk up these stairs jump off the porch and start flying Why not Its a dream Lucid dreams have lit up the big screen in movies such as   and   But the ability to control dreams the hallmark of lucid dreams is quite rare in real life Now German neuroscientists have taken a step toward giving this elusive power to some runofthe mill dreamers Small electrical pulses during sleep make some people feel as though they can manipulate their dreams a team from Goethe University Frankfurt and the University of Goettingen   Sunday The short shocks which are barely perceptible also make some sleepers more aware theyre dreaming and feel more like theyre watching their dreams as outsiders the scientists wrote in the journal   People normally take their dreams as reality while theyre sleeping says neurologist   at Goethe University Frankfurt who contributed to the study Lucid dreamers view their dreams like a movie You know its a dream and you change it in certain instances You put the dream in a dimension other than reality Nitsche and his teams technique is still far away from giving people  like powers to climb walls woo beautiful suitors or fight armies But he hopes a similar method may one day help treat mental disorders such as schizophrenia and posttraumatic stress disorder Dreams can be really terrorizing for patients with PTSD Nitsche tells Shots If it would be possible to induce lucid dreaming with these patients maybe it would reduce their suffering Previous studies have found that lucid dreams occur during REM sleep  the time of the night when dreams are most memorable At this point lucid dreamers show extra activity in the front part of the brain Specifically a distinct signal shows up on an EEG during lucid dreams  an electrical wave at  hertz or  cycles a second coming from the prefrontal cortex So Nitsche and his colleagues wondered what would happen if they enhanced this brain regions activity in regular dreamers They got  volunteers to come to the lab and sleep through the night They stuck  electrodes on their skulls and waited until the subjects showed signs of REM sleep Then we started electrical stimulation for  seconds Nitsche says We woke them up and asked them what they were dreaming The volunteers also filled out a survey that measures how lucid a dream is  how much people feel in control of their dreams and how much they realize theyre dreaming Nitsche and his team repeated the experiment with eight different electrical shocks from  hertz to  hertz Guess which one triggered the most control and awareness of dreams Electrical waves that match those observed in spontaneous lucid dreamers  hertz There was a large clear effect in some subjects Nitsche says The most enhanced aspect was dissociation People really became aware that they were dreaming Control of the dreams was also enhanced but a bit lower Its a really exciting study and I think its important says   a psychologist at Harvard Medical School and author of the book   Still shes not convinced that the technique is actually inducing fullfledged lucid dreaming The stimulation is doing something in that direction  Barrett tells Shots But a real lucid dream is rare and usually very dramatic Its like a light bulb  So if they Nitsche and his colleagues were going for clearly defined lucid dreams they would have gotten a much lower response rate The researchers also didnt use the gold standard for measuring lucid dreaming Barrett says In previous studies subjects are asked to give a prearranged signal with their eyes when theyre dreams become lucid she says Thats a much stricter criteria than the rating scales used in the current study Furthermore this electrical stimulation technique isnt the first tool for enhancing lucid dreaming Barrett points out Back in the s psychologist Stephen LaBerge created a pair of goggles back to help trigger lucid dreams And there have been psychological tools for decades that can increase the odds of having one of these dreams The studies on these techniques used a much higher bar for what theyre calling lucidity Barrett says But then again lucidity is necessary to assume control of dreams she says People can change recurring nightmares by just imagining a positive outcome while youre awake They can also learn to problem solve in dreams  Our natural dreaming is very creative and really useful
