Recently someone dear to me received the diagnosis of dementia and Ive been grappling with the frustrations of helping her adapt What kinds of activities are available to help someone with dementia remain engaged and active in the community  Which professionals can comprehensively assess a familys situation and suggest solutions Who can help caregivers when a loved one whos cognitively challenged and depressed meets every suggestion with apathy or resistance Good luck getting guidance You are on your own to figure out what is needed and how to put a plan together in a meaningful way said   professor of community public health and director of the Center for Innovative Care in Aging at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore It is a huge challenge Dr Gitlin is an expert on   for people with Alzheimers disease and the originator of   which will be offered through Coursera for five weeks starting in midOctober You can sign up now Whats a MOOC you may wonder   Its   usually to anyone in the world who wants to sign up Instead of sitting in classrooms students watch video lectures and often participate in online chat rooms  Some of them take MOOCs seriously doing recommended reading and completing suggested assignments  But more than  percent dip in and out at their discretion or drop out altogether The course offered by Dr Gitlin and her collaborator   an assistant professor at the School of Nursing at Johns Hopkins is free to anyone who wants to enroll   Dr Gitlin and Ms Hodgson expect about  people worldwide to do so reflecting the concern internationally over Alzheimers  I plan to take the course  Though my father had Alzheimers and two uncles had either Alzheimers or vascular dementia years ago doctors often didnt bother to distinguish between these types of dementia theres much left for me to learn about ways to interact with people with these conditions The point is to help people understand Alzheimers disease from a comprehensive perspective that encompasses not only its medical implications but social psychological and environmental considerations Dr Gitlin told me in an interview   Shes especially focused on what she calls the lived experience of people with dementia   Caregivers and professionals need to know about the different stages of this disease and how a person is functioning during these stages in their home their family and their community she said  Only then does it become possible to develop a supportive environment that allows the person to use the capabilities he or she still has  Thats what personcentered care is all about  Instead of dwelling on the losses suffered by someone with dementia  the things they cant do any longer the ways in which they are diminished  it means appreciating that a persons sense of dignity of purpose of needing and wanting a role remains intact almost to the very end Dr Gitlin said We often forget this because people with dementia often arent able to express it    Recognizing that people wont sit through long online lectures Dr Gitlin and Ms Hodgson have broken each class into  or minute segments  Some will be Oprah Winfreystyle sessions with one of the doctors questioning a colleague from Johns Hopkins with expertise in a subject area  including Dr Peter V Rabins an author of   He will talk about assessing caregivers needs in the second week of the course beginning Oct  Week  might be especially interesting to caregivers who arent sure how to deal with Alzheimers patients who are agitated aggressive apathetic irritable delusional disruptive or emotionally distraught  Dr Gitlin is developing   and participated in writing an important paper on this topic published in JAMA late last year  Homework assignments will ask students to explore dementia trends in their region and evaluate case studies  Before the course students will be asked to take a mythbuster test to confront and correct whatever biases they might have about dementia Ms Hodgson said  After the course Johns Hopkins will offer a series of Webbased seminars to caregivers and health professionals following up in more detail on the issues raised  Potential topics  include safety in the home activities for people with dementia and endoflife care This effort to educate a worldwide audience about Alzheimers and other types of dementia is worth watching  Please let us know here if you learn about any similar efforts that might be of interest
