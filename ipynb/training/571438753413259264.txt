The cones in our retinas  the fine layer of nerve tissue that lines the back of our eyes  detect the blue green and red in an image The cones and your brain mix those colors to make other colors Ninetynine percent of the time well see the same colors Haller says But the picture of this dress seems to have tints that hit the sweet spot thats confusing to a lot of people  The very top section of the dress appears gold to some people but black to others This makes sense to Haller  One of the typical color confusions we see is blueyellow she says So perhaps in this dress the black has a bit of blue and the gold has a bit of yellow  As retinal specialists met Friday in Scottsdale Arizona at the annual meeting of the Macula Society they swapped theories about why peoples cones and brains process the dresss colors so differently  One theory has to do with evolutionary biology Primates including humans have developed an excellent sense of color so were able to for example distinguish the yellow fruit hanging on the green tree  To determine the color of that fruit its often necessary to factor out colors in the light around it that might give the fruit a different and misleading tint There are likely slight variations in how our brains do this automatic filtering  Your brain is constantly estimating the color of the light thats falling on the object and factoring that light out said Wallace Thoreson a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center Each of us makes slightly different unconscious assumptions  Haller said the Macula Societys meeting was totally derailed by the dress as doctors skipped sessions to stand out in the hallway and compare each others color judgments  Some of them even think the dress could possibly help advance medical science and hopefully help people with vision problems  Dr Emily Chew an ophthalmologist at the National Institutes of Health said in more than thirty years of research shes never seen an image where people all with normal vision have had such dramatically different responses  It would be interesting to use this image to learn more about the pathways of how we understand color said Chew the deputy director of the division of epidemiology and clinical applications at the National Eye Institute  She said it was impressive how crowd sourcing identified the dress   It would be really hard to create this image she said Its serendipitous Ive never seen anything like this Its really unbelievable
