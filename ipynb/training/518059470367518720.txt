Often that means he runs Running is how Mr Samuelsson clears his mind mulls over projects and thinks up new recipes It is a process that has apparently served him well Mr Samuelsson who was born in Ethiopia and raised in Sweden rose to fame in the food world as the   He is a bestselling author winner of the show Top Chef Masters and owner of the Harlem restaurant Red Rooster Mr Samuelssons latest project is a new cookbook  The book is a collection of recipes  many of them inspired by his travels across America  that he uses in his own kitchen where he cooks for his wife friends and family Recently I caught up with Mr Samuelsson in Harlem where we talked about his approach to food and health Mr Samuelsson let me tag along on one of his workouts in Marcus Garvey Park then whipped up a recipe from his new book quinoa with broccoli cauliflower and toasted coconut Here are edited excerpts from our conversation along with   for his quinoa dish which was both healthy and tasty As a busy chef whose career revolves around food are there any things you do to stay healthy My goal every week which I never get to is to play soccer with my buddies on Saturday Ideally I would love to get some tennis in too Very rarely do I get to do that But one thing that I know I can do is I can run in the park If I have to get up at  to do it or at  to do it I do it So I end up doing three to four days a week of running and then if I can get a couple of pushups and stuff like that in then great I work out mostly for my back because as a chef your body breaks down Most chefs that I know have pain somewhere in their hands or in their feet or in their back So these are areas for me that I make sure Im moving constantly What is your routine like The park that I work out in is sort of an outdoor gym I always make sure that I do situps and pushups but I also make sure I bend my knees properly a bunch of times and run the stairs Ive been cooking all my life and when I wake up my back hurts a little bit Yet Im better off than most chefs that I know because Ive been working out for a long time Back exercises are important movements for your knees carrying things in the kitchen the right way But more than anything exercise is good for my mind and my spirit How does it affect your mental wellbeing Health is something for me that is important not only for my weight but also for my state of mind When I run thats when I think about recipes Its one of the few times that Im completely by myself Thats where I have time to think about a staff move what to do what not to do and I can think stuff through As busy as the world around me can be when Im running Im completely in the zone Im thinking about my day my family my wife my mother or my daughter So I need that exercise Its the state of mind and being in that space that I need Are you a good runner I feel like Im a pretty good runner But when Im in Ethiopia Im the worst runner in the world So its all relative to where you are But the one thing I always get from running is clarity You have an app   which teaches parents how to cook with their children Why was that important for you I grew up learning to cook from my grandmother I didnt know as a yearold how fortunate I was It informed every decision in terms of food for the rest of my life Im not saying everyone should be an executive chef But if you know how to cook you can always invite people over you can always take care of yourself you can always eat great and youll save money I think that the better we are informed about food as children and as adults the better the choices were going to make Obesity is not something that just landed on top of us here Its something we can work on as families and beat One of my favorite sections in my new book is cooking for kids I love that  teaching the next generation and inspiring better eating Tell us about your new book  is really a labor of love that Ive been working on for a long time It goes back to opening up this restaurant in Harlem I wanted to do food that people here are familiar with and I knew that the heart of this food and this restaurant would be inspired home cooking which is very different from what Ive done the other  years of my cooking career A lot of the restaurants dishes started in my wifes and my kitchen Home cooking has always been very central to me In the book you talk about the food you cook at home but you also explore different food trends around the country The book looks at what American food is today What are the trends but also what are the challenges that we face We throw away  percent of all of our food If we knew how to cook more maybe we could reduce that number down to  percent So the book deals with leftovers it deals with celebrations and the holidays and it deals with just delicious food Youve written several books including a memoir What do you enjoy most about the process What I love about doing a book is that about two months after it comes out the readers start contacting you Hey we celebrated our kids th birthday and we used your book And at the book signings people come up to you with messy books with grease on them and they say Can you please sign it I love that That means that you used it For me this is not a book that youre just going to put on the shelf This is something you use and cook with every day And thats something I love about doing a book Whats your favorite recipe from the new book Its really the quinoa recipe Its a good window into the flavor profile that I like and its healthy Its a rice dish at heart which is very simple But we tweak it just a little bit and its a new dish And I love that  Food is not that hard to make once youve been exposed to it Its like a language When you can speak one language its not so hard to learn a second language And if you speak two languages its easier to learn a third Theres a vocabulary that youre building on Its the same with cooking If you dont know how to make a good pot of rice quinoa is so far away from you Its just a clumsy word What was the inspiration for this dish I wanted to do a recipe thats easy and healthy So I did a little bit of quinoa with cauliflower and broccoli I spiced it up with some coconut milk and some toasted coconut Its quick and you could say its trendy I love things that are old but also trendy like Harlem Quinoa is  years old but its very popular right now Its not the new kale yet But it might be the new kale
