When a stranger can gain access to someones entire genetic code by picking up a used coffee cup it presents a whole new thicket of concerns about privacy and security Actually were already there though were still in the early stages of whats shaping up after all the years of hype as a genuine revolution Just take a look at Rob Steins recent   to see how far weve come and where were headed A sample of saliva taken from a coffee cup or a Qtip is enough for technicians to reveal someones genes for better and for worse Reuters Sharon Begley   EasyDNA a California company thats already doing ancestry health and paternity testing on samples ranging from cigarette butts to licked stamps Against that backdrop the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues just released recommendations on how the country should proceed along the genomic path Yes whole genome sequencing may help refine diagnosis and treatment though there are still   to overcome before thats commonplace Between now and then safeguards are needed before whole genome sequencing becomes widespread the commission says In a letter to President Obama the commission chairs say the group recommends strong baseline protections for whole genome sequence data to protect individual privacy and data security while also leaving ample room for data sharing opportunities that propel scientific and medical progress Some specific ideas from the commission Socalled   are quite common when radiologists scan patients Since everyone has genetic mutations the whole genome sequences are bound to find something quirky on everyone When obtaining your consent the researchers doctors or commercial genome sequencers need to explain when and how theyll tell you about those findings
