When a stranger can gain access to someone's entire genetic code by picking up a used coffee cup, it presents a whole new thicket of concerns about privacy and security.. Actually, we're already there, though we're still in the early stages of what's shaping up, after all the years of hype, as a genuine revolution. Just take a look at Rob Stein's recent .  to see how far we've come and where we're headed.. A sample of saliva taken from a coffee cup or a Q-tip is enough for technicians to reveal someone's genes, for better and for worse. Reuters' Sharon Begley .  EasyDNA, a California company, that's already doing ancestry, health and paternity testing on samples ranging from cigarette butts to licked stamps.. Against that backdrop, the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues just released recommendations on how the country should proceed along the genomic path.. Yes, whole genome sequencing may help refine diagnosis and treatment, though there are still .  to overcome before that's commonplace.. Between now and then, safeguards are needed before whole genome sequencing becomes widespread, the commission says. In a letter to President Obama, the commission chairs say the group, "recommends strong baseline protections for whole genome sequence data to protect individual privacy and data security while also leaving ample room for data sharing opportunities that propel scientific and medical progress.". Some specific ideas from the commission:. So-called .  are quite common when radiologists scan patients. Since everyone has genetic mutations, the whole genome sequences are bound to find something quirky on everyone. When obtaining your consent, the researchers, doctors or commercial genome sequencers need to explain when and how they'll tell you about those findings.
