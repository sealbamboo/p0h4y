There are lies damn lies  and the lies that we tell for the sake of others when we are under the influence of oxytocin Researchers found that after a squirt of the socalled love hormone volunteers lied more readily about their results in a game in order to benefit their team Compared with control subjects who were given a placebo those on oxytocin told more extreme lies and told them with less hesitation according to   published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Oxytocin is a brain hormone that is probably best known for its role in helping mothers bond with their newborns In recent years scientists have been examining its role in monogamy and in strengthening trust and empathy in social groups Sometimes doing whats good for the group requires lying Think of parents who fake their addresses to get their kids into a better school A pair of researchers from BenGurion University of the Negev in Israel and the University of Amsterdam figured that oxytocin would play a role in this type of behavior so they set up a series of experiments to test their hypothesis The researchers designed a simple computer game that asked players to predict whether a virtual coin toss would wind up heads or tails After seeing the outcome on a computer screen players were asked to report whether their prediction was correct or not In some cases making the right prediction would earn a players team a small payment the equivalent of about  cents In other cases a correct prediction would cost the team the same amount and sometimes there was no payoff or cost In the first round  healthy men sprayed either a small dose of oxytocin or a placebo into their noses  minutes before playing the game As expected men in both groups cheated  but the men who had taken the oxytocin cheated more By definition anyones cointoss predictions should be correct  of the time on average But the players on oxytocin said they made the right prediction  of the time as did  of the players on the placebo Whats more players on the hormone reported on the accuracy of their predictions in an average of  seconds That was significantly faster than the players on the placebo who took  seconds to decide what to tell the researchers Apparently the decision to lie to benefit the group required less deliberation than the decision to tell a selfserving lie In cases where correct predictions led to either no gain or a loss oxytocin didnt seem to induce players to lie any more than they would have otherwise the researchers found In the next round of the experiment the rules of the game were basically the same except that the gains and losses were kept by the players not shared with a team In that case there was no difference in lying truthtelling or response time based on whether players got oxytocin or the placebo The study authors interpreted that as evidence that oxytocin influences only group dynamics not individual behavior The researchers paid special attention to cases of extreme lying  players who said nine of their  predictions were correct In truth people should do that well only  of the time But in the game  of the men who got oxytocin said they went nine for  when they were playing for a team Not only was that higher than the  of men who told the same whopper after getting the placebo it was also higher than the  of men who told that lie under the influence of oxytocin when they were playing only for themselves When dishonesty serves group interests oxytocin increased lying as well as extreme lying the researchers concluded When lying served personal selfinterests only oxytocin had no effects    and like   on Facebook
