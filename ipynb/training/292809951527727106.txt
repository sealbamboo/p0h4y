 If butter cheese and creamy dressings are constantly calling your name your genes could be to blame Research published in the journal   says that a humans preference for fat come down to a variation in a single gene In a study of  AfricanAmerican adults researchers concluded that a certain variant of the CD gene causes people to be more sensitive to the taste of fat than people who have a different form of the gene About  percent of the population is believed to have the fattasting variation In the study researchers gave participants salad dressings with varying amounts of fatty canola oils Then participants were asked to rate their perceptions of the dressings oiliness fat content and creaminess along with how much they liked certain   such as sour cream mayonnaise bacon and French fries When researchers correlated participants with certain forms of the gene CD they found that the participants who had the AA form of the gene were more sensitive to the fat in foods They also found that participants with the AA form of CD liked fatty foods more than those who had other forms of the gene It is possible that the CD gene is associated with fat intake and therefore obesity through a mechanism of oral fat perception and preference Kathleen Keller an assistant professor of nutritional sciences at Penn State University and study researcher wrote in the study In other words our results suggest that people with certain forms of the CD gene may find fat creamier and more enjoyable than others This may increase their risk for   and other health problems The research of Keller and her team comes only weeks after a similar analysis was presented in the   In this study researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis became the first to identify CD as a human receptor that can taste fat In fact researchers in the Washington University study found that people with the gene were eight times more sensitive to the presence of fat in foods
