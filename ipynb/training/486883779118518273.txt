 is a synthetic   which is a hormone thats naturally produced in a womans body It regulates ovulation The hormone causes changes to the uterine lining and mucus in the cervix which makes it harder for sperm to reach the uterus therefore making it more difficult to conceive Because it strengthens the uterine lining it helps cut down on heavy bleeding  Levonorgestrel is also the hormone used in the   contraceptive better known as the morning after pill In this study Finnish researchers from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Hyvink Hospital in Hyvink Finland wanted to examine the association between premenopausal use of the LNGIUS and cancer rates especially when it came to  cancer of the uterine wall The study followed more than  Finnish women between the ages of  and   All of the subjects were using the hormonereleasing IUD to treat their heavy periods from  to  At that time up to  of all LNGIUSs sold in Finland were used for heavy periods and not for contraception  Investigators found that over time the device did not significantly raise the risk of uterine cancer or ovarian pancreatic and lung cancers But researchers did see a spike in the number of breast cancer cases especially in women between the ages of  compared to women in the general population who were not using this particular IUD The number of diagnosed new breast cancer cases among Finnish women who used LNGIUS for menorrhagia was  higher than in Finnish general population said Dr Tuuli Soini the lead author of the study  However the research does not say that this type of IUD causes breast cancer Soini also adds one limitation of our study was that women suffering from heavy menstruation may in fact represent a selected group of women who may have other risk factors for cancer such as factors related to lifestyle genetic factors just to name a few  According to Soini this study is the first linking premenopausal LNGIUS use and breast cancer  Two earlier studies did not reveal an increased cancer risk according to the study For physicians this research is a new piece of information they can pass on to those patients  Its a great reminder that we need to weigh the benefits of some of these methods against the risks said   director of Comprehensive Womens Health in Silver Spring Maryland We need to educate our patients because many of these therapies may work but some could have serious side effects Women need to be told Then its up to the patient along with a doctors guidance to make the decision The study authors agree  LNGIUS use seemed to protect against endometrial cancer which is a common cancer type steadily increasing in the population said Soini We are still convinced LNGIUS is the best treatment modality for heavy menstrual bleeding a common health problem affecting the quality of life of a large proportion of female population overall We certainly hesitate to recommend any change of the clinical menorrhagia management guidelines  Soini also stressed However health benefits and health risks should be carefully taken into account while counseling menorrhagia patients in relation to any hormonal or surgical therapy
