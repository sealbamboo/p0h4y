I come in with yogurt or a granola bar If I dont take the time to bring a snack Ill be tempted to fill the craving in another way like running to the bakery for a cupcake     If your coworker breaks out a bag of mini candy bars ask yourself Am I going to feel better if I have one This makes you get into the habit of saying no and then saying yes only if you really want it If you ask yourself that question you realize that you can say no and move on        After dinner I always clean up the kitchen and turn off the lights I was a huge nighttime snacker before I lost the weight  cookies ice cream you name it Seeing that light off is a stop sign signaling that Im done for the evening the kitchen is closed    I make my house a safe zone I dont bring home any food that will be tempting I also make it easy on myself As soon as I bring groceries home I immediately cut up fruit so it is readily available     I bought  big glass pickling jars with gaskets for all of my dry goods So when I go to make meals I can see my lentils my blackeyed peas my wasabi peas my nuts Having those good ingredients right there ready to go really does keep you from preparing something bad for you      I start in the produce section shopping the perimeter of the store first gives me a nice layer of healthful food in my cart Then Im so inspired by whats already there Im less likely to add something thats junky Its a mental game    I try to never bring my husband and kids to the grocery store with me If we all go together theyll put a bunch of crap in the cart       I used to sample all the desserts at parties and social events but now I practice the rule of one If I want a smallsize cake or cookie I let myself have one so Im not deprived Youre forcing yourself to make a conscious choice    If Im going to a party I always eat something at home  a salad or a skinny crostini made with Wasa bread tomatoes feta cheese and olives  because you never know when theyre going to serve the food It could be  oclock at night    I look at every social event like its just another meal  not a treat meal I think to myself If I wouldnt eat it in my own house I dont eat it outside the home      Its all in choosing the right spot All my girlfriends know that I have a list of my favorite restaurants in my area with nutritious options Even if its a new place though theres really no excuse anymore because you have access to resources at all times You can search online check out the menu and figure out what youre going to order before you even walk in the door    The first thing I do is scan what the  la carte vegetables are and order some for the table People often forget to look at vegetable sides and consider them as appetizer options Ill choose roasted Brussels sprouts or grilled asparagus so we have something healthy to nibble on while we decide what were going to order for dinner      At night I often want something to nosh on so I make trail mix I spray airpopped popcorn with cooking spray and add lowsodium sea salt dried cranberries wasabi peas a couple of baby pretzels and a few MMs Its only  calories If I can have MMs each day I wont lose my mind    If I really want something before I go to sleep I pour myself a cup of chocolateflavored almond milk from Trader Joes It tastes fantastic and its a smart snack because it has a protein kick to make you feel full    For an evening snack I make a sundae out of Greek yogurt walnuts a chopped banana and maybe a few darkchocolate chips It feels indulgent
