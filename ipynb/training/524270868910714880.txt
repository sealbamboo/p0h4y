Getting an eye exam typically involves big complicated machines But eye doctors are trying to get the big and complicated out of the equation by using smartphones and tablets instead That way they figure eye exams can be done just about anywhere  even a village in Nepal Thats where   and his colleagues are using iPads to test people for   a disease that often has no symptoms until it has irreversibly damaged eyesight Thats because it nibbles away at vision at the periphery of the visual field Finding that out usually involves sitting in front of a big machine and staring at a screen while gray dots appear and disappear Instead Johnson tested an offtheshelf free app called   to screen about  patients in Nepal I was skeptical at first we did some tests and calibrated it The app was very good at identifying people with moderate to severe disease less so at screening out people with normal vision It works much better than I expected Johnson who specializes in developing diagnostic tests told Shots He and his colleagues are now expanding the tests to India with the aim of refining it I know I can make it better Johnson presented his data Monday at the meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology in Chicago and he was far from the only one tinkering with mobile tech A number of researchers presented devices that clip onto iPhones to turn them into diagnostic tools Dr David Myung chief resident at Stanford University Hospital wanted to come up with an easy way to photograph an eye inside and out A big ophthalmology practice would have a machine that does that beautifully but it costs tens of thousands of dollars and requires specialized training Myung wanted something that a harried ER doctor or nurse could use on the fly We wanted to find a lowtech way to do it Myung told Shots So he and his colleagues came up with a plastic arm that snaps onto an iPhone holding an ophthalmology lens in front of the camera at just the right distance The plastic arm is about as lowcost as it gets To get around the fact that the photographer isnt an ophthalmologist its designed so that people take videos or multiple photos Its a little like trying to take pictures of your kids and theyre moving around all the time If you take  or  photos one of them going to be in focus The gizmo is also being tested to see if it can reliably screen people at a public hospital for   and Myung and colleagues are applying for FDA approval since its a medical device We originally developed this for ophthalmology work in developing countries Myung says People do have smartphones and digital capability We think it could be very useful there And maybe closer to home too Since the goal is cheap simple tests using available technology couldnt I just do my eye exam at home skip the two hours sitting in the waiting room with my eyes dilated There are plenty of eye tests apps ready for download right now But its complicated Johnson says Did they get a bad result because they didnt do the test right or is there a change in their visual status Johnson says Hes worried that people will skip an eye exam then get frightened by a false negative result to a home test I think having that as a screen thats available for people who dont have good access to health care is the first thing Home testing will require some additional things to make it bulletproof
