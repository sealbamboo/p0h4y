People with diabetes face an increased risk of Alzheimers disease and other forms of dementia a connection scientists and physicians have worried about for years They still cant explain it Now comes a novel observational study of patients at a large health care system in Washington State showing that    even among people who dont have diabetes The results published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine may have influence on the way we think about blood sugar and the brain said Dr Paul Crane the lead author and associate professor of medicine at the University of Washington The researchers tracked the blood glucose levels of  members of Group Health a nonprofit HMO for nearly seven years on average Some patients had Type  diabetes when the study began but most didnt None had dementia Over the years as they saw doctors at Group Health the participants received blood glucose tests Its a common test in routine clinical practice Dr Crane said We had an amazing opportunity with all this data All the lab results since  were available to us The participants average age at the start  also reported to Group Health every other year for cognitive screening and if their results were below normal further testing and evaluation Over the course of the study about a quarter developed dementia of some kind primarily Alzheimers disease or vascular dementia To measure blood sugar levels the researchers combined glucose measurements both fasting and nonfasting with the HbAc glycated hemoglobin assay which provides a more accurate longterm picture They also adjusted the data for other cardiovascular factors already linked to dementia like high blood pressure and smoking We found a steadily increasing risk associated with everhigher blood glucose levels even in people who didnt have diabetes Dr Crane said Of particular interest Theres no threshold no place where the risk doesnt go up any further or down any further The association with dementia kept climbing with higher blood sugar levels and at the other end of the spectrum continued to decrease with lower levels This held true even at glucose levels considered normal Among those whose blood sugar averaged  milligrams per deciliter the risk of dementia was  percent higher than among those at  mgdL just slightly lower The effects were also pronounced among those with diabetes patients with average glucose levels of  mgdL had a  percent higher risk of dementia than those whose levels averaged  mgdL Though a longitudinal study like this one provides insight into the differences between people it cant explain why higher blood glucose might be connected to dementia or tell individuals whether lower blood glucose is protective People shouldnt run for the hills or try crazy diets Dr Crane cautioned While an epidemiological study like this one can guide further exploration he said This doesnt show that changes in behavior that lower your individual blood sugar would decrease your individual risk of dementia As for the blood glucose levels the study recorded clinically theyre not big differences said Dr Medha Munshi a geriatrician and endocrinologist who directs the geriatric diabetes program at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston who was not involved in the study I wouldnt change my goals for diabetes management based on this study Nor would she warn someone whose blood glucose hits  mgdL that he or she faces a greater risk of dementia But because diabetes itself can pose such a threat to health and quality of life she still urges patients to adopt healthy practices like exercising regularly and maintaining a normal weight to try to avoid the disease If by doing so they also lower their dementia risk  and knowing that would require a different study focused on interventions  that would be a bonus This research offers more evidence that the brain is a target organ for damage by high blood sugar said Dr Munshi And everyone is still working on the why
