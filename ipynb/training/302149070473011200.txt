 A little   toward helping improve the heart health of black men new research suggests Just six weeks of resistance exercise appears to have a positive impact on the blood levels of key indicators for inflammation immune response andor artery shape among black men Such indicators or markers are known to rise in conjunction with tissue damage infection and stress But after weight training levels of two of the markers dropped in these patients the researchers found However while the association was observed among   it was not found among white exercisers This caveat tracked an earlier finding by the same research team that showed that while black men who lifted weights experienced a drop in an important postinjuryinfection inflammation marker known as Creactive protein white men did not This suggests that resistance exercise training is more beneficial in young AfricanAmerican men than in white men of the same age Bo Fernhall dean of the College of Applied Health Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago UIC said in a university news release Fernhall who led the study as a professor in the department of kinesiology and community health at UICs UrbanaChampaign campus and colleagues reported their findings online recently in the   The researchers noted that in the United States    particularly in the form of high blood pressure or hypertension stroke and kidney disease  is more prevalent among blacks than whites Higher blood pressures in AfricanAmerican children have been shown as young as  to  years of age Fernhall said So theres obviously something going on that predisposes the AfricanAmerican population to endstage disease hypertension and stroke and the more debilitating diseases later on in life The focus of the current investigation was on indicators in the blood that signal arterial trouble including one involved in blood vessel remodeling and one that signals oxidative stress Levels of both dropped among black men who lifted weights Study coauthor Marc Cook a UIC doctoral student pointed out that this builds on prior research that has shown that aerobic activity also helps to lower levels of oxidative stress markers So if you dont like cardiovascular exercise if you dont like running on a treadmill if you cant play basketball or youre not good at it you can lift weights and improve your health especially when it comes to high blood pressure Cook said If you just want to lift weights and you do it on a regular basis you could improve your function While the study found an association between cardiovascular health and weight training in black men it did not prove a causeandeffect relationship
