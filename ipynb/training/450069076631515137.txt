Skeletons unearthed in London Crossrail excavations are Black Death victims from the great pandemic of the th Century forensic tests indicate Their teeth contain DNA from the plague bacterium   and their graves have been dated to  Records say thousands of Londoners perished and their corpses were dumped in a mass grave outside the City but its exact location was a mystery Archaeologists now believe it is under Charterhouse Square near the Barbican They plan to expand their search for victims across the square  guided by underground radar scans which have picked up signs of many more graves Crossrails lead archaeologist Jay Carver says the find solves a yearold mystery This discovery is a hugely important step forward in documenting and understanding Europes most devastating pandemic he said Further excavations will follow to see if  as we expect  we are coming across a much bigger mass burial trench Between  and  the Great Pestilence swept westward across Europe killing millions of people It later became known as the Black Death It arrived on Britains shores in  and is believed to have wiped out up to  of the population at the time In London two emergency burial grounds were dug outside the walls of the City One has been found at East Smithfield while the other is known to lie somewhere in Farringdon In March  Crossrail engineers    alongside pottery dated to the midth Century Samples from  of the corpses were taken for forensic analysis In at least four cases scientists found traces of the DNA of the   confirming they had contact with the plague prior to their death To pinpoint which historical plague outbreak the Charterhouse  could have fallen victim to the researchers used radio carbon dating They determined the burial ground was used in at least two distinct periods  the earliest within the Black Death in  followed by a later outbreak in the s In a bid to understand just how far the grave extends across the square Crossrail approached the University of Keele to undertake a forensic geophysics survey  using groundpenetrating radar The initial scan detected signs of further burials across Charterhouse Square and also the foundations of a building  possibly a chapel We will undertake further excavations in Charterhouse Square later this year to confirm some of the results said Mr Carver The skeletons provide a rare opportunity to study the medieval population of London according to osteologist Don Walker of the Museum of London Archaeology He said We can start to answer questions like where did they come from and what were their lives like Im amazed how much you can learn about a person who died more than  years ago Analysis of the skeletons bones and teeth indicates that Mr Carver said We can see from the people here that Londoners werent living an easy life The combination of a poor diet and generally a struggle means they were very susceptible to the plague at that time and thats possibly one of the explanations for why the Black Death was so devastating By sequencing the ancient bacterial DNA researchers hope to understand how the plague has evolved and spread over the centuries Globally the infection still kills  people a year including countries like Madagascar Antibiotics are available but if untreated the disease kills within four days Scientists hope to confirm   The bn Crossrail project aims to establish a kmlong mile rail link with  stations across London and is due to open in  The excavations have already unearthed     and the largest piece of amber ever found in the UK The latest announcement comes ahead of a Channel  documentary Return of the Black Death Secret History on  April which follows the Charterhouse Square discovery
