It was at the week scan that problems with Amandas pregnancy were first noticed  At the next scan Amanda and her husband Mark were told that their unborn son would not survive the pregnancy  but they could not bring themselves to go through with a termination Joshua Adair was born in June  with a rare and incurable condition called   which means he has short arms and legs and an unusually narrow ribcage It was a difficult start to life for their second child who spent his first month in an incubator at Manchester Childrens Hospital receiving help to breathe As his breathing problems worsened he needed more and more oxygen and was eventually put on a ventilator At one point his parents were told he had only weeks to live His ribs were not growing so it was becoming more difficult for him to breathe on his own so we had a rushed christening after three weeks says his mum At that point we said we would do anything to help save his life  and thats when we got in touch with Great Ormond Street Hospital  The answer for Joshua was chest expansion surgery which involved breaking all his ribs and resetting them using metal plates to leave room for the chest cavity to grow But the operation almost didnt happen when he had a cardiac arrest after picking up a serious infection In the end the surgery took place and was a success Joshua returned to Manchester five days afterwards to continue his recovery Joshua is now two and a half years old  and its only in the last four months that he has finally been able to live at home with his family  Amanda says its been a very hard road He spent his first birthday in a high dependency unit and then after we moved house last October he came home for Christmas for one day but he got a chest infection and ended up back in ICU for two weeks Every little cold and infection is a major health issue for Joshua who may be on a ventilator permanently Yet despite his many physical problems Joshua has surprised his family and his doctors He can now sit up on his own roll onto his tummy and make lots of noise although he cannot talk because of a tracheotomy Hes a lot more aware now and more affectionate He can smile and shake his head too Joshua needs hour care so Amanda has given up work to look after him but she is also assisted by other carers who can take him to nursery or out in his specially adapted pram to accompany his sevenyearold brother Ethan to school Jeune Syndrome is thought to affect around  people in the UK and although it is inherited parents are usually unaware they are carrying a gene for the condition Research suggests that those with the disease have hairlike structures on cells that help bone growth  called cilia  that do not work properly Dr Miriam Schmidts clinical research fellow at the Institute of Child Health at University College London has been funded by   to look at the genes behind the condition  Her research has found three genes related to Jeune Syndrome and this means scientists can now explain  of cases They can also offer prenatal diagnosis much earlier in pregnancy  Dr Schmidts says the impact of new gene sequencing methods on her research has been revolutionary Lots of different genes can have mutations Before we had to screen a lot of genes but now we can see all the genes in the human body at the same time If each genome is a library and each chromosome a book shelf then each mutation would be a spelling mistake So finding the mutation was a really slow process We cant cure genetic defects but families do feel better if they know whats wrong with their child The gene discovery also means scientists will be able to understand more about what causes the condition which could help them explore avenues for treatment in the future Joshua had more chest surgery in April this year this time using artificial bones to remodel his ribcage instead of titanium plates Again the operation was a success giving more room for Joshua to grow and his chest to expand Not bad for a boy who wasnt given a chance
