The painkiller diclofenac isnt very popular in the US but its by far the most widely used nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug or NSAID in the world A slew of studies though show    sold under the brand names Voltaren Cambia Cataflam and Zipsor  is just as likely to cause a heart attack as the discredited painkiller Vioxx rofecoxib which was   in  But evidence of the drugs cardiovascular risk hasnt translated to a reduction in use a   in the journal  found  Diclofenac far outsells ibuprofen naproxen and other   in  countries around the world If you look at it internationally diclofenac is the single most widely used NSAID says study author   of the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences in Toronto Henry tells Shots that diclofenac raises the risk of a cardiovascular event such as heart attack by about  percent compared to taking no NSAID Other NSAIDS are much safer with   being the least risky Naproxen has a global market share of only  percent Clearly thousands of people die as a result of using diclofenac Henry says But these are invisible victims And therefore theres no advocacy lobby group on their behalf The bad cardiovascular risk profile of diclofenac is no secret   a US government website   people who take it may have a higher risk of having a heart attack or a stroke and that these events may happen without warning and may cause death People with low cardiovascular risk probably can take diclofenac without much danger If their annual risk of a heart attack is  in  the drug would raise it to only  per thousand But diclofenac would boost the risk in those with a  percent annual heart attack risk to  percent  a substantial increase especially when multiplied over an entire population taking the popular pills for a wide range of aches and pains For instance if only  percent of Chinas  billion people take diclofenac a plausible assumption since the drug is the most commonly used NSAID in Chinese hospitals Henry and his coauthor   of Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry say it could result in  preventable deaths Countries where diclofenac dominates the painkiller market are largely low and middleincome nations such as Bangladesh Pakistan Thailand and Vietnam But the list also includes England Australia and New Zealand And the drug is number three among Canadian NSAIDs with more than  percent of the market Henry says theres a perception that diclofenac is a more potent painkiller than other NSAIDs We think thats just because its been marketed in high doses Higher doses also magnify the cardiovascular risk The study authors are petitioning the World Health Organization to remove diclofenac from the agencys list of socalled   which qualify in many countries for public support Henry said it would be a gargantuan task to get diclofenac removed from the market since drugs are regulated on a nationbynation basis Diclofenac which dates to the s is one of the oldest NSAIDs These drugs act by suppressing   small molecules that have many effects throughout the body Good prostaglandins dilate blood vessels and increase blood flow a desirable effect Henry says Bad prostaglandins increase the tendency of blood to clot which is undesirable He says drugs like diclofenac and Vioxx inhibit the good prostaglandins without inhibiting the bad ones Another NSAID that operates in the same undesirable way is   Henry and McGettigan find that its also used in many countries but it hasnt been approved in North America
