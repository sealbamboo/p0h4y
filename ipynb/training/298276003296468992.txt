 Its known that drinking during   leaves babies vulnerable to a spectrum of abnormalities called fetal alcohol syndrome Now a new study pinpoints the latter half of the first trimester as a critical time in the development of some of the syndromes most telling physical characteristics Study authors also stressed that their research illustrates there is no safe amount of drinking during pregnancy since the amount of drinking that produced these features in infants varied from woman to woman The fact that we didnt find a safe threshold is important said study author Christina Chambers an associate professor of pediatrics and family and preventive medicine at the University of California San Diego Not every child of women who drink even very heavily has all the features so there are certain susceptibility factors that we dont know The study appears online Jan  ahead of print publication in the April issue of the journal   The authors say it is one of the first to examine the impact of quantity frequency and timing of alcohol exposure on the condition Thought to affect about  percent of the American population fetal alcohol syndrome can result in physical behavioral and learning problems People with the syndrome may have abnormal facial features such as a smooth ridge between the nose and upper lip small head size unusually smallset eyes and shorterthanaverage height The  women in the study were enrolled in the California Teratogen Information Service and Clinical Research Program between  and  which provided confidential risk assessments for any potential toxin exposures during pregnancy Every three months during the remainder of their pregnancies they were asked about their use of alcohol and other substances including specific dates of use drinks per day number of binge episodes and maximum number of drinks Information about their babies development was collected after birth and each newborn was then examined by a dysmorphologist a specialist in structural birth defects to look for evidence of fetal alcohol syndrome as well as other conditions While higher levels of alcohol exposure were strongly linked to a greater risk of infants born smaller and lighter with small heads and a smooth ridge between the nose and upper lip the most significant associations were observed during the second half of the first trimester of pregnancy  defined as  to  days after conception For every onedrink increase in the daily average number of drinks consumed during this stage of pregnancy there was a  percent higher risk for having a smooth ridge between the nose and upper lip a  percent higher chance of having an abnormally thin upper lip a  percent elevated risk of having a smallerthannormal head a  percent greater risk of reduced birth weight and an  percent higher chance of reduced birth length In addition the likelihood of shorter birth length was associated with drinking in any trimester the study found There is almost  years of research on fetal alcohol syndrome but one of the challenges has been determining what are the windows of risk and the patterns in timing and quantity of alcohol use and this study addresses that said Tom Donaldson president of the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in Washington DC This article very clearly demonstrates that risk begins with any use Chambers and her colleagues theorized that alcohol exposure in the first six weeks of pregnancy  when many women dont yet know theyre pregnant  may result in higher miscarriage rates although the study did not include women who had miscarriages or stillbirths
