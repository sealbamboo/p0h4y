Auguste is  years old a charmer with big blue eyes long lashes and a playful smile Hes wearing a Tshirt that says Make some noise and fiddling with his Etch A Sketch in a hospital exam room But when a doctor reaches toward his temple he quickly releases the knobs and tilts his head He knows what theyre looking for Behind each ear under the skin are cochlear implants  surgically implanted devices meant to help process sound But they didnt help Auguste He was born without an auditory nerve the wire that ferries sound from the ear to the brain He points out planes in the sky but cant hear their engines roar Hes never heard the voices of his yearold sister or yearold brother He doesnt know the sound of his own name Now a team of Los Angeles doctors and researchers believes it can help Auguste hear But the device the team is testing will require surgeons to go much deeper into Augustes skull all the way to the brain Sophie Gareau Augustes mom often tears up when she thinks about whats ahead Hes so perfect you know she says Her voice breaks I dont want anything to happen to him But I am so convinced that its going to work  Sophie realized something was off when Auguste was  months old Her baby wasnt babbling Doctors in Montreal said he was fine She insisted otherwise but it was nearly a year later before audiologists played sounds as loud as an airplane engine in the toddlers ear and confirmed what his French Canadian parents had suspected Auguste was profoundly deaf I think it takes a moment to sink in and then you cry for a week Sophie said Audiologists put him on track for the cochlear implant which places electrodes in the snailshaped cochlea part of the inner ear to stimulate the auditory nerve Its a common procedure for deaf children About  children in the US have received them But the surgery didnt work Auguste had a cochlea doctors discovered but no auditory nerve to deliver sound to the brainstem Sophie and her husband Christophe Majkowski were crushed but they focused on the positive Hes perfectly healthy and hes smart and hes quick said Sophie who shares her sons big blue eyes and constantly chats with him in sign language Shed heard about something called an auditory brainstem implant or ABI The device uses an external processor on the ear to send sound to a surgically implanted electrode array A doctor warned her against it He had mentioned that only the Italians were doing it and they were cowboys which in French means crazy people she said The Italian in question was Vittorio Colletti who began putting the devices in healthy deaf patients in the late s at the University of Verona This was unheard of at the time There had to be an urgent reason  such as removal of a dangerous tumor  to perform such a risky surgery Colletti was criticized But he began reporting incredible results some patients with the device could even conduct business on the phone without lipreading The medical community was skeptical So Colletti invited Robert Shannon who helped develop the modern brainstem implant while working as a medical researcher at the House Research Institute in Los Angeles to see for himself Shannon spent hundreds of hours testing patients in Italy I was astounded said Shannon who now works at USC It was even better than he said A team of researchers that included Shannon wanted to introduce the procedure to children in the US But a riskaverse Food and Drug Administration denied the teams initial request said USC audiologist Laurie Eisenberg one of the lead scientists After all Eisenberg said it is brain surgery in children After some key changes in FDA personnel the team received the goahead in  In spite of several setbacks the team pressed on because the National Institutes of Health had agreed to pay for the teams clinical trial Auguste is the first patient  Auguste lies unconscious in the operating room at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles a blue sheet covering his body The only part of him visible is a small square where the three surgeons are operating  their window into Augustes brain Pediatric neurosurgeon Mark Krieger stands over this tiny red window gloved hands at work Marc Schwartz a neurosurgeon with the Los Angelesbased House Clinic speaks in a voice muffled by the mask they all must wear His colleague Eric Wilkinson one of the lead scientists trains a plasticwrapped microscope on the exposed flesh The surgeons cut through skin saw through bone and snip through the dura the brains protective covering They drain cerebrospinal fluid so that the cerebellum relaxes allowing them to move past the bulging tissue and reach the brainstem Occasionally a spurt of blood runs across the opening but the surgeons dont flinch Colletti the cowboy who pioneered the procedure is sitting nearby He has flown in from Italy to see the clinical trial begin He cant wield a knife all he can do is offer advice as he watches Augustes brain on a large screen Schwartz knows the path to the cochlear nucleus the spot on the brainstem where the ABI will go Hes seen Colletti perform the procedure in Italy about half a dozen times He follows the ninth cranial nerve to the boundary between the cerebellum and brainstem then looks for a tiny nook called the lateral recess Thats where the cochlear nucleus should be But it isnt Theres nothing there Theres no hole there Schwartz says No hole Not even anything that looks like a hole Remotely The chatter in the room has dropped to hollow silence punctuated by the harsh beep of the monitors Schwartz retraces his steps over and over No luck The surgeons debate what to do next If they cant find the lateral recess they cant put the device in Wilkinson urges him forward but Schwartz is worried Im just afraid of hurting the kid he says At last Schwartz finds the entrance Over several minutes he carefully inserts the millimeterlong electrode array into the right spot Bravo Colletti says Bravo bravo After the roughly sixhour operation the doctors find Augustes parents in a waiting room The surgery went well they say Auguste will be awake soon Christophe and Sophie hug each other tightly When the surgeons are gone she lets out a whoop edged with exhaustion  There are a few scary days for Augustes parents Soon after the surgery Sophie discovers blood seeping onto his pillow A week passes before Auguste can walk again A few weeks later hes playing in the sand at Venice Beach with his family a new haircut outlining the pink crescent scar behind his ear Inside Augustes head his brain is healing and fibrous tissue is growing around the device Outside hes flailing at his older sister Daria as they both try to climb onto their dads back Christophe rears like a horse and they slip into the sand giggling and out of breath Sophie says shes keeping her expectations in check The ABI delivers more rudimentary sound than does natural hearing Auguste will always be deaf and theyll always sign with him she says If he never speaks or experiences the nuances of music thats fine All Auguste needs are basic reference sounds  the honk of a horn in a busy street the clatter of something falling behind him  to connect him to the world and keep him out of harms way  Auguste sits at a toyfilled table at USCs Keck School of Medicine After a month of recovery its time to find out whether the surgery worked Margaret Winter and Jamie Glater scrunch around the kidsized table Theyre known as child whisperers because deaf children cant say exactly what theyre hearing the USC audiologists have to be able to read their reactions such as a quick glance or a sudden stillness As Auguste plays with his trucks Winter uses her computer to remotely activate individual electrodes on the device each of which represents a different pitch range If the device works Auguste should hear these simple beeps Auguste is rolling a toy monster truck across the table As the beep sounds he freezes midcar crash Somethings happened Glater makes a crooked L with her fingers the thumb pointed at her ear Listening Youre listening she says Auguste searches their faces then goes back to his toys Delighted the audiologists go through several more electrodes dialing up the electrical signal on each until they see a clear reaction Then its time to try a human voice They turn on the microphone Bapbapbapbap Glater says Every time she says the strong syllables Auguste drops a token in a Connect Four grid as hes been trained to do The adults cheer Winter turns the signal up Auguste winces  the way you do when a sound is too piercing and brings his hand to his head then runs into Sophies open arms He shakes his head so hard the earpiece flies off Thats perfectly normal Winter tells the parents Its a completely new experience  more of a sensation than a sound at first Whatever he felt it penetrated his world Winter says Over time the brain picks up more complex information teases apart different pitches learns to tell long smooth sounds apart from short staccato ones How it manages this incredible feat is a mystery that researchers are still trying to solve Making that progress will take years of therapy and training for Auguste to learn how to process sound and if possible to speak But first baby steps The team leaves the device on at a low level The next day they try again Hey Auguste Sophie says At first he whines but then he reaches for another toy Hes getting used to it Glater grabs a toy train Choo choo choo she says Christophe chimes in Choo choo choo they chorus Auguste giggles You like that Sophie says After the testing Auguste plays in the hallway And when the device falls off his ear he stops in his tracks He picks it back up He wants it on
