Falling in love is easy Maintaining a happy healthy relationship Thats the hard part And if you go into a relationship buying into myths like opposites attract and happy couples never fight youll be setting yourself up for failure says   a psychotherapist based in Santa Cruz California These ideals are unhealthy and unrealistic since they tend to be based on fairytales Cinderella anyone To help improve your relationships weve decided to clear the air Read on to discover the truths behind  common relationship myths This is one of those myths thats ingrained in us as teenagers the good girl falls for the bad boy And while there is some truth to it  extroverts tend to be attracted to introverts for example  the key to a successful relationship is to complement one another I like to say complements attract says Bloom This means looking for someone who has the qualities you lack Its also a big plus to have similarities in your personal history as well as interests in common Coming for a similar background will make it easier for you and your partner to relate to one another A lot of us fall for this misconception and its no wonder why Movies television shows and society perpetuate the myth that for happy couples life is always roses and sunshine The truth All couples have differences and fighting is not a sign that youre with the wrong person says Bloom In fact its healthy to debate issues Youre not always going to see eyetoeye and thats okay What  important is being diplomatic during arguments and not judging or being critical of your spouse Speaking the truth without blame and judgment will establish trust and strengthen your bond There is no correct frequency for sex says Bloom Everyone has different needs If you want to have sex more or less often talk to your partner and figure out a groove that works for you both People tell themselves If I find the right person its smooth sailing from there The reality is a lot different You dont know a person until youve been with them for a while explains Bloom In the beginning of a relationship youre both putting your best foot forward But eventually your flaws start to show and your partner has to learn how to deal Recognizing that all relationships take work will keep you from feeling disappointed later on Women who deal with trust issues tend to think that marriage and babies will make their partners more committed says Bloom But thats not necessarily the case Rather than solve your problems having a baby may actually create   issues that will only add to the ones youre already dealing with To improve your bond you have to look at whats happening inside the relationship rather than looking to outside forces to fix it recommends Bloom Saying your vows and exchanging rings on your wedding day isnt enough You need to commit to your marriage every single day according to Bloom Great relationships dont just happen he says You have to cocreate it with your partner all the time Your partner isnt a mindreader says Bloom Its up to you to tell him or her exactly what you need to feel loved For example if you want physical connection and attention tell your partner what that means for you Maybe its a hug and kiss before you leave for work or cuddling on the weekends Bloom suggests saying something like It would mean a lot to me if  and filling in the blank with whatever you need to feel loved and supported This myth is endlessly supported by the media so its no surprise that a lot of us fall for it But the reality is not that all men are cheaters and buying into this myth can have negative consequences for your relationship Youll be less trusting of your partner and constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop says Bloom If you want a solid bond you have to trust your significant other and communicate if you have concerns about his fidelity It isnt always easy but its important to be open and honest with one another People  change  as long as they want to You have to be willing and open says Bloom Remember that change can be scary so its important to be loving and supportive of your partner We all grow up with the Cinderella story says Bloom People are taught to think that love should be enough But if youre caught up in that myth youre not going to take the responsibility required to create a great relationship You have to be ready and willing to work for your relationship It doesnt just happen it takes effort and determination
