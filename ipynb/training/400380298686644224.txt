The   and the   just released   to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk  and the change from the previous version last updated in  is profound Here are three things you need to know about these new guidelines Americans have long been urged to focus on their laboratory numbers Many people are obsessive about checking their cholesterol levels and pursuing even better numbers Doctors have been told to focus on these numbers and in some cases the quality of their care was assessed by the percentage of their patients with low cholesterol levels  Those days are over The new guidelines recognize that for patients who have exhausted lifestyle efforts and are considering drug therapy the question is not whether a drug makes your lab tests better but whether it lowers your risk of heart disease and stroke Studies over the past several years have shown that improving your lab profile with drugs is not equivalent to lowering your heart risks Drugs have thousands of effects on the body and a drugs effect on an individual lab test cannot necessarily predict its overall effect on you  Importantly the guidelines still state that cholesterol is important But the point is that changing your cholesterol level with medications is now accompanied with the appreciation that other effects of the drugs may offset any benefit to reducing cholesterol  Theres one exception to the numbers rule People with very high levels of the harmful cholesterol known as LDL still need to worry about targets The new guidelines set that LDL level at  milligrams per deciliter  but the principle is that if people have very high cholesterol levels then their cardiovascular risk is so high that it is likely that treatment to reduce the levels would offset any risks of the drug treatment So the new guidelines are saying we should not be chasing the cholesterol levels alone The know your number campaign is no longer consistent with the guidelines and the days of doctors adding additional medications to get you to some arbitrary cholesterol level should no longer occur  What is taking the place of cholesterol levels What should you do now The guidelines are now focusing you on your overall risk of heart disease and stroke They indicate that drug treatment is recommended for people with a high risk  and that more powerful treatments are best for those with the highest risk So what they are saying now is know your risk of heart disease and stroke They have published   to help you  but more important is the general concept that drug treatment with effective medications those proven to lower risk should be used in people with the most to gain  The guidelines do set thresholds for risk but my view is that these recommendations should not be considered dictums to be followed without question They say that if your year risk of heart disease and stroke is  percent or higher then you should be treated with drugs However I believe that only  can determine what constitutes a high enough risk that it is worth it to you to be treated with drugs Such a decision depends on how you feel about your risk of heart disease and stroke and how you feel about taking drugs  and their risks and benefits  The understanding that simply improving cholesterol lab tests may not reduce your risk for heart attack and stroke has focused attention on the choice of drug therapy In the treat to target era there was a sense that we could use any of the medications to lower LDL  and what was most important was the lab test  However there have been numerous studies showing that many popular drugs that may have improved lab tests for cholesterol failed to reduce risk These studies led the authors of the guidelines to make a distinction between proven and unproven medications Thus the focus of the guidelines is on statins the drug class with clear evidence that it can lower risk in many groups of patients In fact statins seem to lower risk regardless of your cholesterol levels This fact has led many of us to think about statins as riskreduction medications rather than just medications that modify cholesterol levels Regardless the evidence that statins lower risk is very clear So the guidelines now make clear that if you use drug therapy for higher risk you should use statins If you cannot tolerate one statin you might want to try another statin after consultation with your doctor If you use another type of drug then you should know whether that drug has been shown to reduce risk in contemporary studies Many popular drugs like Zetia ezetimibe have not yet been proven to save lives  The new guidelines are a marked departure from the era of chasing targets and being agnostic to the drugs you used The new message is dont chase targets know your risk and  if you need drug therapy  use statins These principles should guide your discussions with your doctor Harlan Krumholz is a cardiologist and the Harold H Hines Jr
