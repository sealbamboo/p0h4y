Triathletes can tolerate more pain than the rest of us a new study confirms which helps explain why they would swim then bike then run all because they  to and not because they are perhaps being chased by a bear Thats interesting on its own but theres more Researchers say that understanding how athletes can withstand the pain of a grueling endurance event may eventually lead to potential treatments and therapies for people with chronic pain  Its a very masochistic sport said Jenna Parker who was the top female finisher in the New York City Triathlon in July She was joking but only kind of I guess to some extent I always wondered what it is that makes people able to compete at a high level in athletics Obviously theres something thats different that makes us able to push our physical boundaries in a way that other people cant It was a small study with just  participants  triathletes  men and nine women and  nontriathletes seven men and  women The triathletes each compete in at least two national competitions a year  either Olympic distance or Ironman the nontriathletes were active but more casual exercisers  runners swimmers Zumbaers  In one experiment the researchers asked teach volunteers to put a hand in cold water about  degrees they were told to remove it if or when they experienced unbearable pain In another experiment they experienced gradually increasing heat applied to a forearm with a computerized gadget starting from about  degrees Fahrenheit They were asked to press a switch when they first felt pain and then press a switch when they could no longer tolerate the pain The triathletes and nonathletes registered pain at about the same temperatures But the triathletes were able to withstand the pain for longer Triathletes appear to exhibit greater ability andor motivation to endure pain in the experimental setup and possibly also in everyday life Dr Ruth Defrin at Tel Aviv University in Israel and colleagues wrote in their report published in the journal Pain But why Do tougher people tend to become triathletes Or does becoming a triathlete make you tougher Defrin has a few theories Since triathletes experience repetitive pain during training and competitions perhaps the pain inputs that reach the brain constantly trigger the brain stem structures responsible for pain inhibition which in turn produce a more powerful pain modulation and tolerance but this is yet to be tested Defrin said via email So their brainandbody chemistry grows accustomed to the pain which makes it more bearable over time Another thought which this study did test was the triathletes psychological attitudes to pain In a survey meant to gauge how afraid the volunteers were of pain the triathletes selfreported less fear And other   support that psychological link Being afraid of the pain before dental surgery for example can make it hurt worse  This is a concept that has become a lifeline for Angela Durazo who is a yearold fulltime triathlete who is a living example of the findings In  Durazo began chasing her dream of becoming a professional triathlete  she had sponsors and she was doing well placing fifth in her first international competition  But then she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis an autoimmune disease that attacks the bodys own tissues that can cause lifelong chronic pain It feels like youre taking a hot knife and scratching against the bone Durazo says  At one point the pain was so great she couldnt open a bottle of water by herself At its worst she couldnt get out of bed But after some intense months of physical therapy counseling and a change to an antiinflammatory diet the pain is manageable and shes competed in seven triathlons this season Durazo says that competing in a triathlon helped her learn to distinguish between pain in her physical therapy she could push through and pain that signaled a potential injury You push through the pain of racing  which is much different than chronic pain but its pain nonetheless Durazo says I thought the more I could deal with chronic pain that the more I could use that as my tool to become a better athlete  When I realized that it made it so much easier to deal with my rheumatoid arthritis Like this is just mental toughness training says Durazo  The obvious disclaimer Anyone suffering from chronic pain due to any condition should talk to a doctor before taking on a triathlon or other exercise program But Defrin says that individually tailored exercise programs for chronic pain patients may help them to better cope with their pain And Durazo is fascinated by the evidence shes seen in herself  When youre doing a race youre neck and neck  it boils down to who can endure the most pain she says So the more I can deal with the chronic pain of my disease the better athlete Im going to become
