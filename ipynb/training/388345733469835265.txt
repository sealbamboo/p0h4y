It was a good question since historically the two groups have been at odds    Unlike people with anorexia or bulimia who tend to be excessively thin many binge eaters are overweight or obese And much of the focus of antiobesity efforts  listing calories at restaurants banning cupcakes in schools sending students home with body mass index report cards  are decried by eating disorder activists who say such measures can encourage anorexia or bulimia  Antiobesity activists in turn worry that the eating disorder community minimizes the medical risks of obesity which the American Medical Association classified as a disease in June and plays down the discrimination many obese people face  They come out of different traditions said Kelly Brownell dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University Obesity was mainly dealt with in medical professions and eating disorders were dealt with more in psychology professions    But binge eating disorder   include consuming enormous amounts of food in a twohour window  without purging at least once a week for three months could bridge the gap between the two worlds while also reducing the stereotype that only thin people suffer from eating disorders We cannot address obesity and not eating disorders said Chevese Turner  founder of the Binge Eating Disorder Association which lobbied heavily for binge eating disorders inclusion in the DSM In September clinicians researchers and advocates who work in the eating disorders and obesity communities or have struggled with the food and weight issues themselves held a   to focus attention on the intersection of obesity and eating disorders  Part of what drives me crazy is that the obesity community and policymakers dismiss eating disorders as a small group of people when in fact it is  million and growing  with more and more evidence that the focus on obesity and restriction and growing weight stigma in the culture is contributing to this rise said Ms Turner who spoke at the event  Susan Rappaport knows all about this At  and a petite foot she weighed nearly  pounds  the result she maintains of years of dieting She would starve herself during the day and then get out of bed in the middle of the night to binge   When she told her doctor that she thought she had an eating disorder he brushed it off said Ms Rappaport  who now weighs about  pounds and runs the NuYu Revolution Fitness Studio on the Upper West Side of Manhattan It was like Youre not skinny enough to have an eating disorder But I was a fat eating disordered person Indeed an   with eating disorders had a history of obesity but because of their higher weight their symptoms often went unrecognized and untreated Other studies have found that among individuals with a current or past history of binge eating disorder approximately  percent are of normal weight  percent are overweight and  percent are obese    I dont want to say that the eating disorder is causing their obesity some people with BED are normal weight said Jennifer J Thomas codirector of the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital and the coauthor of Almost Anorexic a book about subthreshold eating disorders But theres definitely a huge overlap and if the two communities arent working together there is a huge missed opportunity Statistics from the  National CoMorbidity Survey Replication   among women and  percent among men Nearly  percent of respondents with binge eating disorder were obese Still despite differences in physical characteristics and symptoms those suffering from an eating disorder like anorexia or bulimia and those with obesity have shared psychological components commonalities and underpinnings said Dr Scott Kahan director of the Strategies to Overcome and Prevent STOP Obesity Alliance at the George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services a nonprofit obesity policy organization Low self esteem is extremely common in both as is body dissatisfaction They are both very much environmentally driven Both place excessive emphasis on appearance and body size In the same way many of the same psychological underpinnings play into both Another area where the two fields converge is weight stigma said Rebecca Puhl deputy director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale A   found that the more people feel stigmatized or bullied about their weight the greater their risk for obesity Other studies have shown that experiencing weight bias contributes to risk of eating disorders Jenni Schaefer  Dr Thomass coauthor is adamant that the two groups work together to ease confusion among recovering patients Recently a teenager in recovery from bulimia said to me My therapist tells me not to talk about my weight and that my body is fine But my doctor keeps weighing me and says that I need to lose weight Ms Schaefer said  She had a similar experience with her own recovery from a year struggle with anorexia My body had changed far more quickly than my mind While that was confusing in and of itself it was even more difficult to understand why my doctors were giving me different perspectives regarding my new weight In many ways I hit a standstill at that point I didnt know what to do With all this in mind a growing number of eating disorder treatment facilities are treating obese patients with and without binge eating disorder in groups with anorexics and bulimics   It makes no sense to separate people based on their size said Dr Susan McClanahan founder of Insight Behavioral Health which has four locations in Chicago She is aware of the inherent conflict Youre telling one group You have to eat and the other Its OK   to eat everything on your plate she continued But I think its been a real relief for the anorexics to see someone who is overweight and have them realize Theyre just a person its nothing to be afraid of And the overweight folks can say Just because youre skinny doesnt mean youre going to be happy You can be absolutely miserable when youre thin Many treatment methodologies are also similar within the two groups like eating regular meals not skipping meals and learning to listen to ones body for cues of hunger or fullness Some patients say that being in a mixed group is helpful Ann Schaffer  an administrative assistant and musician in Chicago has struggled with binge eating disorder off and on for  years At her heaviest Ms Schaffer who is foot weighed  pounds and found it challenging to be in the same room with pound anorexics Sometimes it was almost like envy  I wish I had your problem Ms Schaffer recalled After a while it was like camaraderie The problem is not the food the problems are the issues in your life and you turn to food because you cant handle them This model of treating the two groups together is not without controversy At Walden Behavioral Care in Waltham Mass individuals with binge eating and anorexia used to attend the same groups but that stopped about five years ago Patients were uncomfortable said Stu Koman a clinical psychologist and the clinics founder and chief executive A lot of what they were dealing with in therapy was their discomfort at being in the group with someone who was anorexic rather than focusing on what they needed to focus on these binge episodes The anorexic patients were terrified that they would end up looking like the heavier patients suffering from BED One thing nearly everyone agrees on is that the cultural conversation around food and body size must shift along with media messages promoting images of waiflike models and an estimated  billion a year weight loss industry in which the vast majority of dieters regain their weight within five years The focus should be on behaviors not weight said Dianne NeumarkSztainer a professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Minnesota who has   and   We know from our research that talking about weight and diets is not effective and for many leads to weight gain over time said Dr Sztainer the author of Im Like So Fat We really want to focus on providing a community that makes it easy to engage in healthy eating and physical activity   Dr Brownell believes that the two communities could work together as a powerful political force sharing a goal of better food and healthrelated messages and policies Better access to healthy locally grown foods might be such an example he said The extreme presence in our society of unhealthy highly processed foods are a problem for both of these camps Some people respond by eating too much and others respond by extreme control so it becomes an eating disorder A healthy food environment would be a benefit in both worlds
