Another day another tablet  This time its for people who need help cutting their alcohol consumption  But is this another example of what some are calling a worrying trend a pill for every ill  Is it the best response to the scourge of alcoholism Nobody doubts the cost to society of excess drinking The government estimates that alcoholrelated harm leads to annual costs of bn  including direct costs to the NHS the effects of alcoholinduced crime and lost productivity in the economy  The drugs manufacturer Lundbeck says that largescale trials have shown that it can reduce alcohol dependence in certain patients by an average of  over a six month period   The tablets costing the NHS about  each are taken in association with counselling   So whats the cost   NICE acknowledges that its not possible to estimate what the usage might be  Predictions from Lundbeck suggest that around  people in England and Wales might be prescribed the tablets in the first year of use That would rise to nearly  in the fifth year  The total bill in the first year would be about m rising to more than m in the fifth year  That m cost of prescribing to  looks like a minimum likely cost given that the eligible population in England is   Being eligible of course does not mean that the drug would be appropriate but the acceleration in annual costs over five years might well continue over a longer period In essence taxpayers are being asked to fund treatment in an attempt to reduce costs associated with alcohol misuse   But moderate consumers and nondrinkers might feel this is unfair There is an argument for using other policy levers to encourage people who drink excessively to moderate their consumption The Faculty of Public Health has argued there are simple alternatives to medication which would reduce alcohol consumption including cutting drink advertising and introducing a minimum price per unit   The faculty points out that there are pressures on the NHS budget and prescribing nalmefene might not be the best use of resources Minimum pricing is a contentious issue  This government stalled on the idea and is said now to be considering the arguments for going down that route  The Scottish administrations attempt to impose a minimum price of p per unit has been held up by a legal challenge mounted by the drinks industry   A decision by the European Court of Justice may not come till next year  As it happens nalmefene has been available in Scotland since October   Pills to tackle drink problems  Bariatric surgery to deal with obesity  All on the NHS and paid for by taxpayers   Its easy to construct populist headlines which miss the complexities of the arguments about helping people with acute conditions   But with all the demands on the health service these questions will continue to be asked
