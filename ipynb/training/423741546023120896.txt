Florida may soon become the latest state to allow doctors to prescribe marijuana Advocates there are gathering signatures to put a medical marijuana referendum on the fall ballot But Floridas Legislature may act sooner to allow residents access to a particular type of marijuana Advocates say the strain called Charlottes Web offers hope to children with severe seizure disorders Paige Figi is a Colorado mom whose young daughter   suffers from   Its a debilitating genetic disease that left the little girl unable to walk talk or eat Figi says an oil extracted from a particular strain of marijuana has helped save her daughters life Charlotte is doing great says Figi who was in Tallahassee Fla to testify at a legislative hearing Shes two years in to treatment I would have brought her here but she cant leave Colorado Thats because the marijuana extract her daughter depends on cant legally be transported across state lines Its from a variety of marijuana with very little   or THC the primary component that produces the high Instead the strain has very high amounts of another compound    or CBD A few years ago Figi told legislators her daughter was having  seizures a week After trying every drug and therapy she and her husband could think of they started Charlotte on a marijuana extract that contained high amounts of CBD She takes just a few milligrams of the oil each day in her food The results have been dramatic Figi says Shes  percent  almost  percent  seizurefree she adds She has about one or two seizures a month now down from  But the marijuana extract isnt a cure Charlotte and others with Dravet have a genetic disease theyll have forever Figi says her daughter will never drive a car marry or live independently But Charlotte used to have to rely on a feeding tube Figi says and now can eat and drink on her own She has friends and a vastly improved quality of life For families like hers Figi says Charlottes Web and similar strains of marijuana represent a lifeline Its brandnew and its very very exciting for these parents who have nothing left Figi says The Figis story has become wellknown among parents of children with Dravet syndrome and other seizure disorders Theres now a waiting list for Charlottes Web and the   is working to ramp up production In the meantime families from Florida and other states have been moving to Colorado to get their kids started on the therapy Families like Cory Brownings who bought a house in Breckenridge Colo Browning is a lawyer in north Florida whose daughter has Dravet syndrome and has suffered from as many as  seizures a day Browning testified at the hearing that hes looking to Colorado because medical marijuana is illegal in Florida I dont want to break the law Browning said I have a law license to protect If I have to our only option may be to send my wife and daughter to Colorado Twenty states and the District of Columbia   for medical purposes and Maryland has a limited medical marijuana research program Leaders in the Florida Legislature have consistently blocked efforts to bring a bill to the floor But for Charlottes Web and similar strains even some staunch opponents of medical marijuana now are willing to make an exception  a Baptist minister from central Florida has long opposed anything that he believes expands substance abuse But after hearing pleas from Figi and other parents he said he was moved I dont think this is substance abuse Zant says I think this is using the substance wisely as God intended Im for it While parents and advocates are embracing this specialized form of marijuana as a new therapy for children with seizure disorders many medical experts are more circumspect There are many more unknowns than knowns says   a neurologist and head of New York Universitys Comprehensive Epilepsy Center And I think the focus of the community  lay and scientific and governmental  should be on getting good information That should be the real focus of what we need right now Devinsky is overseeing clinical trials beginning soon that will test the safety and efficacy of a CBD compound developed by a British drug company To get FDA approval for the drug Devinsky says researchers must conduct randomized controlled trials  a process likely to take at least a couple of years In the meantime some families in Florida and elsewhere say their children cant wait for results from research For these families Devinsky thinks Charlottes Web and similar marijuana strains may make sense If I had a child who had failed  medications and drug treatments and there was nothing else to do and they were having many seizures a day that were terribly disabling Devinsky says I think it would be a very reasonable thing to do to try a highCBD cannabis product But the enthusiasm for the new therapy   among parents of children with Dravet syndrome and similar disorders may make it harder to conduct clinical trials Devinsky says The challenge may be finding families who havent already begun trying the Charlottes Web extract
