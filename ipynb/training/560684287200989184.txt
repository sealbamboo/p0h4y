There are no plans for any insurance products to help people plan ahead for their care needs in old age leading companies have told the BBC Creating such a market was one of the key aims underpinning the governments decision to introduce a cap on care costs in England from next year Two years ago Prime Minister David Cameron said he hoped the plans would open up an enormous market But  major companies said there was not enough interest in such policies Care experts said the revelation was a blow About  of people are expected to need care in their old age  with one in  facing costs in excess of  From April  the government is setting the cap on care at  from the age of  Currently people face unlimited costs  although those with little wealth get help towards their costs Under the change once an individual has spent that sum the state will pick up the bill for care  although people will still be liable for  weekly living costs if they are in a care home The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the overs The care calculator covers both residential care and the support provided in peoples own homes for tasks such as washing and dressing  Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs wherever they live in the UK There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website with news stories explainers analysis and video By covering the catastrophic costs ministers hoped insurance policies would be offered to people so they could make small payments in the decades before they reached the age when they needed care The only products currently on the market are immediate needs annuities which involve people paying a oneoff lump sum  often about   when they start needing care The idea is that they will then be paid an income over the rest of their life to cover the costs of care However some people have reported the policies have failed to keep pace with the rising costs of care  and because of the upfront money involved they are out of the reach of many people The BBC approached  companies and received  responses as part of its   which includes an online guide to how care works and what it costs The companies participated on the basis they would remain anonymous One said a key problem was that people tended not to plan for retirement and the governments proposals had not fundamentally changed that picture Another reported that few people were prepared to defer consumption today to pay for an event which may not occur Care refers to everything from support provided in peoples homes to roundtheclock help in care homes Unlike with the NHS people have to pay towards these services Some get help from their local authorities but others pay the full cost of their care One in  people faces lifetime costs of more than  About  people are currently living in care and nursing homes across the UK while about one million receive help in their own home There are another  million people who rely on friends and family for support Care Minister Norman Lamb said I do challenge the insurance industry  dont be conservative on this Step up to the plate They have a responsibility in my view too We need to do this collaboratively  Weve taken the steps that they wanted us to take to enable them to do these reforms And I think they need to be ambitious and to recognise the importance of providing products so that people can plan for old age But Yvonne Braun of the Association of British Insurers said the industry was ultimately responding to the law of supply and demand If you wanted to sell to somebody in their s s and s or even s I think you would find it very very difficult Younger people have other financial priorities  specifically paying off their mortgage and supporting their children She said it was more likely that other insurance products such as critical illness cover and life insurance would be adapted to cover care costs James Lloyd director of the Strategic Society think tank said there were always doubts the insurance industry would develop products The government could lower the cap to try to encourage more interest it could just accept that people will have to pay the  in costs or develop its own state insurance model  that has happened in Germany But there really isnt an easy answer
