Federal health officials say theyre still checking into why so many more children than usual appear to be getting very sick from an old virus    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says   while infected with the virus and more than   with it across the country Its an unusual level of activity but the CDC stresses that many more people will have been infected but only had sniffles  certainly not sick enough to justify testing them for the virus This increase could be caused by many different viruses that are common during this time of year EVD appears to be the predominant type of enterovirus this year and is likely contributing to the increases in severe respiratory illnesses CDC said Doctors have been asked to be on the lookout for EVD Its not clear if or how the virus might cause an unusual form of muscle weakness seen in about a dozen children Adding to the confusion onthespot tests that hospitals and testing companies provide dont always specify the virus the CDC says EVD has been previously referred to as human enterovirus  or HEV and human rhinovirus  or HRV They are all the same virus The D stands for enterovirus species D it said in a statement The strains of EVD circulating this year are not new the CDC added CDC working with state health departments has identified at least three separate strains of EVD that are causing infections in the United States this year the most prominent strain is related to the strains of EVD that were detected in the United States in  and  it added There are more than  types of enteroviruses and they infect  million to  million people every year with tens of thousands sick enough to go to the hospital It is common for multiple strains of the same enterovirus type to be cocirculating in the same year Respiratory illnesses can be caused by many different viruses and have similar symptoms Not all respiratory illnesses occurring now are due to EVD Theres no specific drug for the virus or vaccine to prevent it CDC says handwashing is the best way to protect against all sorts of viruses
