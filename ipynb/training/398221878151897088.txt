Children who were conceived with in vitro fertilization have the same overall chance of developing childhood cancers as those conceived naturally scientists reported Wednesday Its a reassuring finding says pediatrician   of University College London who led the study Its a bellwether to the future health of these kids as they grow up Theres always been a question about whether IVF could have a negative impact on a childs longterm health Sutcliffe says Embryos and eggs dont usually see the light of day but these do literally Answering that question has been a lengthy process The study   Wednesday in the   is the largest of its kind And it did uncover a very small rise in risk for two rare cancers But for more common cancers such as leukemia the fertility treatment had no effect The main message about cancer is good news Sutcliffe tells Shots I dont want to overextend the findings of the study But if a population has something going wrong youd think that cancers would start showing up More than  million children have been conceived with IVF The fertility treatment   for more than  percent of all babies born in the US Several studies had found changes in how genes are turned on and off in IVF embryos That   also plays a role in cancer And previous analyses of cancer rates in IVFconceived children have come up with mixed results The current study lays to rest some of this concern and confusion Sutcliffe and his team tracked more than  children conceived by IVF from  to  They then compared the cancer rates in these kids with those observed across the whole population of kids in the United Kingdom The sheer size of the study meant that Sutcliffe and his team could tease out the risk for individual childhood cancers Rates of leukemia brain tumors and kidney cancers were the same in both groups But children conceived with IVF had about a  to  times higher chance of developing a liver cancer called   and a muscle cancer called   We cant be as confident in these findings as in the overall message about cancer because these two cancers are rare Sutcliffe says And the absolute risk for these diseases is still very low For instance about  out of every  million children conceived by IVF developed hepatoblastoma Thats not to say that IVF doesnt come with some risks A study last year in the     a slightly elevated chance of birth defects especially for those conceived by the IVF technique known as intracytoplasmic sperm injection or ICSI But the biggest risk with IVF Sutcliffe says is the high rate of twins and triplets A lot of the health effects including premature birth and low birth weight are related to multiple births he says Because of that IVF children are likely to be born slightly less mature overall Sutcliffe told Shots On the other hand if the baby is a singleton and conceived by IVF he says then really his or her prospects are largely the same as the naturalconceived child
