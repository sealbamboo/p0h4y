Just how many abortion positions does Mitt Romney have   that answer is unclear This time the confusion began Tuesday during a meeting with the editorial board of the   Theres no legislation with regards to abortion that Im familiar with that would become part of my agenda Romney said He went on to add that he would use an executive order to reinstate the   which bars US aid to international groups that lobby or pay for abortions But the comment about not pushing abortionrestricting legislation surprised those on both sides of the abortion debate Thats quite a shock coming from Mitt Romney who has consistently called for the overturn of   who said that he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would do just that who has an extensive prolife agenda on his website that anybody can access says Beth Shipp political director of NARAL ProChoice America That agenda includes things like   which would require legislation Romney has also   to ban abortions at the point fetuses can theoretically feel pain In addition to a terse statement from the campaign vowing that if elected Romney would be a prolife president the candidate himself tried to walk back some of his comments when asked by reporters at a campaign stop Wednesday I think Ive said time and again Im a prolife candidate Ill be a prolife president he said during a rope line in Ohio Even before Romneys walk back however he was being defended if somewhat weakly by abortion opponents No one likes to be caught flatfooted or see your hero flatfooted But those moments do come said Marjorie Dannenfelser president of the Susan B Anthony List Dannenfelser said she thinks Romneys comment to the editorial board was nothing more than a slip  that he just has too much else on his mind to keep issues like abortion front and center I think the simple truth of the matter is his head is in jobs and the economy almost all day long almost every single day she said And of course we want at least a third of his focus to be on it all the time but you dont always get everything that you want NARALs Shipp however thinks its anything but an accident  just as it was no accident when Romney said in a CBS evening news interview in August that he supported abortions when the    not just her life  was threatened That position was also   quietly by staff I know Mitt Romney really wants women to vote for him Shipp says But the way that hes going about this by lying to people about where he stands on the issues is not going to serve him well come Nov  Still political scientist John Green of the University of Akron says what Romney is doing isnt all that unusual Theres a long tradition of candidates adopting one kind of position for a broad audience maybe on television then having a different position in direct mail or in smaller venues he says Green says Romney is running into trouble because in todays world of Twitter and nonstop cable news theres no such thing as being able to deliver different messages to anyone anymore Weve discovered over the last couple of election cycles and weve seen it in many examples this year is that its hard to keep those different venues separate because of our communication technology today Green says With an issue as touchy as abortion that can become even more hazardous says Green The people who really care about something like abortion whether theyre in the Republican base or the Democratic base have very firm convictions on where a candidate should stand he says And variation on those convictions can create very real problems Those problems include both alienating ones own voters and mobilizing those on the other side At least for now however Romney seems to be making it work Theres still nearly a month until Election Day however and two more debates to go
