Top of the morning to you. Another busy day is unfolding on the Pharmalot satellite campus as we juggle sundry duties, which include hustling a short person to the local schoolhouse and, of course, scanning the universe for interesting items. Heard something fascinating yourself? We accept secret stuff. Meanwhile, time to get cracking. So please join us as we host the mandatory cup of stimulation and dig in. Have a good day, everyone….

Meanwhile, Japanese authorities arrested a former Novartis employee for allegedly fabricating study results for the Diovan high blood pressure med. And the FDA delayed approval of the Orexigen Therapeutics diet drug.
