It has been a bruising year for the NHS in England  Report after report has laid bare what has been going wrong It kicked off with the publication in February of the Francis Inquiry into events at the Stafford Hospital which accused the service of betraying patients By the start of the summer another  hospitals with the highest death rates were being hauled over the coals for their failings in their care But it didnt stop there  As autumn came another review  this time on complaints  was scathing about the attitude of the NHS to complaints  The report led by Labour MP Ann Clywd who had broken down on radio over the care given to her late husband said there was a culture of delay and denial Of course controversy has surrounded the health service before After all who can forget how  was dominated by rows over the NHS reforms But that was about how the service was structured  This year has been about the very basics  the quality of care  and so in that sense it has felt different So can the NHS can look forward to calmer times in  Royal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter hopes so  It is his members who have often been in the firing line but he believes this could be a watershed moment for the NHS What has happened this year is probably unprecedented in the history of the NHS he says  There has never been a year like it with all the reviews But what is pleasing is that what we have been talking about is really important  staffing numbers training for healthcare assistants  these are all the things that make a real difference to patients We now have to build on what has happened We dont want all these recommendations to disappear over the next  months Encouragingly Mr Carter believes there are already signs that the reviews are resulting in tangible change  Earlier this month Health Education England announced there would be an  increase in nurse training places meanwhile the government has asked the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to look how safe staffing ratios could be established These are huge movements in the right direction but we need more This year we have had the diagnosis now we need the treatment Mr Carter adds But as always it is unlikely to be plainsailing for the health service According to Chris Hopson chief executive of the Foundation Trust Network the giant hurdle in the way of further progress is money This is perhaps the trickiest position the NHS has ever been in he says  We are looking at a period of  years where money will be incredibly tight and what we are seeing now is a mismatch between what is being asked for and what is achievable These are all good ideas but can we afford them Not in the current financial envelope in the timeframe being talked about So what we now need is an honest debate about what is possible and what is not and whether we want to invest more money in the health service if we want to do everything we are talking about But as  looms into view it is impossible not to consider another factor in this equation An election is now less than  months away and it seems likely the NHS will be playing a major part Is that going to be a blessing or a curse for the future of the health service
