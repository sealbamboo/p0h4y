New York City's adult smoking rate rose to 16.1% in 2013, the third straight year that tobacco use has crept up in a metropolis once known for its innovations in getting people to kick the habit, according to government data released Monday.. City officials and public-health workers blamed a steady drop in funding for anti-tobacco programs for the highest rate of smoking since 2007. For the first time in six years, more than a million New Yorkers said they smoked at least occasionally.
