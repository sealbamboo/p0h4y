Like operations medications and fad diets health care policy is usually appraised with a simple question Does it work or doesnt it  The assumption is that new regulations and practices either cut costs and improve care or they dont and so by simple extension should be either supported or struck down Last month for example on the third anniversary of the passing of the Affordable Care Act   and   marked the occasion by diving headlong onto the doesitordoesntit pigpile freely offering their predictions of whether President Obamas health law would work over the next   or  years I managed to restrain myself but Ive certainly done my time in that fray  Now a   to reconsider how we judge putting health care policies into practice Focusing on outcomes in obesity surgery the study illustrates the breathtaking speed at which clinical medicine can progress and how rapidly policies along with their critics and champions can become obsolete  Health care policy is a moving target and the most effective measures endure as best practices only until new research points the way to even better approaches  Doctors have attempted to use surgery to treat obesity   but it wasnt   that doctors and patients began to view bariatric surgery as an acceptable alternative to diets exercise and medications Fueled by dramatic and   like patients clocking in   the number of   despite the fact that they were still considered experimental and that complications could be significant Pulmonary embolism leaks from the new intestinal connections and even death were all known to result from bariatric surgery and the rates of such mishaps were   In  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS   to socalled centers of excellence To become such a center hospitals needed first to fulfill criteria set by one of two organizations the   or the   The criteria included having two bariatric surgeons on staff and performing at least  obesity operations a year  It was a heady moment for health care policy wonks everywhere they praised the decision as a bold attempt to improve quality and impose standards on a rapidly growing specialty  But in retrospect the centersofexcellence initiative looks one might say     In the years since  surgeons developed new operations incorporated safer techniques and better equipment and began conducting   on complication rates and safety measures Yes Medicare patients who had bariatric surgery    tended to do better confirming a common belief that the CMS coverage decision contributed to the improvement in outcomes and general upsurge in quality of care But   if the improvements were due to the policy or were simply a result of the advances that had occurred over time  To answer this question the authors of the new study reviewed the discharge records of more than  Medicare patients who underwent bariatric surgery before and after the national coverage decision As with previous studies they found that Medicare patients who had their operations after  did better than those who had them earlier The researchers then compared these outcomes to those of patients who were not covered by Medicare and therefore not restricted to having their operations done at centers of excellence Even after adjusting for individual patient risk factors and the specific type of bariatric procedure performed they found no differences in complication rates or outcomes between Medicare and nonMedicare patients Moreover they discovered that many of the improvements had been under way   to  In other words the muchheralded policy of funneling patients to centers of excellence has had little effect on how patients do This is a cautionary tale said Dr Justin B Dimick a bariatric surgeon who is lead author of the paper and director of policy research at the Center for Healthcare Outcomes and Policy at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor While the policy might have been completely appropriate  years ago its important to make sure that the benefits continue to outweigh the harms today For patients who might benefit from weight loss surgery those harms can include foregoing the surgery itself For six months prior to their operation patients are required to participate in regular support groups and meetings with their surgical team Afterward they need to return regularly to the hospital for close medical followup Medicare patients who live far from a Center of Excellence often decide not to have the surgery because of the extensive travel costs and lost time at work if they proceed it is at great personal expense The results of this study have prompted the CMS to   Not all    with lifting the  coverage restrictions but Dr Dimick and his coauthors believe that reviewing all the research and reassessing policy choices is important particularly in a field that has advanced as quickly as theirs Policymaking has to be a dynamic process that reconsiders the evidence as it comes out Dr Dimick said If youre going to keep designating centers of excellence you need to be sure they are actually excellent and actually offering better care than other institutions
