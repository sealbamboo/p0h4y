The moms at Saturdays soccer game let out a collective wow as a yearold girl headed the ball away from the net Then one next to me said Should they be doing that Another said I dont think so But none of us yelled Hey kids no heading the ball Head injuries are a big problem for young athletes who may be more vulnerable for a year after having a concussion according to research published Monday That means students and their parents may have to think hard about when its safe to return to play Im going to guess that lots of parents perhaps most of them wouldnt keep their kids out of hockey or football or lacrosse or other highrisk sport for a year after a concussion   a pediatrician at Boston Childrens Hospital who wasnt involved in the research writes in her   They would take the risk But we still dont know if one year is what it takes to protect kids brains says Dr Matthew Eisenberg the lead author of the study who is an emergency room physician at Boston Childrens We didnt have enough patients to pinpoint the window of vulnerability Eisenberg tells Shots We were nervous about this before and now we see even more reason to be nervous But were not able to say when is the right time to return to activity The patients who had had a concussion in the year before being injured again had symptoms for almost three times as long as those with a first concussion  days compared to  days according to Eisenberg and his colleagues The   appears in the journal   They tracked  patients ages  to  who came to the emergency room at Boston Childrens with a concussion Twothirds of them were injured playing a sport with hockey soccer football and basketball the most common They then followed the patients to see how long it took them to recover Headache and other concussion symptoms can make it impossible for students to do schoolwork Patients are often told not to read use computers or watch TV In the study those age  and over were more likely to have a long recovery time That could be either because neurobiology changes as children mature the researchers theorized or that they are playing harder with more contact and higherforce impacts Any athlete suspected of having a concussion should be removed from play immediately according to   issued earlier this year by the American Academy of Neurology The goal is to reduce a second hit to a recovering brain Despite his findings Eisenberg says he would never tell a parent to keep a child out of sports for a year For every family for every child the situation is going to be different he says Its really important that they get close followup care and make decisions based on whats best for the child
