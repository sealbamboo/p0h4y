British Prime Minister David Cameron has said the government is right to take action to keep our own people safe from the Ebola virus  His comments came after the government decided to screen some people arriving in the UK for the virus Ministers initially said there were no plans to screen people arriving from Liberia Guinea and Sierra Leone Those arriving from areas hit by Ebola face enhanced screening at Heathrow Gatwick and Eurostar terminals  There are no direct flights to the UK from the affected areas but people can fly via Paris or Brussels  Downing Street said passengers would be asked questions and potentially given a medical assessment during the screening process  The Department of Health said further details about   will be announced next week before the measures come into effect A statement said Government departments health protection agencies and the transport sector are continuing to work closely together to minimise the risk It is important to stress that given the nature of this disease no system could offer  protection from nonsymptomatic cases but the overall risk to the public in the UK remains very low Mr Cameron said Quite rightly were taking all the steps we can to keep our own people safe here in the UK What we do is we listen to the medical advice and we act on that advice and thats why were introducing the screening processes at the appropriate ports and airports  Mr Cameron also said What were focusing on as a country is taking action right across the board to deal with this problem at source  Were making a bigger contribution than almost any other country in West Africa to help deal with the crisis at its source Gatwick said on Friday morning it knew nothing about the new measures An airport spokesman said Weve not had anything at all Were still waiting for Public Health England to let us know A Heathrow spokesman said it was working with the health body to implement the measures and reassured passengers the risk of a traveller contracting Ebola had been assessed as low  Eurostar said it was liaising with relevant authorities to work out how it will be implemented  Symptoms of Ebola include fever headache vomiting diarrhoea and bleeding  but these are similar to more common infections like flu and some stomach bugs If you have these symptoms and have had contact with an Ebola patient   Do not go directly to AE or a GP If there has been no contact with Ebola seek help from  your GP or AE if necessary The chances of developing Ebola in the UK are low  BBC transport correspondent Richard Westcott said it would take a few days to get screening in place in the UK  He said My understanding is that its easy to trace the starting point of someones journey even if they transferred flights along the way because effectively they are still travelling on a single ticket which is logged on a computer So it should still be simple to identify most people whove come from those high risk countries unless they really have gone around the houses to get here If one of those people shows any signs of Ebola they might be asked to wait for a few hours at the airport while tests are carried out Our correspondent said before the outbreak just under  people a day flew directly to the UK from the affected areas and added that most travellers wont notice any difference  Home Office minister Norman Baker said the government changed its mind about introducing screening as a result of new advice from the chief medical officer Mr Baker said I think its a good reflection on the government that they listened to professional advice from the chief medical officer and are prepared to change their minds Meanwhile the Foreign Office said it was working with the Macedonian government to investigate the circumstances surrounding a British mans death in the country on Thursday It had been claimed that the man  thought to be   may have had Ebola but Whitehall sources earlier said it was very unlikely he could have contracted the disease The outbreak has already killed more than  people mostly in West Africa with more than  health workers among the victims People leaving areas affected by the outbreak have been subject to checks for some weeks although people do not become infectious until they display symptoms Earlier this week a Spanish nurse became the first person to contract the deadly virus outside of West Africa   Leading global health experts   of the Ebola outbreak Chris Dye from the World Health Organization WHO has told the BBC  He said the international response was helping but needed to continue  A health expert has said that screening is a mistake and that he can not see the point David Mabey professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told BBC Radio s Today programme There will be a lot of delay and disruption as they do not know who to screen The priority should be on testing those who are at risk and become sick said Prof Mabey  Money spent on the screening would be better spent on setting up places where people can go and be tested and telling people where that is he added
