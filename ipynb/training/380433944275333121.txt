The Navy Yard massacre may renew concerns over the potential dangers of mentally ill people who dont get treatment That issue is especially hot right now in Seattle where the mayor has called untreated mental illness an emergency Seattles Pioneer Square is an uneasy mix of art galleries and skid road its gelato over here and heroin over there And then theres mental illness Its scary says James Nevin He says he sees it every day Theres one guy man I walk by him all the time and this guy says the most heinous things Ive ever heard  and then Ill see him a few hours later and hes got the sweetest personality and disposition you could ever possibly have Unstable people have made downtown Seattle jittery lately  for good reason In August a man with a history of mental illness shot and wounded a bus driver then died in a chaotic shootout with police And just last Friday night a selfidentified schizophrenic attacked a couple with a knife wounding the woman and killing her boyfriend This isnt the first time this summer weve seen someone with a mental health issue Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn says On Monday even as news was coming in about the massacre across the country McGinn acknowledged the growing nervousness I do not want to stigmatize people with mental health issues he says Very very few are violent But when someone is violent we have to have the ability to identify that provide services and potentially isolate them so that they cannot harm themselves or others Washington state ranks low in its per capita supply of psychiatric hospital beds and there have been cuts to outpatient mental health care too At the same time lawmakers have made it easier to get someone committed  at least temporarily Amnon Shoenfeld director of mental health for Seattles King County says if someone has a psychotic episode on the streets the cops will pick him up The problem is with the shortage of psychiatric beds that person often ends up parked in an emergency room Youll have somebody whos being held for involuntary commitment probably in restraints on a gurney next to someone whos come in to the emergency room probably for a broken foot Shoenfeld says The situation in Seattle is just the latest chapter in a national story that started  years ago when America began deinstitutionalizing the mentally ill The Treatment Advocacy Center tracks what it sees as the human cost of this policy in an   of preventable tragedies If you look at the  worst the deadliest shootings in our history six of them occurred in the last decade says Doris Fuller head of the organization And of those Virginia Tech Sandy Hook Aurora appear easily associated with mental illness Fuller argues that deinstitionalization went too far that its time to fund more hospital beds more treatment  and when justified to compel that treatment The argument isnt without controversy theres a fear it could lead back to the bad old days of warehoused patients forced by the government to take psychotropic drugs But right now in places like Seattles Pioneer Square theres a growing sense that its time for the pendulum to swing back a bit in that direction
