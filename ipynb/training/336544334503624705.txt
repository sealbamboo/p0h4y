Sugar and especially the highfructose corn syrup that sweetens many processed foods and nearly all soft drinks has been justly demonized for adding nutritionally empty calories to our diet and causing metabolic disruptions linked to a variety of diseases But a closer look at what and how Americans eat suggests that simply focusing on sugar will do little to quell the rising epidemic of   This is a multifaceted problem with deep historical roots and we are doing too little about many of its causes More than a third of American adults and nearly one child in five are now obese according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Our failure to curtail this epidemic is certain to exact unprecedented tolls on health and increase the cost of medical care Effective measures to achieve a turnaround require a clearer understanding of the forces that created the problem and continue to perpetuate it The increase in obesity began nearly half a century ago with a rise in calories consumed daily and a decline in meals prepared and eaten at home According to the Department of Agriculture in  the food supply provided  calories per person per day on average By  this amount had risen to  calories an increase of more than  percent Consuming an extra  calories each day could add nearly  pounds to the average adult in a year Sugar it turns out is a minor player in the rise More than half of the added calories   a day  have come from fats and oils and another  calories from flour and cereal Sugar accounts for only  of the added daily calories Demographic changes and how the food and restaurant industries responded to them compounded the problem As more women entered the work force family meals and especially homecooked meals became less frequent Relatively few husbands became family cooks sadly From  to  according to the Department of Agriculture  percent of American calories were consumed in fastfood and fullservice restaurants more than triple the amount in  Eating just one meal a week away from home can translate into two extra pounds a year for the average person the department calculated Although the recent economic downturn forced more people to dine at home the average adult now eats out nearly five times a week Unless calorie counts are reliably listed on the menu it is impossible to know how many are being consumed in a restaurant  never mind the bread butter chips and dip that people eat while waiting to be served Portions have grown along with waistlines Restaurants know that Americans love bargains and providing huge portions doesnt add substantially to overhead Although some weightconscious diners will share an entree or take home half a meal for another day most people tend to eat what they are served These restaurants are training diners to believe a serving of food is much larger than what dietitians would consider a proper portion Now even when eating at home people pile too much on their plates Portions of other foods also have ballooned Bagels once two ounces and  calories now weigh up to  ounces and supply  calories even before anything is put on them A Costco corn muffin has  calories and a healthysounding raisin bran muffin from Au Bon Pain has  Coffee is no longer a caloriefree beverage A Starbucks ounce latte with  percent milk has  calories and a ounce Frappuccino has   about as much as a ounce Coke with  calories from  teaspoons of sugar People are often fooled by the healthy aura of a food like yogurt Yoplait which has trumped the market in recent years is really dessert Yoplait French Vanilla has  grams of sugar twice as much as a serving of Lucky Charms Greek yogurt the current national passion is really just strained yogurt higher in protein fat unless fatfree and calories than regular yogurt And although frozen yogurt typically supplies  calories an ounce most people consume much more than they realize The serveyourself frozen yogurt store that recently opened on my corner provides cups that if filled would contain  ounces thats  calories not counting toppings Although restaurants and packaged food producers often say that they are simply giving customers what they want Hank Cardello and colleagues at the Hudson Institute a policy research organization recently reported that among leading consumer packaged goods companies and restaurant chains those that have grown their betterforyoulowercalorie foods and beverages over the past five years   Toxic though it may be the problem is not just this environment of food Researchers now know that people who struggle with weight are battling evolution itself which has programmed us to store calories when food is plentiful and when food is scarce to reduce calories we expend When an overweight person cuts down significantly on what he eats the body defends itself by using fewer calories The effect can be longlasting If a persons weight drops to  pounds from  significantly fewer calories must be consumed daily to stay at that weight than would be necessary if the person had never been overweight Even if a pound person loses  pounds he needs  percent fewer calories to maintain the new weight than someone who always weighed  Short of bariatric surgery very gradual weight loss  say no more than  pounds a year  may be the only way around this metabolic slowdown This strategy gives the body and appetite a chance to adjust Willpower rarely helps people who struggle with their weight With constant temptations to eat more and especially more highcalorie foods our society must change Instead of subsidies for corn used to produce highfructose corn syrup let the government subsidize more fresh fruits and vegetables Michael Pollan an author and journalism professor at the University of California Berkeley has said it best Eat food Not too much Mostly plants His newest book Cooked A Natural History of Transformation adds a corollary And cook it yourself No time People always have time for what they consider important and what is more important than your health Homecooked food contains better ingredients and you know what youre eating
