A team of researchers from the City of Hope in Duarte has developed a speedy way to identify drugs and chemicals that can disrupt the balance of sex hormones in human beings and influence the development and progress of diseases such as breast cancer In a trial screening of  drugs in wide circulation the new assay singled out the popular antidepressant paroxetine better known by its commercial name Paxil as having a weak estrogenic effect that could promote the development and growth of breast tumors in women This is important because as many as a quarter of women being treated for breast cancer suffer from depression  a condition most commonly treated with antidepressants known as SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors including Paxil which has been on the market since  Almost a quarter of American women in their s and s are taking an antidepressant mostly SSRIs Last summer the Food and Drug Administration approved the marketing of a low dose of paroxetine  repackaged under the commercial name Brisdelle  as a nonhormonal treatment for hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms About  of breast cancers in women are sensitive to estrogen meaning that the hormone found plentifully in females of childbearing age contributes to their growth The novel screening method developed at City of Hope described in a forthcoming issue of the journal Toxicological Sciences also identified two antifungal medications  biconazole and oxyconazole  as having an antiestrogenic effect similar to that of medications prescribed to prevent breast cancer and its recurrences in women Incidental to their intended use in combating fungal infections those medications inhibit the action of aromatase an enzyme that converts androgens  hormones more plentiful in males but present in both sexes  into estrogen Less surprising the highthroughput screening mechanism identified bisphenol A  a compound used in the manufacture of plastics and epoxy resins  as an estrogen promoter capable of raising breast cancer risk The discovery that Paxil behaves as an endocrinedisrupting chemical may shed light on growing suspicions about the medication in women who have had breast cancer A  study found that breast cancer patients in Canada who were taking Paxil were more likely than those taking other antidepressants to die of breast cancer when there was a substantial overlap in their use of that antidepressant and of tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer recurrence The researchers surmised that paroxetine which was taken by about a quarter of the depressed breast cancer patients in the study might block the production of a liver enzyme needed to metabolize tamoxifen The authors of the latest research said paroxetines weak estrogenic effect may be responsible in part for the observed reduction in tamoxifens effectiveness in that study The finding that paroxetine has estrogenic effects has implications for patients with estrogensensitive breast cancer who are on other medications said Shiuan Chen professor and chairman of City of Hopes department of cancer biology and lead author of the study To confirm paroxetines estrogenic action the researchers performed a further analysis that found that many of the genes whose activity is altered by paroxetine are genes that also respond to estrogen But the researchers said the assay does not show whether the antidepressant medication alters the activity of estrogen directly or by indirect means An earlier version of this post misspelled Shiuan Chens first name as Shihuan
