When it comes to taking care of aging mothers biology is destiny Or to be more precise biology plus geography equals destiny  Or to quote The Shirelles circa  if youre the daughter who lives closest when your mother needs help Baby its you Weve known for a long time that despite decades of social change elder care remains largely a female task Most studies find that women account for about twothirds of caregivers We know it can be a very tough job But theres a lot about how certain women wind up becoming caregivers that we dont know Theres all this research on the effects of caregiving on people and virtually nothing about who is the one who winds up doing it said Karl Pillemer a gerontologist at Cornell University Why does Jane become the caregiver when Billy and Betty dont  For almost  years Dr Pillemer and his collaborator J Jill Suitor a Purdue University sociologist have been wading into family dynamics in later life trying to figure out who shoulders this task Along the way theyve learned that despite the supposed cultural taboo against family favoritism   Moreover mothers often have clear expectations about which child they want and expect to care for them in later life  generally a daughter But what happens when the crunch really comes and decisions are made The researchers latest   recently published online in The Gerontologist shows that among siblings if you live closer youre vastly more likely to have caregiving thrust upon you Dr Pillemer said And if youre the nearest daughter its really likely The researchers were a little startled themselves by this scenario which appears to ignore almost  years of upheavals in womens lives and roles Its almost like being back at the turn of the century Dr Pillemer said Dr Pillemer and Dr Suitor first interviewed the mothers nearly  of them between  and  Seven years later they returned for a second round of interviews with those who had needed assistance during the previous two years either because theyd had a serious illness or were no longer able to manage without help By then the mothers  in this later sample were in their s and s All sorts of personal history and relationship issues would factor into who wound up as caregivers the researchers hypothesized They figured it would be those children who were closest to their mothers emotionally who had earlier received support from their mothers and who had fewer competing demands on their time like work spouses or children of their own Nope A feeling of shared values was of borderline significance but otherwise none of those presumed factors played much of a part The decision came down to gender daughters were more than twice as likely to become caregivers as sons And proximity children within a twohour drive were six times likelier to provide care than those farther away Most of the time those were the very children their mothers had identified as their expected caregivers years before they needed help They were remarkably accurate Dr Pillemer said Researchers often insist that a studys findings are more complicated than they seem but in this case they may be simpler than they appear Dr Pillemer said The caregiving daughters most in their s and s were predominantly boomer working women but theres still this very traditional expectation When that expectation gets thwarted when mothers arent cared for by the child they prefer   the researchers had earlier found Lets pause for a moment to acknowledge that yes sons often take on this role and handle it splendidly In fact The Times ran a long story a few years ago explaining that for a variety of reasons   Moreover the Boston results might have differed if the scientists had interviewed aging fathers One reason mothers wanted daughters to help them Dr Pillemer said was their apparent discomfort with having sons assist with intimate tasks like bathing or using a toilet Still the findings concur with other research showing that caregiving remains largely womens work How is that going to work in coming years when old people will no longer have an average of four children and more adult daughters are in the work force and when the caregiving tasks will likely have grown even more demanding It doesnt seem tenable as we go into a vastly different configuration Dr Pillemer acknowledged Despite what mothers want
