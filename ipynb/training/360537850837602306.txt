After too many drinks the motorcycle enthusiast in his s had driven off the side of the road As one of the doctorsintraining covering trauma that night I was responsible for his initial physical exam but it wasnt going to be easy He was enormous his feet hung over the flimsy emergency room gurney and his neck bulged out of the stiff cervical collar Moreover he was what the older nurses called a mean drunk so it was with more than a little apprehension that I began palpating and poking He glared at me his eyes filled with loathing and his thick muscles twitched under my every touch I moved from his head down to his shoulders and chest relieved not to have to look in those eyes But when I pushed against his ribs feeling for any instability that might signify broken ribs he shouted and raised one of his massive arms as if to hit me On his biceps under the splattered blood I could make out a brilliant indigo swastika  I shuddered The patient had suffered only broken bones so after my evaluation I was happy to leave him to the orthopedic surgeons When I expressed my relief to a colleague he smiled Im sure it freaked him out to have an Asian woman taking charge of his care he said after I had described the patients menacing tattoo and threatening reaction to me  But then my colleague paused What   need to do is turn this into a teaching moment he finally said without the slightest hint of irony Sit down with the patient and educate him about racism  I remembered this colleagues nave remark and the burly patient with the swastika tattoo when I read  in a recent issue of The Annals of Internal Medicine on the medical professions attitude toward patients who discriminate against doctors Since Hippocrates physicians have embraced the ideal of caring for all patients regardless of who they might be While the father of medicine struggled to be openminded when it came to caring for slaves doctors more recently have wrestled with caring for patients of different races gender and sexual orientation In  the American Medical Association codified its opinion on the issue issuing in its   a mandate that doctors could not refuse to care for patients based on any invidious discriminatory criteria like race or ethnicity   But what does the doctor do when the patient discriminates In his thoughtprovoking essay Dr Jain an attending physician at the Boston VA Medical Center describes an encounter with a hospitalized patient who is upset over a pharmacy regulation Frustrated that he cannot obtain his usual type of insulin the patient turns on Dr Jain   are so incompetent he says Why dont you go back to India  The patients outburst calls up painful memories for Dr Jain who fires back angry retorts as he walks out of the patients room only to regret later what he has done He hands over the patients care to another doctor but finds when he seeks out the advice and support of colleagues that they are quick to admonish him and even make light of the patients behavior One doctor even urges Dr Jain to go back to the patients room and apologize  What are our obligations Dr Jain writes when we are the subject of their inhumanity cruelty or intolerance The essay illustrates the paradox that exists in medicines attitude toward race Doctors are under strict ethical provisions not to refuse patients and in medical school and during training they learn to filter their own responses in order to help patients feel safe and secure  But many extend these lessons in modulating ones responses to situations where patients make demands and behave in ways that in any other public setting would be considered discriminatory or even racist One   up to almost a third of doctors would without question concede to a patients demand for physicians of a certain race ethnicity gender or religion  Its medicines open secret said Kimani PaulEmile an associate professor of law at Fordham University who   on the topic The medical profession knows this happens but doesnt want to talk about it The repercussions of this professional blind eye are most difficult not for doctors but for nurses aides and other staff Unlike physicians who might experience such discrimination on occasion nonphysician providers and hospital or nursing home workers are in a particularly vulnerable position because they are in constant contact with patients and have less control over policies regarding patient requests   involved a hospital that barred a black nurse from caring for or even touching a white patients baby revealing the extent to which patient requests are accommodated But there is a far larger problem with what sociologists and psychologists   subtle but crippling insults indignities and demeaning behavior Nurses and ancillary staff are on the front lines of patient care Dr Jain said They feel the effects of our willingness to accept a wide range of behaviors from patients every day  The answer however isnt easy Race and ethnicity appear to  on patients experience of being ill and their sense of satisfaction with care  Moreover   indicate that a providers race ethnicity gender and even social class   make a difference Patients tend to receive better care from providers who are most like them Still the medical professions current stance is far from ideal   in medical schools and training programs to increase diversity among the next generation of doctors will likely have an effect but much more needs to be done to foster open and nuanced discussions of the professions attitude toward race and ethnicity and to assess the professions at times overly exuberant interpretations of putting the patient first Theres something wrong Dr Jain said when a person can go to work be subject to intolerance or abuse and have it be ignored and accepted by colleagues as part of the job
