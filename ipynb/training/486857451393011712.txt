The patient was in her late s and wouldnt have started regular colonoscopies until she was  so her pelvic exam caught the precancerous condition early   I feel like my astute gynecologist saved my life the patient told me  And this patient knows a few things about medicine shes   the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention So if pelvic exams can find bad things why did the   recommend doctors skip them This group of internal medicine doctors  theyre not gynecologists  said that while there may be some success stories those are merely anecdotes The group said there are no actual studies showing pelvic exams help women and it believes the exams could actually hurt them As someone with a masters degree in public health this made sense to me But since my own annual exam is coming up I decided to take a closer look My conclusion the American College of Physicians has made some judgments based on some very thin research So I am going to continue getting my exams Heres why During a pelvic exam the doctor inserts a speculum to open the vagina and look inside for things that shouldnt be there such as growths on the cervix If youre due for a Pap smear the doctor will do one at this point in the exam  Since the doctor cant see the uterus fallopian tubes and ovaries he or she then removes the speculum and inserts two gloved fingers into the vagina and places the other hand on the lower abdomen to feel for abnormalities such as inflammation tumors or cysts  Doctors have been doing this exam on women with no gynecological symptoms for as long as anyone can remember There are plenty of studies showing the Pap smear saves lives but does a visual and manual inspection do any good  The American College of Physicians looked and didnt find a single study that assessed whether routine pelvic exams save lives or make women healthier  I dont want to do an exam that doesnt have any documented benefit said Dr Hanna Bloomfield who with funding from the Veterans Health Administration reviewed the medical literature for the American College of Physicians I get it but just because no ones ever sat down and studied these exams doesnt mean theyre useless  it just means no ones studied them So I called up a handful of gynecologists to ask if theyd ever made any great saves like Gerberdings gynecologist  While the catches might not be as dramatic theyve all caught bad stuff women wouldnt have known about otherwise warts on a womans cervix HPV lesions that could have spread to a sexual partner benign ovarian cysts that werent painful but could twist and rupture and on occasion they found ovarian cancer  That left me thinking I do want this exam unless it causes me too much harm    The American College of Physicians says physical harms may include urinary tract infections  Yikes I dont want a urinary tract infection But whats the evidence that this actually happens   Strangely the organizations guidelines didnt give any so I called Dr Amir Qaseem the lead author He told me he got his information from the evidence report written by Bloomfield but when I looked at that report there was nothing  So I gave Bloomfield a call  The data about urinary tract infections is bad data so I didnt include it in the final version of my report she said I dont know why they put that in the guidelines   The past president of the American College of Physicians Dr Molly Cooke says both as a doctor and a patient urinary tract infection doesnt  figure into my benefitharms calculus  Okay I thought to myself If the former president of the American College of Physicians isnt worried I wont be either So what should I worry about  Unnecessary surgery according to the college  Sometimes your doctor will do a pelvic exam and see or feel something that they think is worrisome but is actually a big nothing and you have surgery you didnt need  That sounds legitimate But again wheres the evidence The American College of Physicians cites one study That study done in Greece looked at  healthy women whose doctors found something worrisome on their pelvic exams These women had more testing and doctors decided to do laparoscopic surgery on  of them Ovarian cancer was found in two of these women so the American College of Physicians concluded that the other  had unnecessary surgery   There are two problems with this conclusion One while these women didnt have ovarian cancer during the surgery doctors did find other things such as benign ovarian cysts that were removed Maybe this was unnecessary Or maybe it helped  Bloomfield the associate chief of staff for research at the Veterans Administration Healthcare System in Minneapolis agreed that some of these surgeries she deemed unnecessary might actually have been helpful Its impossible to know because the Greek paper contains very few details  The second problem with labeling these surgeries unnecessary is that the Greek women got their care from  to  Doctors are now much more adept at weeding out people who dont need surgery because of better imaging technology To extrapolate anything from a study done in Greece in  to the US in  is unconscionable says Dr Barbara Levy vice president of health policy at the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists The professional organization is not going to change its recommendations in light of this report saying they believe pelvic exams can still be valuable So we have different doctors with different opinions You and I get to be empowered patients and decide who we agree with  For me I dont want to miss something that could be serious Ill take the small chance that an exam will lead me to an unnecessary surgery because before I would have that surgery I would ask good questions and get a second or third opinion if necessary to make sure I really needed it So ladies if you choose to have a routine pelvic exam do it with your vagina and your eyes wide open Know that science isnt perfect But also know that you and not a group of doctors looking at that imperfect science will make that decision
