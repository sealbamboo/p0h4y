It was a village of lepers who saved the Yang family as they fled their village in Laos amid the communist takeover of the country in  Nearly  years later the memories can still make MayKao Hang her married name cry But she hopes her story of resilience can point the way to helping the latest crop of kids to suffer from war displacement and disruption    A   released by UNICEF this week finds that more than  million Syrian children have missed out on medical attention a safe home food or schools since the civil war started there three years ago Even if the war stopped tomorrow they would bear physical and mental scars for life For many the trauma will fester research on past survivors suggests turning into mental illness or even physical pain And even for success stories like Hang the pain of war and displacement is hard to get past Trauma is not something that you overcome Its just something that you live with says Hang now president and chief executive officer of the   which helps troubled children and their families in St Paul Minn Childhood trauma is among the biggest risk factors for mental disorders and depression says Dr Kerry Ressler a psychiatrist specializing in fear anxiety and trauma at Emory and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute One of the first and most lasting symptoms may be insomnia says Kristin Bulin executive director for the Center for Survivors of Torture  War Trauma in St Louis They dont feel safe so they dont sleep That leads not only to tiredness but anxiety and an inability to think clearly Survivors often develop physical symptoms such as backache headaches and even migraine They suffer from intrusive thoughts  memories about a traumatic event that wont go away and even flashbacks when for a few moments they are literally reliving the terror But researchers are also discovering clues to how to help kids recover Ressler says there are behaviors that predict whether a person will do well after surviving a traumatic event Like avoidance he said Avoidance of scenes that remind people of the trauma or avoidance of other people We know that  if you stop avoiding and do the thing you are afraid of you can overcome that Therapy can help kids get over that fear before they start developing dangerous behaviors Ressler says But it must be handled carefully Hang remembers when wellmeaning teachers showed her fifthgrade class a film about the Vietnam War I burst into tears crying she says I didnt know why I was crying That often happens to children who have survived war People are trying to be nice to them and they open up a new wound Hang still chokes up at the memory of fleeing her home village in Laos then being ambushed and shot at by Communist rebels in the midst of a monsoon They survived only because they stumbled into a village of people with leprosy who belonged to the same Hmong ethnic group as her family Lepers saved our lives They sheltered us and took care of us says Hang It took more than a year to get to a new life in the United States after a trek over the mountains and into Thailand and then a miserable time living mostly outdoors in refugee camps Finally in  two young women sponsored Hangs family She was just  One factor working in Hangs favor Most of her family stayed together Research shows that preserving family structure can help keep kids together mentally Theres a lot of capacity for resilience given opportunities given the support of other people says child psychologist Ann Masten of the University of Minnesota whos treated survivors of the killing fields of Cambodia among other refugees It is clearly easier if they are moving with their families or with a closeknit group of people A loss of trust can cause some of the most debilitating effects Ressler says  whether its a child abused by a parent or a child whos survived a government attack on her village For kids their primary relationships are their families so if their family is together it can buffer those risks Ressler said Some kids in fact seem to be made stronger by their survival Ressler said The key in those cases is having a sense of control over their lives They have strong family support a sense of mastery or a sense of positive emotions he said One can go through a lot of trauma but still come out and feel some level of control over ones survival Hang feels that One thing that helped me was having really high expectations from the people in my life about what I could achieve and accomplish says Hang All five of her brothers and sisters finished college and Hang went to Brown University on a full scholarship even after years of poverty Little things helped too like an art prize she won in seventh grade Hang says High selfesteem boosts resiliency agrees Amy Richmond of Save the Children whose organization  this week on Syrian kids But kids need help getting there Their basic needs must be met first Hang and the other experts agree Maybe all a kid needs is to have his next meal taken care of so he can pay attention in school for the day Hang says What helps most is giving children structure  predictable routines places activities chores This can happen even in the   Ressler says There is something about that sense of stability that sense of predictability that can add a lot to an otherwise difficult world he said Save the Children sets up safe spaces for kids to play They train fellow refugees to boost the kids confidence in a loving way  training that can follow the children and their adult caregivers into a new life Genes are also clearly involved in making people resilient Theres a batch of genes linked with PTSD and anxiety including two that appear to help regulate the production of stress hormones And about a decade ago researchers found a gene that made people more prone to depression after a serious life event Cultural factors count too Research shows kids who keep a familiar connection to spirituality moral values and a sense of hope fare better People who are encouraged to keep their own cultural values tend to do better Masten said A study of Sri Lankan refugees showed that orphans often said embracing their cultures Buddhist ideals helped But most of what helps seems to come from within Masten says The people who werent resilient died she said Research also shows the trauma of war doesnt stop with the victims who live through it A growing body of evidence suggests that mental trauma may be passed down from one generation to the next Ressler led a highly publicized study last year in which mice   about a specific odor from their fathers Parents can pass along their anxiety in other ways too Even if parents are consistent if they are nervous and anxious the kids can watch and learn from that he said
