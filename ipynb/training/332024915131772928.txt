The past couple of months have been unsettling ones for meat eaters in Shanghai In March more than  dead pigs   in a stretch of the Huangpu River  a main source of the citys drinking water Local officials insisted both the water and the citys pork supply were safe but they never explained exactly how the pigs died or how they ended up in the river One working theory was that farmers upstream in neighboring Zhejiang province dumped the dead pigs after officials there cracked down on the practice of selling diseased pork to local markets On Chinas increasingly irreverent social media some people tried to look on the bright side and suggested that Shanghais river had essentially become a giant bowl of pork soup Soon afterward another far more serious meat problem emerged in this city of  million The   showed up in live fowl in Shanghais fresh meat and produce markets The government shut down live poultry sellers and killed more than  chickens ducks and other birds One apartment complex downtown even penned off a handful of black swans warning residents to keep their distance just in case The virus has killed  people in Shanghai home to nearly half of all the fatal cases in China Scientists   so far the virus appears to be transmitted from birds to people and theres no clear evidence of sustainable humantohuman transmission which could spark a pandemic Some city restaurants including a Sichuanese place where I order Kung Pao chicken stopped serving chicken but many others continue to stock it On May  a national holiday a KFC on Nanjing Road Shanghais main shopping street was jammed at lunchtime Im not worried said a man named Yang as he considered his New Orleans chicken burger Its common knowledge that the virus will be killed under high temperature So judging from existing reports it is safe to eat chicken As for mutton well that came into question last week after police   that they had busted a crime ring that had passed off more than  million worth of rat and other small mammal meat as mutton The gang allegedly used additives to spice up rat fox and mink meat to sell in markets in Shanghai and neighboring Jiangsu province since  The arrests were part of a nationwide crackdown that netted more than  suspects and more than  tons of fake or inferior meat Following some of Shanghais food safety problems   an Englishlanguage satire site issued a   about city officials encouraging residents to eat more healthfully The slogan for Shanghais new campaign Go Vegan If You Want To Live
