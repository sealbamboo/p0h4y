Walter Bianco has had hepatitis C for decades Hes known about it for  years And now hes reaching the end of the road The liver is at the stage next to becoming cirrhotic the yearold Arizona man says That means hes approaching the end stage of hepatitis C infection   is a precursor of   which requires a transplant And it can lead to   More and more baby boomers like Bianco are approaching this stage of chronic hepatitis C infection   that  to  million Americans have the insidious virus Many like Bianco got it from injecting illegal drugs in their youth He says hes been drug and alcoholfree for  years Some got it from transfusions before  a period when blood wasnt screened for the virus Some got infected from sharing razors or toothbrushes or from contaminated needles used for tattoos or hospital equipment Some got it from sexual transmission Whatever the source of infection Biancos ominous situation is increasingly common There isnt a day that goes by where I dont have a story very similar to Mr Biancos says   of Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale Ariz Biancos liver specialist Vargas has been trying for two years to stave off the deadly complications of Biancos infection So far nothing has worked But theres a very good chance that Bianco can be cured of his hepatitis C Potent new drugs can clear the virus from his body for good People are ecstatic Vargas says It really is amazing to be seeing whats happening These new drugs are curing more than  percent of patients  virtually  percent in some   Just a few years ago cure rates were  percent or less But theres a big problem the cost One of the new drugs called   brand name Sovaldi costs  per pill Vargas says Sovaldi combined with another new drug called   Olysio is highly effective in patients like Bianco And the new drugs are easy to take Bianco says the older drugs caused horrible side effects Just terrible itching terrible headaches nausea But Medicare wont pay for the drugs that Vargas says Bianco needs Medicare officials wouldnt comment on coverage of new hepatitis C drugs A spokesman says the federal program turns such decisions over to private insurers that administer   One of those private insurers has twice rejected Vargas prescription because the Food and Drug Administration hasnt approved use of the two drugs in combination Last week Olysios maker   the FDA for approval of the regimen Together the two drugs would cost around   far more than Bianco can afford It is a lot of money and there are a lot of hep C sufferers out there Bianco says I think the Medicare were probably thinking that if we can hold off for a year or two some of these following drugs will be cheaper But Vargas says Bianco like many others with endstage liver disease may not have that long to wait If he were my father the Mayo specialist says I would want Mr Bianco to be treated now  not in a year not in a year and a half  A spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services called NPR to report that the agency is looking into Walter Biancos case The policy is trying to catch up with reality the CMS spokesman said asking not to be identified by name It has been a slow process We want to try to be helpful as much as we can to get beneficiaries the drugs that they need Its   how insurers and government programs will cope with the problem The Department of Veterans Affairs and expert panels recently recommended reserving the new drug regimens for patients awaiting liver transplants and others with the most advanced liver disease But consumer advocates cringe at the idea that patients may have to wait for a cure until their livers have suffered irreversible damage For one thing once a patient has cirrhosis he will have to be monitored for liver cancer every six months for the rest of his life If I had a chronic infectious disease that could lead to advanced liver disease and complications Id want to be treated says Ryan Clary of the   an advocacy group The news is the cure is here We need to get people into treatment But those asked to pay the bill for treatment are   at the hundreds of billions of dollars that hepatitis C drugs could cost them Olysio costs around  per patient for a week course of treatment Sovaldi costs  People were very shocked by the price because it hit a psychological barrier in terms of This is too expensive  says   of Beth Israel Deaconess hospital in Boston She recently was turned down in her request to prescribe the two drugs for a Medicare patient But Graham says the cost per patient for hepatitis C drugs is not unique We have a lot of drugs where we spend in that  to  range  and the outcome is not cure Graham says alluding to   for rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis and cancer The cost problem with hepatitis C drugs is that millions of people will need them in the near future especially as federally recommended screening programs to detect infected people ramp up Graham says many of these patients cant wait long for their chance at a cure Hepatitis C is a ticking time bomb she says We have a very limited amount of time to get in here and alter the course of the disease for a good number of people If that doesnt happen she says a lot of them will suffer liver failure and liver cancer And that will cost a lot more to treat in the long run
