Think theres nothing more wholesome than a tub of popcorn and a classic childrens animated film Guess again say Canadian researchers When it comes to bigscreen murder and mayhem kids animated films pack the deadliest wallop of all topgrossing films according to a   published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Rather than being the innocuous form of entertainment they are assumed to be childrens animated films are rife with onscreen death and murder wrote lead study author Ian Colman an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Ottawa and his colleagues Among other findings Colman and his colleagues found that murder occurred three times more often in topgrossing animated childrens films than it did in comparable adult dramas In fact the parents of main characters were the primary targets of onscreen death in childrens flicks and were five times as likely to meet an untimely end than they were in films for adults There was no evidence to suggest these results had changed over time since  when Snow Whites stepmother the evil queen was struck by lightning forced off a cliff and crushed by a boulder while being chased by seven vengeful dwarves the authors wrote The analysis appeared in BMJs tongueincheek Christmas issue which has explored such topics as the onscreen tippling habits of James Bond the propensity for idiotic behavior in male   and why your doctors waiting room has such old magazines The cartoon study according to authors was inadvertently inspired by some advice Colman received from a friend Youre watching Finding Nemo with your children this evening Take my advice skip over the first  minutes The authors conducted their research by watching  topgrossing North American films since  The films included  childrens animated movies and  dramatic films for adults Childrens films that featured only robots planes or cars were excluded as the concept of mortality for a nonliving yet anthropomorphized character is unclear the authors wrote The researchers found that twothirds of the cartoons depicted the death of an important character compared with half of those in adult dramas The authors note that childrens literature and the works of the brothers Grimm have long featured gruesome deaths However as child mortality rates have decreased over the centuries the researchers say death has become an increasingly taboo subject to discuss with children As such many youngsters may be unprepared for what they encounter in a Grated Disney film Exposure to onscreen death and violence can be frightening to young children and can have intense and longlasting effects authors wrote This might be particularly problematic when children have not been prepared through candid discussion with parents or caring adults to face these themes
