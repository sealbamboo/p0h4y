Its October The rota coordinator is grinning smugly Those months of swapping shifts for weddings and holidays are a mere figment of their imagination as this year they will give themselves Christmas off A common payoff for nurses doctors and other healthcare professionals that sign up to coordinate rotas is that they can assign themselves to a warm house with family around them at Christmas and New Year The question is why do we as a profession find the thought of working at this time of the year so galling when in reality it can actually be the most uplifting time to be at work Last Christmas Day I woke up at am I put on a festive dress and drove for an hour towards my place of work leaving my family behind I felt depressed and sorry for myself while Facebook confirmed that several other friends were ranting about their poor fortunes too I walked through the doors and immediately a porter with a Santa hat wished me a merry Christmas I mustered a smile and went to answer the dreaded bleep On the way everybody I passed including patients in dressing gowns seemed to stop me in my tracks and at the very least gave me a smile all very American for a Londoner like myself Thirteen hours and counting After a mildly amusing handover and tales of commiseration on how we were all so harddoneby I trotted off to the high dependency respiratory ward to check on the patients On arrival the domestic services staff were already preparing a special lunch for all the patients and their relatives the nurses had tinsel in their hair there was a copious amount of Quality Street on the desk and there was a rumour that the local church congregation was coming to sing carols at midday Adiditionally restrictions on visiting times had been removed so the ward was full of families who had transplanted their Christmas Day to a district general hospital Every patient I spoke to thanked me for being there and some relatives that Id never met gave me a card By the time the choir arrived I was in such a good mood that I didnt care that the canteen had charged me  for a piece of turkey that resembled nondescript white cardboard uncooked sprouts and a Christmas pudding that was primarily cold lard When I started working as a junior doctor I was surprised at the lack of morale among staff and the rudeness I encountered when we were all trying to do our best It is exhausting you end up resenting your career choice and most people are in the same boat Suddenly on this day I had been dreading my utopian view of the   came true We all worked together there was no backbiting and the patients indomitable spirit put a spring in my step I then had one of the worst and most profound moments of my career Late on in my shift an extremely ill young woman died unexpectedly and her elderly mother was called in for the bad news to be broken My colleague disappeared and before I knew it the patients mother had arrived on the ward Apart from feeling angry at the other doctor for vanishing my main emotion was one of dread I had broken bad news before but this was Christmas Day I took the mother into a side room with a nurse and had to bite the inside of my mouth as I told her She stood up gave me a hug and thanked me for being brave Here is a woman receiving some of the worst news a person can hear and she was concerned for me I was really proud of our National   Service on that day If you are working this year I hope you enjoy your cardboard turkey feel sick from the Quality Street and wear your Christmas jumper with pride
