The exact cause of prisoner Jerome Murdoughs death at Rikers Island in February is still under investigation But the temperature in the cell when he was found in New York Citys biggest jail was at least  degrees The death of Murdough who had severe mental illness called renewed attention to a longstanding problem maintaining reasonable temperatures in jails and prisons The high temperatures at some US facilities can form a dangerous  even deadly  combination with   Medications can make the mentally ill more susceptible to heat and some prison guards say its not safe for them either Dr Susi Vassallo grew up in Texas so shes not afraid of heat But the physician and New York University medical school professor still remembers her reaction when she stood in a nonairconditioned prison cell one summer When you closed the  doors they had just little dots in them which provided any ventilation from the outside she says Even after five minutes  it was absolutely stifling  it was inconceivable to live there  hours a day day after day Vassallo an expert on heatrelated illnesses is often called to testify in lawsuits about temperatures in jails and prisons She says that for most people those conditions are uncomfortable but that those with some health conditions  including high blood pressure and diabetes or those taking certain medications  can be much more sensitive For those prisoners exposure to heat can lead to longterm health consequences or death And the number of inmates prone to this sensitivity has been growing the elderly prison population has been increasing for years and people with mental illness make up a disproportionate percentage of inmates in the US Prisoners rights lawyers and others have been arguing for decades about what constitutes a reasonable temperature One lawyer Mercedes Montagnes filed a lawsuit last year demanding that the heat index  a calculation of heat and humidity  on Louisianas death row not go above  degrees A judge agreed and   but thats on hold as the state appeals the decision Montagnes knows that plenty of people outside prison dont have air conditioning But prisoners have a right to reasonable temperatures and cant escape the heat the way the unincarcerated can she says Those individuals have the ability to go to a freezer to get cold water to go to a mall to go to a movie theater  to take action in order to mitigate the effect of the heat on them she says The argument for air conditioning prisons has found allies in some unlikely places Last year   against the states Department of Corrections Lance Lowry a former prison guard in Texas who now works with the guards union says the corrections officers have many of the same heatsensitive health conditions as prisoners  obesity diabetes high blood pressure even mental illness Officers frequently suffer from heat cramps and a lot of heat illnesses Lowry says He says prisoners are harder to manage in the heat too  there are more fights and more psychiatric emergencies Texas is among several states facing lawsuits over    of the more than  prison beds in the state only about  are climatecontrolled Because of that litigation state officials wouldnt talk on the record but the state corrections department said in a statement that it is trying to mitigate the high temperatures Those efforts include   to test at seven facilities Former Texas warden Keith Price now a professor of criminology and sociology at West Texas AM University said that its important to accommodate heatsensitive prisoners but that inmates also need to acknowledge that prison is not a fivestar hotel You know they dont get to go get a cheeseburger whenever they want to either Price said So I mean you know theres a certain amount of things that you give up when you become incarcerated
