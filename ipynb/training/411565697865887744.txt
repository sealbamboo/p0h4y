Well look what showed up on our doorstep The Western Hemisphere has an unwelcome visitor a painful tropical illness called chikungunya fever And it doesnt look like the hardtosay illness is leaving anytime soon You can hear how to pronounce it   After being a problem in Africa and southern Asia for decades the chikungunya virus has made its way to the Caribbean the World Health Organization   Tuesday The virus cropped up in the French part of St Martin in October Since then it has infected at least two people WHO said About twenty more cases are likely This is the first time that locally acquired transmission of chikungunya has been detected in the WHO Americas Region the agency said in a statement Global health researchers have been predicting the mosquitoborne illness would come our way sooner rather than later The   virus attacks the joints and causes fever headaches and arthritis symptoms The disease usually goes away after a few days But sometimes the joint pain can last for weeks even months In fact the muscle and joint pain are infamous and give the disease its name Chikungunya roughly translates to that which bends up in the   language describing the stooped posture of a person infected with the virus There are no treatments or vaccines for chikungunya But fatalitis are rare the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   And once youve been infected youre likely to have lifelong immunity The only way to prevent it is to stay away from its source  the   mosquitoes Since scientists first   chikungunya in Tanzania in  the virus has hung out primarily in subSaharan Africa and southern Asia But in  a giant outbreak in India sickened more than a million people One infected man hopped on a plane and brought the virus to Italy Chikungunya established a foothold in the country and spread to nearly  people And it turned out it also brought another unpleasant surprise to Europe a   to spread around communities Up to that point scientists had thought the virus was only transmitted by      a mosquito that prefers warm tropical climates But in Italy the virus was spreading by the Asian tiger mosquito an insect that can tolerate more temperate environments Further research   that indeed the virus had mutated and gained the ability to spread through the tiger mosquito   That adaptation could spell trouble for the US Both   and   are found in the southern US The tiger mosquito has a much broader range and thrives as far north as Chicago Just as dengue fever has started to creep back into   and   some global health researchers are concerned that chikungunya will eventually make its way to the US
