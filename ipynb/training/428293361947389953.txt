To plague aficionados the Justinian Plague which in the th century AD is thought to have killed  million to  million from Asia to Africa to Europe is hardly a footnote But it is a mystery deepened by a new finding that the bacterium that caused it  a different strain than that which caused the Black Death and later plague outbreaks  appears to have gone extinct or is hiding unseen in rodent populations We will likely never see it again said the authors of a   published this week in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases But they warned there is a lesson in the fact that a strain of plague could jump from rodents to humans spread prosper and kill some  of its victims for two centuries and then mysteriously disappear New and equally virulent pathogens could appear just as mysteriously they wrote Fortunately we now have antibiotics that could effectively be used to treat plague said study coauthor Dave Wagner of Northern Arizona Universitys Center for Microbial Genetics and Genomics That he says lessens the chances of another largescale human pandemic The symptoms that overtook victims of the Justinian Plague were described by the early scholar Procopius in terms that echoed  years later with the outbreak of the Black Plague As it took its toll across the known world it contributed to the end of the Roman Empire and marked the transition from the classical to the medieval period The sleuthing reported in the Lancet was as remarkable as the findings themselves An international team of researchers extracted DNA fragments from the teeth of two plague victims who were buried sometime between AD  and  in Bavaria Germany The authors of the study reconstructed the genome of the pathogen that felled both victims and compared its sequences with those of more than  strains of bacteria from the same family that are currently found in animal reservoirs and humans throughout the world They found that the infectious agent that caused the Justinian Plague is a member of the bacterial family   from which sprang the Black Plague  years later and a recurrence of that plague in the late s and early s But the genetic fingerprint of the Black Plague is sufficiently distinct from the Justinian Plague that researchers concluded it is highly unlikely that they are related or that one of the Justinian strains evolved into the strains that caused the Black Death The strains of   in the Plague of Justinian form a novel branch on the   phylogeny the authors wrote That novel branch appears to have reached an evolutionary dead end they wrote It is either extinct or unsampled in wild rodent reservoirs Among the most discernible chromosomal differences between the strains were two that are associated with a pathogens ability to spread replicate and kill its hosts The Justinian Plague appeared to have been even deadlier to its victims than the  strains that reemerged  years later After dispatching so many souls in eighttoyear cycles with such efficiency what became of that novel strain For now the authors can only conjecture that either human populations evolved to become less susceptible to its deadly ways or that climatic changes taking place at the time created a less hospitable environment for the Justinian Plague pathogen Evidence for the latter possibility includes the fact that all three plagues  the Justinian Plague the Black Plague and the plague that surged in the late s and early s  followed periods of exceptional rainfall and ended periods of climatic stability
