Nurses should target MPs in marginal seats to turn up the pressure over pay the Royal College of Nursing says Ministers have blocked a recommendation for a  acrosstheboard rise for health staff in England General secretary Peter Carter urged nurses to resist the temptation to push for a strike Instead he said with  nurses in each constituency they could make a difference between an MP being elected or not in tight seats Speaking at the unions annual conference he said the decision in March to only give  to those who did not get that sum in progressioninthejob increases designed to reward professional development was ruthless These are given to half of all NHS staff and are worth over  on average But the independent pay review body had recommended  be given to everyone Mr Carter compared this to the  pay rise the MPs got following a review of their pay Other health unions  Unison and Unite  have balloted their members about industrial action But Mr Carter told delegates at the start of the fourday conference in Liverpool that strike action would not be right as it would leave patients in the lurch However he added There are many MPs on all sides of the House of Commons that have small majorities some just a few hundred some even as low as  to  votes There are about  nurses in each consistency and if we mobilise ourselves I know that many of those MPs will be looking over their shoulders and wondering if theyll be reelected at the general election next year Your vote can be the difference between returning to parliament or being out of a job  Thats why now is the time to lobby them To flush them out to say where they are standing on health workers salaries Mr Carter said the anger in the profession was being fuelled by what appeared to be a growing pay bill for senior NHS managers Data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the RCN shows that the amount spent on executive directors who sit on the boards of NHS trusts has grown by an average of  in the last two years compared to the  extra nurses health visitors and midwives have got the RCN said However the executive director figures also include termination payments so it could be a sign of the NHS getting rid of senior staff A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said the figures on executive pay should be treated with caution as other data suggested there had been no increase She added We have an available budget of nearly bn for pay increases We have offered to look at any proposal the unions make on how to use this money  However they have not put forward any proposals to help the lowest paid Our door remains open if they wish to reconsider their position In contrast to the situation in England the Scottish Government has accepted the  pay rise recommendation Talks are ongoing in Wales and Northern Ireland
