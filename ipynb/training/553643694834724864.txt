Im hunched over my iPhone texting with a stranger I know only as NJ Im soliciting career advice I love my work I peck out but sometimes wonder if I should be more strategic have a grand plan This conversation is being facilitated by Kindly a smartphone app that pairs users for anonymous chats about the troubles on their minds A timer at the top of my screen counts down  minutes the allotted time for each chat  though I could extend the conversation or follow up later by sending NJ a friend request Its a novel concept for a social network Whereas Facebook Twitter and Instagram are built on reallife ties however tenuous Kindly seeks to connect strangers bound only by a desire to share everyday problems I dont know if this app wouldve succeeded five years ago because every chat wouldve been about sex said Jordan Walker chief executive and cofounder of Kindly But now Tinder and Hinge exist People go there to have those conversations Walker  says Kindly was inspired by his own loneliness after a divorce You can have  friends on Facebook but on a Tuesday night at  you  want to talk to someone about whats bugging you and might not know who to reach out to he said Thats where were trying to come in Kindly has about  users Walker says That includes people signed up as designated listeners and those looking for a sympathetic ear Theres no screening process though the app asks advice seekers to rate listeners with a thumbsup or thumbsdown after chatting John Grohol a psychologist and founder and chief executive of the mental health website Psych Central questions the value of outsourcing ones emotional wellbeing to random strangers Typically when we want to vent our feelings  its going be most useful if were doing it with someone whose opinion we value he said Kindly is sort of a non sequitur in the social networking world It feels to me like an artificial interaction created because it could be created I cant say I dont know what he means After I aired my work worries to NJ I got a question in response Are you young NJ asked If youre young its OK to have some uncertainty Then NJ revealed that he  she  is  and has similar concerns I confessed Im over  NJ came back with Just follow your passion I immediately felt ridiculous In real life Id never seek career guidance from someone two years out of college When I told Walker about this he urged me to look at it from a different angle Of course this happens he said Sometimes you dont connect with someone that offers anything  but maybe they can offer one little point of wisdom Theres a bit of serendipity involved here Perhaps I told NJ that I am following my passion more or less But before an answer appeared the  minutes finished counting down and I was back to pondering my path alone
