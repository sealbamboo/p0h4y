The Ebola virus had been circulating in Guinea for roughly three months before doctors and international aid organizations finally detected it It was hiccups that eventually gave it away journalist Jeffrey Stern   in  this weekend To find out why the virus eluded detection for so long Stern went to Meliandou a remote Guinean village where   is thought to have lived to investigate Ebola he writes isnt easy to diagnose in its early phase Most of us think of Ebola as sort of the cinematic portrayal of it  you know bleeding out of the eyes and ears Stern tells NPRs Audie Cornish in an interview today on  That happens but it doesnt always happen and it doesnt happen until the later stages of the virus In the early stages he says symptoms can look a lot like cholera and malaria And since Guinea had never experienced Ebola no one knew to look for it  not even people in the medical community We tend to think of Ebola as a generally African scourge but the last real outbreak had been more than  miles away he stresses And it might as well have been another world for the people in the forest region of Guinea Then Dr Michel Van Herp an epidemiologist with   noticed something odd Half the patients listed on a medical report from Guinea had the hiccups Hiccups is something thats associated  for reasons were still not entirely sure of  with hemorrhagic fever but especially with Ebola Stern says Once they pinpointed the culprit he says aid organizations like Doctors Without Borders and the   had an incredibly fast response  almost too fast Health care volunteers were immediately sent in to track contacts and set up isolation wards but public communication couldnt keep up with the efforts That led to resistance among the locals who had never heard of Ebola until health care workers in big yellow Tyvek suits started coming to their villages and taking away their ailing loved ones In the most extreme cases Stern says you heard stories of villages throwing stones at health workers On a less spectacular level the mistrust kept health workers from identifying possible cases People were reluctant to tell volunteers if they had been in contact with an infected patient So if we dont know then it becomes very difficult to do what is actually a very straightforward process which is isolating infected patients and tracking their contacts he explains It was also difficult to get patients to come to clinics The public health messages emphasized that  percent of Ebola patients died although Stern notes that in this outbreak the fatality rate is in fact lower But the  percent figure stuck He says that those who had Ebola would think If its  percent mortality anyway I would rather die in the comfort of my own home with my family around me than in some place with people who I cant even really see their faces
