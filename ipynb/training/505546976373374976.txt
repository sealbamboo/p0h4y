A yearold boy who was born deaf has been caught reacting to music for the first time  and it looks like hes ready to bust a move In the home video Auguste Majkowski listens with a smile on his face to a  tune called Ma Baker When the music cuts off he makes a tilted T with his hands  the sign for again  and he jumps to his feet when the speaker turns back on It was amazing said Augustes mother Sophie Gareau Caught offguard the adults in the room took a few beats to realize they should probably capture the moment on camera she added We were so awestruck Auguste can now hear thanks to a device called an auditory brainstem implant The youngster from Montreal had an electrode array   on his brainstem in May and hes been using it regularly since midJune when researchers with USC and Childrens Hospital Los Angeles first turned the device on  But since returning home Augustes reactions have come in fits and starts A beating drum or a barking dog might make his head turn but not every time Thats to be expected said USC audiologist Laurie Eisenberg one of the lead scientists Its going to take a while for Auguste to be able to fully process sound  and to figure out which noises are important At first these precious moments were so sporadic that even when Auguste reacted dramatically to a new noise Sophie said her husband Christophe Majkowski seemed to just miss them Christophe has been cautious in expressing his hopes for Auguste postsurgery Sophie said So for him dancing to Ma Baker with Auguste marked a turning point That was the moment where he said OK this thing is working Sophie said The results offer encouragement to Augustes parents who flew to Los Angeles from Canada to   And the progress is promising for the team of scientists whose NIHfunded clinical trial if successful could help set a clear precedent for the safety and efficacy of this procedure in the US The ABI device uses an external earpiece that can be worn rather like a bluetooth headset and an electrode array embedded in the brainstem The earpiece processes the sound outside the ear and sends it to the electrode inside the skull which stimulates a region of the brainstem related to hearing The implant doesnt bring hearing up to the level of biological hearing Sophie who constantly chats with Auguste in Quebec Sign Language says that all she really wanted for Auguste was reference sounds such as the honk of an oncoming car to help keep him safe and enough sound to help him interpret spoken words while lipreading But she did admit that she held out a little hope that he might be able to appreciate music  which can be much more difficult for the brain to pick up than speech If he can hear music this is a miracle she said in an earlier interview before the surgery in May Music is so fantastic in life The brain is geared to understand language so surprisingly little sound information is needed to process it Eisenberg said Music on the other hand can require listeners to pick up incredibly precise sound information she said  so its subtleties may be lost on children with ABIs unless its something primarily rhythmic like drums or rap Either way it will be a long time until Augustes brain adjusts and can fully interpret the signal coming from the electrode array embedded in his head said Eisenberg said Think of him like a monthold Eisenberg said  his sense of hearing was essentially born in May which means theres a long way to go before he can understand words and perhaps more fully appreciate music Eisenberg spoke soon after learning that two other children who underwent the surgery after Auguste also performed extremely well when they were tested she said A total of  children will undergo the trial
