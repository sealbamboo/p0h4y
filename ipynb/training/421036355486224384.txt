A lot of us are drinking too much and on Tuesday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called us on it More than eight drinks a week for women and  drinks a week for men can get you into trouble the CDC warned But that doesnt seem to jibe with other studies that found that drinking alcohol makes for better heart health several Shots commenters noted Shana Cuddy   That   which found that Europeans who drank zero to three glasses of wine daily had better cardiovascular health didnt prove that it was the wine that made the difference It could be that people who drink moderately are healthier to begin with And there havent been any randomized controlled trials to find out As a result the American Heart Association says it   drinking wine or any other form of alcohol to get these potential benefits Then what about the weekly limits Many of our readers thought they seemed pretty darned skimpy To find out how the CDC came up with them we talked with Lela McKnightEily a health scientist at the CDC who is the lead author on the new   Its a daily average McKnightEily told Shots The average is based on population studies which show that people who drink more than that have an increased risk of heart disease breast cancer and other health problems Theres no level thats not at risk she said That takes a bit of the shine off that glass of wine while cooking dinner especially since if I indulge every day Im close to the upper end of the moderate drinking zone But the numbers get more complex than just weekly averages Public health officials are particularly concerned about people who binge drink which the CDC defines as more than four drinks at a sitting for a woman and five drinks for a man About  in  Americans   according to another CDC   Thats  million people In that study people defined binge drinking as downing nearly eight drinks in a session four times a month People also need to be aware that accepted definitions of a drink dont always match the doctors measure The feds measure a glass of wine as   You could get two or three drinks in a standard wine glass and not be aware of it McKnightEily says Indeed between those giant restaurant glasses highalcohol craft beers jumbo martinis and human nature its easy to overindulge As the commenter going by the scrambled handle rbdbdgr   Thats really what the CDC is trying to say rbdbdgr If doctors and other health professionals dont routinely ask all of us about alcohol they cant help the people whose drinking has slipped from pleasure to problem And that shifts the focus of the Whats too much question from averages based on the public at large to right where it should be on a persons individual risk It depends on who you are McKnightEily says noting that many people have health conditions that are made worse by alcohol Thats why we want people to have the conversation with their health providers
