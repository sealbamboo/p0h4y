Two new US Ebola treatment facilities are expected to open in Liberia over the next week One is a bed field hospital near Monrovias airport specifically to treat local health care workers who get infected The other is a bed Ebola treatment unit or ETU in the town of Tubmanburg north of Monrovia The bed hospital is finished and set to open this weekend But overall progress has been   in building the  field hospitals that the US promised Liberia back in September However   from the st Airborne who is commanding the US forces in Liberia says five are under construction and work will begin soon on  more Now that we are out of the rainy season weve been able to make pretty good progress on building says Volesky So youll see these ETUs coming up online a lot quicker just because were not fighting the elements The US has pledged to build ETUs all across Liberia with the idea that others will manage those facilities Volesky says thats part of the reason the ETUs arent going up faster Constructing them is only one piece of the equation They also have to make sure they can put health care providers in them to treat patients What we want to do is not accelerate the ETU construction and then have an empty ETU that weve got to secure he says From the beginning of this operation President Obama made it clear that US Army medics will not be treating patients at the new centers The World Health Organization says its still searching for international aid groups to run and staff  of the yettobebuilt ETUs Even before any of these proposed wards open there are signs that the Ebola epidemic may be   in Liberia Many of the existing Ebola hospitals there  which were completely overwhelmed in September  now report having empty beds Volesky says these changes on the ground could alter what the US finally builds What we dont want to do here as the military is come in here and build capacity or capability that the Liberians cant sustain Thats a lesson he picked up from serving in Iraq and Afghanistan He still expects to construct all the promised treatment units but some of them might end up being smaller than originally planned Liberia has gone from having more than  new cases of Ebola each week in late August to reporting just  cases in the last week of October Some researchers are even questioning whether the country needs hundreds of additional Ebola treatment beds But there have been other ebbs and flows in this outbreak warned   the assistant directorgeneral at WHO who is in charge of the organizations operational response to the Ebola outbreak My God the single biggest mistake anybody could make now is to think Well do we really need all those beds  he said in a press conference last week in Geneva Absolutely because remember what youre looking at is treatment centers that are geographically located across these countries in hot spot areas If the US military follows through with its plan to build an Ebola ward in every county across Liberia Aylward said Ebola cases from rural areas could be isolated much faster which would prevent the spread to new communities He added that right now is a critical moment in the outbreak Im terrified that the information will be misinterpreted and that people would start to think Oh great Ebola is under control  he told reporters Thats like saying your pet tiger is under control or something This is a very very dangerous disease Its not the time he said for the international community to back off Volesky says the American military isnt In fact its presence will grow significantly  from  servicemen right now to  by the end of the month In addition to constructing the treatment centers US troops have started training health care workers in Monrovia to work in the Ebola wards The US Navy is running mobile laboratories to test blood samples for Ebola The Army just sent soldiers from its   from the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland to set up more mobile labs in Liberia Voleskys operation now also has helicopters at its disposal He says the US military can provide speed and flexibility in the battle against Ebola  and he expects it to play an even bigger role in the weeks to come
