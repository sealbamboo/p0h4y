When Nimco Ali was  she thought her family was going on vacation They flew from their hometown in Manchester England to Djibouti on the Horn of Africa Ali doesnt remember the exact location But she clearly remembers what happened there The young girl found herself in a dingy room with a woman dressed in all black standing over her She didnt know what was going on at the time But she fell asleep And when Ali woke up she was confused The woman had mutilated her genitals Ali is British to the core She was raised in Britain and went to British schools But her family is from Somalia  where   of girls and women have a part of their genitals cut mutilated or completely removed In some places the practice is still thought of as a rite of passage for women But health leaders around the world are working to end the abusive practice Now Ali  is one of several activists speaking out against the tradition Shes also the cofounder of   a nonprofit that provides support for women living with genital mutilation and protects young girls at risk Even in the UK Alis experience isnt uncommon A   out of City University London estimates that from  to  about  girls in England and Wales were born to mothers from countries practicing genital mutilation Many of these girls may be at risk Thats why the British government has launched a new health care program to help survivors Prime Minister David Cameron has also proposed new   that mean parents could be prosecuted if their daughters are mutilated We recently spoke with Ali about what it takes to end female mutilation around the world She says women like her shouldnt be afraid or ashamed to talk about their own experiences Heres an excerpt of our conversation which has been edited for clarity We were in   on holiday and it was just a normal day The cutter who came into the room looked a little bit scary I didnt know what she was going to be doing But I just didnt like what she wore To me it was an African interpretation of what a witch would look like She was all dressed in black and she wasnt exactly the most cheerful person I remember waking up after I had FGM female genital mutilation and I was confused I didnt understand what this was about And nobody really talked about it after that I talked to my teacher in order to get some kind of explanation What was it Why had it happened But she just gave me a very flippant answer She said this is what happens to girls like you I didnt even know what girls like me meant There was no conversation around FGM then There werent even conversations around maternal health It was very much Well we dont want to interfere in your culture And its something we dont understand So lets just leave it In  I went to a local high school in the UK and I met these yearold girls Thirteen out of  of them had had FGM and I was completely horrified So I started to work on child protection and tried to get more guidelines on what legislation should be passed It was only in  that I started to talk about my own experience as a survivor I had educated myself and understood why I had FGM  because I was a girl and I was unvalued within that society I assumed that the mothers of these daughters had figured that out as well But they hadnt Its only in the last year that I have stopped being threatened by men and people who expect me to stay silent I knew I had to say something so I would give an interview Then I would have to switch off my phone and go into hiding for a week or two because I knew there would be constant emails and constant phone calls Even going out would be completely crazy Two summers ago a man from East Africa hit me with a car It was about this whole thing of me talking about things I shouldnt be talking about But the only thing I was talking about is my own body And I have the right to do that No The cycle was broken with my niece and cousin who are ages  and   That some of these things happen for a religious or cultural reason People arent looking at why it really happens Its because women are not valued in these countries and communities want to control them What happens with FGM is that youre broken as a child and youre rebuilt as what they want you to be So its not about you being free and fearless Also for a long time people talked about statistics and the medical issues of FGM rather than the human issues or the psychological and psychosexual issues Every woman has her own experience Its the agony of not having answers about something that was so vivid to you  and not being able to talk about it When a woman becomes fertile theres the whole issue about her ability to trust and have intimacy Ive been able to get the support and health care Ive needed But for me it was the guilt of not speaking out sooner and supporting other girls Women who have had the procedure can enjoy a healthy and happy sex life They can get over FGM Its not something that defines you Its something that happened to you And you can get over it Thats some of the conversation changes I hear in the UK Its not about being a victim Its about being a survivor
