Public health student Robert Snyder says hes been back and forth between US and Brazil at least six times While some trips were for fun others were to study how diseases affect some of the countrys poorest communities Snyder  whos pursuing a doctorate in epidemiology at   is currently in Rio de Janeiro studying how diseases strike in the citys slums or   Hes interviewing families to learn what puts them at risk for diabetes TB and staph Last summer Snyder was there for three months delving into the rate of high blood pressure in slums and comparing it with the rate in communities with better health care options And on his very first day he had an unpleasant encounter in Copacabana a wealthier and more touristfriendly community where Snyder was staying He may have been in the wrong place at the wrong time Then again he might have been a victim of an inappropriate footwear choice I got mugged the day I got there It was  oclock on a Sunday night and I wanted to go over to a friends house I was walking down the street and this kid and his girlfriend walked up to me They pushed me against the wall and he put a knife against my chest and said If you dont give me money Im going to kill you in Portuguese So I took out my wallet gave them the money His girlfriend put her hand in my pocket and took my cellphone which I hadnt even activated yet I went to the police station right next to my house and they took me to the other side of the city to a special police station for tourists I remember the female officer was like Oh next time that happens just punch him in the face The mugging happened because I wore the wrong shoes  at least thats what people told me In Brazil everyone has these plastic flipflops called   a famous Brazilian brand You have to wear them everywhere and if youre not wearing them especially in Rio people know you are not from there I had on Birkenstock clogs which I have since learned no Brazilian would ever wear The ironic twist was that were trying to assess all these different diseases and in public health we think of violence and crime as kind of a disease And now my experience will contribute to the statistics were trying to study Things like interpersonal violence  murder assault  have a serious impact on public health of a community The day after I got mugged a physician at my clinic said Ive lived here for   years and Ive never been robbed He was a member of the old left Democratic Party when Brazil went through a dictatorship Brazil always gets this bad rap  fair or not  for being a relatively dangerous place to walk around But he said that ironically when the dictatorship was going on it was much safer because they would crack down on crimes with an iron fist And there was a lot more segregation between the slums and nonslums The word that anyone who goes to Brazil should know is   It doesnt have a good translation in English but its this longing feeling for the people you really care about and your country Its a very emotional word that captures the Brazilian culture When you talk to someone you would say  and that means I am missing you Its great to have someone say that about you Peanut butter They dont really have peanut butter in Brazil and if the shops do its really expensive about  a jar Its a comfort food When I get home I would eat peanut butter with apples and it makes me   for the US I bring the extra big jugs every time I go We have this idea that these communities are homogeneous and theyre all these places of abject poverty and misery While there are certainly some components of it that are like that what really struck me the most was how happy and proud people were to be living there Theres this idea of social capital People get along well and they look after each other Get some Havaianas Its the only way youll be able to blend in
