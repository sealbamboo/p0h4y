Californias ongoing backlog of MediCal applications under Obamacare has been reduced by about a third since May said officials at the states Department of Health Care Services In an email to The Times department spokesman Anthony Cava said that  Californians were now waiting to hear the status of MediCal applications and that the number was continuing to decrease through our ongoing work with the counties The update  the first in nearly two months  came a day after healthcare advocates sent state officials a letter demanding that the healthcare department detail plans to address the bottleneck which was as high as  people in May Since the launch of Affordable Care Act enrollments an enormous influx of new applications for MediCal has stymied state computer systems making it difficult for counties which are supposed to process applications for coverage within  days to provide decisions on coverage to applicants Unlike Covered California the staterun medical insurance marketplace that operates with set enrollment periods MediCal applications are accepted yearround The backlog represents an everchanging rolling population whose paperwork is pending Cava wrote Healthcare advocates said they were concerned because some patients whose applications are stalled and who are unsure of their coverage status avoid seeking necessary medical care In the letter sent to the healthcare services department Wednesday the Health Consumer Alliance detailed difficulties faced by  MediCal applicants around the state One was described as a college student who allowed an infection to progress for more than a month while his family waited for a decision on MediCal coverage The familys application is still pending after six months according to the letter Another case cited was said to involve a yearold man in Los Angeles County who had his MediCal card but was told by medical providers that his coverage had never been activated Attorneys had to intervene to activate his benefits Katie Murphy managing attorney at Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County and a member of the group that sent the letter to state officials Wednesday said legal aid groups had worked with hundreds of such cases She said the advocates were pleased if there has been progress but a large number of Californians face delays in coverage that is still incredibly real and unacceptable Anthony Wright executive director of the advocacy group Health Access which was not involved in the letter said he was glad to see a new state accounting of the backlog Its good that the number is less he said Its not good that its still hundreds of thousands Department of Health Care Services director Toby Douglas was not available for comment
