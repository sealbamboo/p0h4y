Doctors want people to quit smoking before surgery because it reduces the risk of complications but often dont do much to make that happen But it turns out just a wee bit of help makes it much more likely that people will quit before going under the knife a study finds Patients who got less than five minutes of counseling from a nurse and free nicotine patches at least three weeks before surgery were much more likely to quit according to researchers at the University of Western Ontario Those patients also got a brochure and a referral to a quitsmoking hotline Before surgery  percent of the  patients at St Josephs Hospital in London Ontario who were given help managed to quit compared with about  percent of the  patients who got none A month after surgery  percent of the patients given help said they had stopped smoking compared with  percent in the other group But those numbers were selfreported unlike to the dayofsurgery report which was confirmed by testing peoples breath The group that got help also did better at cutting back even if they didnt quit We really tried to simplify the amount of extra work the hospital would have to do says Dr Susan Lee a clinical instructor in anesthesiology at the University of California San Francisco and lead author of the study The hospital nurses were already doing interviews before admission and the quit line was an exisitng national service The   were published in the journal   Doctors have long known that   with complications including heart attacks and excessive bleeding Afterwards smokers are more likely to have heart attacks and strokes get pneumonia and have problems with wound healing This study looked at complications but there werent enough participants to detect differences between the groups Nonetheless heres a motivating stat A big international   published earlier this year in the journal   found that people who quit smoking a year before surgery had no higher risk than those who had never smoked at all So why arent hospitals already doing this Earlier efforts to get hospitals to counsel have been more complicated Lee says And most hospitals dont do screenings weeks before surgery allowing patients enough time to quit Even the hospital in the study struggled with that It was hard to get the patients in three weeks preoperatively Lee says But surgery can make for a great excuse to quit she says Patients are nervous theyre thinking about their health more they want surgery to be successful This is a great moment when we can get in there and make a difference
