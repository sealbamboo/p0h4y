They often turn up in the emergency room in severe pain pleading for relief A drug that can help reduce their flareups is readily available  yet too rarely used The patients many of them children have   a debilitating and sometimes lifethreatening blood disorder It is relatively rare so doctors may not know how to treat it For patients the results are devastating including severe pain that often requires hospitalization and can last for days A new set of guidelines for managing the disease published recently in JAMA the Journal of the American Medical Association aims to change that The report calls for   particularly regular blood transfusions and a drug called hydroxyurea It also provides detailed guidance on caring for children with sickle cell and treating the disorders complications which include infections strokes and severe   Some of what we really know works based on good clinical trials is not being provided to patients even though it could have dramatic effects on their quality of life said Dr Gary H Gibbons director of the   which convened the expert panel that developed the new guidelines The problem is that sickle cell disease is comparatively rare Most clinicians dont encounter it and have limited experience and expertise Dr Gibbons said Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder primarily affecting people of African ancestry though people of Hispanic Mediterranean and Middle Eastern heritage may also be affected The disease causes the body to make abnormal sickle or crescentshaped red blood cells that can block vessels causing organ damage and pain It is a debilitating and lifethreatening illness Bone marrow transplants offer the hope of a cure but are still considered experimental Patients have a reduced life expectancy though they are living longer than they did in the past experts say One of the reports surprises a clear directive to doctors to take patients at their word when they say they are in pain and to treat it promptly and aggressively The pain may be intense I tell people to try to imagine the worst pain theyve ever been in from a broken limb or a   and then try to multiply that said Carlton Haywood Jr an assistant professor of hematology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who has sickle cell disease himself Then think about it not for an hour or a day but for days on end Yet Dr Haywood added frequent requests for pain medication can stigmatize sickle cell patients as drugaddicted Despite the widespread concern about overuse of opioids the recommendations urge physicians caring for sickle cell patients to use the powerful painkillers when necessary Were trying very hard to make the point that the pain is not associated with physical findings said Dr George Buchanan a professor of pediatrics at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas who helped lead the expert panel that developed the guidelines When the patient says theyre in pain they deserve and should receive effective pain medication The drug hydroxyurea increases the production of healthy fetal   making the red blood cells less stiff and rigid Even though the drug does not cure the disease clinical trials found it significantly   Still many patients either dont have access to it or dont have access to a doctor whos knowledgeable or who emphasized how effective it is Dr Buchanan said It also takes a while to work Patients must take hydroxyurea for three months before it becomes effective People get tired of taking it every day thinking Its not doing me any good  The drug also should not be taken during   Another effective treatment is regular monthly blood transfusions Regular transfusions shut off the bodys production of sickle cells and raise the red blood count to normal reducing the risk of anemia Dr Buchanan said Both treatments should be considered for every patient Dr Buchanan said although both have side effects Dr Michael DeBaun director of the VanderbiltMeharryMatthew Walker Center for Excellence in Sickle Cell Disease who wrote an   in JAMA criticized the panel for not soliciting input from patients and affected family members There were no recommendations he noted about bone marrow transplants which   But the authors of the new guidelines who spent five years reviewing the scientific evidence said they were stymied by the relative scarcity of evidence from good randomized clinical trials There is little evidence about kidney disease in sickle cell patients for example or even about managing the pain said another leader of the guideline panel Dr Barbara Yawn of Olmsted Medical Center in Rochester Minn Dr Yawn has been involved in developing evidencebased guidelines for other illnesses When we looked at managing   there was almost too much evidence to review she said The huge takehome message with sickle cell disease is that we desperately need more research
