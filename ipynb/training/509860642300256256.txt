Just before noon on a December morning in  a magnitude  earthquake shook over  of the territory of Armenia centered in the northern city of Spitak The temblor leveled entire towns and cities killed an estimated  Armenians  twothirds of them children trapped and crushed in their crumbling schools  and hastened the dissolution of the Soviet Union of which Armenia was then a part    But the Spitak disaster was more than a geopolitical milestone The earthquake was in the words of one researcher a psychiatric calamity that has yielded a trove of knowledge aboutposttraumatic stress disorder    More than a dozen studies of Spitaks victims have helped tease out the longterm effects of PTSD and the range of factors that predispose individuals and groups to developing enduring symptoms of irritability avoidance intrusive thoughts and fears vivid flashbacks and troubled sleep and appetite    A new study of Spitaks victims by UCLA researchers zooms in on the molecular contributors to PTSD It finds that in Armenians who carried two specific genetic variations associated with depression PTSD was more common    The two genes were by the researchers admission relatively very small contributors to an individuals overall vulnerability to developing PTSD In gauging how severely a subject would suffer from symptoms  years after the earthquake several easytospot traits were far more useful predictors than were singleletter changes on certain genes Among them Females were more likely than males to experience PTSD as were older people those who had lost family members and those who had experienced traumatic events before the earthquake    But among people who developed the worst PTSD symptoms researchers identified two DNA variants that each contributed  to  to the severity of the disorder    A third variant was found to account for  of an individuals vulnerability to depression in the wake of trauma though no link to PTSD could be found    The results published Monday in the Journal of Affective Disorders are based on a genetic analysis of  adults from  families in northern Armenia All agreed to allow their DNA to be sent to Los Angeles where it was combed for clues to psychiatric vulnerability    The existence of a study population with clear genetic links common family histories and exposure to a single trauma allowed researchers an unusual opportunity to distill information about genes role in PTSD said UCLA psychiatrist Armen K Goenjian who led the study But he added that the findings needed to be replicated in larger more heterogenous populations    Goenjian an Armenian American rushed to Spitak after the  quake and helped establish a pair of psychiatric clinics for victims there Those clinics remained open for  years    Goenjian said that PTSD among Armenians was an ongoing problem and much bigger than we first appreciated given how widespread the destruction was how the loss of loved ones was universal and how delays in rebuilding forced the population to confront constant reminders of their trauma    The variants linked to PTSD were on genes that had some key things in common Both have a role in governing the quantity and action in the brain of the neurotransmitter serotonin And both have been found to boost an individuals risk of depression    Those common threads may help to explain why PTSD is so frequently diagnosed in those who have had or who will go on to develop depression Serotonin is believed to play a key role in mood regulation and many antidepressants are thought to work by boosting serotonin and its availability in the brain    Goenjian said his team had expected to find a link between the socalled serotonin transporter gene and the severity of PTSD symptoms But it seemed to predict only more severe depression symptoms
