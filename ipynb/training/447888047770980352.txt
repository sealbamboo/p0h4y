CHICAGO  As many as  children worldwide become sick each year with a drugresistant superbug strain of tuberculosis according to new estimates by US researchers that for the first time quantify rates of this difficulttotreat form of TB Overall as many as  million children become sick with TB each year about twice the number previously thought and of these only a third of the cases are ever diagnosed the study found A huge proportion of children are suffering and dying from TB unnecessarily said Helen Jenkins of Brigham and Womens Hospitals Division of Global Health Equity the lead statistician on the study published on Sunday in the Lancet The findings published as part of a special theme issue of Lancet to commemorate World TB Day on March  offer the clearest picture yet of the global burden of tuberculosis among its youngest victims and for the first time estimate the burden of multidrugresistant tuberculosis or MDRTB Despite children comprising approximately one quarter of the worlds population there have been no previous estimates of how many suffer from MDRTB disease said Dr Ted Cohen also of the Harvardaffiliated Brigham and Womens Hospital and a coauthor on the paper For decades researchers had largely ignored tuberculosis infections in young children in part because children are less likely to transmit the disease than adults TB infections are especially hard to diagnose in children because the infection looks different in children than adults The disease is caused by bacteria that typically attack the lungs and are often spread through the air when people who have an active infection cough In kids you are much more likely to have TB disease in other parts of the body not necessarily in the lungs Jenkins said To arrive at their estimates Jenkins and colleagues scoured publicly available databases and devised a way to correct for chronic underreporting of TB in children The World Health Organization estimates that  million people developed TB in  and  million died from the disease According to the WHO half a million people became sick with dangerous superbug strains of tuberculosis in  up to  million people worldwide may be infected with drugresistant TB by  Keeping track of TB rates in children is important for two reasons Jenkins said First children with drugsensitive forms of TB generally respond very well to treatment Second because TB disease develops very quickly in children often within weeks of exposure finding an infected child can offer key clues about TB transmission within a community
