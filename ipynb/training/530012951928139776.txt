Designing medications and immune therapies that blunt a drug addicts high and help him kick his habit is a promising idea And someday soon it is expected to yield actual medications for addiction But theres a fundamental problem with prescribing an addict a daily medication that makes it impossible to get high when the urge to use overwhelms the urge to quit  as it so often does  the struggling addict can easily discontinue the medication and go back to his illicit habit A new approach aims to prolong the effect of such antiaddiction medications and make it harder for recovering addicts to abandon their therapy It would deliver genes into a methamphetamine addicts cells on the backs of a dismembered virus and prompt those cells to make a continuous supply of antimeth antibodies Weeks or even months after getting a dose of medication if the temptation to return to methamphetamine wins the day a standing army of antibodies binds to the illicit drug and prevents it from reaching an addicts brain No high no rush of dopamine to the brain no psychologiocal reward for using Instead of descending back into addiction the recovering meth addict gets another chance to stay clean A paper presented Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists offered evidence that such a strategy could work Molecular biologist Eric Peterson of the University of Arkansas described an experiment in which methaddicted mice got an antibody therapy that continued to keep methamphetamine from reaching their brains  days after they got their dose The delivery system that made that longlasting effect possible was an adenoassociated virus engineered to deliver genes that produce antibodies that bind tightly to methamphetamineÂ  Fifty days after injecting the mice with the virus Peterson and a team led by graduate student Nisha NanawareKharade gave the mice a dose of methamphetamine Half an hour and an hour after getting the meth the mice that got the genebased therapy had much more methamphetamine in their blood than did mice that got a saline shot instead That suggests the meth  bound to the antibodies  never crossed the protective barrier into the brain and stayed sequestered in the bloodstream until it was filtered out The project funded with grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute on Drug Abuse sought to integrate antibody engineering and gene therapy technology to generate an antibodybased medicine that could continue working for months or years Peterson said If the approach can be proved to work safely in humans he said it could protect recovering addicts from relapsing
