Thomas Duncan the first person diagnosed with the Ebola virus in the United States is in isolation in a Dallas hospital and the family he stayed with is now in quarantine in an apartment complex north of downtown Dallas That means the family has been ordered not to leave their home and is banned from hosting any visitors until the day incubation period for Ebola has passed While they are in quarantine police are surveying the building and necessities are being delivered to the family  The Dallas County Fire Marshall says that four people who are quarantined will soon be moved to another location Reuters reports Quarantine is a legal move as much as it is a public health tool Under the   police can charge the family with a thirddegree felony should they leave the apartment This has Shots wondering how do isolation and quarantine actually work We talked to   a professor of health law at the Boston University School of Public Health Here are highlights of the conversation edited for clarity and brevity Isolation can be voluntary or involuntary When you have a really sick patient like someone who has symptoms of Ebola isolation is just good medical practice They take care of a person in an isolation room in a hospital and use all kinds of infection control practices and patients usually want that they submit to that because they want to get better Thats what happens in the vast vast vast majority of cases Only in a handful of cases do you have the possibility of involuntary isolation From the laws perspective in order to require someone to be isolated they would have to have a dangerous contagious disease thats easily transmissible persontoperson and and this is important be unable or unwilling to isolate themselves In other words they would pose a danger to other people because they would come in contact with other people either voluntarily or because they couldnt help themselves For the most part it just doesnt happen very much in this country When public health officials or a physician want to petition to have someone involuntarily isolated then they would have to go to court and prove both those points dangerous contagious disease and the probability that the person would spread it to others if not confined Youre clearly entitled to a hearing and then you would have to be released once those conditions no longer apply  it cant be forever Quarantine is most precisely used to mean confining people who may have been exposed to one of these dangerous contagious diseases Its not that theyre necessarily sick But the goal is if theyve been exposed to a dangerous contagious disease to keep them from exposing other people I think the public officials and physicians ought to provide you with information about how you should take care of yourself and how to clean dishes and how to make sure you dont touch each other You conduct your life as you would otherwise but youre probably bored to tears Theyre monitoring to make sure that you dont have any symptoms and presumably if someone develops a symptom like fevers or headaches they would probably whisk them into a hospital and ask them to stay in isolation All of this is highly factspecific according to the particular disease In the late s early s when a lot of treatment programs for tuberculosis lost funding and there was an influx of both HIV and TB immigrants homeless people many who were mentally ill or many who were on drugs and didnt have any place to go so they ended up being isolated in the hospital Early in the s there was sometimes isolation for somebody with sexually   transmitted infections before there were antibiotics to treat them But again it was targeted largely at poor sex workers and some immigrants Isolation is a useful tool in extreme circumstances but it has an unhappy history of being applied rather selectively But of course as I said earlier you really dont need it for most people Most people understand the need for staying away from other people if theyre infectious There have been circumstances more than  years ago There was a large quarantine   in San Francisco which was struck down by the courts because it essentially quarantined the healthy with the sick in plague and was also highly discriminatory It really only quarantined people of Chinese ancestry in Chinatown in San Francisco kind of wound around the Caucasian places so it was pretty obviously discriminatory States are sort of the first line they have basic authority to impose involuntary   detention of a person within their territory The federal government does have authority to quarantine but it stems from the federal governments power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce So it really deals with people who are crossing the borders not with local noncommercial activities like going to the hospital It is possible that had anyone been aware of Duncans arrival from another country to the US that the federal government could have taken some action and asked but he was fine then Its mostly the states that do this  this is  percent state in practice
