Researchers have successfully decoded the genes of a yearold man from Siberia The results offer clues about early human life outside of Africa as well as how humans interacted with Neanderthals and other groups around at the time The complete set of genes is the oldest genome of its kind according to   a director at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig Its almost twice as old as the next oldest genome that has been sequenced The work of Pbo and his colleagues   in the journal   The DNA came from a human femur found in  by a collector scouring the Irtysh River in western Siberia The femur was handed over to a local paleontologist who in turn gave it to Pbos team in Leipzig When the age of the bone was revealed the team couldnt believe it We were actually so amazed we actually had it dated even twice to make sure Pbo says Pbos team specializes in extracting ancient DNA from bones like these They carefully set to work retrieving genetic material from bone cells in the femur Because the bone came from a modern human they had to take precautions to ensure it wasnt contaminated with their own genetic material The results provide a window into an unusual period in human existence Modern humans evolved in Africa around  years ago They left the continent around  years ago But researchers now know that other humanlike people were already living in Europe and Asia These included   large muscular hominins that lived in the caves of Europe Whats exciting about this paper is that its looking at a very ancient modern human who would have lived around the same time as Neanderthals says   a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the work The bone shows that the Siberian mans DNA contained a tiny amount of Neanderthal genes In other words he had some Neanderthal ancestors Its the latest in a series of papers showing that humans and Neanderthals bred Modern Asians Europeans and Native Americans also have Neanderthal genes but the Neanderthal gene sequences of the Siberian man were longer indicating that interbreeding had taken place in the relatively recent past between  and  years ago They actually mixed with each other and did have children Pbo says As intriguing as the bone is it leaves many questions about what happened next We know that humans thrived and that Neanderthals eventually went extinct but we still dont know why says   a computational biologist at the Max Plank Institute in Leipzig and a coauthor on the paper The genetics just doesnt tell us anything about that Just as big a mystery is what happened to the Siberian man and his descendants MayPreviously it was thought ancient humans hadnt lived so far north  years ago And venturing into the region may have been a bad move Pbo suspects The Siberian mans genetic code is distant from other groups of humans suggesting his family may have gone extinct even before Neanderthals died out
