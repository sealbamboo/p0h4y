Theres nothing like a serious health scare to convince smokers to kick the habit but new research finds that nearly  in  cancer survivors is still smoking nine years after their diagnosis The  smoking rate among American cancer survivors is about half as high as the   among American adults as a whole according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Smoking doesnt just increase the risk for   it also makes cancer treatments less effective makes cancers more likely to come back after treatment and makes them come back faster Researchers from the American Cancer Society and Emory University both in Atlanta examined data from the ongoing   This study tracks a random sample of adults from  states around the country who have been diagnosed with a common type of cancer The cancers included in the study are breast prostate bladder uterine melanoma colorectal kidney nonHodgkin lymphoma ovarian and lung Nearly  study participants were diagnosed between  and  and were still alive in  and  on average  years had passed since their cancer was diagnosed They answered questions about their smoking behavior in those later years Overall  of the  cancer survivors were still smoking according to the survey data Among these smokers  smoked every day and they smoked an average of  cigarettes daily The other smokers smoked about once every three days and on those days they burned through an average of  cigarettes About half of the cancer survivors who were still smoking said they had no intention of quitting the researchers found Another  of the cancer survivors reported that they were active smokers when they were diagnosed but had quit since then That means that onethird of all of the people who were smokers when they were diagnosed were able to quit after nine years the researchers reported Another  of the cancer survivors were former smokers who had already stopped smoking when they were diagnosed Smokers who were diagnosed with a smokingrelated cancer were  more likely to quit compared with smokers who had other types of cancer the researchers calculated But this doesnt necessarily mean that a diagnosis of lung cancer or another cancer linked to smoking served as a wakeup call to these smokers the researchers wrote Rather the data may simply reflect the fact that fewer people with these types of cancers survived long enough to be interviewed in  and  Survivors who smoked daily smoked at relatively high levels and would likely have a difficult time quitting because of their tobacco dependence the researchers wrote In addition older smokers were less likely to say they intended to quit probably because they feel that the effort or difficulties in quitting eg withdrawal symptoms may not be worth the possible gain in greater life expectancy the researchers wrote Among all of the cancer survivors the smoking rate was highest among those who had bladder cancer  followed by lung cancer  and ovarian cancer  Survivors who were women were younger had less education and had lower incomes were all more likely to smoke compared with survivors as a whole The lowest smoking rates were seen in adults who had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer  kidney cancer  and melanoma  the researchers found The   were published this week in Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers  Prevention
