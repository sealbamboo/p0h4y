Every year sneeze sufferers swear This is the worst allergy season ever And theyre right Pollen levels are increasing pollen seasons are getting longer and more people are developing allergies says Estelle Levetin PhD chairwoman of the aerobiology committee for the American Academy of Allergy Asthma  Immunology 
                   
                  In the United States nearly  of adults  and over suffer from seasonal allergiesthats nearly  million people While spring and fall allergies cause the same symptoms sneezing itchy eyes and runny nose their triggers are different 
                   
                  Spring allergies which run from February to late July are brought on by pollen from trees grasses and weeds Fall allergies go from midAugust through the first autumn frost and are chiefly set off by pollen from the ragweed plant mold and dust mites 
                   
                  Read on to learn whats making both seasons so unbearableand the best ways to survive them 
                   
                   Spring allergies now start sooner and fall allergies end later thanks to global warming says Jeffrey G Demain MD director of the Allergy Asthma  Immunology Center of Alaska 
                   
                  Were using more carbonbased fuels generating greenhouse gases that trap heat from the sun in our atmosphere This makes temperatures rise prompting plants and trees to flowerand release pollenearlier each spring in the fall they delay the death of ragweed plants from frost extending the pollen season explains Levetin 
                   
                  End result Fall allergies may go practically into winter Higher amounts of carbon dioxide not only kickstart pollen production they also boost the amount of pollen each plant generates tooespecially in urban areas where the gas is more plentiful To add insult to injury CO is making pollen more potent too 
                   
                  Theres more allergen now in each grain than there used to be Dr Demain says And pollen isnt the only allergen on the rise Increasingly balmy temperatures mean more moisture in the air which creates mold 
                   
                  The higher temperatures and gas may increase not just the growth of mold but also its spore productionwhich is how it distributes allergensboth indoors and out Dr Demain says 
                   
                   The number of Americans with allergies is two to five times higher now than it was about  years ago according to surveys from the National Institutes of Health 
                   
                  Genes play a role in your susceptibility but the blooming allergy boom is most likely due to the longer more intense pollen seasons 
                   
                  There are other expertsupported theories as well Now that were exposed to less dirt and bacteria thanks in part to our obsession with antibacterial everything and have fewer scourges like polio and parasites to fight our immune systems are quicker to overreact to otherwise harmless substances like pollen says Levetin 
                   
                  At the same time our environment is too dirty Studies show that pollution such as exhaust fumes can trigger allergic flareups Todays processed preserved foods lack the tough fibers of the plants and grains our ancestors feasted on throwing off the delicate balance of bacteria in our guts and setting us up for allergic sensitivity says University of Michigan professor of internal medicine Gary Huffnagle PhD Studies suggest too that as use of antibioticswhich also disrupt bacteria in the gastrointestinal tracthas surged so have allergies
