Consuming high levels of protein  particularly animal protein  is a bad strategy if youre at midlife and aiming to live into old age new research finds But a study out Tuesday reveals that in older age fortifying ones diet with more proteinrich foods appears to be a formula for extending life An   published in the journal Cell Metabolism says that over an year study period middleaged Americans who had the highest consumption of protein were more than four times as likely to die of cancer or diabetes and twice as likely to die of any cause than those whose diets were lowest in protein But a highprotein diet had the opposite effect on Americans  and older a group of Americans and Italian researchers found Those whose diets were highest in protein were  less likely to die of cancer and  less likely to die of any cause than were those whose protein intake was lowest Your stage in life matters said biogerontologist Valter Longo director of USCs Longevity Institute and lead author of the paper which explores the role of dietary protein from the cellular level to the population level  Some have said for years that proteins are bad Thats half right and half wrong Tapping a national database of  Americans health and nutrition behaviors Longos team found that in people between the ages of  and  following a diet in which protein accounted for  or more of daily calories consumed increased the risk of death during the year study period to levels comparable to the effect of smoking cigarettes Whether the remainder of those younger individuals diet was dominated by fat or carbohydrates made no difference to the outcome But the source of the protein mattered a great deal for those whose sources of protein were heavily plantbased  nuts and legumes  the increased risk of dying of cancer declined and the increased risk of allcause mortality disappeared altogether The article by the USItalian team is the culmination of two decades of study that has coaxed the researchers to look for clues well outside the lab Longo and his team have studied the dietary habits of a little town in Italy with a high concentration of centenarians and have traveled to Ecuador to gather information on an exceptionally longlived family congenitally deficient in a growth hormone linked to cancer The findings of Longos team are in line with mounting research on the hazards of heavy consumption of red meats and the protective effects of plantbased nutrients But unlike many largepopulation studies that have found links between poor health outcomes and animal protein consumption the current study identified the potentially pivotal role that a hormone called insulinlike growth factor or IGF plays in driving agerelated diseases such as cancer In a subset of the studys human subjects who submitted their blood for analysis as well as in laboratory mice Longos team found that heavy protein consumption in middle age drove up levels of IGF In the groups rodent experiments  higher IGF levels  whether induced by high protein consumption or genetic engineering  promoted rapid cancerous growth when the researchers implanted  cancer cells under the animals skin  of these mice developed tumors Among mice that were fed a lowprotein diet through middle age  and which therefore had lower IGF levels  tumor formation was  to  lower At the same time the researchers uncovered evidence that older mice were less able to absorb or process proteins When they were fed highprotein diets the older mice tended to maintain or increase their weight  a factor that appeared to keep them from becoming frail By contrast older mice fed a lowprotein diet lost weight that says Longo appeared to make them more vulnerable to diseases of aging IGF produced largely in the liver is essential to normal human growth and to the process of cell replacement after injury  But it is also implicated in a wide range of disorders associated with overgrowth and cell proliferation including heart enlargement the runaway cell growth common to all cancers and obesity But while  IGFs role in promoting tumor growth has long been recognized its link to a highprotein diet appears to be a new People will say Here we go again First you attack the fats then you attack the carbohydrates now its the protein  Longo said But over  years of research linking heavy protein consumption to diseases of aging and eventually to higher IGF levels he said we never changed our mind Americans proteinpacked diets are hurting them in a major way
