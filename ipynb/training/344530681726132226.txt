At a time when most pregnant women work there are new efforts to keep companies from unfairly targeting employees because of a pregnancy The allegations of pregnancy discrimination persist and have even risen in recent years despite a decadesold law against it   Advocates say those most vulnerable are lowwage workers like Natasha Jackson a former account representative at RentACenter in Charleston SC She cajoled customers to pay up and occasionally delivered heavy rental furniture After she became pregnant in the spring of  coworkers helped out with deliveries Then one morning I came in and I was told I had to wait to clock in until I spoke to both the district manager and the head of human resources she says They told her about another pregnant employee whod hurt herself lifting a rental TV They put Jackson on two weeks paid vacation and sent a medical form for her doctor to fill out The doctor wrote that  as with many pregnant women  Jackson shouldnt lift more than  pounds When I guess they read that thats what they started to use to keep me out of work Jackson says Jackson made more than her husband who was working temporary jobs at the time When the head of human resources told her shed have to go on unpaid leave she says she became distraught on the phone with him So he told me Calm down you still probably can get a job somewhere Try to find a job bagging groceries or something  she recalls We all think that pregnancy discrimination is illegal but what has happened is the way that law has been interpreted says Dina Bakst copresident of A Better Balance an advocacy group that pushes for familyfriendly work policies Bakst says courts have interpreted the   narrowly allowing employers to deny the same kinds of accommodations they make for those with onthejob injuries say a pulled muscle or broken bone Recognizing such limitations when Congress expanded the   in  regulators interpreted it to include pregnancyrelated impairments But  and this is a point feminists have long insisted upon  advocate Bakst says normal pregnancy is not a disability What pregnant women typically need are really routine modest accommodations she says An extra bathroom break a stool a water bottle These may be simple things yet theyre sometimes denied especially to lowwage workers Bakst says she recently heard from   who had treated a pregnant retail worker after she fainted and collapsed from severe dehydration The woman was not allowed to drink water while standing for hours behind the cash register To address a situation like that Congress is trying another legislative fix to more clearly spell out the obligations of employers Rep Jerrold Nadler DNY recently introduced the House version of the   The bill says exactly as the Americans with Disabilities Act says An employer must make a reasonable accommodation provided its not an undue hardship Nadler says Its similar to existing state law in California and newly proposed legislation in New York But so far there are no Republican cosponsors and business groups have declined to take a position As a defense lawyer I question the notion that the law needs amendment or the law has some holes in it says Gerry Maatman of Seyfarth Shaw He notes the EEOC has listed pregnancy discrimination as one of its top emerging issues A lot of enforcement dollars and effort will be undertaken by the EEOC with or without any amendments to the law he says I think that advocates are in essence just shining a spotlight on an issue that is certainly one thats being litigated on a daily basis in the federal courts To be sure the legal process is helping some Just last month   who was pushed out after suffering from pregnancyinduced carpal tunnel syndrome She will now be allowed to return to work after maternity leave But the story is not the same for numerous others including Jackson the woman forced out of a furniture rental company because she couldnt lift heavy things She never did get her job back Everything from that moment in my life took just a down spiral she says I never recovered from it Jackson and her husband had to back out of buying their first house They took a financial hit with her many months of unpaid leave Theyre now divorcing Jackson contested the loss of her job but after three years an arbitrator decided that it was perfectly legal
