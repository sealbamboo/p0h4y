Some famous writers painters and musicians have done some of their best work in their later years  impressionist Claude Monet for one But at the   older people are proving that you dont have to be famous  or even a professional artist  to live a creatively fulfilling life in old age With a fully equipped theater and painting and sculpture studios there seems to be rehearsals or exhibitions of some sort going on here all the time Resident Nailah Jumoke  moved here all the way from her home in Chicago I was looking for a place where seniors werent being treated as seniors she says As an artist I needed to be around motivation The move was affordable because some of the apartments here are subsidized and Jumoke lives just on Social Security Her experience here has exceeded her expectations Shed done some theater before but she was never a writer Now she is So Im learning some new things in my senior age she says and being a part of this community is helping me to see that I have a lot more inside of me  as far as creating This is no surprise to Tim Carpenter He founded an organization called   thats been providing arts programs at retirement complexes for years But his efforts were limited because most retirement homes just didnt have enough space When you get handed a building that has one club room and you want to do more than one thing its almost impossible he explains The idea of somebody watching television and having a poetry class are at odds with each other Then he happened to meet a developer named John Huskey Hes president of   which builds a lot of apartments for seniors And Carpenter asked him why so few of his residents were participating in activities Huskey would say Well wait a minute I build good quality housing arent I done Carpenters answer I dont think so For a while the two men had a contentious relationship Huskey says that changed one day when he asked Carpenter to try to figure out why one of his projects wasnt getting many tenants So Carpenter suggested offering a writing class onsite He says it was very quiet  and then the laughter started Huskey says It didnt take long before the worst idea Id ever heard was the best idea Id ever heard because it really really worked So they decided to design new buildings with spaces for things like writing classes painting and performance The building in North Hollywood has a professional acting company in residence at its theater and company members work on projects with the residents There are also painting and sculpture studios there as there are at another senior artist colony in Burbank Calif that opened in  Recently staff members at the   were hanging paintings for an upcoming show These exhibitions are important says Carpenter because residents shouldnt just dabble They need to have a goal he says to have expectations be high and for people to take risks as they get older  instead of saying Oh youre old now we dont expect you to do anything If you could just sit here  Research shows that theres a positive impact on older people who create art theyre healthier theyre happier theyre more likely to stay mentally sharp Scientists say that more studies are needed but Buster Sussman  seems to be living confirmation of the studies done so far Two of his paintings are hanging in the show Theyre faux advertisements done in the style of Picasso The former real estate reporter only started painting recently and gets a kick out of seeing his work hanging on the wall Im vain he explains Im a total fraud as an artist but you can be vain and a fraud at the same time An artistic fraud maybe But his selfdeprecating wit is as authentic as it gets
