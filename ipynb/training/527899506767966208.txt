The world is facing a doublebarreled pandemic reminiscent of the dual epidemic of tuberculosis and HIV that emerged in the s  only potentially much bigger Its a   thats beginning to affect many countries around the globe  poor middleincome and even rich nations The problem is that people with diabetes  a galloping   in itself  are two to three times more likely to get active TB And   harbors the TB germ making them vulnerable if they get diabetes Researchers say that diabetes suppresses the immune system giving latent TB germs the chance to multiply and cause disease Diabetes is fueling the spread of TB declares a   on the looming coepidemic released at the   Union World Conference on Lung Health in Barcelona on Wednesday Having diabetes increases the risk that a person will become sick with TB the report says Diabetes is also more difficult to manage in people who have TB And a person sick with both diseases is likely to have complications that do not typically exist when either is present on its own Dr   a coauthor of the report tells Goats and Soda theres a new urgency to head off the dual epidemic in countries with high levels of TB such as Brazil China India Indonesia and the Russian Federation Harries who spent years in Malawi as the HIVTB epidemic unfolded doesnt want to repeat history Looking back we were a bit late in our response to the HIVTB epidemic It took a while to wake up to the fact that HIV was driving that Warnings about the deadly interaction of HIV and TB were sounded in the early s but no global strategy was developed until  The AIDS virus kills off CD cells in the immune system which are necessary to fight TB infection The TBdiabetes doublewhammy has at least two important differences from the TBHIV coepidemic And while low and middleincome countries with most of the worlds population is at risk for the TBdiabetes problem wealthy countries such as the United States are hardly immune in an increasingly mobile world Akbar Anthony is a case in point A yearold Pakistani hes lived with his family in the Bronx for more than  years working as a welder This spring he developed a fever and malaise  although not the coughing that sometimes signals a lung disease A trip to the emergency room and a lung xray revealed TB I was in the hospital for  days in an isolated room Anthony tells Goats and Soda If somebody come inside they had to wear a mask I never go outside for  days It was not easy Drugs eventually cleared his TB But blood tests showed he had diabetes  and apparently has suffered from the metabolic disorder for years It has caused blindness in one eye and numbness in his feet side effects of longstanding diabetes A study presented in Barcelona on Thursday finds that one in five TB patients in the Indian state of Kerala also had diabetes So as Akbar Anthonys case also shows people with newly diagnosed TB should be tested for unsuspected diabetes And a large Korean study presented at the Barcelona meeting shows that TB is frequently diagnosed within a year of diabetes  a finding that argues for screening newly diagnosed diabetics for TB Such bidirectional screening seems like simple logic But it represents a big shift in thinking among doctors and public health workers Infectious and noncommunicable diseases are thought of as occurring in separate silos treated by different kinds of doctors and addressed if at all by different programs or agencies that dont talk to one another Nobody knows whether Akbar Anthony caught TB in New York City or brought it from his native Pakistan Of the two billion people in the world with latent TB infection  percent will never get sick from it But the risk soars among people who develop diabetes Obviously diabetes does something to your immunity but we dont understand what Harries says Were trying to understand the mechanisms One thing is clear Having both diseases complicates the treatment and compromises the outcome of both For one thing diabetes drugs interfere with those needed to cure TB and vice versa This makes it more difficult to treat TB Harries says Theres an increased chance of relapse and death and it takes longer to go from infectious to noninfectious And controlling diabetes becomes more difficult The dual infection may also increase patients risk of getting hardtotreat multidrug resistant TB although theres conflicting evidence about that The new report cosponsored by the   and the   asserts that attacking the dual epidemics affecting many countries will not requirenew global health agencies or mobilizing vast new sums of money But theres reason to be skeptical that heading off the coepidemic will come cheap You can say How on earth are we going to implement this And I dont think weve got that worked out yet Harries says India which has a high incidence of both TB and diabetes has recently set up a system to provide free diabetes testing But newly diagnosed patients have to pay for their own diabetes drugs which are beyond the means of many Indians In China patients must bear the cost of both diabetic testing and treatment This too is different from the situation with TBHIV Harries says HIV and TB diagnosis and treatment are generally free thanks to the belated realization that nocost treatment was necessary to fight that coepidemic Thats not the case with noncommunicable diseases like diabetes he says
