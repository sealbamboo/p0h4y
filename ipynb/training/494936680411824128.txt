Let me guess how you feel about your urine Get that smelly stuff away from me as fast as possible A small group of environmentalists in Vermont isnt as squeamish Instead of flushing their pee down the drain theyre collecting it with special toilets that separate No  and No  Then theyre pooling the urine of the  volunteers in the pilot project a quart or so per person daily and eventually giving it to a farmer whos putting it on her hay fields in place of synthetic fertilizer The goal is to collect  gallons this year The logic driving this avantgarde project of the   based in Brattleboro Vt is that its foolish and wasteful to part with the precious nitrogen and phosphorus that moves from the food we eat right through us  especially when farmers have to buy fertilizer at great expense to put those very same nutrients back into the soil Whats more founders   tell The Salt once our urine enters the wastewater system drinking water carries it to a treatment facility where the nutrients become pollutants that can contaminate waterways and cause   among other issues One goal is preventing the pollution caused by peeing in water  keeping pee out of the waterways and protecting water quality says NoeHays And we can also make agriculture more sustainable and resilient by returning these nutrients to the soil Urine is an inherently local and renewable source of fertilizer The idea of peecycling has much in common with the night soil tradition as well as the newer practice of using   or sewage sludge thats been transformed into soil amendment for farmers Several wastewater treatment plants in the US have been making and donating biosolids which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency to farmers for years But the practice is controversial because some activists claim that even certified biosolids could contain harmful chemicals The average human generates  pounds of nitrogen and almost  pound of phosphorous in a years worth of urine And those nutrients come in a form that plants can use Though Rich Earth is the only legally authorized and publicly documented urine reuse project in the US many other countries  rich and poor alike  have recognized its potential and are conducting their own research Urine from a healthy person is sterile so using it on farmland is considered safe Even the World Health Organization has   for reusing urine in agriculture The problem though is that with the   which some of the REI volunteers are using others have waterless urinals with removable containers the pee may get contaminated So to kill off germs Nace and NoeHays are testing two sanitization methods pasteurization and storing it for a month or more which allows the alkalinity to develop over time and kill microbes They are also trying to determine if there are medicines in the waste that might wind up in plants grown for food So theyre sending samples to researchers at the University of Michigan and University of Buffalo to find out for a study funded by the EPA So far the only farmer using the product grows hay as a forage crop for animals When the Rich Earth team measured the impact of the urine applied to her hay fields in  they found that yields increased dramatically And word has gotten around their community they now have a waiting list We have more farmers who want urine brought to them than infrastructure to do it says Nace But we can only begin to service this region We would like to have enough scientific documentation that it could be replicated at the state level Scaling up such a project isnt just a hope of hippie Vermonters   a researcher at the Center for Development Research at the University of Bonn in Germany assessed two rather complex and expensive technologies for turning urine into fertilizer and   that agricultural yields with urine fertilizers were comparable to those achieved with commercial fertilizers Europeans and particularly   are intrigued by the idea But Antonini tells us in an email theres a long way to go before you can even think of using urine as a commercial fertilizer given the rather stringent regulations in the EU In the developing world however she thinks these systems could be especially helpful for those who dont currently have access to any sanitation But so far there isnt much demand for it Still ecological sanitation is becoming a bit of a buzzword  the wonky version of peecycling
