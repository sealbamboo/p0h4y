 Regular consumption of black tea  which is rich in    significantly reduced blood pressure a randomized placebocontrolled trial showed Drinking three cups each day for six months lowered both diastolic and systolic blood pressure by  to  mm Hg according to Jonathan Hodgson PhD of the University of Western Australia in Perth and colleagues Even those small changes could have a large impact on health at the population level they reported in a research letter in   Those differences would be associated with a  percent reduction in the prevalence of hypertension and a  percent to  percent decrease in the risk of   they said Hodgson and colleagues conducted a randomized trial that included  men and women ages  to  mean age  for men and  for women who were regular tea drinkers The participants had a mean body mass index of  kgm and a mean daytime systolic blood pressure of  mm Hg at baseline During a fourweek runin period all of the participants consumed a lowflavonoid diet along with three cups of regular leaf tea per day During the sixmonth intervention period the participants were randomized to three cups per day of either mg powdered black tea solids that contained  mg of   and  mg of caffeine or a placebo drink matched in flavor and caffeine content From baseline to six months there were no changes in energy and nutrient intake urinary sodium and potassium excretion or body weight in either group There were however differences in hour ambulatory blood pressure driven mostly by daytime readings For systolic readings were  mm Hg lower at three months and  mm Hg lower at six months in the participants who were drinking tea For diastolic the differences were  and  mm Hg respectively Hodgson and colleagues noted that previous shortterm randomized trials exploring the effects of black tea on blood pressure may have failed to demonstrate significant effects because they were underpowered to find small but clinically significant differences It is also possible they noted that longerterm consumption is needed to make an impact As for why black tea would lower blood pressure the researchers pointed to effects on the endothelium the inner lining of blood vessels that helps blood flow smoothly Endothelial dysfunction may be an early marker for changes in blood pressure and there is evidence that tea consumption improves endothelial function This could contribute to reduced vascular tone and lower blood pressure the authors wrote Another possible mechanism involves the effects of tea flavonoids on body weight and visceral fatness A recent metaanalysis suggests that green tea and its flavonoids  many of which are structurally similar to black tea flavonoids  together with caffeine can reduce body weight and abdominal fatness wrote the researchers who noted that although there was no change in body weight in the current study information on   was not available
