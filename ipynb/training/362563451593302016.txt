Maybe this isnt so surprising given the aggressively narrow proportions in girls clothing these days in trendy skinny jeans Lycra leggings and unforgiving clingy tops that are all the rage among the under set Its no wonder that young girls are more aware than ever of their own minimuffin tops or baby fat as grandmas call it Compound clothes with the omnipresent camera phone photo stream and selfies and its a recipe ripe for selfloathing  We know that there is a very real childhood obesity epidemic in this country plaguing entire communities and it is one of the most significant health issues of our time Our snack food nation is chock full of overstuffed sodacoma kids who play outside less and eat more According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in  more than onethird of children and teenagers in the United States were overweight or obese The number is alarming Its a national crisis that everyone from  on down seems intent on tackling In fact my daughters elementary school participated in an ampedup fitness program this year The program included cardio and flexibility tests weighing the children and taking a body mass index The results were printed with colorcoded columns that redflagged danger zones for kids at risk in various categories  I happened to walk into the school on a morning when some fourthgrade girls were being herded into a corner next to a scale and weighed by the physical education teacher who then typed the childrens weight into a laptop As the girls waited to be weighed some looked like they were about to burst into tears and others like they were going to throw up One of the tiniest girls in the grade stood next to one of the largest in a painfully awkward scene that seemed stolen from a    For the next few days the chatter among the girls was What do you weigh My daughter came home stressed she like many of the girls didnt want to share her weight or even step on a scale The whole ordeal was mortifying even among a group of averagesized girls I told my daughter she didnt need to tell anyone her weight and if pushed I said she could lie  Having just been to the pediatrician for my daughters annual physical she and I knew exactly what she weighed and that she was perfectly healthy But the number on the scale startled her On the cusp of puberty many of the girls bodies are changing and emotionally they are more fragile than ever I told our school principal that I didnt want my daughter weighed Even at age  or  regardless of the number on the scale it just felt like a public shaming  Were very concerned about some of the childrens antiobesity programs and messaging thats happening now said Claire Mysko manager of the National Eating Disorders Associations   They are well intentioned of course but when the focus is on BMI as an indicator of health and when kids are getting weighed at school and comparing notes it can really be a trigger for kids who are already feeling vulnerable There is research out there that these programs may be backfiring The kids are coming home more anxious The goal is to shift the conversation away from BMI and talk about what makes your body feel good  A few years ago there was a public outcry when DaraLynn Weiss   the severe diet she put her yearold daughter on The article was part confessional about Weiss own body issues and struggle with food as well as her yearlong quest to slim down her daughter Weiss got the   But after Weiss learned that her daughter was obese at  years old standing  feet  inches and weighing  pounds didnt she have to take some serious intervention  My daughter enjoys a good meal especially if mac and cheese is on the menu So when she went to sleepaway camp at  years old I had prepped her ahead of time about making healthy food choices Make sure to eat lots of fruit and drink plenty of water Stay away from all the white and creamy ranch salad dressings Choose the clear ones that look like vinaigrette I told her  One of the first letters she sent home that summer was all about what she ate for dinner  Mommy youll be so proud of me I didnt eat the white dressing I ate the clear one she wrote  The letter had me laughing and a little worried At  years old had I started the beginning of a lifelong eating disorder or am I just making for a conscientious and healthy eater  As parents you have to set boundaries but you dont want to make certain foods off limits or shameful You also dont want to set it up that every time you have the chocolate cake that its indulgent or sinful Mysko said We dont want kids thinking about calories or fat grams and stoking that fear And shame is not a motivator of healthy behavior Some children hit the genetic lottery and dont have to worry about their metabolism or weight but many more boys included feel the embarrassment of being the bigger kid Experts say that the key for parents is to not obsess about the number on the scale and also to look at their own attitudes about food and weight If every time you walk by the mirror youre scrutinizing yourself youre sending a dangerous message to your own children  Weight is a fear that so many parents have But we have to shift the focus away from weight and BMI Its less about making sure kids dont get fat or that fat kids get thin Mysko said The conversation should be about how can we make all kids healthy and feel good about themselves
