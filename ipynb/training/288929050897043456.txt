During first period at Olivenhain Pioneer Elementary School in Encinitas Calif Kristen McCloskey leads about two dozen thirdgraders through some familiar yoga poses All right so lets do our opening sequence A she says instructing the kids Everyone take a big inhale lift those arms up Look up At the end of the halfhour class yearold Jacob Hagen says he feels energized and ready for the rest of the day Because you get to stretch out and its good to be the first class because it wakes you up he says Schools across the country are focusing more on teaching students to make healthy choices Encinitas Superintendent Tim Baird says yoga is just one element of the districts physical education curriculum We also have a nutrition program he says We also have a lifeskills program where kids learn about perseverance and responsibility The whole wellness program is supported by a  grant from the KP Jois Foundation The Encinitasbased group promotes a kind of yoga called Ashtanga which was introduced to Encinitas from India in  by founder Krishna Pattabhi Jois But when Mary Eady visited one of the yoga classes at her sons school last year she saw much more than a fitness program They were being taught to thank the sun for their lives and the warmth that it brought the life that it brought to the earth and they were told to do that right before they did their sun salutation exercises she says Those looked like religious teachings to her so she opted to keep her son out of the classes The more Eady reads about the Jois Foundation and its founders beliefs in the spiritual benefits of Ashtanga yoga the more shes convinced that the poses and meditation cant be separated from their Hindu roots Its stated in the curriculum that its meant to shape the way that they view the world its meant to shape the way that they make life decisions Eady says Its meant to shape the way that they regulate their emotions and the way that they view themselves Eady is part of a group of parents working with Dean Broyles president and chief counsel of the Escondidobased National Center for Law and Policy And then the question becomes  if it is religious which it is who decides when enough religion has been stripped out of the program to make it legal Broyles says I mean thats the problem when you introduce religion into the curriculum and actually immerse and marinate children in the program Critics of the yoga class launched an online petition that garnered about  signatures as of Friday about  of them voluntarily identifying themselves as parents in the district Another online petition in support of the class had more than  signatures which are anonymous to those who dont sign Eady and the other parents working with Broyles want the classes made completely voluntary and moved to before or after the school day They say school officials havent responded to their concerns Opponents worry that the class will be adopted in schools across the nation They point to the Jois Foundations funding of researchers at the Universities of San Diego and Virginia to study whether the yoga classes affect things like attendance behavior and student achievement It is the stated goal of both the Jois Foundation and the district itself to prove scientifically that Ashtanga yoga works for kids here in the district and then export it nationally Broyles says Jois Foundation Director Eugene Ruffin however maintains that the yoga program is typical of athletics programs for kids They provide you with the exercise and the motivation for children Ruffin says And then they give you character exercises  Thou shalt not steal thou shall be honest thou shall be respectful to adults  Ruffin says those ideals arent specific to Hinduism and dont conflict with his own Catholic upbringing Despite the controversy most parents like Monique Cocco are happy with the classes She says her children dont come home with a newfound knowledge of Hinduism Absolutely not  no What my daughter tells me is she did the pancake today and she lays down and then she cracks up because its so funny Cocco says Cocco hears from teachers that kids are calmer and more focused after yoga so the teachers can spend more class time on lessons instead of settling kids down the way they sometimes have to after traditional gym classes When winter break ends Monday the school district is moving forward with plans to have the classes taught at all nine Encinitas schools
