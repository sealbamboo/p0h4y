Doctors later declared Jahi braindead and told Winkfield they were going to take her off life support Her parents   asking for just a little more time The big question is How in the world did this happen  said CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen Youre talking about a tonsillectomy right Tonsillectomy is the third most common surgical procedure performed on children in the United States   after circumcision and ear tubes  While not as common in adults tonsillectomy joins the list of   such as appendectomy cholecystectomy gallbladder removal and cesarean section But just because these surgeries are routine doesnt mean theyre  safe Theres a reason the consent form you sign at the hospital is so detailed While your surgeon may have successfully performed this particular procedure thousands of times each patient is different Your risk doesnt change because the person who was on the operating table before you survived  The complications are very rare said Dr Albert Wu director of the Center for Health Services and Outcomes Research at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health But uncontrollable bleeding can happen in almost any surgery In extreme cases you can bleed out In general Wu said the most common postsurgery complications are bleeding infection and damage to nearby tissue During a tonsillectomy for example surgeons are removing the tonsils two ovalshaped pads near the back of the throat To do so they must cut or burn away the tonsils which could lead to a small artery being nicked Usually surgeons will stop the bleeding by cauterizing it Wu said but some people dont clot well  A   of more than  tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy patients in Germany examined the postoperative complications for these surgeries An adenoidectomy removes the patients adenoids and is commonly done alongside a tonsillectomy Bleeding occurred in about  of the patients five needed a blood transfusion   done in Europe in  that included more than  tonsillectomy patients found about  were delayed in being discharged or returned to the hospital in the  days after surgery Eight patients received a blood transfusion One death was reported during the study period  The statistics are slightly higher for other common surgical procedures A study of  laparoscopic cholecystectomies   found complications in  of the patients Yet the risk of death is still low a   found the mortality rate for gallbladder removal was between  and   Certain patients are at greater risk during general surgery than others Wu said Patients with preexisting conditions such as heart lung or liver problems are more likely to suffer from complications or die  The stress of surgery can be too much for you to be able to maintain your bodys equilibrium Wu said  Obese patients are also at greater risk A   showed severely obese children undergoing tonsillectomies had an increased risk of complications during their surgeries   But what if the patients body isnt at fault What if its the surgeon who messes up Medical errors kill more than  people every year in the United States according to   Add them all up and you have probably the third leading cause of death in the country Dr Peter Pronovost senior vice president for patient safety and quality at Johns Hopkins Hospital told CNN during a  investigation into common medical mistakes  Wu said patients should tell their surgeons everything that they know about themselves including their past experiences with surgery and anesthesia whether they have any allergies and if theyre prone to bruising or heavy bleeding   The question people should always ask is Do I need this surgery  Wu said In some cases not having surgery is riskier than having the surgery  but for many many things the surgery is quite discretionary You have a choice
