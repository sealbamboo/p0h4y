Weve been asking Americans about stress in their lives On Friday the tables were turned when Dr Lynn Bufka a licensed psychologist with expertise in treating anxiety stress and related problems came to NPR to take questions on Reddit about coping with stress Bufka who works at the American Psychological Association in Washington DC is on Twitter   She said that the questions during the Ask Me Anything session were common issues that her patients ask about all the time Were all going to experience stress she told Shots Its a normal part of our day but we have a choice in how we respond to it When asked if doing the AMA was stressful for her she responded No not really Besides she said It was fun and a little challenging  but I like to be challenged If one person learned something helpful then thats great Here are some of the highlights from Reddit edited for length and clarity You can find the full set of questions and answers   Stress can interfere with many things we try to do Some people can be very anxious about being evaluated socially and therefore are reluctant to make small talk because they are concerned about how other people will perceive their comments In those situations try to focus on the other person and draw him or her out Once he or she is chatting you may start to feel more comfortable too Lots of strategies can reduce stress  try to maintain regular sleepeatexercise habits as much as possible say no when overwhelmed with tasks turn off newsinformation for some mental downtime spend time with people who make you feel good participate in something with others a sport volunteering religious services or maybe find your own quiet rituals to take some slow breaths and let go of the days pressures These are only a start in trying to reduce stress Try to identify situations that make you a little anxious but you think you can do Maybe making small talk with a family member or making eye contact with the person you are buying items from and practice those Make yourself mini practice assignments that seem doable track how you do and as you practice them they will become easier Heres something many people find very surprising Most people are paying more attention to themselves not you You might feel anxious and might be concerned that you look nervous but the person next to you might feel the same way about himself or she might be looking at the time and wondering if shell catch her bus or they might be thinking about what to cook for dinner  Family can be stressful for a variety of reasons even if that same family is a source of love and support Sometimes it is just the busyness of lives  lots of people with different activities and different ideas and just trying to stay connected can be a challenge However if it is about trying to live up to expectations part of the challenge is helping your family understand who you are and what motivates and interests you so that they can be supportive of your aims and goals Families no matter how much they love us sometimes have ideas about who we are supposed to be that dont match up with who we really are and navigating that is tricky Trying to have an open conversation is a good first step Im not sure we want to be totally stress free Sometimes stress makes us work harder get more prepared for tasks we are facing or perform better Stress sometimes results from good things  like getting married or bringing a new pet into the home However we want to be aware of those situations in which we feel overwhelmed by demands That is when we want to try and reduce our stress by doing things like changing the demands when possible or changing how we think about situations Sometimes the situations are stressful and sometimes we make them more stressful because we pile on expectations or mental demands or perfectionism even beyond whatever the situation is
