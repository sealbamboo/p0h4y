My twin grandsons now  walk nearly a mile to and from school and play basketball in the schoolyard for an hour or more most afternoons when weather and music lessons permit The boys like their father are lean strong and healthy Their parents chose to live in New York where their legs and public transit enable them to go from place to place efficiently at low cost and with little stress usually They own a car but use it almost exclusively for vacations Green commuting is a priority in my family I use a bicycle for most shopping and errands in the neighborhood and I just bought my grandsons new bicycles for their trips to and from soccer games accompanied by their cycling father My son used to work in New Jersey which entailed a hated commute by car that took  to  minutes each way He quit that job when his sons were born and working parttime from home cared for the boys He now commutes to work in the city by foot and by subway giving him time to read for pleasure As youll soon see the change has probably been good for his health too According to the Census Bureau more than threefourths of all commuters   in  Only  percent used public transportation and  percent walked to work A mere  percent rode bicycles although cycling has finally begun to rise in popularity as cities like New York create bike lanes and   But workers are not the only ones driving for hours a day The midth century suburban idyll of children going out to play with friends in backyards and on safe streets has yielded to a new reality play dates lessons and organized activities to which they must be driven and watched over by adults In My Car Knows the Way to Gymnastics an aptly titled chapter in Leigh Gallaghers prophetic new book The End of the Suburbs she describes a stayathome mom in Massachusetts who drives more than her commuting husband   to  miles each weekday just to get herself and her children around each day Millions of Americans like her pay dearly for their dependence on automobiles losing hours a day that would be better spent exercising socializing with family and friends preparing homecooked meals or simply   The resulting costs to both physical and   are hardly trivial Suburban sprawl has taken a huge toll on our health wrote Ms Gallagher an editor at Fortune magazine Research has been piling up that establishes a link between the spread of sprawl and the rise of   in our country Researchers have also found that people get less   as the distances among where we live work shop and socialize increase In places where people walk more obesity rates are much lower she noted New Yorkers perhaps the ultimate walkers weigh six or seven pounds less on average than suburban Americans  of  Texans compared their health with the distances they commuted to and from workIt showed that as these distances increased physical activity and cardiovascular fitness dropped and   body weight waist circumference and metabolic risks rose The report published last year in The American Journal of Preventive Medicine by Christine M Hoehner and colleagues from the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis and the Cooper Institute in Dallas provided causal evidence for earlier findings that linked the time spent driving to an increased risk of cardiovascular death The study examined the effects of a lengthy commute on health over the course of seven years It revealed that driving more than  miles one way to and from work five days a week was associated with an increased risk of developing high blood sugar and high   The researchers also linked long driving commutes to a greater risk of depression anxiety and social isolation all of which can impair the quality and length of life A Swedish study has confirmed the international reach of these effects Erika Sandow a social geographer at Umea University found that people who commuted more than  miles a day were more likely to have   stress and heart disease In a second study Dr Sandow found that women who lived more than  miles from work tended to die sooner than those who lived closer to their jobs Regardless of how one gets to work having a job far from home can undermine health Another Swedish study directed by Erik Hansson of Lund University surveyed more than  people ages  to  and found that the longer they commuted by car subway or bus the more health complaints they had

Gallagher happily recounts some important countervailing trends more young families are electing to live in cities fewer yearolds are getting drivers licenses people are driving fewer miles and bike sharing is on the rise More homes and communities are being planned or reconfigured to shorten commutes reduce car dependence and facilitate positive interactions with other people Dr Richard Jackson the chair of environmental health sciences at the University of California Los Angeles says demographic shifts are fueling an interest in livable cities Members of Generation Y tend to prefer mixeduse walkable neighborhoods and short commutes he said and childless couples and baby boomers who no longer drive often favor urban settings While there is still a long way to go before the majority of Americans live in communities that foster good health more urban planners are now doing healthimpact assessments and working closely with architects with the aim of designing healthier communities less dependent on motorized vehicles for transportation Â
