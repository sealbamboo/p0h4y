It happens to the best of us You drink one too many cups of coffee and for the next few hours you end up acting like a hyper preschooler who just   Which can be pretty inconvenient if its say noon and youre at the office or if its midnight and you cant fall asleep Wouldnt it be nice if there were something quick and easy that you could take to combat the effects of overcaffeination Something like  a banana Last week food blog     that eating a banana might indeed be an effective way to remedy overcaffeination This based on advice solicited from baristas like Simon Ouderkirk of   Folks science has proven that bananas will stop the jitters and get your eyesight right after too many espressos he told   As far as we can tell the scientific argument for why bananas might tame an unwanted caffeine jolt rests on the fact that caffeine is a diuretic If you consume too much of it you risk depleting your levels of important electrolytes like potassium Eating foods rich in potassium like bananas can help to counter this effect Its a plausible theory but is it correct Unfortunately not says   professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center According to Eichner drinking a few too many cups of coffee will not have any noticeable effect on potassium levels The only cases of low potassium from caffeine I know of were flukes he writes in an email to   He points to the case of a yearold Australian   who experienced severe muscle weakness after drinking  liters of CocaCola during a wild and crazy night of kangaroo hunting Turns out hed been following that kind of colaheavy diet on a daily basis for the previous three years But even if you did manage to consume enough caffeine to significantly deplete potassium levels Eichner adds that eating just one banana wouldnt help you out much For example in order to restore the potassium lost from a severe bout of diarrhea he says youd have to eat the equivalent of a footlong banana Sorry folks but it looks like bananas arent a caffeination cureall after all And until the day when mega bananas   become available for purchase Eichner suggests a more practical if less whimsical way to treat overcaffeination Just let it wear off
