On Aug  doctors and nurses at Childrens Mercy Hospital in Kansas City Mo realized they had a problem Children were coming into the emergency room with an illness that caused wheezing and breathing problems so severe that some children ended up in the ICU on ventilators And it was spreading fast By Aug  we were beyond our bed capacity   chief of the infectious diseases section at Childrens Mercy said at the   in Philadelphia Since then the virus that caused those illnesses   has sickened children across the country and may be responsible for the deaths of five children Jackson and   of Johns Hopkins Childrens Centers briefed reporters on the outbreak Thursday morning Bottom line There are still a lot more questions than answers about the outbreak and how the virus might affect childrens health in the future but were learning Heres what infectious disease specialists have found out to date  Cases have been reported in  states and the District of Columbia Though the CDC has confirmed  cases as of Wednesday there are undoubtedly many many more cases that are causing milder coldlike illnesses This is different this year what were seeing Milstone said Something is different So far its impossible to know whats making it different Milstone says  if the virus has changed so its more dangerous or if its spreading so much more widely that were seeing more cases both mild and severe Five children who died have tested positive for EVD but its not known whether the virus caused their deaths Milstone said The Midwest has been hit harder in this outbreak than the coasts That may be because people there have immunity due to earlier undetected outbreaks Early on it looked like most of the children who were being hospitalized with lifethreatening breathing problems had a history of asthma But Jackson says onethird of the patients at Childrens Mercy who fell seriously ill had been healthy with no previous respiratory issues If your child has ever wheezed in the past get with your primary care physician to have an asthma action plan Jackson said  There is no rapid test for enterovirus D and since theres no medication specific to it the treatment will be the same We continue to restrict testing to children with unusually severe disease Jackson said That will help researchers figure out whats causing the severe cases and also may help predict what will happen to those children in the future  Enteroviruses typically circulate from midsummer until early fall this years outbreak is already waning Since theres no vaccine for this bug the best defense is timetested infection control Make sure that children wash hands often cover their coughs and stay home if theyre sick Milstone couldnt resist putting in a plug for the flu shot last year  children died of the flu The one thing that parents and doctors would probably most like to know is the least clear  whether the rare cases of paralysis that have been reported in children who had been ill are tied to EVD Its known that enteroviruses can cause paralysis polio is a notorious member of this large group So it makes sense to look at EVD as a cause But theres no clear evidence that the limb weakness and paralysis experienced by a few children is a result of this virus Of the three children who had symptoms of flaccid paralysis at Childrens Mercy Jackson said none tested positive for EVD I expect there will be more cases across the United States Jackson said and a number of different causes linked to these cases The CDC has convened a group of neurologists to work on the issue Figuring it out will take very very close study she said
