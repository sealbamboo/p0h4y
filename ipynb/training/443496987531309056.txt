Childhood obesity has made it to the forefront of public health issues both in the United Kingdom and in the United States Now researchers at the Universities of Dundee Strathclyde Georgia and Bristol say that not only does obesity affect a childs overall health but it may also lead to poorer school performance among teenage girls Among boys the link is less apparent Since the s the UK has seen childhood obesity rates grow at an alarming rate says   specialist in the prevention of childhood obesity at the University of Strathclyde and the studys lead author Today nearly a quarter of children in UK are obese by the time they reach  Increasingly researchers in both the US and the UK have been interested in how obesity might affect students academic achievement but Reilly says few studies have examined the same students over several years or been able tease out obesitys effects from the influence of social factors such as socioeconomic status The current study analyzed data from nearly  adolescent students in the UK comparing their body mass index from ages  to  with how well they performed in standardized tests during those years About  percent of the students surveyed were of a healthy weight at the start the researchers said and about  percent were obese The academic exams which tested the students English math and science abilities were given three times  at ages   and  After adjusting for factors like socioeconomic status IQ and menstruation cycles the researchers found that on average girls who were obese at age  performed worse at age   and  than girls deemed to have a healthy weight Being obese at  the scientists found was enough to lower average attainment to a grade D instead of a grade C by age  The strength of that effect can mean the difference between passing a class and failing it says Reilly He and his colleagues focused on age  he says because thats about the age that determines whether you will do well after   and whether you will go on in college The   Tuesday in the   Though the study followed British teens Reilly says the findings are likely also applicable to students in the United States where the proportion of children between the ages  and  who are obese   from  percent in  to nearly  percent by  The similarities between the environment the culture and school systems between the US and the UK are more similar than may be obvious Reilly says There is nothing about this study that is specific to the UK agrees   the director of Yale Universitys Prevention Research Center who wasnt involved in the study For example one    of more than  boys and girls in elementary school in the US also found that obese students performed worse on math tests The reason behind such a link or why it consistently seems more prevalent among young girls has yet to be determined Reilly says But other studies suggest the stigma of obesity and its effect on mental health in young adults may play a large role Girls are much more affected by obesity in terms of mental health and wellbeing than boys are he says adding that stigmas negative effect on things like selfimage selfesteem and even depression may be lead girls to skip school more often leading to poorer grades The issue with girls Katz says is that theyre much more subject to the peer pressure and ridicule associated with obesity The link between obesity and grades likely goes both directions Katz adds That is poor academic achievement also could contribute to obesity If youre rewarded with grades and success then youre less dependent on fries and cheese doodles frankly he says And if your grades are not good or rewarding you dont have to be depressed to be frustrated  and for your selfesteem to plummet And food may be a solution you turn to But there are a slew of other factors that might also explain the link  including the ways sleep problems in obese teens can impair school performance and brain function and the findings that peers tend to influence each others weight We tend to isolate factors Katz says But likely  everything that happens influences everything else that happens The best strategy at least in the US he says is to address the root causes of obesity from a cultural level We need to make eating well the default Katz says We need to make physical activity a default And we need to address  the hypocrisy of a culture where the First Lady is focused on childhood obesity but we aggressively market French fries and Coca Cola
