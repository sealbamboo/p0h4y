The presence of a romantic partner during painful medical procedures could make women feel worse rather than better researchers say A study involving  couples found this increase in pain was most pronounced in women who tended to avoid closeness in their relationships  The authors say bringing a loved one along for support may not be the best strategy for every patient  The work appears in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience  Researchers from University College London Kings College London and the University of Hertfordshire say there has been very little scientific research into the effects of a partners presence on someones perception of pain despite this being common medical advice They recruited  heterosexual couples and asked them a series of questions to measure how much they sought or avoided closeness and emotional intimacy in relationships  Each female volunteer was then subjected to a series of painful laser pulses while her partner was in and then out of the room  The women were asked to score their level of pain They also had their brain activity measured using a medical test called an EEG  The researchers found that certain women were more likely to score high levels of pain while their partner was in the room  These were women who said they preferred to avoid closeness trusted themselves more than their partners and felt uncomfortable in their relationships  And researchers say the findings were mirrored in the brain activity tests too  When their partners were present the womens EEG traces showed higher spikes of activity in regions of the brain linked with experiencing body threat  Dr Katernia Fotopoulou one of the lead researchers told the BBC Our research shows one piece of advice doesnt fit everyone  Advice that you must have your partner with you is not always going to work if people are most concerned about lowering the level of pain they feel Dr Amanda Williams from University College London provided an independent comment This research fits well with previous studies  some children report they feel more pain in the presence of their parents  This is particularly true when their parents are more anxious than them People assume that having a partner a parent or a close other present is always helpful but it is clearly not the case  We need to understand who this advice doesnt suit
