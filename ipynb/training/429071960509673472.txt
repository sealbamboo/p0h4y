The high number of early deaths in Russia is mainly due to people drinking too much alcohol particularly vodka research suggests  The study in The Lancet says  of Russian men die before they are  and most of the deaths are down to alcohol The comparable UK figure is  Causes of death include liver disease and alcohol poisoning Many also die in accidents or after getting into fights The study is thought to be the largest of its kind in the country Researchers from the Russian Cancer Centre in Moscow Oxford University in the UK and the World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer in France tracked the drinking patterns of  adults in three Russian cities over up to  years  During that time  of them died The researchers also drew on previous studies in which families of  people who had died were asked about their loved ones drinking habits  Study coauthor Prof Sir Richard Peto from the University of Oxford said Russian death rates have fluctuated wildly over the last  years as alcohol restrictions and social stability varied under Presidents Gorbachev Yeltsin and Putin and the main thing driving these wild fluctuations in death was vodka In  the then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev drastically cut vodka production and did not allow it to be sold before lunchtime Researchers say alcohol consumption fell by around a quarter when the restrictions came in and so did overall death rates Then when communism collapsed people started drinking more again and the death rates also rose Sir Richard said When President Yeltsin took over from President Gorbachev the overall death rates in young men more than doubled This was as society collapsed and vodka became much more freely available  There was a huge increase in drinking and they were drinking in a destructive way They were getting drunk on spirits and then buying and drinking more producing a big risk of death The consumption rates for women also fluctuated according to political events but they drank less so mortality rates were also lower Most drinkers were smokers as well which researchers say aggravated the death rates Russia brought in stricter alcohol control measures in  including raising taxes and restricting sales  Researchers say alcohol consumption has fallen by a third since then and the proportion of men dying before they reach  years old has fallen from  to  Half a litre of vodka costs around   roubles Heavy drinkers in this study were getting through at least a litre and a half of vodka a week  In  each Russian adult drank on average  litres of pure alcohol every year of which eight litres was in spirits mainly vodka  In the UK the comparable figure is  litres per adult  but just less than two litres of that is in spirits Researchers say the key problem driving the high death rate is the way Russians drink alcohol Researcher Prof David Zaridze from the Russian Cancer Research Centre said They binge drink Thats the main problem Its the pattern of drinking not the percapita amount they are drinking Russians have always drunk a lot They sometimes say its because of the cold weather but this is just an excuse This is the nations lifestyle that needs to change Since the average life expectancy from birth for men in Russia is still only  years ranking among the lowest  countries in the world more effective alcohol and tobacco policy measures are urgently needed
