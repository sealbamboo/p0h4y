People who carry errors in a single gene could be protected against heart attacks and high cholesterol American research suggests The New England Journal of Medicine study reveals one in every  people could have genetic faults that halve the chance of suffering heart attacks  Drugs that work on this gene pathway already exist and researchers hope this sheds light on their effectiveness Scientists say their findings may pave the way for improved therapies  A team of US scientists sequenced the entire genetic code of  people identifying  people with specific errors The naturally occurring genetic changes lead to a key gene not activating  Most people have two active copies of the NPCL gene but researchers found the  people with an inactive copy had lower levels of LDL cholesterol  The study suggests their cholesterol levels were about  lower than those with two active copies of the gene  And they were at half the risk of suffering heart attacks too  People with the errors did not differ from the larger population in other ways such as their blood pressure weight and rate of diabetes  all factors that can contribute to heart attack risk  Dr Sekar Kathiresan of the Broad Institute who worked on the study said Protective mutations like the one weve just identified for heart disease are a treasure trove for understanding human biology  They can teach us about the underlying causes of disease and point to important drug targets Prof Nathan Stitziel of Washington University School of Medicine who also worked on the research said When people have one copy of a gene not working its like taking a drug their entire lives that is inhibiting this gene The anticholesterol drug Ezetimibe already works by inhibiting the NPCL pathway But researchers are unsure whether it just lowers cholesterol or directly protects against heart disease too  Scientists hope this discovery will help answer this question and may spur improved therapies that target this gene   Prof Jeremy Pearson from the British Heart Foundation charity said High cholesterol is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease increasing the risk of a potentially lifethreatening heart attack or stroke  Thats why researchers are working hard to find new ways to treat this condition  The results of this genetic study are interesting and strengthen the likelihood that treatment with Ezetimibe or a more powerful drug acting on the same target will reduce cardiovascular events  Whether Ezetimibe can do so is currently being tested in a large trial whose results are eagerly awaited
