Surely listening to Pharrell Williams Oscar nominee Happy makes you bounce with joy Nirvana still makes you want to wail And old Beatles songs make you feel like everythings going to be all right But maybe you dont feel anything at all Some people lack the ability to get pleasure from music researchers say even though they enjoy food sex and other great joys in life Psychologists at the University of Barcelona stumbled upon this while they were screening participants for a study by using responses to music to gauge emotion They were surprised to find that music wasnt important at all to about  percent of the people  they said they didnt bob up and down to tunes they liked didnt get weepy didnt get chills It was like they couldnt feel the music at all People with a disorder called   cant hear musical tones So the Barcelona team tested to see if these people could identify the emotions in different types of music They could do that they could hear the music Then they asked the participants who were Spanish university students to bring in music they liked The first surprise is that some of the participants had trouble bringing music from home says Josep MarcoPallares an associate professor of psychology at the University of Barcelona and senior author of the study These people didnt have any music  no MPs no CDs No Spotify or Pandora Then the  volunteers were asked to listen to tunes judged pleasurable by other college students ranging from Puccinis Nessun dorma to Simon  Garfunkels Bridge over Troubled Water The scientists measured participants heart rate and skin conductance which are considered physiological measures of emotion The people who had said they got no pleasure from music showed no physical response while the music lovers did The other participants reported chills when listening to music MarcoPallares told Shots With our anhedonic group they had no chills They had no real response to music Well maybe theyre just insensitive boors But the scientists thought of that too They then gave participants a common psychological test with which people can earn monetary rewards The people who were indifferent to music did just fine showing faster heart rates and skin response at the prospect of winning This suggests that they dont have a global impairment of the reward system MarcoPallares says This is specific to music The   were published Thursday in   So here you have healthy happy people who just dont get music Maybe those people who dont dance at weddings arent wallflowers after all And maybe if we figure out why a small number of humans have missed out on the thrill of music  MarcoPallares calls it specific musical anhedonia  it will reveal something about why music matters so much to the rest of us MarcoPallares is hoping to find that out Hes continuing the experiment by scanning people in an MRI to see if the brains of people who say meh to music respond differently And if youd like to see how you score on the scientists musicresponsiveness scale you can try the   here Ill bet our compadres at   score off the chart
