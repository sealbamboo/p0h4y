Americans consume too much sugar and our collective sweet tooth is killing us So says   published Monday by the journal JAMA Internal Medicine It finds that  of US adults get more than the recommended  of their daily calories from added sugars in foods and drinks  and that higher levels of sugar consumption are correlated with higher risk of death due to cardiovascular disease Too much sugar does not just make us fat it can also make us sick Laura A Schmidt a professor of health policy at the UC San Francisco School of Medicine wrote in  that accompanies the study Researchers used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey or NHANES  a large study updated each year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  to measure changes in sugar consumption over time and to see its effect on health Added sugars were defined as all sugars used in processed or prepared foods such as sugarsweetened beverages grainbased desserts fruit drinks dairy desserts candy readytoeat cereals and yeast breads but not naturally occurring sugar such as in fruits and fruit juices Between  and  Americans got  of their calories from added sugars on average That figure rose to  in the years  to  then fell to  between  and  the researchers found In the most recent period studied about  of adults got more than  of their calories in the form of added sugar Nonsmokers African Americans and people under the age of  ate and drank more added sugar than other adults For the second part of the study the research team  which included experts from the CDC Emory University and the Harvard School of Public Health  took a close look at  people who were part of NHANES between  and  and were tracked for a median of  years During those years  people died as a result of cardiovascular disease The study participants were divided into five groups based on their sugar consumption People in the lowest group got fewer than  of their calories from added sugars while those in the highest group got more than  of their calories from added sugars the researchers found Compared to the people in the lowest group those in the highest group were more than twice as likely to die during the followup period according to the study But they werent the only ones who put their health in jeopardy People in the secondhighest group of sugar consumption saw their risk of death due to CVD rise by  those in the middle group saw their risk rise  and those in the fourthhighest group had  greater odds of CVD death compared to the people in the baseline group All of these figures were adjusted for age gender race income smoking and drinking history exercise habits body mass index and diet quality among other factors The increases in the risk of death were considered too large to be due to chance In general people who consumed more added sugar also had more fat and cholesterol in their diets and they ate less meat vegetables and grains according to the study Soda and other types of sugarsweetened beverages were the No  source of added sugar in American diets accounting for  of the sweeteners Those were followed by grainbased desserts  fruit drinks  dairy desserts  and candy  In the past experts focused on obesity and cavities as the primary health problems related to overconsumption of added sugars But recent studies have linked the sweeteners directly to high blood pressure high cholesterol cardiovascular disease diabetes liver cirrhosis and dementia among other chronic health problems Schmidt wrote The study findings support the logic for implementing a tax on sodas and other sugarsweetened beverages Schmidt added Fifteen countries have such taxes but campaigns to implement them in the US have failed miserably So too have efforts to remove sugar from the Food and Drug Administrations list of ingredients that are generally recognized as safe  as long as sugar retains this status food manufacturers will remain free to use as much of it as they want The new study holds potential to turn the political tide by demonstrating that added sugar is not as benign as once promised Schmidt wrote Perhaps but that doesnt seem likely in a country where experts cant even agree on how much added sugar can be part of a healthful diet The Institute of Medicine advises adults to keep added sugars below  of their total caloric intake while the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans from the US Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services recommend devoting only  to  of calories to sugar fat and other forms of discretionary calories The American Heart Assn says women should eat and drink no more than  calories worth of added sugars per day while men should not exceed  calories per day The World Health Organization says the upper limit on added sugars should be  of total calories    and like   on Facebook
