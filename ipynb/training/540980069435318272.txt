Liberian President Ellen JohnsonSirleaf hopes to ring in the holidays with an ambitious goal no new cases of Ebola in her country by Dec  We believe we had to set a target that gave our people hope a target that would make them more committed to taking all the precautionary measures she says Yes its called ambitious but sometimes you have to take a risk in being ambitious If anything the recent drop in Ebola cases is a hopeful sign The outbreak has killed more than  people in Liberia and at its height the West African nation was reporting the most new cases of the virus per week But at one point last week the Liberian Ministry of Health reported that in the countrys largest Ebola hospital  equipped with  beds  there were only   Yet while numbers are falling in the capital Monrovia new outbreaks have been popping up in remote areas which could reverse the progress Thats one of the biggest challenges to hitting the target JohnsonSirleaf tells us The battle she says is far from over This interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity Now its strengthening our health system to prevent a recurrence Its key and thats not something were waiting to get to zero to start on We already have a year plan to strengthen our healthcare facilities by training our workers and by upgrading the services in our clinics and hospitals Overambitious is the story of my life I never stop doing that And so they expect that of me I say my challenge is to work toward it I have no guarantee that I will be successful but Ill work at it Theres no great issue on that If for any reason between now and the target date we havent been able to control the outbreak we will be the first ones to admit that and to say well we did set a target but these conditions have changed it Crossborder movements will make a big difference We have porous borders so as long as you have problems over there well do what we can but you know  thats our target and we will work at it Theres no magic to it We do that through coordination  exchange of information best practices good examples Our coordinators of our three countries will be holding a meeting in Freetown capital of Sierra Leone early next week At the highest political level I talked to President Koroma of Sierra Leone and President Conde of Guinea regularly just to see how theyre doing how were doing So thats the best thing we can do Were talking about maybe common facilities on borders so that we have treatment centers that will be close to the borders And if there are sick people on that side  and we have extra beds  then our service can be provided to them Those are some of the collaborative arrangements that will help us work together toward common progress We were facing an unknown enemy In the war you know where the gun is you know where the soldier is you know where the rebel is With this one you just didnt know In the beginning I had sleepless nights because I was as fearful as anybody else I did not stop going around talking to people I did not stop coming to work But I had sleepless nights Now We are making progress were committed to resolving this problem So I do not have sleepless nights anymore I sleep I am very pleased to go to bed and to sleep throughout the night get up the next morning and face the problem again and go to work at it
