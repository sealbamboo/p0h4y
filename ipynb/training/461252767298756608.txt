Pregnant women have heard it time and time again What you eat during those nine months can have longterm effects on your childs health Heck one study even   that when pregnant women eat a diverse diet the resulting babies are less picky in the foods they choose So what about moms eating habits before she even knows shes pregnant Nutritional deficiencies right at the time of conception can alter a babys genes permanently scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine   Tuesday The study published in   is the first to show that an environmental factor during the first few days of development can change DNA long term The researchers didnt look at how these genetic changes affect overall fetal development or the babys health later in life And they analyzed only six genes But theres growing   from other studies that similar types of genetic changes may help determine a childs risk for some diseases including diabetes mental disorders and autism Can diet affect other genes Whats the biological impact of those DNA modifications At the moment we dont know the answer to those questions says nutritionist   who contributed to the study But subsequent research we have  and havent yet published  says it does matter Now were not talking about altering the DNA code itself  you know the building blocks of genes the   Rather Prentice says the dietary effects he and his team have found seem to be changing whether genes are turned on or off in that earliest stage of embryonic development This onandoff switch is controlled by decorating the DNA with a special tag called   How much the six genes got tagged in the developing embryo depended on the levels of a few micronutrients in the moms blood at the time of conception Prentice and his team found The team examined several B vitamins and nutrients associated with them They couldnt pinpoint exactly which ones were most important But in general when several of these nutrients including vitamin B were at lower levels in moms blood the six genes had less methylation The vitamin levels in all the women werent way out of the normal range either Prentice says If you took the blood to your doctor he would say they were normal The team also found a link between the DNA methylation and moms body mass index at the time of conception The heavier the mother the less methylation And again none of the moms were obese There were no overweight women in this group Prentice says Even then we found a strong link between the mothers BMI and methylation patterns For years scientists have observed a similar phenomenon in mice Diet and weight at the time of conception alter a babys DNA methylation To check for the effect in people Prentice and his team turned to women in   Families there rely on their gardens for most of their food he says so the weather patterns completely change the foods eaten throughout the year In the rainy season residents get fewer calories but more nutrientrich vegetables In the dry season they have more calories but dishes are less vitaminpacked I think the study is great says Duke Universitys   who wasnt involved in the work Weve hypothesized that this time right around conception is a critical period Its pretty exciting to see it Although the team only looked at six genes Murphy says she thinks the effect shown in these stretches of DNA could reflect whats happening throughout the genome They could be the canary in the coal mine she says
