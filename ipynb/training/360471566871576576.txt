A womans cancer risk appears to increase with her height a new study shows An analysis of  postmenopausal women showed that the taller a woman is the greater her risk for a number of cancers including breast colon and skin cancer among others   published in Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers  Prevention is not expected to change screening recommendations and shouldnt alarm those with a tall stature Instead say scientists the association between height and cancer may help guide researchers to study hormones and growth factors that influence height and may also play a role in cancer We know that cancer is a disease in which hormones and growth factors modify things said Geoffrey C Kabat a senior epidemiologist in the department of epidemiology and population health at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University in New York Height itself is not a risk factor but it really appears to be a marker for one or more exposures that influence cancer risk Nobody really knows why cancer risk is associated with a taller stature It may have to do with hormones and growth factors that spur both height and cancer cells It may be that height simply increases the surface area of the bodys organs resulting in a greater number of overall cells and higher subsequent risk of malignancy While the current study focused only on women other research has also found an association between height and cancer among men    found that taller men were at slightly higher risk for aggressive prostate cancer In May the Journal of the National Cancer Institute reported that height differences between men and women may help explain why men have an overall greater risk of developing cancer in nonsex specific organs like kidneys and lungs    showed that sex differences in height may explain a third to a half of a mans excess cancer risk compared to women Height can be influenced by a number of factors beyond genetics The amount and type of foods consumed in childhood can influence height and childhood nutrition may also play some role in cancer risk A higher circulating level of a protein called insulinlike growth factor which can be influenced by factors like exercise stress body mass index and nutrition is also associated with both increased height and an increased cancer risk The data for the latest analysis were collected from the Womens Health Initiative the largestever study of postmenopausal women The researchers identified  women who had received a cancer diagnosis during the year study period The data set included not only the womans height but also her age weight education smoking habits alcohol consumption and whether she used hormone therapy This allowed the scientists to control for other factors that could influence cancer risk and more closely determine the strength of the association with height They found that for every inch change in height there was a  percent increase in risk for developing any type of cancer The cancers most strongly associated with height were cancers of the kidney rectum thyroid and blood Risk for those cancers increased by  to  percent for every inch increase in height
