
 Im scheduling your orchiectomy in two days my oncologist told me only minutes after handing me a diagnosis of testicular cancer With that he added a new word to my vocabulary Orchiectomy Excision of one or both testicles Castration  That was  years ago this spring Although I was a total cancer knownothing at the time this was more than a decade before Lance Armstrong became the symbol of testicular cancer I quickly became an expert on the topic  Those were preGoogle days so searching for information meant taking off on foot In this case to the medical library of the University of California San Francisco where helpful librarians handed me a stack of photocopied studies and stats  I discovered that testicular cancer was an uncommon malignancy but its sweet spot was young men  to  Check that applied to me In fact there was a whole list of traits that would put a young man like me at risk Caucasian higher economic status a history of mumps trauma such as horseback riding or bicycling Check check check check Never mind that there was a whole list of others that would seem to exclude me Danish background undescended testicle Down syndrome hermaphroditism exposure to Agent Orange or solvents used to clean jet engines    What did these piles of information add up to Not much frankly except that I understood for the first time what Einstein meant when he wrote Information is not knowledge With the orchiectomy now in my rearview mirror I quickly fell down the rabbit hole of confusion trying to understand Why me a single sad and pathetic question that filled my diary entry over and over again on one particularly bad day It didnt make sense there was no logic  Finding no answers in my stacks of studies I moved on from the why to the me From there it was a hop skip and jump to Its my fault  I already knew that people with cancer were routinely blamed for their disease How many times had I heard someone with lung cancer asked as if holding a smoking gun Did you smoke How many times had I thought the same thing I must have done something to bring this on myself Amid this confusion my  therapist at the time  lets call him Dr S  handed me a book Getting Well Again A StepbyStep SelfHelp Guide to Overcoming Cancer for Patients and Their Families already a best seller and still among the top  sellers in the cancer category on Amazon For weeks on end Dr S had been telling me that I internalized blame rarely expressed anger and was too much of a people pleaser All true by the way With that book in hand now I could focus on the typical cancer personality and how my reactions to stress and other emotional factors can contribute to the onset and progress of cancer   The newagey silver lining since the authors didnt really want us to slit our wrists thinking we were the cause of our own plight was this If you change your behavior you can reduce your chances of developing cancer For those of us poor souls who were already ill we could improve our prognosis  Convinced I had brought this cancer on myself the floodgates of memory and selfblame poured out My perceived failings ranged from fairly minor to very major   At  I donned a British accent and conned a neighboring widow into thinking I was an orphan whose parents both mmmusicians I stammered and siblings  I mmiss them so mmuch had all died in a horrid car accident When my mom found out she marched herself over to our neighbors to introduce herself at my expense  I was gay Remember this was the s not long after homosexuality was declassified as a mental health disorder and homophobia almost always internalized    I had been molested as a child with that very testicle a focal point Ah there it was the root of my years of selfblame Like many young victims I faulted myself for the assault Deep inside I was still that child who believed hed done something terribly wrong Was this why I got cancer Then in the midst of my chemo I started a correspondence with a family friend Marion who herself was battling a lifethreatening cancer At first her advice proved both predictable and prescriptive Get them to give you Compazine or Tigan for nausea during chemo Dont wait till you feel nauseated Smoke pot   I wrote her that I felt I had brought this on myself Within the week Marions next letter arrived Youre not to blame Dont let it take hold of you She added  Its often very wise for us not to try to understand but just to move beyond I guess I was ready to hear it her advice sunk in Soon after I wrote a letter to my grandmother explaining what I had learned  Finally I let go of Why me and came to terms with the double truth that no answer exists and its the wrong damn question anyway Fixating on it had prevented me from moving forward to the next question in my recovery What now And with that question I could now embrace my future  and let go of the past Steven Petrow lives in Hillsborough NC and is the author of   Workman  Follow him on Twitter    and on
