Dating isnt easy and its even less so when youve got Aspergers an autism spectrum disorder that can make it hard to read social cues Jesse Saperstein knows that all too well In his new book   the yearold tells his fellows on the spectrum that they need to be up front with potential dates that they have Aspergers And he says they also need to realize that what feels to them like sincere interest can all too often be perceived as creepiness This is an edited version of our conversation I believe my peers and I we achieve great things by being unrelenting We dont know when to stop We can go after things for years But that relentlessness does not work with humans and human emotions In adulthood that translates to fullblown stalking Sometimes there are legal consequences that could be avoided when the intent is harmless You have no idea I have definitely been accused of that many times In college I would try to win people over by giving them long handwritten cards I continued this into adulthood but it wasnt considered cute It was considered disturbing Now I tell you I have Aspergers and this is how I communicate If this bothers you you just need to tell me so Ill do better in the future Ninetynine percent of the time that works I sure dont want to miss the people who would love a handwritten card The purpose of my book is to help people shave off experiences that cause damage So theyll know from my experiences that if you call someone  times in a week it may work in the movies but it most likely leads to disaster in reality It was hard for someone who is not able to let go easily Online dating is all about letting go and a lot of hidden signals You can let go and definitely not get what you want but avoid a lot of consequences One of the golden rules is not to invest a lot of money the first or second time you meet someone I used to think that if I spent a lot of money on a Broadway show or a fourstar restaurant it might not make a woman fall in love with me but it sure would help That is erroneous I think that is one of the things that contributed to my  credit card debt I kind of did it to myself but at the time it did seem like a really good idea With dating it does not matter how cruel or sudden the rejection is when someone demands to be let alone you have to respect that Ill tell people contact this person only once a year and see what happens That may not be appropriate but its a lot better than being relentless Im seeing a woman right now whos a few year younger than me Its hard due to our very hectic schedules shes still going to school What helps is her bringing issues to my attention instead of sitting on them so I can work through them Success with autism or any kind of challenge comes from knowing you have incredible things to offer Mistakes dont mean youre a loser
