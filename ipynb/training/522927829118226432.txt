The first diagnosis of an Ebola patient in the U.S. prompted a declarative message from top government health officials seeking to calm a nervous public.. “We’re stopping this in its tracks in this country,” said Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at a Sept. 30 press briefing. Dr. Frieden, the public face of the government’s response, subsequently said the U.S. would halt Ebola “in its tracks” at least six times.
