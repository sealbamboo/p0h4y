It used to be common for drugmakers to ply medical students with meals and gifts as a way to curry favor with Americas next generation of doctors But times are changing To curb the influence of drug companies most US medical schools have now instituted policies that restrict or ban gifts altogether The policies appear to have a lasting effect A study   in   the   finds that policies restricting gifts may reduce how often doctors who were med students when the policies were in force prescribed newly marketed drugs The researchers found that physicians who attended US medical schools with policies restricting gifts were less likely to prescribe two brandname drugs    for ADHD and   an antipsychotic  than older cheaper and similarly effective alternatives There was no apparent difference in prescriptions for   an antidepressant These results suggest though they dont prove that policies restricting gifts to med students can affect what they prescribe when they become doctors Thats a good thing according to   associate professor of medicine at Yale University and coauthor of the study Ross says that giftgiving creates a relationship between physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers that leads to unnecessary prescribing of newer pricier  but not necessarily more effective drugs The pharmaceutical industry whose real interest is in promotion and marketing their products should have no role in the education of physicians  Theres just no reason for it he says Ross has company In  the American Medical Student Association released its first annual   which evaluates US medical schools on how they regulate medical students exposure to the pharmaceutical industry These scorecards have created competition among schools to do better resulting in more schools adopting policies restricting gifts Some new drugs have significant advantages over older ones These innovative drugs probably wouldnt be hurt by a cutback in physiciantargeted marketing Ross says When a new drug comes to the market and it really makes a difference people are going to be eager to use it he says Are there appropriate ways for physicians and drug companies to work together According to Ross there are but they mostly have to do with research
