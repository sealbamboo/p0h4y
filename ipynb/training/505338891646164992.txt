Six years after California instituted a statewide effort to pare fat and boost fitness in its schoolchildren the kids havent reversed the trend of growing obesity in their ranks But they are fitter and as a group have slowed the growth of obesity according to a new study The first comprehensive   of a pioneering statewide campaign to fight child obesity found that between  and  the rate of obesity among children in grades five seven and nine grew by  That may seem nothing to crow about but it is a far slower rate of growth than has prevailed in recent decades when obesity among children was growing by between  and  per year At the same time California schoolchildrens fitness levels showed small but steady gains Researchers at UC Davis reviewed the results of fifth seventh and ninthgraders    assessments of each students performance on tests measuring body composition abdominal strength trunk extensor strength aerobic capacity upper body strength and flexibility In all  of California schoolchildren were overweight or obese in   overweight and  obese Thats up from  in   overweight and  obese While body composition assessed by measuring skinfolds with calipers by the standard   and by a handheld device called a   did drift upward in all grade groups despite a decline in fatness among Asian and nonLatino white kids and among girls in general But while abdominal strength also suffered a small decline every other area of fitness saw improvements in students overall ratings The number of kids who achieved a perfect fitness score  meeting fitness standards in all six categories  went from  in  to  in  The slowdown in obesity rates and the improvements in physical fitness might be an early sign of a turning point in childhood obesity wrote the authors of the study published in this months American Heart Journal a publication of the  The study is one of the latest to suggest  that growing awareness and a raft of public policy changes is curbing the epidemic of obesity  or at least preventing a new generation of Americans from carrying it forward The authors were particularly pumped about improvements in childrens aerobic capacity which they said strongly suggests that kids stepped up their levels of physical activity in the sixyear period That may be the result of burgeoning public health campaigns encouraging kids to exercise including First Lady Michelle Obamas Lets Move campaign But some credit no doubt is due to the states requirements starting in  that all public schools provide over each day period  minutes of physical education to all kids in grades Ktofive and  minutes to all kids in grades sixto The best way to stop and eventually reduce childhood obesity has yet to be discovered the authors wrote But their study did identify several age and ethnic groups whose problematic patterns of consumption and sedentary behavior may need stronger medicine to change Poorer fitness and body composition scores were consistently seen in counties with lower incomes and higher levels of unemployment African Americans and Latinos had less lean body composition score than Asian and nonLatino white kids and lagged behind those groups in measures of abdominal strength and trunk extensor strength basically the ability to lift the upper torso off the floor And in this California sample growth in obesity rates seemed to be greatest among younger kids between kindergarten and fifth grade Despite improvements in school nutrition and fitness levels children who were obese in the fifth grade tended to remain obese in subsequent years said lead author   of UC Davis School of Medicine And we suspect this trend begins before kindergarten he added That suggests that targeting kids as soon as they arrive at school might be the best way to drive down future obesity levels and build fitness We will need to consider new interventions for the Kthroughfive students the authors declared
