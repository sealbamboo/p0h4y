hereas  of all NHS staff identify as nonwhite only  on higher grades do so The proportion is lower still in very senior management and at board level Around  of   nurses but only  of nursing directors are from black or minority ethnic BME backgrounds Last year my company Public World published   which drew upon data from  NHS trusts showing that in all but one of them over a month period the percentage of BME appointments was lower than the percentage shortlisted which in turn was lower than the percentage of BME applicants Our statistical analysis was by no means comprehensive and we drew no specific conclusions about what might explain the numbers We merely noted that they reinforced other evidence suggesting the need for a renewed focus on race equality in the NHS From April  all but the smallest employers of the  million NHS workforce will be required in the words of NHS England to demonstrate progress against a number of indicators of workforce equality The new   first proposed by NHS Englands equality and diversity council in July and mandated in October will take the form of nine indicators announced on the NHS England website on  December It is a response to evidence that BME people are underrepresented in the services leadership overrepresented in disciplinary hearings and negative staff survey indicators and disadvantaged in selection processes However I must confess to some anxiety about the potential effect of the WRES which will be written into the standard NHS contract for  and form part of the inspection regime from the following year There are three reasons for my concern  Recent NHS history is littered with examples of unforeseen consequences of wellintentioned centrally imposed and punitively enforced targets Command and control has its place in emergencies but a poor track record in shaping NHS culture  The WRES indicators have been designed without deep engagement within NHS organisations According to NHS England key stakeholders have been consulted but there was only a twoweek period for feedback with a Christmas Eve deadline  I wonder about some of the metrics including the one that appears to have been influenced by the analysis in our own report Employers will be required progressively to close the gap between the relative likelihood of BME staff being recruited from shortlisting compared to that of white staff being recruited from shortlisting across all posts Without digging into the reasons for that gap  which may or may not be intrinsic to the NHS  isnt there a danger of treating the symptoms rather than the causes Against that NHS England emphasises that the WRES is only the first stage in a process of addressing workforce equality issues These negatively affect not only staff but also patients as   has suggested Moreover I have heard passionate support for the WRES in recent months from a wide range of NHS leaders black and white who make a compelling case that the NHS must be made to finally tackle deep injustices that it has failed to tackle voluntarily So I raise my concerns in a humble spirit of support for the aims of the WRES and hope that NHS trusts will welcome it as an opportunity to engage in the difficult internal conversations we suggested when we published Discrimination by Appointment Public Worlds work on staff involvement to enable sustained cultural change shows that shared vision and common purpose come only through carefully facilitated exploration and acceptance of difference This time ticking boxes simply wont work and open dialogue is essential
