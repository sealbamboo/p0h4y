More than  people may have been exposed to airborne anthrax bacteria in an embarrassing mishap at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the numbers may go even higher officials said Friday Right now we have an excess of  individuals CDC deputy director Dr Ileana Arias told NBC News We expect that number may even grow  because were trying to make that available to as many people as possible in order to make sure there are no adverse consequences to health of any of our employees as a result of what happened Its not the first time the CDC has been tricked by   and the agency is going all out to make sure that this time no one gets sick The last time   five people died including two postal workers infected after anthrax spores puffed out of anthraxfilled letters as they were processed CDC officials said late Friday that theyve ceded control of the investigation into the safety breach to the US Department of Agriculture to avoid any potential conflict of interest In normal circumstances the CDCs Division of Select Agents and Toxins DSAT would handle the probe Instead the USDAs Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service APHIS which is also part of the Select Agent Program will look into the matter The CDCs Dr Paul Meechan told Reuters that the agencys Bioterror Rapid Response units had been preparing an especially dangerous strain of the bacteria for use in two lowersecurity CDC labs They thought the bacteria had been inactivated making it safe to handle But a week later workers noticed a lab dish containing live growing anthrax and they realized they had sent similar samples to labs that were not taking the precautions needed to protect people against infection CDC has had problems with laboratory procedures before Arias said We have had incidents before where somebody may have cut corners or things may have happened she said In each of those situations we were  we did very rigorous investigations and reviews of exactly what happened what needed to be done implemented those fixes and have not had subsequent problems as a result Experts doubt the CDC workers are in any danger I dont think any of these individuals will get infected said Dr Amesh Adalja of the UPMC Center for Health Security which specializes in studying such threats Theyre going to be taking the vaccine as well as antibiotics Anthrax is a common infection that kills a wide range of animals and people It can infect the skin the gastrointestinal tract when swallowed or if inhaled it can cause a lung infection This last type is the worst because the bacteria release spores that can lurk in the body for  days or more before they are activated Then they release a toxin that can kill If a person develops serious symptoms of inhaled anthrax infection its too late to treat them because its the poison not the bacteria itself causing the symptoms No one knew precisely how deadly anthrax can be until  when someone sent powdered anthrax spores through the mail to various media outlets including NBC News and members of Congress In all  people got sick and five died And  people were given antibiotics to prevent infection CDC officials debated whether to close post offices in  after the first cases of anthrax were seen and decided not to Some officials said afterwards they regretted that decision The FBI said  a civilian scientist at the US Armys biohazard lab in Maryland was the culprit Ivins committed suicide before he could be arrested For weeks months and in some cases years offices in Washington DC and across the country changed their procedures for handling mail Two of those killed were workers at a Washington postal facility that handled some of the contaminated envelopes  officials figured out too late that the deadly spores could leak out of the sealed envelopes as they passed through machinery Theyre so fine they often can float in the air almost endlessly never even settling on surfaces This is why the CDC is taking the latest incident so seriously and taking decontamination procedures to the limit The CDC says at least  workers at three labs have been identified in the current investigation Spokesman Tom Skinner says  have been seen and offered antibiotics  are taking them and two have refused The antibiotics ciprofloxacin and doxycycline can treat or prevent an anthrax infection But when the risk is inhaled anthrax  as in this case  people must take the drugs for weeks to be safe Skinner says  workers have started the fiveshot series of anthrax vaccines and another  have refused We are looking into why this happened Until we better understand that we wont know what needs to be done different Skinner said Incidents like this cant and shouldnt happen Were taking full responsibility here to make sure it does not happen again Employee safety is priority one and when this was discovered we moved swiftly to identify those who were potentially exposed to make sure they were properly cared for Anthrax remains No  on the list of potential terrorist agents because it is deadly when breathed in relatively easy to make into a powder and compared to other agents fairly simple to obtain It is a category A agent says Adalja Its tried and true and its easy to disseminate And its mysterious No one knows how two of the  victims  a woman in New York and another in Connecticut  died Adalja said They assumed it was crosscontamination of envelopes he said But the questions are still not answered of how those people got it People have forgotten that there is still a lot of mystery there Adalja said
