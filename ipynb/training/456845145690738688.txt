The nations food poisoning problem hasnt gotten better since  a disappointing trend for health experts who had hoped to budge the more than  cases  hospitalizations and  deaths reported in the US each year Thats according to the latest report card on foodborne illness from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention It finds that overall food poisoning rates held steady Cases of salmonella dipped by  percent in  compared with  even as cases of campylobacter infections often linked to dairy foods and chicken jumped  percent Vibrio infections often linked to raw oysters climbed to the highest number ever To be six or seven years out and not seeing a lot of change means were no closer to those goals than when we started said Dr Rob Tauxe deputy director of the CDCs division responsible for foodborne waterborne and environmental diseases Thats a concern yes The CDC is measuring progress based on the agencys Healthy People  goals which set specific targets for reducing certain kinds of infection Its tracked by FoodNet a system that monitors laboratoryconfirmed infections caused by nine pathogens transmitted commonly through food in  US sites that cover  percent of the population There were  reports of salmonella infection  reports of campylobacter infection and  cases of vibrio poisoning  up from  in   among others logged by the system However those reports are only a fraction of the actual cases of food poisoning that occur In many cases the estimated figure is many times higher For every case of salmonella and campylobacter reported for instance there are  actual cases according to CDC data For vibrio cases there are nearly two for every one reported The improvement in salmonella incidence was a win with cases falling to levels last observed at the  baseline They had jumped in the interim probably because of a large outbreak of nearly  illnesses linked to shell eggs in  Since then the Food and Drug Administration has put in place new regulations for shell eggs which Tauxe said may have driven down the new salmonella infections The vibrio infections though low in actual number are a puzzle Many infections occur after contact with seawater but about half are transmitted through food mostly oysters But the jump may be caused by a strain of vibrio previously seen only in the Northwest now detected on the Atlantic Coast and the fact that climate change may be causing waters to become warmer which increases risk of infection experts said
