An international dream team of flu experts assembled in China today Underscoring the urgency that public health agencies feel about the emergence of a new kind of bird flu the team is headed by Dr   the World Health Organizations top influenza scientist Before he left Geneva Fukuda explained the wideopen nature of the investigation in an interview with NPR The biggest question is just whats going to happen he told Shots Weve had a lot of experience in the last decade with new animal influenza viruses But  we havent seen this combination before So I think right now anything is possible Anything encompasses a wide range of possibilities This   as its called could follow the model set so far by   It infected  people in Hong Kong in  disappeared after being   among the colonys poultry then   in  Over the past decade HN has caused sporadic limited infections among humans in Asia and the Middle East affecting almost  people killing  percent of them Most troubling HN could become fully adapted to humans and touch off a global pandemic The flu experts who arrived in China yesterday and today and their Chinese counterparts are confronted with an urgent set of unknowns Where is the virus Fukuda wonders Where is it keeping itself How are people getting exposed to it How are they getting infected by it Those are some of the really basic questions that were asking Worry has increased recently The virus has been found in two children in Beijing  a   who is recovering and a   who lived across the street He is the first person known to be infected without showing flu symptoms Other cases have recently emerged in Henan province south of Beijing Both are hundreds of miles from Shanghai where HN first appeared last month And theyre far removed from other outbreaks The first thing this tells us Fukuda says is that however people are getting infected  whatever theyre getting exposed to  its not just in one location but its spread out Another mystery is what animal species are serving as the source of the virus Its presumed to be poultry but Chinese authorities and WHO officials say a significant proportion of HN victims have had no known contact with poultry So far testing of nearly  animals  nearly all birds  has found the virus in only  There are very few positives for HN says Dr   the chief veterinary officer of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization based in Rome I would have expected maybe more hits in the poultry sector Lubroth tells Shots that Chinese agricultural investigators took samples from bird markets poultry slaughterhouses poultry farms wild bird habitats and bird environments They also looked at pig slaughterhouses but found no evidence of infection Thats good because   The mingled viruses can swap genes giving rise to new viruses that can spread among people But the search for the animal sources of HN is really only beginning Until last week Lubroth says animal tests for it werent very reliable Theres a good test but the Chinese havent had time to distribute it very widely They have more samples than they have results he says Fortythousand samples currently await analysis The basic problem is that HN viruses are tiny needles in a gargantuan haystack Theres no way to test every last chicken duck or pigeon in the five provinces and two enormous cities where cases have been found The surveillance has to be very targeted Lubroth says and because we dont have a lot of information that target is quite dark The usual tactic in this kind of situation is called traceback That is start with the poultry markets where people who got the virus shopped or worked then trace the source of the poultry back to the farms where they came from But Lubroth says many poultrysellers dont keep good records And asking them where they got their chickens often leads to dead ends They can shrug They can say theres a middleman Lubroth says and then you go to the middleman and hes not there anymore Meanwhile as the hunt is on for the viruss origins scientists are just beginning to study it up close Dr   and his colleagues at Erasmus University in Rotterdam just got samples Thursday He says his first priority is to develop a quick and reliable diagnostic test We want to be sure we can diagnose patients when they come from infected areas he tells NPR But Osterhaus and Erasmus researcher   also want to figure out what genetic changes HN would need to enable to spread easily among people To do this they want to do socalled   experiments splicing in genetic segments to see if they confer transmissibility When they did similar experiments with HN last year critics said it was   because a virus with pandemic potential might escape from the lab But Osterhaus says the current situation with HN flu shows exactly why these experiments are important We need to understand what makes these viruses transmissible Osterhaus tells Shots I think thats quite important in estimating the risk in the future of these viruses that pop out in people But Osterhaus says they wont do those experiments without a lot of consultation with fellow researchers around the world
