The number of young adults taking drugs for ADHD has soared in five years particularly among young women whose use of the drugs is up  percent according to a new report The   from prescription provider Express Scripts finds a large overall increase in the number of Americans treated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder a  percent rise in just five years More than  million people covered by private health insurance insurance have filled at least one prescription for ADHD the report finds The rapid increase in adult use of these medications is striking especially since there is very little research on how these treatments affect an older population said Express Scripts Dr David Muzina It signals a need to look more closely at how and why physicians prescribe these medications for adults particularly women who may turn to these medications or experience symptoms of attention disorders as a result of keeping up with the multiple demands on their time The findings dont surprise Stephen Hinshaw a professor of psychology at the University of California Berkeley who has studied ADHD in girls and young women These are women who need help Hinshaw told NBC News It may partly reflect the rise in diagnoses among children ADHD drugs are mostly prescribed to children and their use was up nearly  percent but adult use rose even faster up more than  percent the report said According to the American Psychiatric Association  percent of US children have ADHD But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that  percent and more of kids have been diagnosed with ADHD up from  percent in  Other reports show diagnoses have   in a decade Boys are more likely to be diagnosed   percent compared to  percent of girls And as kids get diagnosed   many of whom didnt recognize the symptoms until they spoke with a specialist about their children Since females tend to present the inattentive form of ADHD and do not display disruptive behavior in school their symptoms may be overlooked in childhood As they age they may become more aware of their symptoms and consult their physician the Express Scripts report notes Just under a third of people who had ADHD as children never grew out of it William Barbaresi and colleagues at Boston Childrens Hospital   The Express Scripts study only covers people with private insurance but thats more than half the US population Their team looked at pharmacy claims of  people Among adults women far outnumber men in their use of ADHD treatments the reverse of childhood trends where only half as many girls as boys take ADHD medications the report finds The number of males using ADHD drugs plummets after age  while women ages  to  surpass younger girls use of these medications  percent vs  percent respectively in  Hinshaw said the rise in diagnoses for women may reflect a lag in recognizing the problem We found that by their early s girls with ADHD were suffering academically just like boys with ADHD They were having difficult relationships just like boys with ADHD he said But the girls were not acting out Instead they were turning their distress inwards cutting themselves thinking about suicide and even attempting it This rise in diagnoses would be helpful if it eliminated this selfinjurious behavior said Hinshaw who has cowritten a new book The ADHD Explosion ADHD is a very broad diagnosis and covers symptoms from an inability to concentrate and focus to extreme hyperactivity and a lack of ability to control impulses Its not clear what the causes are although theres a clear genetic link Research does not support the popularly held views that ADHD is caused by eating too much sugar watching too much television parenting or social and environmental factors such as poverty or family chaos the CDC advises Of course many things including these might make symptoms worse especially in certain people But the evidence is not strong enough to conclude that they are the main causes of ADHD Many experts say its the availability of treatments that has caused the rise in diagnoses Theres no point getting a condition diagnosed if there isnt anything you can do about it Now several drugs can be prescribed especially stimulants such as Ritalin also known as methylphenidate Concerta and Strattera CDC says up to  percent of kids are helped by the medications Behavioral approaches can also help And children diagnosed with ADHD can access special services in schools another possible incentive to get a diagnosis and a prescription
