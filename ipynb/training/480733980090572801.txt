Barbershops are a traditional gathering place for AfricanAmerican men  a place to talk politics sports and gossip Now some doctors in Los Angeles are hoping to make the barbershop a place for combating high blood pressure among black men Death rates from hypertension are three times higher in AfricanAmerican men than in white men of the same age says Dr Ronald Victor the director of CedarsSinai Center for Hypertension in Los Angeles Hypertension is one of the biggest reasons why the life expectancy of AfricanAmerican men is only  years Victor says Thats a full decade less than white men in this country This week he received an  million grant from the National Institutes of Health to fund a study testing whether barbershop intervention could significantly lessen hypertension in AfricanAmerican men The study will involve getting barbers around the city trained to take their patients blood pressure Victor is working with Dr Anthony Reid a cardiologist in nearby Inglewood on the project Reid says most of his patients are AfricanAmerican My patients like me but they love the barber and theyd much rather go to see the barber than the doctor typically Reid says The idea is instead of starting out by asking patients as usual to come in to the hallowed halls of medicine were bringing medicine to the people who need it Victor says A few years ago Victor had success with a similar project in Dallas  albeit on a much smaller scale One of the barbers he worked with then James Smith has been shaping up lining up and fading mens hair in Dallas for  years He says his customers are like family Im always the one asking about Hows your wife hows your children hows your mom  Smith says So it was easy for me to do that and say Well look brother hows your blood pressure Hows your health  Smith says of all the men he asked to check only two said no We still do it Smith says We have the machine there and now everybodys conscious of it Some of them will come in and be like Hey man take my blood pressure check my blood pressure You know theyll come in and ask you to check it you dont have to check it for them Victor and Reid say theyll work with about twodozen barbershops in LA and will track atrisk patients for at least  months They have partnerships with lowcost health clinics and Reid says hell see patients who may not have insurance or who are cashstrapped The ultimate cost is lessened if we treat your hypertension now as opposed to your kidney disease and hemodialysis and your stroke and your heart attack downstream Reid says If the Los Angeles study goes well the doctors say they hope to scale this up and enlist barbers across the country to help fight hypertension
