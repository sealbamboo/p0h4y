This is the sixth week of the trial of Dr Kermit Gosnell the physician charged with   in the deaths of a woman and infants at the Philadelphia abortion clinic he owned and operated The case and its grisly details have prompted considerable debate about a variety of issues including whether the media   it sufficiently But it has also laid bare some of the very issues at the heart of the stillsimmering debate over abortion  years after the Supreme Court made it legal Most directly it raises the question of whether increasing regulation on abortion clinics make places like Gosnells clinic more or less likely to exist One thing those on both sides of the abortion debate agree on is that what happened at the Womens Medical Society in West Philadelphia was unforgivable Its such a horrific case says Charmaine Yoest president and CEO of the antiabortion group   You see both the horrific destruction of innocent human life with the babies but it also helps to illustrate our concern over how women are being treated in abortion clinics  as terrible commodities to increase the bottom line  a sociology professor at the University of California San Francisco who has studied reproductive health issues since the s doesnt dispute that Gosnell was doing terrible things in his clinic and putting patients at risk What Gosnell was doing was completely against the law Joffe says and had there been any inspections he would have been shut down a long time ago But where the two sides disagree its in the strongest of terms Abortion opponents like Yoest for example say Gosnell is hardly the outlier those in the abortionprovider community say he is This is a very dramatic case compared to what happens in some other clinics she says But in all honesty it doesnt completely surprise us because weve been trying to get attention to lowgrade conditions in abortion clinics across the country for many many years That kind of rhetoric makes Joffe and her allies furious Those opposed to abortion are trying to make the argument that all abortion providers are like Gosnell she says which of course is absurd Joffe says a key reason Gosnell had patients in the first place is because the government   for abortions for poor women Even with its reputation for substandard care Gosnells clinic was all many poor women could afford His prices were way under other prices in the area Joffe says citing the   in the case So for example he charged  for a firsttrimester procedure the prevailing rate at that time was approx  And for lowincome women says Joffe by the time they could come up with enough money for an abortion often they were so far along in their pregnancy they either needed a more expensive secondtrimester procedure or else they were beyond the legal limit And this leaves them vulnerable to places like Dr Gosnells clinic she says where he was allegedly performing the procedure beyond the time in pregnancy allowed by law For abortion opponents the Gosnell case shows the need for more and stricter regulation The fact that we regulate veterinary clinics and beauty parlors more than you do abortion clinics in this country thats inexcusable says Yoest And what it leads to is this kind of situation with Gosnell But abortion rights backers say the increasing restrictions end up giving women fewer choices other than substandard facilities like Gosnells Joffe says a   passed in the wake of the Gosnell revelations has resulted in many abortion clinics that were providing perfectly safe care having to shut their doors Pennsylvania used to have  facilities now they have  she says The city of Pittsburgh used to have four clinics now theyre down to two There is one area where the two sides sort of agree Its how politicized the issue has become The politics of abortion are hurting women who need access to safe and affordable abortions and cant get them says Joffe Real women in the real world are suffering as this health care procedure becomes so incredibly politicized Yoest meanwhile says the power of what she calls Big Abortion is preventing common sense regulations You create a political environment where politicians are unwilling to come anywhere near abortion clinics and thats untenable Yoest says The trial of Gosnell meanwhile will go to jury deliberation next week The defense ended abruptly Wednesday when the doctor chose not to testify and his lawyer presented no witnesses
