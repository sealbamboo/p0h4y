An old complaint about the safety of childhood vaccines is finding new life at the United Nations The UN Environment Program is considering a ban on thimerosal a vaccine preservative that is widely used in developing countries The program expects to make a decision sometime after a final meeting on the issue in January Thimerosal which contains a form of mercury was removed from most childhood vaccines in the US and Europe more than a decade ago amid public fear that it could cause autism Several large studies later found   from the preservative and that removing it did   Now the proposal before the UN has public health officials once again trying to reassure people that   Three separate papers in the journal  argue against an international ban This is critical says   of the Emory Vaccine Center at Emory University and an author of   Lives potentially would be lost if we banned thimerosal from vaccines Thimerosal keeps vaccines from going bad in parts of the world where other options such as refrigeration or singledose vials arent practical The proposed ban is part of a larger effort to reduce exposure to mercury which can affect brain development And public health experts strongly support most aspects of that effort Orenstein says But when it comes to thimerosal in vaccines the benefits far outweigh any risks he says adding that a ban could mean the return of diseases that used to kill millions of children each year in developing countries Pertussis or whooping cough could really resurge in these areas Orenstein says But Orenstein and other experts werent always so certain about thimerosal In  they asked vaccine makers in the US to stop using the preservative in childhood vaccines At the time some parents of children with autism were alleging that the thimerosal in vaccines caused the disorder Also researchers realized that some children could be getting more mercury from vaccines than the Environmental Protection Agency deemed safe So Orenstein says he and others erred on the side of caution At the time we just didnt know what the toxic effects might be or might not be he says And one of our concerns was what if we did the studies and three years later found there was harm The studies showed   though And scientists also determined that the form of ethyl mercury in thimerosal is far less dangerous than methyl mercury the form found in seafood So the EPA exposure limits didnt really apply But groups opposed to thimerosal say theyre not convinced by the studies And they say its wrong to give the preservative to children in developing countries but not to children in the US and Europe The practice is egregious offensive and unacceptable says Eric Uram executive director of the USbased group   SafeMinds has played a prominent role in pushing for the international ban But so far countries that might be affected by it have been less vocal Uram says SafeMinds has contacted officials from countries including Nigeria and Uganda and found they are concerned But he says they are hesitant to speak up because the World Health Organization has deemed thimerosal safe They defer to WHO for guidance on health issues he says So it becomes inappropriate for them to say that the WHO is incorrect Uram also disagrees with public health officials who believe the ban would disrupt vaccination programs in developing countries The ban would be phased in he says giving countries time to find alternatives to thimerosal But right now there is no good alternative says   of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine In the US she says most childhood vaccines are packaged in singledose vials which dont need a preservative That drives up the cost of each dose and makes it more difficult to transport large amounts of vaccine she says Also Larson says there is no scientific reason to ban thimerosal from vaccines It would be bowing to public pressure she says
