A Cardiff hospital has been forced to apologise for flaws in the way it diagnosed miscarriages over many years It follows the case of a woman wrongly told she had miscarried nine weeks into her pregnancy after a scan at the University Hospital of Wales Emily Wheatley from Monmouth went on to have a healthy baby daughter Ella The Public Service Ombudsman for Wales believes flaws in UHWs practices may have gone back as far as  A helpline has been set up for patients Ms Wheatley was told during a dating scan she had suffered a silent miscarriage  where there are no symptoms She chose to undergo a uterine evacuation at Nevill Hall hospital in Abergavenny but staff there discovered she was nine weeks pregnant with a healthy foetus Ms Wheatley suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis meaning the chances of her conceiving naturally were very very slim To be told that Id miscarried was a real shock she said It took a lot to adjust to that after adjusting to the fact that I was pregnant in the first place After being told she was indeed still pregnant she said Even though the baby was there clearly on the screen I couldnt really believe it She said the hospital took away the enjoyment of pregnancy She added Its just unbelievable actually that there are potentially other women out there who have been diagnosed with having a silent miscarriage and they potentially have got rid of healthy babies That frightens me Maybe hundreds of babies have been lost because of their decision making which is unthinkable Peter Tyndall Public Service Ombudsman for Wales said it was an unacceptable mistake which should have been avoided and he has called a review of midwife sonographers competency He said staff after discovering a silent miscarriage should have used a different scan to give them a more accurate picture but failed to do so In a   he says the health board failed to implement guidelines issued by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists RCOG that were designed to prevent the misdiagnosis of early pregnancy loss  and had been using outdated guidance for two years or more Asked how many other people could have been affected he replied Youll have to ask the health board but clearly there will have been others The health board has set up a helpline for other women who think they may have been affected  Wed advise them if they are concerned to contact the helpline Mr Tyndall said he thinks Ms Wheatleys case is unusual and I dont think its typical but he said other women may have been similarly affected The ombudsman made a series of recommendations including that the health board issues a written apology and pays the woman  The helpline      was launched on Friday and will remain open from  to  daily until  GMT on  November Dr George Findlay Cardiff and Vale Health Board director for children and womens services said about  deliveries are performed each year and between  and  people have a miscarriage Were saying that about  women per year may have a miscarriage that leads to an intervention by us he said What I dont know right now is what type of scan or number of scans that these patients had and were happy to look at that on a case by case basis Dr Findlay added We let her down and we didnt provide a standard of care thats acceptable to me as a doctor or me as a manager Cardiff and Vale University Health Boards executive director of nursing Ruth Walker offered an unreserved apology to Ms Wheatley and said the said the board was genuinely sorry that it has taken an ombudsmans report for her to receive the answers she deserved  She said that correct procedures were now followed She added the helpline had received  calls throughout the day on Friday  We were able to immediately reassure eight of those patients regarding their care and will be speaking further with  other patients in the coming days  There were also  calls from patients outside the Cardiff and Vale area which we were able to redirect accordingly
