Kelley picked up the phone and called a familiar number What about the nice single man whod inquired before  would he be interested No the woman told her She hadnt heard from him in weeks Disappointed Kelley asked if there was anyone else who would hire her Shed had two miscarriages herself and wanted to help someone else with fertility problems In return shed get a  fee  Hold on the woman said let me see  Yes she said there was a couple who wanted to meet her Was she ready to take down their email address  Absolutely Kelley answered  Most surrogacies have happy endings and this one should have too  with a couple welcoming a new baby into their home and Kelley enjoying her fee plus the satisfaction that shed helped another family  Instead it ended with legal actions a secretive flight to another state and a frenzied rush to find parents for a fragile baby  After speaking with the surrogacy agency Kelley then  arranged to meet the couple at a playground near her home in Vernon Connecticut a suburb of Hartford When she arrived she liked what she saw The couple was caring and attentive with their three children who were sweet and wellmannered and played nicely with her own two daughters The couple desperately wanted a fourth child but the mother couldnt have any more babies Yes Kelley told them right then and there Yes I will have a child for you  CNN made several unsuccessful attempts to contact the couple by phone and email The couple had conceived their children through invitro fertilization and had two frozen embryos left over Doctors thawed them out and on October   put them in Kelleys uterus  About  days later a blood test showed she was pregnant  one of the embryos had taken  Kelley and the parents were thrilled and over the next few weeks the mother was attentive and caring When Kelley had morning sickness the mother called every day to see how she was feeling She gave Kelley and Kelleys daughters Christmas presents When Kelley couldnt make rent the mother made sure she got her monthly surrogate fee a few days early  She said I want you to come to us with anything because youre going to be part of our lives forever  Kelley remembers  Congratulations You made it half through the mother emailed Kelley on February   It was one of the last friendly emails between Kelley and the woman whod hired her  A few days later Kelley five months pregnant had a routine ultrasound to make sure the baby was developing properly The ultrasound technician struggled to see the babys tiny heart and asked her to come back the next week when the baby would be more developed  At that next ultrasound the technician said it was still hard to see the heart and asked Kelley to go to Hartford Hospital where they could do a higherlevel ultrasound  Apparently there was more to it than that  As Kelley was driving home her cell phone rang It was the babys mother She kept saying Theres something wrong with the baby Theres something wrong with the baby What are we going to do  Kelley remembers She was frantic She was panicking Then the midwife called She told Kelley the ultrasound showed the baby had a cleft lip and palate a cyst in her brain and serious heart defects They couldnt see a stomach or a spleen The next ultrasound was three days away and Kelley grew increasingly anxious with each passing day By the time she walked into Hartford Hospital on February   she was  weeks pregnant and absolutely terrified of what the ultrasound would show and what the parents reaction would be  With the parents standing behind her the ultrasound technician at the hospital put the wand on Kelleys stomach The test confirmed her worst fears It showed the baby did have a cleft lip and palate a cyst in the brain and a complex heart abnormality The doctors explained the baby would need several heart surgeries after she was born She would likely survive the pregnancy but had only about a  chance of having a normal life Kelley remembers the doctors saying In a letter to Kelleys midwife Dr Elisa Gianferrari a maternal fetal medicine specialist at Hartford Hospital and Leslie Ciarleglio a genetic counselor described what happened next Given the ultrasound findings the parents feel that the interventions required to manage the babys medical problems are overwhelming for an infant and that it is a more humane option to consider pregnancy termination they wrote Kelley disagreed Ms Kelley feels that all efforts should be made to give the baby a chance and seems adamantly opposed to termination they wrote  The letter describes how the parents tried to convince Kelley to change her mind Their three children were born prematurely and two of them had to spend months in the hospital and still had medical problems They wanted something better for this child  The parents feel strongly that they pursued surrogacy in order to minimize the risk of pain and suffering for their baby Gianferrari and Ciarleglio wrote They explained their feelings in detail to Ms Kelley in hopes of coming to an agreement The two sides were at a standoff The doctor and the genetic counselor offered an amniocentesis in the hope that by analyzing the babys genes they could learn more about her condition Kelley was amenable they noted but the parents feel that the information gained from this testing would not influence their decision to consider pregnancy termination The atmosphere in the room became very tense Kelley remembers The parents were brought into the geneticists office to give everyone some privacy After a while Kelley was reunited with the parents  They were both visibly upset The mother was crying she remembers They said they didnt want to bring a baby into the world only for that child to suffer  They said I should try to be Godlike and have mercy on the child and let her go  I told them that they had chosen me to carry and protect this child and that was exactly what I was going to do Kelley said I told them it wasnt their decision to play God Then she walked out of the room  I couldnt look at them anymore she said The next day according to medical records the mother called Hartford Hospital to ask about different types of abortion It was explained to her that they could induce birth the baby wouldnt survive or they could do a dilation and evacuation in which case the pregnancy would be vacuumed out of the womb The mother after asking about whether the fetus would feel any pain said she thought the second option was best She asked if the procedure had been scheduled No she was told Only Kelley could do that  The mother noted that the surrogacy agency was getting in touch with Kelley and a few days later Kelley received an email from Rita Kron at Surrogacy International telling her that if she chose to have the baby the couple wouldnt agree to be the babys legal parents  You will be the only person who will be making decision about the child should the child is born sic Kron wrote  CNN contacted Surrogacy International and a woman who said her name was Rita answered the phone  You have to understand something  there is a privacy that exists and thats the end of the story she said and then hung up Kron did not return CNNs emails  Kelley didnt want to be the babys mother  shed gotten pregnant to help another family not to have a child of her own Kron gave her an option the parents would pay her  to have an abortion  The offer tested Kelleys convictions Shed always been against abortion for religious and moral reasons but she really needed the money Just before getting pregnant shed lost her job as a nanny and the only income she had coming in was child support from her daughters father and her monthly surrogacy fee of  which was about to end because of the dispute with the parents Her resolve began to falter Then it nearly crumbled  Kron took Kelley to lunch  She painted a picture of a life of a person who had a child with special needs She told me how it would be painful it would be taxing it would be strenuous and stressful She told me it would financially drain me that my children would suffer because of it Kelley remembers  Kelley had a counter offer In a weak moment I asked her to tell them that for  I would consider going forward with the termination she said  But as soon as she got in the car to go home she regretted it Kelley said  Kron let Kelley know the parents had refused to pay  By that point it didnt matter to Kelley  shed decided against abortion no matter what Kron sent her an email asking if shed scheduled the appointment for the abortion Kelley wrote back a oneword answer no   On February   six days after the fateful ultrasound Kelley received a letter The parents had hired a lawyer  You are obligated to terminate this pregnancy immediately wrote Douglas Fishman an attorney in West Hartford Connecticut You have squandered precious time On March  Kelley would be  weeks pregnant and after that she couldnt legally abort the pregnancy he said  TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE he wrote  Fishman reminded Kelley that shed signed a contract agreeing to abortion in case of severe fetus abnormality The contract did not define what constituted such an abnormality  Kelley was in breach of contract he wrote and if she did not abort the parents would sue her to get back the fees theyd already paid her  around   plus all of the medical expenses and legal fees  Fishman declined to comment on the specifics of the case  The situation is complicated Its very complicated Fishman said Speaking generally he said everyone who enters into a surrogacy contact needs to be clear from the beginning about what they are willing and able to do When theres a lack of clarity then you start to have a recipe for problems he said You want to position yourself to not have to be addressing these kinds of issues for the first time when the crisis hits After receiving Fishmans letter Kelley decided it was time to get her own attorney  Michael DePrimo an attorney in Hamden Connecticut took the case for free He explained that no matter what the contract said she couldnt be forced to have an abortion DePrimo sent an email to Fishman the parents lawyer stating that Kelley was not going to have an abortion  Ms Kelley was more than willing to abort this fetus if the dollars were right Fishman shot back  The notsosubtle insinuation that Ms Kelley attempted to extort money from your clients is unfounded and reprehensible DePrimo responded If you wish to propose a solution to this unspeakable tragedy I will listen and apprize my client accordingly sic However as I mentioned in my previous correspondence abortion is off the table and will not be considered under any circumstance he said  In an affidavit filed in Connecticut Superior Court DePrimo described what happened next  DePrimo received a phone call from Fishman telling him the parents had changed their minds They now planned to exercise their legal right to take custody of their child  and then immediately after birth surrender her to the state of Connecticut She would become a ward of the state  DePrimo explained to Kelley that this was no empty threat Under state law they were the parents not her and under   parents can voluntarily give up custody of a baby less than a month old without being arrested for child abandonment  Kelley couldnt stand the thought of the baby in foster care Shed heard the nightmare stories  She felt like her back was up against the wall  Her lawyer explained she could go to court and fight to get custody of the baby or fight to appoint a guardian for the baby but Connecticut law is very clear that the genetic parents are the legal parents so shed likely lose in court  There was one more option DePrimo told her She could go to a place where she not the genetic parents would be considered the babys legal mother  That place was  miles away  Over the years states have developed different laws about surrogacy Some like Connecticut say the genetic parents  the ones who supplied the sperm and the egg  are the babys legal parents Other states dont recognize surrogacy contracts and so the baby legally belongs to the woman whos carrying the baby  On April  in her seventh month of pregnancy Kelley and her daughters left for one of those states  Michigan While she was gassing up her car to leave her lawyer informed the parents lawyer about her plans  Once I realized that I was going to be the only person really fighting for her that Mama bear instinct kicked in and there was no way I was giving up without a fight Kelley said  Kelley chose Michigan because of its laws but also its medicine shed been doing research on the babys condition and concluded CS Mott Childrens Hospital at the University of Michigan had one of the best pediatric heart programs in the country  When she arrived she found an inexpensive summer sublet from a University of Michigan student and applied for Michigan Medicaid She made appointments with a highrisk pregnancy specialist and a pediatric cardiologist and settled into life in Ann Arbor with her girls  There was one thing left to do She had to decide if she would keep the baby She was a single mother with no job and no permanent place to live but shed grown emotionally attached to the life inside her and some days she wanted to keep her   Kelley struggled and finally decided she wasnt the right person to raise the child But she knew who was in her online research shed met other mothers of children with special needs One of them had been particularly helpful putting her in touch with support groups and sharing stories and photos of her own children  both biological and adopted  with medical problems  The woman and her husband helped Kelley pack up to move to Michigan and gave her emotional support as well  While it is true that the baby will face some lifelong challenges it is also true that it is also more than possible for her to have a wonderful life and to thrive the mother wrote to Kelley in an email I am sorry that her biological parents have abandoned their daughter and left you navigating this new unexpected journey as the sole person bearing responsibility for her wellbeing and care Kelley asked the couple to adopt the baby  They said yes The baby now had a home and it would be undisputed  Or so Kelley thought  Kelley hadnt heard from the biological parents in months when in May about one month before the babys due date the parents filed in Connecticut Superior Court for parental rights They wanted to be the legal parents They wanted their names on the birth certificate  The legal papers included a stunning admission the wife was not the babys genetic mother  theyd used an anonymous egg donor  The case had now become very complicated The lawyers were still negotiating about who would be the legal parents when the baby was born June   She was fullterm and six pounds nine ounces but she wasnt breathing Her body was limp and blue Her heart rate was dangerously low The pediatricians pumped oxygen into her tiny lungs and in about  seconds her heart rate went up to normal She breathed on her own Her color normalized Infant appears to be moving all extremities and crying appropriately the medical record stated  Kelleys name went on the birth certificate Kelley said she left the space for the fathers name blank Three weeks later the two sides struck a deal The father agreed to give up his paternal rights as long as he and his wife could keep in touch with the adoptive family about the babys health Since then the couple has visited the baby The father has held her They do care about her wellbeing They do care about how shes doing the adoptive mother said The babys medical problems turned out to be much more extensive than the ultrasound at Hartford Hospital had revealed  She has a birth defect called   where the brain fails to completely divide into distinct hemispheres She has   which means many of her internal organs such as her liver and stomach are in the wrong places She has at least two spleens neither of which works properly Her head is very small her right ear is misshapen she has a cleft lip and a cleft palate and a long list of complex heart defects among other problems Baby S  her adoptive parents are comfortable using her first initial  has a long road in front of her Shes already had one openheart surgery and surgery on her intestines and in the next year shell need one or two more cardiac surgeries in addition to procedures to repair her cleft lip and palate Later in childhood shell need surgeries on her jaw and ear and more heart surgeries Her adoptive parents who asked to remain anonymous to protect their familys privacy know Baby S might not be with them for long The cardiac procedures she needs are risky and her heterotaxy and holoprosencephaly though mild carry a risk of early death according to doctors  If Baby S does survive theres a  chance she wont be able to walk talk or use her hands normally  In some ways Baby S looks different from other montholds babies In addition to the facial abnormalities shes very small weighing only  pounds and  she gets food through a tube directly into her stomach so shell grow faster Her adoptive parents know some people look at her and see a baby born to suffer  a baby whose suffering could have been prevented with an abortion But thats not the way they see it They see a little girl whos defied the odds who constantly surprises her doctors with what shes able to do  make eye contact giggle at her siblings grab toys eye strangers warily S wakes up every single morning with an infectious smile She greets her world with a constant sense of enthusiasm her mother said in an email to CNN Ultimately we hold onto a faith that in providing S with love opportunity encouragement she will be the one to show us what is possible for her life and what she is capable of achieving Just as there are two ways to look at Baby S there are two ways to look at Crystal Kelley the woman who carried her In one view shes a saint who fought at great personal sacrifice for an unborn child whose own parents did not want her to live In another view she recklessly absconded with someone elses child and brought into the world a baby who faces serious medical challenges when that wasnt her decision to make  Kelley knows some people hate her  Shes   and many readers especially other surrogates have attacked her  I cant tell you how many people told me that I was bad that I was wrong that I should go have an abortion that I would be damned to hell she said In the end she feels like she did the right thing No one else was feeling this pregnancy the way that I was No one else could feel her kicking and moving around inside she said I knew from the beginning that this little girl had an amazing fighting spirit and whatever challenges were thrown at her she would go at them with every ounce of spirit that she could possibly have No matter what anybody told me I became her mother  Check out the latest news from
