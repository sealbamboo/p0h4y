How are Americans sizing up the threat from Ebola A Harvard School of Public Health poll   that more than a third of Americans  percent are worried that Ebola will infect them or a family member over the next year Most  percent believe Ebola can spread from someone who is sick and has symptoms And thats correct Body fluids such as blood urine and feces   from one person to another And almost all of the poll respondents  percent agreed that direct contact with body fluids from a person with Ebola symptoms was likely to cause infection A large proportion  percent of people believe the virus can be transmitted by a sneeze or cough Thats highly unlikely Common sense and observation tell us that spread of the virus via coughing or sneezing is rare if it happens at all the World Health Organization   Dr William Schaffner an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center says there is no known case of Ebola being spread that way I think the public has received Ebola  but not Ebola  he said of the Harvard poll results on Wednesdays   Those kinds of subtleties actually are pretty hard to communicate The telephone poll of  adults was conducted Oct  Thomas Eric Duncan   the poll was put into the field The death of the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the US may have weighed on poll respondents More than half of them  percent said they were worried about an Ebola outbreak in the US within a year When asked the same question in August  percent of people polled said they were concerned about an Ebola outbreak here While there have been setbacks already in dealing with Ebola in the US public health officials say the country can cope with the virus As we learn from the recent importation case in Dallas and subsequent transmissions and continue the public health response there we remain confident that Ebola is not a significant public health threat to the United States CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden said in   submitted for a House oversight committee Thursday Ebola he wrote is not transmitted easily and it does not spread from people who are not ill and cultural norms that contribute to the spread of the disease in Africa  such as burial customs and inadequate publichealth measures  are not a factor in the United States We know Ebola can be stopped with rapid diagnosis appropriate triage and meticulous infectioncontrol practices in American hospitals Americans appear confident that if someone in their community gets sick with Ebola they will receive good care Some  percent said that someone infected with Ebola would survive an infection if he or she got prompt medical care
