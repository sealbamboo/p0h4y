 Aiming to reduce the global threat of counterfeit drugs a new Institute of Medicine report also recommends changes in the United States that include a mandatory drugtracking system and tighter licensing rules for drug wholesalers The potential dangers of counterfeit drugs are many the expert panel noted In  the US Food and Drug Administration issued warnings more than once about   bevacizumab The scope of the problem is even bigger in developing parts of the world One  investigation revealed that falsified or substandard drugs have been sold in at least  countries We have a rampant problem with malaria medications tuberculosis medications and others particularly in low and middleincome countries and we know its increasing said Lawrence Gostin chair of the committee that prepared the report which was released Wednesday The Institute of Medicine IOM is a nonprofit organization that gives expert evidencebased advice on public health issues to policy makers and health professionals Experts say the health   depend to a great degree on the disease a particular medication is used to treat In a worstcase scenario a bad cancer drug could rob a small child with curable leukemia of the chance to be cured said Dr Otis Brawley chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society who stressed that the chances of getting substandard cancer drugs especially in a physicians office or hospital is quite small Meanwhile antibiotics that have been diluted could actually foster antibioticresistant bacteria and push a malaria or tuberculosis outbreak far beyond the borders of a particular country in Africa or Asia he added The problem is that this hugely profitable business is vastly splintered and there is essentially no global regulatory system to combat it there are not even consistent definitions among countries for terms such as substandard and falsified The word counterfeit for instance is often bandied about to describe drugs that have no active ingredient or have been diluted or otherwise violated and dont meet regulatory standards Under patent law however it has a very narrow meaning We dont have common shared definitions We dont have any global tracking and tracing All of the reports by INTERPOL International Criminal Police Organization are anecdotal Nobody coordinates with one another said Gostin professor of global health law at Georgetown University Law Center and director of the World Health Organization WHO Collaborating Center on Public Health Law and Human Rights both in Washington DC As a result we have fragmented inconsistent data and our report is designed to fix all of that The reports most ambitious recommendation said Gostin is asking WHO to begin a global code of practice that would create standard definitions introduce trackandtrace systems and improve regulatory structures and capabilities all over the world The report also calls on the US Food and Drug Administration which sponsored the report to act as the leader in the United States and set standards for other countries to follow The task is a daunting one The business of selling substandardfalsified drugs is more profitable than the illicit drug trade said Gostin Its bringing the same kinds of cartels and illegal behavior and trafficking of these medications and its extremely sophisticated Drug tampering can occur at any point in an incredibly complex supply chain As Gostin said at the raw materials stage at the manufacturing stage and even when you have goodquality drugs they are being transported and can be delivered by the illicit trade and then diluted The drugs can end up in doctors offices but   or in local black markets Theres no duty to report fake drugs and theyre often impossible to detect he added We had people show us two different drugs in two different packages Were a sophisticated scientific committee and we couldnt tell the difference Gostin noted The unanswered question is whether such immense changes can be made In a statement released Wednesday FDA Commissioner Dr Margaret Hamburg commended the IOM for its recommendations She said her agency is currently transforming from a predominantly domestically focused agency to one that is fully prepared to help ensure product safety and quality within a globalized world In this context many of the IOM recommendations support actions and   Hamburg added including advancing technology strengthening global regulatory capacity strengthening surveillance developing sciencebased standards and engaging in global dialogue Gostin conceded that the recommendations were also likely to benefit international pharmaceutical companies that sell legitimate drugs but thats not our purpose Our purpose is to make sure that people when theyre taking medications can have some confidence that the medication will work and wont poison them  Copyright     All rights reserved
