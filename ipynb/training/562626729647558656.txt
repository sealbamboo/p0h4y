They had each lost slabs of muscle to bomb blasts or other physical traumas then struggled to regain even partial function of their mangled legs Some even considered amputation After exhausting all conventional treatments the five men volunteered for an experimental and seemingly outlandish surgical procedure aimed at spurring new muscle growth They had swaths of chemically treated pigs bladder sewn to their healthy muscle and left to decay In a paper published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine researchers at the University of Pittsburgh say the implantation of socalled extracellular matrix into the patients legs prompted new muscle to grow by drawing the bodys own tissuecreating stem cells to the site As a result three of the five patients saw at least a  increase in strength and a  improvement in functionality six months after the surgery according to the report Most of these patients have been through hell said Dr Stephen Badylak senior study author and professor of surgery at the University of Pittsburgh The things that you and I take for granted  getting out of a chair taking steps getting off a curb getting out of the car  these are the types of deficits that these individuals had Muscle makes up more than  of a persons body mass and unlike other tissues it has the ability to regenerate after injury But that ability is lost when large volumes of muscle are torn away or deprived of blood flow Instead the body produces scar tissue Though scientists have proposed healing such injuries by injecting patients with stem cells capable of transforming themselves into muscle tissue Badylak said most of the cells would quickly die He and his colleagues say the solution is to recruit stem cells from the patients own body where they can pick up on chemical signals sent by distressed cells nearby Study authors say this is where the pigderived extracellular matrix or ECM comes into play The ECM is a web of long protein molecules that serve as the scaffolding for living tissue The molecules are found in nearly all multicellular organisms Though scientists had long viewed the ECM as serving only an architectural function the Pittsburgh researchers say it also acts as a messenger When it begins to degrade it releases chemical compounds called peptides that attract stem cells These scaffolds are kind of homing beacons said study leader Brian Sicari a researcher at the universitys McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine Dr Patrick Warnke a professor of facial and regenerative surgery at Griffith University in Queensland Australia said he was impressed by the technique and speculated that it might one day be used to repair damaged heart tissues This shows a lot of promise for regenerating muscular tissue said Warnke who was not involved in the study The research was partially funded by the US Defense Department and three of the patients were service members Two of those had been injured in bomb blasts and the third suffered exerciseinduced damage The two other patients both civilians lost leg muscle as a result of skiing accidents All five patients were between the ages of  and  and had undergone numerous surgeries before entering the study One of the bombing victims had been operated on  times While the number of patients was small we were very encouraged by the data said Dr J Peter Rubin a study coauthor and professor of plastic surgery and bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh We were seeing very dramatic improvements in quality of life for some of our patients Transplanted organs are frequently attacked by the patients immune system which is why recipients must take powerful immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their lives But before the ECM was implanted it was treated with chemicals that remove the cells leaving only the lattice of protein molecules intact Without foreign cells to provoke the patients immune system the problem of rejection was avoided the authors said But there is a catch The recruited stem cells can transform into a variety of tissues including fat cartilage bone and scar tissue Badylak said that in order to produce new muscle tissue the stem cells had to be coached Study authors did that by implanting the ECM under just the right tension and by initiating vigorous physical therapy within a day or two after surgery The cells get the idea to say OK I get it Im supposed to line up this way Im supposed to be the type of a cell that can bear weight or contract Badylak said If that doesnt happen when they get there and they dont get those signals they can turn into anything else
