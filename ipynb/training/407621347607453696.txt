People may feel ashamed or afraid to talk about abuse including the verbal kind so the researchers from Northeastern University asked their older subjects to respond to questions by touching a computer screen It gave them more privacy They instructed these seniors to think about the person who helped them most with their care  it could be a family member or a paid helper  then asked How often in the past year did someone insult or swear at you and How often did someone stomp out of the room or house and How often did someone threaten to hit or throw something at you The questions came from a muchused scale that measures conflict This study which involved  older patients at a large academic medical center in New York did not ask people to describe the kind of verbal mistreatment they had experienced from their caregivers But   lead author of the research and dean of Northeasterns Bouv College of Health Sciences in Boston has explored elder abuse for  years and has heard the most frequent complaints many times She yells at me He swears at me all the time She tells me that if I keep acting like this shell put me in a nursing home The participants in Dr Fulmers study were ambulatory older people who lived in the community and who did not have dementia which would lead you to think their caregivers might face somewhat less stress than those whose elders are bedridden or demented Yet a startling  percent of these seniors whose average age was about  reported   from their primary caregivers in the past year The researchers presented their results at the Gerontological Society of Americas recent annual meeting in New Orleans Experts consider verbal insults threats and humiliation forms of elder abuse but believe its often overlooked compared with physical harm or financial exploitation Sticks and stones right If someone yells at a kid dont all of us notice Dr Fulmer said Sometimes people call protective services Our tolerance for similar behavior involving elderly people is much different We might question the researchers decision to place a senior in the verbally mistreated category based on a single selfreported incident It is a low bar Dr Fulmer acknowledged If a weary daughter or aide loses her temper once in a year and says something regrettable does that make this older person a victim Vulnerable seniors can hurl insults too and exasperate those around them in other ways Besides people will vary in their responses A more sensitive person might overreport a cross word Dr Fulmer said Others might tolerate being sworn at regularly Without standardized definitions and methodologies its hard to say how common verbal abuse truly is Other studies and there arent enough of them have found much lower rates The first nationally representative study to ask older people about mistreatment published in  reported that   What makes the Northeastern study worth paying attention to though is the impact that any level of mistreatment can have The group that said a caregiver had yelled sworn or threatened at least once in the past year had significantly lower social functioning and poorer mental health than the group reporting no verbal mistreatment Previous studies have also found relationships between verbal mistreatment and seniors health and wellbeing As we are learning with verbal abuse among other groups like bullied teenagers names can indeed harm you Were trying to sensitize caregivers to the fact that words hurt Dr Fulmer said If you have a pattern of aggressive abusive interactions with your elders they can suffer Sympathetic to the strains on caregivers she urged them to seek help  from caregiver support groups social workers physicians clergy  if they find themselves using insults or intimidation Heres where access to respite care might make a difference gerontologists and others are also working to develop therapies that may reduce mistreatment At the New Orleans conference there were more presentations on mistreatment this year than ever before Dr Fulmer said I take it as a very good sign
