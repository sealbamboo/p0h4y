 Its too many   not too much protein that leads to unhealthy weight gain associated with overeating new research suggests In a donottrythisathome study  healthy participants followed   containing different levels of protein  plus nearly  extra calories  for eight weeks The study took place in an inpatient setting where participants had just completed weightstabilizing diets for  to  days Those who ate lowprotein diets gained less weight than the other groups but the quality of the weight gained was worse as it came from an increase in body fat In contrast the highprotein diets led to changes in lean body mass and helped participants burn calories Most people are overeating and for those people who are they need to pay attention to what they are putting into their mouths said study coauthor Leanne Redman an assistant professor of endocrinology at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge La If you overeat a highfat lowprotein diet you may gain weight at a lower rate but you are   The findings appear in the Jan  issue of the   The researchers looked at how the level of protein in the diets affected body composition weight gain and energy expenditure under tightly controlled conditions using sophisticated measurement techniques Participants were young adults aged  to  The diets varied in the amount of calories derived from protein The lowprotein diet had  percent of calories from protein the normalprotein diet had  percent of calories from protein and the   had  percent of its calories as protein All three diets included the same amount of carbohydrates and fat made up the difference in the calories All participants were overfed by about  calories a day Everyone gained weight during the overeating period However people in the lowprotein diet lost  pounds in muscle mass while those in the normal or highprotein groups gained muscle mass during the overeating period Muscle weighs more than fat which is why they gained more weight The excess calories turned to fat among participants who ate a lowprotein diet The makeup of the weight  lean muscle or fat  may be even more important than the number on the scale or body mass index said Dr David Heber director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of California Los Angeles and coauthor of an editorial accompanying the new study Calories count he said He encourages a highprotein lowfat diet that is rich in colorful fruits and vegetables We are talking about lean protein such as whitemeat chicken ocean fish turkey egg whites and certain protein powders Protein is more satiating and helps reduce appetite he explained Connie Diekman director of university nutrition at Washington University in St Louis said This study provides support to the caloriescount message as it relates to percent of body fat I find the conclusion of this study especially helpful in encouraging people to be aware of the calories they consume and to avoid focusing on just where those calories come from
