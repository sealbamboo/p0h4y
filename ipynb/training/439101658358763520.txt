A trip to the doctors office may help you feel better but it can also send you right back to bed if youre unlucky enough to pick up someone elses germs during your visit And researchers say you might be getting those germs from the doctors stethoscope Think of stethoscopes as an extension of the doctors hands which are the main source of patienttopatient bacterial transmission says   the director of infection control at University of Geneva Hospital in Switzerland and the studys lead author The Center for Disease Control estimates that on any given day one in every  patients has an infection after receiving medical care Between  to  percent of those infections happen through the spread of pathogens from one patient to another or from hospital equipment to a patient often via the hands of healthcare workers according to   an epidemiologist at Virginia Commonwealth University who wasnt involved in the study But while there are guidelines that recommend that all doctors wash their hands before and after visiting each patient there are none mandating that small medical equipment like stethoscopes should also be disinfected after every single use We have no guidelines to clean our stethoscopes which has as many bacteria on the diaphragm of the stethoscope as we have on our fingertips Pittet tells Shots To study this researchers had three physicians examine a total of  patients at the hospital After each examination they looked at the amount of bacteria collected on different regions of physicians dominant hand and on the diaphragm  the part that comes in direct contact with the patient  and tube of their stethoscopes In one phase researchers examined total bacteria collected in another they focused just on one particularly bad bug methicillinresistant   or   to see if the contamination includes diseasecausing bacteria Although results from  patient examinations showed no presence of bacteria the remaining  revealed that the density of bacteria was much higher on the stethoscope than on the back and palm of the hand The most heavily contaminated parts were the fingertips and the more contaminated they were the more bacteria was found on the stethoscope The   were published Thursday in   Pittet considers the study one of the first to provide evidence that health care providers should clean their stethoscopes But he says it may be years before any guidelines actually come out Thats because research has yet to show just how many patienttopatient infections are associated with the spread of bacteria through medical equipment One of the major knowledge gap of infection control is the degree to which the inanimate environment  actually drives the hospital infection process Bearman says We havent been able to come up with great studies that say Well if you do a certain degree of decolonization youre going to get an absolute reduction in infections  But he adds Common sense should dictate that reusable equipment should be wiped down after each use The solution sounds simple enough doctors can use an alcoholbased rub to clean their equipment or use disposable covers Though Bearman notes that many people still dont do either And thats true for hand washing too which both Bearman and Pittet stress is the most important practice In the s just  percent of doctors washed their hands between patients Since the initial   by the World Health Organization Pittet says the number has improved to nearly  percent worldwide However it is not at that very high high rate of sustainability that we would like to see Bearman tells Shots Thats why both scientists say that patients shouldnt be afraid to ask their doctors to not only to clean the equipment but also their hands before the examination Tip If you find the situation uncomfortable you can talk to your nurse Those hands are coming into contact with multiple potential sources of pathogens whether its touching the telephone touching the bed rails touching the patients touching the IV line touching the stethoscope Bearman says So the final common link is going to be the hands of the healthcare workers
