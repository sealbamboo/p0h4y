Camden NJ has serious health problems with too many people going to local emergency rooms unnecessarily But progress is being made albeit slowly John Pike  is a Camden resident who used to be a frequent flier at the ER Pike has a smokers cough and when that cough or pain in his bad hip flared up hed go to the ER  maybe eight or nine times a year But when he did ER staffers didnt really remember him or his medical history You get the feeling you are irritating them he says It would be a simple problem Im wasting their time where they could be dealing with a real emergency Once he says an ER nurse pulled him aside and said This is something your doctor can deal with Not much I could say because she was telling the truth he says But Pike didnt have a primary care doctor until a community group called the   opened a doctors office right inside Pikes apartment building  director of research and evaluation for the coalition says the idea was to get super users like Pike to stop going to the hospital so frequently Gross says the group saw ER overuse in Camden as a sign for us from the data that you dont have a source of primary care or you have a loose relationship with primary care or you cant get an appointment with your primary care because of your work hours Gross leads a team of   at the coalition For several years they gathered hospital billing information from across Camden Then they mapped the data block by block It turns out that Pikes building is marked as a brightred hot spot on the map Pike and his neighbors at the Northgate II building had racked up more than  million a year in hospital admissions and trips to the emergency room over about a decade These days Pike rides an elevator to the doctor just six floors down from his apartment The space is bare bones with just two exam rooms and a tiny file office but Pike has his own doctor now  Dr Madhumathi Gunasekaran I feel comfortable with her I can talk to her she doesnt shove you off like some doctors Pike says Dr Jon Regis is a longtime member of the Camden coalition His company the   operates  offices across New Jersey including the practice at Northgate II The subsidized housing there is home to many lowincome seniors and people with disabilities Many people who live in Northgate II now see Gunasekaran for checkups and other medical issues But Regis says it took longer than he had hoped to win over residents  almost two years We thought that since they were having such a difficult time we could just open up the door and they would come down he says That wasnt the case Regis says some residents told him they didnt want their neighbors to know theyre going to the doctor But Regis was persistent in trying to get residents to use Gunasekaran instead of the ER We had to do a number of different things like health fairs and meetandgreets We had to engender a sense of trust in the residents before they would come down to see us he says I think that was somewhat surprising But were starting to get past that now About a year ago only about  people got their primary care at the office That number has grown to nearly  or about  percent of the buildings residents It was a slow start but Regis says he is pleased with the progress Reliance uses revenue from private pay and private insurance patients at other office locations to help finance the clinic at Northgate II This way he says We dont have to turn anybody away and weve been able to make this work
