Its quite clear that this is not a direct ancestor of people today said Svante Paabo a biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and senior author of the study  Instead he said this representative of an early humanlike species called Homo heidelbergensis could be an ancestor of both Neanderthals and another group called the De nisovans  The genetic relationship to Denisovans discovered through this DNA research is surprising because the Homo heidelbergensis remains found in the cave have many Neanderthallike features The only remnants of Denisovans come from Siberia  a long way from Spain  Its sort of an open question really what this means and I think further research into the nuclear genome of these hominins will address that Paabo said Paabo and colleagues used a new method for sequencing ancient degraded genetic material to put together the yearold specimens mitochondrial genome It is the oldest DNA ever found outside permafrost conditions  in other words it was not permanently frozen  The retrieval of such ancient human DNA is a major technical achievement and promises further recovery of such material from other fossils in this time range both in the Sima and elsewhere where we would not previously have expected it or looked for it said Chris Stringer researcher at the Natural History Museum in London who was not involved in the study  Mitochondria are structures in cells that convert food energy into usable forms DNA stored in the mitochondria is passed to children through the maternal line only ie only moms can pass it on so its only a small snapshot of inherited genes  Genetic material in the cells nucleus comes from both parents and gives a fuller picture of genetic heritage  To study genetics of our ancient predecessors researchers have an easier time studying mitochondrial DNA because there are hundreds of times more copies of it in each cell  Its a much bigger chance to find some fragments of this preserved Paabo said   The method that researchers used involves separating the two strands of the DNA double helix They then make a library from each of the two strands If part of one strand is damaged its analogue on the other strand  which is made of complementary genetic partners  may be intact That is sort of the big trick involved Paabo said  After sequencing the mitochondrial DNA researchers then compared the result with genetic information about Neanderthals and Denisovans  Since nuclear DNA encompasses more information about a persons inheritance a nuclear genome sequence from Homo heidelbergensis may reveal even more clearly how it is connected to other ancient humanlike species he said  But retrieving the nuclear DNA sequence will be challenging study authors wrote Just to get the mitochondrial DNA sequence it took about two grams of bone  less than  ounce  even though hundreds of copies of this DNA are in every cell  Still Paabo said the sequencing technique his group used opens a possibility to now do this at many other sites and really begin to understand earlier human evolution Researchers thought initially the mitochondrial DNA of the Homo heidelbergensis specimen would share a common ancestor with Neanderthals Neanderthals lived in Europe beginning as much as  years ago Paabo said Homo sapiens our species first appeared in Africa between  and  years ago Instead researchers discovered through the DNA that this specimen is closer to the Denisovans a group related to the Neanderthals  A likely explanation is that in Eastern Eurasia this species gave rise to Denisovans and in Western Eurasia they were the ancestors of Neanderthals Paabo said But more research needs to be done to verify that theory  Little is known about the Denisovans Although some of their remains were found in southern Siberia their genetic signature is only found today on islands in the Pacific  Paabo was also the senior author on a   analyzing the Denisovan genome That research suggested that human ancestors and the Denisovans ancestors must have branched off from one another as much as  years ago  although that number is vague Still it seems that the Denisovans must have mated with indigenous people in Papua New Guinea and Australia Paabo said About  to  of the DNA of people from Melanesia islands in the southwest Pacific Ocean Australia and New Guinea as well as aboriginal people from the Philippines comes from the Denisovans On the other hand everyone who lives outside Africa today probably has some Neanderthal DNA in them Paabo said in   The bottom line Paabo said is that the relationships between these early human relatives  Homo heidelbergensis Neanderthals and Denisovans  are not clearcut  Its going to be a more complex history that one will eventually clarify with the help of DNA he said
