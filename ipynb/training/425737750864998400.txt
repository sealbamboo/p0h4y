If youve ever shopped at Whole Foods youve probably noticed that some of the foods it sells claim all kinds of health and environmental virtues From its lengthy list of   to its strict rules for how seafood is caught and meat is raised the company sets a pretty high bar for what is permitted on its coveted shelves Now Whole Foods is dictating what kind of fertilizer the farmers that grow its produce can use Specifically the company recently confirmed that the   its launching in September will prohibit produce farmed using sludge Sludge This doesnt exactly sound like something youd want near your food Also known as biosolids its a type of fertilizer   from treated municipal waste and derived in part from poop And though many farmers gladly accept sludge to enrich their soil its a product with a pretty big PR problem You see for several years now a small group of activists has claimed that biosolids are toxic and full of heavy metals pharmaceuticals and other chemicals They argue that when farmers use biosolids to nourish their soils theyre putting consumers at risk of getting sick But scientists who study sludge and waste experts say that this form of fertilizer actually delivers big environmental benefits The de facto leader of the sludge opposition is   author of the  book   Last week one of the three groups Stauber founded the Center for Media and Democracy   an article cheering the Whole Foods decision and claiming credit for pressuring the company into it Whole Foods spokeswoman Lindsay Robison tells The Salt that biosolids were banned in the name of transparency and being consistent with the US Department of Agricultures National Organic Program which doesnt allow the material on fields where any certified organic product is grown But she adds the companys new biosolids ban wont actually impact any of the companys growers because as far as the company knows none of them use the material According to Rebekah Wilce of CMD who wrote the article Whole Foods move is a victory for consumers The assumption has been that biosolids are safe but theres been very little scientific research on that Wilce tells The Salt Actually as we   back in May biosolids are heavily regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency and have been ever since the s when the agency cracked down on wastewater treatment facilities and what they could discharge When the EPA developed the standards for biosolids it identified the chemicals and metals that are the greatest risk to human health and the environment and set strict concentration limits on them As we recently   the government has less strict standards for organic farmers who want to put untreated animal manure on their fields Still Wilces group isnt happy with the standards for biosolids  she says theyre insufficient But when we asked for specific examples of facilities handing out biosolids with excessive amounts of dangerous chemicals or examples of people getting sick directly from them Wilce did not supply us with any  director of resource recovery for the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority argues that biosolids are actually a very safe material His treatment plant has been turning the citys waste into biosolids since the s and giving them away to farmers in the midAtlantic to use as fertilizer And hes confident that his sludge doesnt pose a risk to anyone eating produce grown with it  because hes constantly testing it per EPA rules Our material is extremely clean and the metals that are in there are at extremely low levels Peot tells The Salt There are trace amounts of flame retardants but theyre ubiquitous in the home now where youre much more likely to be exposed to dangerous levels of them Still we need to be ever vigilant and continue to look for new chemicals that might be risky so we do Scientists and waste experts say theres actually a large net environmental benefit to farmers and gardeners recycling the material as a soil amendment They say it returns valuable nutrients like nitrogen back to the land and keeps the sludge out of landfills and waterways And even though the small group of activists has raised consumers fears scientists say that the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that sludge is safe and useful This is a resource thats really undervalued says   a soil scientist at the University of Washington who has been studying biosolids for over a decade If you do the carbon accounting you see that biosolids actually capture carbon unlike synthetic fertilizer which is what farmers would otherwise be using The opposition to biosolids comes from the fact that people are still uncomfortable with any material made from human waste even if its been heavily processed and treated Brown notes People have been taught that poop is dangerous and it makes you sick and so theyre suspicious of it she says And municipalities have done a terrible job of communicating what they do and what wastewater treatment really is So where does the Whole Foods ban come in Whole Foods says Brown made a business decision rather than a sustainability or environmentally based decision
