Theyre happy to see you when you get home love you unconditionally and make you get up from the couch to take a walk And theres a growing body of evidence that pets can lower your risk of heart disease too the American Heart Association says The group says theres now enough evidence that pets are hearthealthy to justify an official statement summing up the evidence The most data and the best data were on dog ownership said Dr Glenn Levine of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who led the committee that wrote the statement In no way are we discounting or dissing cats or other pets Levine added hastily The committee went through all the evidence linking pet ownership with lowered risk of heart disease Theres plenty of it Only one studys been done to the gold standard of scientific rigor  a socalled randomized study In that one researchers found a group of  people with borderline high blood pressure who were about to adopt dogs from a shelter and persuaded half of them to hold off Those allowed to adopt dogs right away had lower blood pressure two and five months later than those who agreed to wait Interestingly at later followup after all study participants had adopted dogs systolic blood pressure was found to be similarly lowered in the deferredadoption group as well the committee wrote in the report More study is needed to show precisely why pets lower blood pressure and improve the ability to handle heartharming stress hormones such as cortisol Its also possible says Levine that other factors are involved Any pet owner can testify that animals drag in a lot of dirt  and touching and breathing in dirt pollen and other allergens could reduce levels of a compound called Creactive protein which rises when there is inflammation in the body and is strongly linked to heart disease Or it could be something simple Perhaps when owns a pet one tends to be happier said Levine himself a dog owner Pet owners might be more likely to take their medications and eat healthier meals he said Despite the evidence the group doesnt yet recommend that people adopt pets simply to lower their risk of heart disease We did not want people to see this article and just go out and adopt or rescue or buy a dog while they continue to just sit on the couch and smoke cigarettes Levine said The primary reason to adopt a pet would be to give the pet a loving home and to derive a measure of enjoyment from taking care of a pet And although dog owners are far more likely to get out and exercise with their pets than say a snake owner Levine said any pet can be helpful Several studies demonstrated beneficial effects on these parameters associated with goat fish chimpanzee and snake ownership the statement reads One experiment even demonstrated a benefit on cardiovascular stress responses with virtual animals which were presented in the form of video recordings
