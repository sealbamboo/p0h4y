The patient had a severe pneumonia of advanced AIDS Hed been lying in our intensive care unit for three weeks a breathing tube thrust into his raw airway his face a mixture of pain and resignation His weakened lung tissue had popped in several areas requiring chest tubes to drain the pockets of pressurized air He looked like a sea creature with multiple tentacles  My coattending doctor in the ICU had tasked me with keeping the patient alive for the weekend Im going to try and get the tubes out on Monday he explained  Knowing the prognosis I asked him if hed told the family the patient was going to die  No I can keep him alive for now he replied With that he left Soon after the patients family arrived I took a deep breath and told them what I knew they hadnt yet heard that his lungs had been permanently damaged and were steadily getting worse and that he would probably never come off the breathing machine In short I said he was dying  His family took in what I said I left them in the conference room to process this information and a short time later his brother found me and asked that the patient be taken off the ventilator and made comfortable He died peacefully on Sunday night  I doubted my coattending doctor would be surprised My residents tell me some of my colleagues call me   Specializing in the seemingly divergent fields of intensive care and palliative care which focuses on the relief of pain and suffering of patients I frequently find myself in the position of undoing the lifeprolonging work of my ICU colleagues   I believe in letting the dying determine how and when they die as opposed to coaxing their organs along at all costs As one of the only doctors I know who straddles these two worlds I am struck by how many of my colleagues are surprised even disturbed by this pairing I was once accused by a renowned professor of medicine of deceiving my ICU patients by also practicing palliative care as if it was somehow a conflict of interest The ICU is a final common pathway for many of the dying One in five people in the United States currently dies there and   Studies   significantly before they die   Many patients come to the ICU already suffering from critical illness And many recover But for some stretching out their life like an elastic band does nothing but prolong their anguish  Palliative care medicine sometimes called hospice and palliative care is a subspecialty that is only five years old It  advocates medical care that focuses on the overall wellbeing of the patient as opposed to just the optimization of organ function Patients who receive palliative care tend to suffer far less die at home and   Yet even though the ICU is exactly where palliative care is most needed it has proven difficult to merge these two disciplines One reason is that there is only one palliative care physician for every  patients in need This deficit is predicted to   There have been some legislative efforts to increase the number of palliative care specialists But it would most likely take many years to educate enough physicians to meet the demands  And even if we suspend reality and envision a future with a saturated market of palliative care specialists it may still not be enough This is particularly true in a place like the ICU where a Wild West culture makes it a challenge for palliative care to get a foothold Its hard to slow a wild horse particularly one that believes it can outrace death If an ICU physician like myself experiences resistance from her colleagues one can imagine the challenges a palliative care physician or the nurse practitioner or social worker who typically work on a palliative care team would be likely to  face when making recommendations  Recently the palliative care community has made efforts to breach the ICU walls starting   in  It is a repository of information and guidelines for clinicians to successfully integrate the practices of palliative care and intensive care Separately a colleague and I initiated the first specialinterest group for ICU physicians at this years assembly of the American Association of Hospice and Palliative Care Medicine  But more is needed Most important the training of ICU physicians must change to incorporate a patientcentered approach That herculean effort will take time If I am ever dying in an ICU please make sure my doctors consider my needs as a person not a collection of organs And it wouldnt hurt to call a palliative care consult When Monday morning came around my colleague approached me in the ICU In response to my attempts to convince him I had done well by the patient he smiled and shook his head  If you had just kept him alive for the weekend I could have kept him going  He pointed out I had lost the battle with the patients lungs and he was right But I believe the true winner here was the patient   Jessica Nutik Zitter is an attending physician at Alameda County Medical Center in Oakland Calif She is board
