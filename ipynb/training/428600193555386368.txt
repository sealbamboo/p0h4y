Back in  a young biologist at Cornell University made a stunning discovery He took a single cell from a carrot and then mixed it with some coconut milk Days went by and the cell started dividing Little roots formed Stems started growing Eventually a   rose up from the single cell Imagine if you could perform a similar feat with animal cells even human cells A team of Japanese biologists say theyve taken a big step toward doing just that at least in mice Instead of using coconut milk though the magic ingredient is something akin to lemon juice Biologist   and her colleagues at the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology say theyve figured out a fast easy way to make the most powerful cells in the world  embryonic stem cells  from just one blood cell The trick Put white blood cells from a baby mouse in a mild acid solution Obokata and her team   Wednesday in the journal   Eventually a few stem cells emerge that can turn into any other cell in the body  skin heart liver or neurons you name it For decades scientists have been searching for easy ways to make human embryonic stem cells These cells hold great potential for treating diseases such as Alzheimers Parkinsons heart disease and diabetes But for a long time human stem cells were essentially off limits for researchers because the only way to get them was by destroying human embryos Then in  another team of scientists at the RIKEN center figured out a way to make human stem cells from skin and blood by manipulating the cells genes That discovery won the team the   and opened a whole new avenue for exploring the power of stem cells But that process has come with its own set of problems Its quite messy and we dont really understand how it works biochemist   of the University of Cambridge tells NPRs Rob Stein In contrast Smith says the method developed by Obokata and colleagues if it pans out is straightforward and doesnt involve any manipulation inside the cell only a small change in the cells environment Obokata and her team tested a whole range of treatments in the hopes of creating stem cells including starving the blood cells heating them up and even squeezing them through a thin pipette What worked the best was simply putting the blood cells in a mild acid for about  minutes The pH of the solution was about  or a little more acidic than milk A few days later the cells stopped acting like blood and started behaving like stem cells When the researchers injected the cells into a mouse embryo the cells acted just like other stem cells They created all the organs needed for an adult mouse The team named the cells stimulustriggered acquisition of pluripotency or STAP It seems like a new paradigm says Smith who wasnt involved with the study The method could have many applications but it really depends on finding out if and how we can extend this method in humans The researchers dont know whether the method works with blood from adult mice So far all of the experiments have used cells taken from infant mice just  week old The cells are only a few days old Smith says But we need to know if it works with adult cells and in human cells That would be essential if the cells are to be used for medical treatments And of course even if the method does work with human cells theres still a long long way to go before the cells could be tested in humans
