Newborn babies across England will be screened for more debilitating genetic diseases from Monday Cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease are already picked up in the heelprick blood test Four rarer conditions will now also be tested for Public Health England expects  cases will be identified each year allowing lifesaving treatment Wales will follow suit later this month while Scotland and Northern Ireland   Babies currently have the heelprick test at between five and eight days old to check for The babys heel is pricked and drops of blood are collected and analysed so babies can get the treatment and support they need from the earliest stage possible The extra conditions which will now also be tested for are They are all inherited conditions where babies have problems breaking down amino acids the building blocks of proteins For example maple syrup urine disease is caused by a build up of three amino acids leucine isoleucine and valine  Too much protein in the diet can lead to coma and permanent brain damage However early detection means a low protein diet and food supplements can reduce the impact of the disease  A yearlong pilot programme of expanded screening run by Sheffield Childrens NHS Foundation Trust found  confirmed cases of the four extra conditions in  babies Dr Anne Mackie director of programmes for the NHS Screening Programmes said Screening for these rare disorders has the potential to benefit around  children in England each year  The early identification of these conditions can prevent death and significantly improve the quality of life for those living with these conditions Wales has committed to starting screening on  January Public health minister for England Jane Ellison added This is really welcome news  Expanding the screening has the potential to make a huge difference to the lives of babies born with rare genetic disorders  Detecting the disorders early can help prevent babies being severely disabled or even dying which is absolutely vital for the families affected Poppy BellMinogue was nine months old when she became unwell  Unbeknown to her parents she had maple syrup urine disease which had led to a harmful buildup of amino acids in the blood and was affecting her brain   For Poppys mum Samantha and her husband an early diagnosis of the disease would have made a huge difference Instead they had to undergo several months of tests and brain scans before doctors diagnosed the rare disorder In the meantime Poppys parents were told they would probably lose her Samantha says Poppys diet from birth would have been different if they had known We wouldnt have given her breast milk formula milk or food high in proteins after she was weaned Eating these foods made her condition worse and led to high levels of harmful amino acids in her body which may have damaged her brain
