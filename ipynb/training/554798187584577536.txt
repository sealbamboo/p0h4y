The hit comedy series Transparent which tells the story of a yearold dad transitioning into a woman has picked up two Golden Globe awards and shone a spotlight on the lives of transgender people With more realistic portrayals of transgender characters Hollywood may be helping society accept transgender people  even transgender children A growing number of children are using prescription puberty blockers so that they can stop unwanted changes in their bodies like breasts or facial hair  Its a fairly new treatment and a controversial one Critics say blocking puberty is tantamount to child abuse and that children should be counselled to accept the bodies into which they were born But parents of children with severe gender identity disorder and the doctors who treat them say doing nothing can be harmful and that allowing children to go through puberty in the wrong gender can result in severe depression and suicide When I was little I always said Im a girl I look like a girl My heart is a girl heart says yearold Zoey who was born a boy but who now identifies as a girl Her doctor blocked her puberty and then prescribed crosssex hormones to allow her to develop as a female   When I got older I hid it so I would be accepted at schools which was the hardest time of my life because I had to act like somebody that I was not Zoey started identifying as a female from a very young age As a toddler she used to ask her mother why God make a mistake and gave her the wrong body The puberty suppressors Zoey and others take are reversible and FDAapproved because they have been used for decades in children going through premature puberty But for children with gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder the blockers are being started anywhere from age nine to   The drugs are credited with buying the children time so they can figure out if they really do want to live as a different gender Teenagers can then take crosssex hormones to help them physically develop into the opposite gender Doctors have only been using the blockers in transgender children since the late s when Dutch doctors started the practice Zoeys doctor Dr Johanna Olson director of the Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles first started using them in  Of course there are fears around sideeffects says Dr Olson She says one of her first patients was a yearold who had been menstruating for two years and attempted suicide every time a period arrived So thats obviously a huge part of the balance Im going to lose this kid before we have enough data to say yes this is a safe intervention on  and  year olds the kid might kill himself says Dr Olson  of transgender people in US have attempted suicide  for general population Fourtimes more likely to live in extreme poverty Double the rate of unemployment Nearly  report harassment while in school Onefifth have experienced homelessness Source National LGBTQ Taskforce A big debate in the medical community is when to start blockers and crosssex hormone therapy  Dr Kenneth Zucker a gender identity specialist at Torontos Centre for Addiction and Mental Health says his clinic typically waits until patients are  before prescribing hormones to allow people to develop into the opposite gender But his clinic has used puberty blockers on children as young as  depending on when they start puberty Both Dr Olson and Dr Zucker say theyve had very few reports of regret from their patients who have received the puberty blockers  But Dr Zucker says he conducted one study which showed more than  of children who came to his clinic and were not treated with hormone blockers were content in their biological gender by the time they were  There is debate on how low one should go in starting hormonal treatment to suppress puberty he told the BBC   I think where its going to get interesting in this field in the next  years is that at least in some quarters theres now a much more permissive approach toward supporting crosssex hormone therapy and even surgery and the question is going to be is the more permissive approach going to correlate with more regrets or more dissatisfaction Some transgender children buy illegal medication on the internet to try and treat themselves often with dire consequences Is this a golden age in Hollywood for the transgender community The TV series Transparent picked up two Golden Globe awards and best actor winner Eddie Redmayne tipped to win an Oscar for playing Stephen Hawking will next be playing a transgender woman on the big screen  Transgender characters have long been portrayed by Hollywood as prostitutes victims or villains but with TV shows like Glee and Orange is The New Black as well as Amazons new hit Transparent Hollywood is showcasing the lives of transgender people like never before That means audiences are becoming acquainted with some unique issues faced by trans people  like safe access to bathrooms and hormone therapy   Its unprecedented in the sense that until  years ago if there was a trans character in a film or on TV they were either a problem or a criminal says Jack Halberstam a gender studies professor at the University of Southern California This humanisation of transgender people is clearly new  Before receiving puberty blockers children must undergo mental health evaluations strict medical screenings and counselling Dr Olson says the best results come with starting hormone blockers at the first signs of puberty  This is made more complicated by the fact that children are going through puberty at younger ages Some critics say the rising number of transgender children is due to liberal urban parents going too far with kids who might just be experimenting with conventions The reality is that the internet has probably done the most to bring about the rise in transgender children with families from all walks of life finding each other and swapping stories about their children who appear to be going through a phase that seemingly never ends Zoeys mother Ofelia is a working class Hispanic single motherofthree who knew nothing about transgender people until her toddler son started saying I am a girl  Now shes an outspoken advocate for transgender rights I feel its silly they would think Im egging on a child to go through this If you understood how difficult it is for them to transition to be accepted amongst their peers the struggles they have to go through the pain they have to go through Ofelia said This is who my daughter is  this makes sense for me and my family this works She is happy She is in school She is learning Theres nothing different about her She is just transgender  that is it Because of the growing awareness about transgender people doctors say their clinics have been inundated with patients over the last few years The American Medical Association issued guidelines to help doctors Transgender adults who cannot easily pass as their gender identity have higher rates of suicide are more likely to be murdered and often face discrimination in the workplace Theres no reward for being trans no reward Theres a lifetime of medication giving up your fertility it is more challenging to do life when youre trans says Dr Olson pointing out that for people who decide to transition it feels like the only option they have to live as their authentic selves The trans experience is remarkable  to walk in both genders  that is so rare  Lets celebrate that not just tolerate it We have something to learn from trans people
