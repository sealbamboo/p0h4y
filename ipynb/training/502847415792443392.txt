Eating fish is associated with an increase in brain volume but it is apparently not because of its omega content a new study has found Researchers analyzed data from  cognitively normal people average age  who had answered diet questionnaires Theyd also had their blood levels of omega fatty acids measured and their brains scanned  The researchers found that weekly consumption of baked or broiled fish  but not fried fish  was associated with larger gray matter volumes in areas of the brain responsible for memory and cognition including areas where amyloid plaques a sign of Alzheimers disease first appear The association persisted after controlling for age sex race education physical activity body mass index and any tissue damage found on the initial magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain The results were the same regardless of omega levels suggesting that omegas were not the determining factor The  The lead author Dr Cyrus A Raji a radiology resident at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center said that eating fish once a week   there was no additional benefit in eating more  and living a generally healthy lifestyle were enough Physical activity weight control and so on  these factors influence the brain more than any supplement or any medicine Its much more in our control than we thought
