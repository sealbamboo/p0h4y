Watching fastpaced television programmes does not affect childrens ability to concentrate afterwards suggests a Keele University study Tests showed that three and fouryearolds performed better on a problemsolving task after watching a fastpaced rather than a slowpaced Postman Pat  There was no difference in their understanding of the two programmes  The study is presented at the British Psychological Society conference Dr Alexandra Lamont lead study author said there was a widely held belief that watching television was responsible for behavioural problems in young children She said television was often blamed for adversely affecting concentration levels and inhibiting childrens development but there was little research to back that up In the study  preschool children watched both Postman Pat programmes before completing a blockbuilding task and comprehension tests of the programme The fastpaced programme was a recent episode in which the scene changed every two or three seconds and contained lots of visual and sound effects The slowpaced programme was older and the average length of each scene was seven seconds The research team which included Dr Sarah Rose and Dr Nicholas Reyland from Keele University found that children paid more attention to the fastpaced programme and all the children performed slightly better on the blockbuilding task after watching the fastpaced programme  Dr Lamont said We know that the pace of childrens television has rapidly increased in recent years   Its reassuring to discover that fastpaced programmes have no detrimental effects on young childrens behaviour in the short term and important to know that they sustain childrens attention and may even give them a slight boost in ability to undertake other tasks  She added In this very complex area there are clearly still more questions to answer but we are providing some evidence to counter the supposed harm that comes from the increasing pace of technology for young children  The research is presented at the British Psychological Societys developmental psychology section annual conference in Amsterdam
