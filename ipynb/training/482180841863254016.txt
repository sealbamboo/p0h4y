The announcement that popular overthecounter acne treatments can cause rare but lifethreatening reactions sure got our attention Who among us hasnt slathered that stuff on our face The  include throat tightness shortness of breath wheezing low blood pressure fainting and collapse Hives and swelling of body parts where the products were not applied were also reported And  percent of the people affected were sick enough to be hospitalized To find out more we talked with   deputy director of the Food and Drug Administrations office of new drugs This is an edited version of our chat These were overthecounter products Companies were not required to report adverse reactions to overthecounter medicines until  Sometimes they would but mostly they wouldnt Nonetheless we had a big spike most of the cases came in  and were not sure why that was And some of these adverse reactions are very serious We have  reports from consumers and manufacturers  percent of them were people who required hospitalization Thats a lot Thats when the patient had a serious systemic probably allergic reaction It can be something that can be life threatening but there were no deaths thank goodness The others were more local things almost like a severe burn where the medication was placed It can be something that can be life threatening no deaths thank goodness No we dont One of the problems is that consumers use lots of these products and sometimes they use multiple ones or they are confused about which ones they use One of the reasons that were issuing this communication is that topically applied acne products currently dont include warnings to consumers about the possibility of these serious reactions If you experience a serious reaction you should stop using any topical acne product and get medical attention Some of the products have a section on their label that recommends first testing the product on a small area of skin Were encouraging all companies to include that We dont know if its these chemicals or something else in the products Anything that you put on the skin can irritate the skin and theres always going to be the occasional person who reacts for reasons we dont understand Caution is the name of the game Dont assume theyre innocuous Theyre medicines Theyre drugs They deserve to be taken seriously
