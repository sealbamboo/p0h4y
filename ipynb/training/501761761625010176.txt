Fowler said her team has worked hard to implement the new guidelines which are entering a third school year this fall The ultimate goal is to reduce childhood obesity which according to the   has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in  years Gone are the days of mystery meats and grilled cheese on white bread Instead participating schools in the federal lunch program are required to serve skim or lowfat milk add more whole grains include a fruit and vegetable at each meal and prepare food with zero grams of trans fat per serving Calorie and sodium limitations are also in place With onethird of American children obese or overweight members in both parties agreed that Americans tax dollars should fund healthy and wholesome food said Kevin Concannon the US Department of Agricultures undersecretary for food nutrition and consumer services  About  of schools are now in compliance with the new guidelines   with students eating about  more vegetables and  more fruit on a daily basis But theres been controversy over the programs implications for school food budgets  The USDA says  nationwide are eating federal school lunches since the guidelines were enacted in   either by personal choice or because their schools have opted out of the lunch program altogether What it really comes down to experts say is money Wealthier school districts can turn down federal reimbursements if their students arent enjoying the healthier fare Districts with more students who qualify for the program such as in Gainesville often dont have a choice Established in  the  was created to provide free or lowcost meals to students Although the program is optional in most states the federal reimbursement for students meals is so significant that some schools find it too expensive to run programs on their own said Diane PrattHeavner director of media relations at the School Nutrition Association a national organization of school nutrition professionals The School Nutrition Association was instrumental in helping the Obama administration put these new nutrition guidelines in place   for schools to be allowed to opt out Opponents say food companies are working behind the scenes trying to keep their lesshealthy items on the menu longer The  schools in the continental US  per lunch for students who pay full price For students in need the USDA pays almost  times more  for those who qualify for reduced price meals and  for children who qualify for a free lunch  It isnt surprising then that state agencies reported to the USDA that students leaving the program were mainly from residential child care institutions wealthier districts andor smaller schools with low percentages of children eligible for free and reducedprice meals Fort Thomas Independent Schools in Kentucky is one such district that decided to opt out for the  academic year The local high school was losing students to its rivals Subway and a handful of convenience stores down the street With an open campus students can leave for lunch and administrators say the daily exodus increased after new nutritional guidelines went into effect two years ago This meant less money being spent in the cafeteria The guidelines are too strict and the kids can leave said Gina Sawma the school districts food and nutrition director If they arent eating with us theyre leaving and eating junk Sawma says the biggest challenges were the calorie and sodium restrictions required by the federal program The students wanted more protein and larger portions especially athletes The school has a robust   that has won  Kentucky state championships  Douglas County High School in Colorado and Burnt HillsBallston Lake Board of Education in upstate New York also have called it quits   burdensome regulations hungry children and a decline in food sales that led to large amounts of debt Like Fort Thomas these school districts are in areas with relatively   and have a low percentage of students who qualify for free or reduced meals  Schools that predominantly serve lowincome students have fared better in both revenue gains and participation according to the USDA Since they are unable to opt out of the program and students cant afford to eat elsewhere cafeteria workers are making the new rules work The   which has one the highest concentrations of lowincome students in California is an example Since the nutrition guidelines were established there has been a   of participation in its school lunch program For some schools labor and food costs and the quality of kitchen equipment can play a role in whether their revamped food program is a success says PrattHeavner Schools in small and rural areas may also have local vendors and distributors that dont carry a great deal of healthy food options Sawma in Kentucky for example found that foods that met the new dietary guidelines from her vendors didnt taste all that great  She says companies are trying but may just need more time to reformulate their foods so they taste better  Its important to keep in mind that all school meal programs are different PrattHeavner explained Some communities have an easier time if students are more familiar with healthy foods at home Most students seem to be liking the healthier lunches despite some early negative feedback  A  published in the Childhood Obesity journal reported that  of elementary school children  of middle schoolers and  of high school students liked their schools meals And schools opting out of the federal lunch program arent necessarily serving unhealthy fare In the Fort Thomas district Sawma said schools will continue to serve extra fruits and vegetables at no charge and add back larger portions of protein and the popular homemade soups which had to be discontinued due to the National School Lunch Programs calorie restrictions  She said she has received calls from vendors selling unhealthy foods after the school district announced it was leaving the federal program but she made it clear her schools have always offered healthy foods Soft drinks and candy bars arent on the menu For those schools remaining in the National School Lunch Program the USDA is offering technical support help with recipes and financial assistance According to the USDA about  million in grants is still available to schools with lunch programs The USDA  continues to help schools by demonstrating  flexibility and common sense as we work together to improve the health of the nations next generation Concannon said  The department will continue to provide additional funding and training to schools as progress continues
