George Osborne has told the BBC he will put an extra bn into frontline health services across the UK The chancellor said the money was a down payment on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra bn a year above inflation by  He said he could make the commitment because the economy was strong Labour said the reorganisation of the NHS had created a crisis and accused Mr Osborne of making billions of pounds of unfunded spending commitments  Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra bn above Mr Osbornes plan adding that the NHS was in real crisis  Mr Osbornes pledge  to be officially announced in his Autumn Statement on Wednesday  comes after NHS England bosses warned of a need for an extra bn funding this year to cope with immediate unprecedented pressure on NHS budgets  The chancellor told BBC Ones Andrew Marr Show Because we have a strong economy and weve got the public finances under control we can afford to put  billion into the frontline of the NHS across the United Kingdom I can tell you we can go further and use those fines that have been paid by the banks for a permanent improvement in GP services This is a downpayment on the NHSs own longterm plan and it shows you can have a strong NHS if you have a strong economy Further details are expected on Wednesday when Mr Osborne will update Parliament on his tax and spending plans based on the latest predictions for the economy  He rejected claims public services would suffer if funding was cut further and said he would outline how the UK would stay the course to prosperity We shouldnt face this false choice of either bankrupting the country or having decent public services he said But he added that difficult decisions might lie ahead on welfare  possibly freezing working age benefits although he appeared to rule out cuts to pensioners benefits Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will make a statement on Monday in which he is expected to explain where the extra bn for the NHS is coming from   For months NHS leaders have been warning politicians about a growing shortfall in their budget Today the message from the chancellor was that hes heard their call So where will the money come from Of the bn  around bn of it is new money  the Treasury said it would be found from savings in other government departments The remaining m will come from the existing Department of Health budget and will be put into front line  The Liberal Democrats are keen to take credit saying theyve fought hard to secure it Labour say they want to go further and have pledged bn a year to be spent on the NHS on top of todays announcements paid for by a socalled mansion tax and other tax crackdowns NHS funding is going to be one of the key battlegrounds ahead of the next election but with figures due out this week expected to confirm that government borrowing is not coming down in line with the Treasurys plans all parties will face tough questions about how they can increase spending without increasing borrowing yet further  It is understood that around bn will go to NHS England with the remainder going to the devolved administrations if they wish to spend it on extra health resources And it is thought that bn will be spent over the next Parliament from fines levied on banks for their attempted manipulation of foreign exchange rates  Mr Hunt will also announce that the government is committed to implementing the fiveyear plan     unveiled by six national bodies last month Many of the measures put forward are designed to curb the rise in hospital admissions and the impact of the ageing population The plans involve increasing spending on the health service in England by bn a year in real terms by  Simon Stevens chief executive of NHS England who drew up the proposals said they had made the case to the chancellor that services were under pressure and genuine new investment was needed Of course there will still be pressures and difficult choices but the government has played its part and the NHS will step up and play our part too Today represents an extremely welcome voteofconfidence in the NHS own five year plan   Shadow chancellor Ed Balls blamed the Conservatives for causing a crisis in the NHS through its reorganisation and questioned whether the money would be an actual longterm investment in the nurses and doctors we need He said it was a typical Tory pattern of a winter crisis and crisis money coming after it Mr Balls said Labours proposed mansion tax on properties worth m and over would raise the money to invest bn over and above the governments spending plans into the health service although he later he told BBC Radio  Lives Pienaars Politics If he is doing it through a  cut in child benefit then I will have to think again Labour had called for an extra bn next year paid for by banking industry fines The Conservatives coalition partners the Liberal Democrats had called for an emergency injection of bn and a party spokesman said they had fought to make sure that extra funding for the NHS next year is in the Autumn Statement  The easy choice would have been to put off this decision until after the election for the next government to deal with but that would have betrayed patients The NHS needs this money urgently and we have acted in the national interest to make it a priority  Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank told the BBC that Mr Osborne would have to admit on Wednesday that the deficit would probably be a bit higher than had been predicted in March because of relatively poor earnings growth and other tax receipts He told BBCs Sunday Politics programme that by  there would have to be big cuts to other public services including local government and police
