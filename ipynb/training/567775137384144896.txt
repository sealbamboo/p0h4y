Los Angeles County leaders voted Tuesday to fully implement Lauras Law a state law that allows counties to pursue courtordered outpatient treatment for people with serious mental illness The law was recently adopted by San Francisco and Orange counties Los Angeles County launched a small program soon after Lauras Law took effect in  but the countys current program is purely voluntary The vote which will expand funding for outpatient treatment in the county will allow a family member treatment provider or law enforcement officer to ask a court to order someone to undergo treatment Patients however cant be forced to take medication The annual cost of the expanded program will be a little under  million but that is expected to be primarily covered by state mental health funds and MediCal Lauras Law has been praised by advocates who say it gives a new tool to family members of adults with severe untreated mental illness But it has also drawn opposition from civil liberties advocates and others who say courtordered treatment infringes on patients rights Both sides voiced their views to the supervisors Tuesday Brittney Weissman executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Los Angeles chapter told the supervisors Lauras Law helps very ill individuals  who often dont recognize that theyre sick  get well and stay in the community so that they can later continue in treatment on their own Others such as MarkAnthony Johnson of local advocacy group Dignity and Power Now cautioned the supervisors that the move could further criminalize those with mental illness Johnson said Lauras Law plays into the fear that folks with mental health conditions are violent people And he expressed concerns that people of color would be disproportionately targeted for courtordered treatment We dont want to go back to the day when people were institutionalized in a way that was very harmful to themselves and to us as a society she said County mental health officials said details of the court component of the law are still to be worked out but that the emphasis will remain on getting people to voluntarily engage in treatment
