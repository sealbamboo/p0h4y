The director-general of the World Health Organization warned Friday that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is spreading quickly and the consequences could be "catastrophic" if greater efforts to control the outbreak aren't put into place now.. "This outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it," Director-General Margaret Chan told the presidents of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Ivory Coast at a gathering in Conakry, the capital of Guinea.
