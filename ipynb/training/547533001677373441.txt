Could a springloaded fly swatter save NFL football players and Iraq war veterans from the effects of concussions and traumatic brain injuries Before you shrug off that question geneticist Barry Ganetzky at the University of WisconsinMadison medical school suggests you consider that   have already proved their worth in figuring out far more complex human neurological problems They have been used for study of learning and memory they have been used to study models of epilepsy they have been used to study circadian rhythm they have been used to study sleep and they have been used to study addiction Ganetzky said At a fundamental level a brain cell is a brain cell If theres some damage to it it shouldnt make any difference if that damage is occurring because its inside the head of a fly or inside the head of a human Fruit flies can be raised by the thousands and altered genetically They also live brief lives So figuring out what happens later in life amounts to days or a weeks Try doing concussion work with rodents which can amount to dropping weights on the heads of mice Those look like medieval torture by comparison Ganetzky offered By slapping springloaded vials of  against a foam pad and knocking the flies senseless Ganetzky and his colleagues believe they have found leads toward a biological marker for concussions and a path toward blocking degeneration of neurons that can cause symptoms of dementia Their results were published online Monday in the journal  Ganetzky who has studied the nerve cells of fruit flies for more than three decades said he was inspired to look at concussions after the suicide of retired San Diego Chargers linebacker Junior Seau whose brain tissue showed signs of a chronic traumatic encephalopathy a degenerative brain condition related to repetitive head injuries It occurred to Ganetzky that there wasnt a very good medical definition of concussion  doctors on the sidelines of Monday Night Football could look at a players pupils ask a few questions and use their best judgment Its symptomatic said Ganetzky Its not like you measure something Its not like diabetes or high blood pressure Then Ganetzky remembered his postdoctorate days at Caltech with genetics pioneer Seymour Benzer Ganetzky had slapped a vial of flies against his palm then watched the groggy flies slowly recover I thought this was an interesting curiosity but I didnt invest much in it he said But years later Im thinking thats exactly the definition of a concussion Ganetzky was wary that people would think he was nuts So he brought up the idea with his colleague David Wassarman His jaw just dropped Ganetzky said He said if youre not going to study that then I want to Thats when I knew we were onto something Wassarman insisted they forgo the palm slapping and build a machine After all laboratory science is about doing things that can be reproduced reliably and be measured Wassarman constructed a device that hurled a vial of flies at  mph delivering  newtons of force Thats about the grip of a nurse taking your pulse but it wacks the heck out of flies Besides finding that age at the time of injury and the number of injuries correlate with the risk of neurodegeneration researchers discovered that concussion activated innate immune responses similar to those in humans Those responses have been linked to degenerative disorders in the brain By looking at  genetic lines of flies the researchers also found that both the threshold for death and the longevity of swatted flies was linked to certain genes that have an equivalent in human cells If we can really validate this as an appropriate model for humans we can now start to screen for drugs that might block damage said Ganetzky We can begin to look for diagnostic markers where you can actually measure something and not just say Whos the president and when were you born
