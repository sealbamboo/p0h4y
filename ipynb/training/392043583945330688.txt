Doctors dont hide cancer from their patients as they did with   But sometimes patients feel compelled to keep all or a part of their diagnosis to themselves Last week   admitted that he downgraded his potentially disfiguring tongue cancer to the more publicly palatable throat cancer Other celebrities like the late   keep their diagnoses entirely under wraps Cancer patients cant do much about mutating cells  or the myriad pokes prods and procedures they go through during treatment But they can control the messaging experts say deciding whether their cancer is common knowledge or a wellmanaged secret I think control is an important issue says Julie Schnur a clinical psychologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City But there are a ton of reasons why people choose to keep their cancer to themselves Sometimes for instance its just good business I didnt want my clients to perceive me as incapacitated and jump ship says Melanie Young a yearold breast cancer survivor who ran a Manhattan public relations firm at the time of her diagnosis I needed to earn a steady income to pay the bills which piled up during treatment Young told her immediate family her friends and her staff but didnt share her  diagnosis double mastectomy reconstruction or even chemotherapy with a single client or colleague When I finally outed my cancer diagnosis in  the reactions ranged widely says Young who   about her experience Most were supportive but there were a few clients who drifted away In Schnurs experience people who tell their colleagues what theyre going through are often pleasantly surprised by the show of support But compartmentalizing cancer can also be a comfort Sometimes work is a respite a place you can go and just be yourself and do your job she says In a way its an escape Catherine a yearold Seattle breast cancer survivor who asked that her last name not be used told friends and family about her diagnosis surgery and treatment but kept it from everyone but her boss and HR representative when it came to work She didnt want to be thought of as the cancer patient I didnt want to be judged by my cancer she says I wanted to be normal somewhere in my life I hear that a lot says Schnur Women will say I didnt want to be cancer girl I didnt want to be the sick person and have people ask How   you and do that sympathetic head nod Other patients keep mum because theyre worried about how loved ones will react Theyre worried it might be a burden to others or they wont be able to handle it says Schnur I hear that a lot with women who dont want to tell their elderly parents Its a legitimate concern A   found many were thrust into the role of caretaker for emotionally overwhelmed friends and family Some people are good judges of who can or cant handle what says Schnur I dont think secret keeping is always a bad thing And there are levels of secret keeping Some people never share their diagnosis Others share it but never show up without a wig Its how you feel comfortable and how you want to be seen But Sue Harden a Los Angelesbased clinical psychologist and cancer survivor herself cautions that secret cancer can be a doubleedged sword If youre a private person you arent going to be asked a lot of questions she says But patients may not be able to get the support they need And they could get negative judgment because people dont know whats happening Harden lived this herself after being diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma at  While family and friends knew of her disease others simply came to their own conclusions about what was going on with her health I was going to high school and it was a small town she says When I went through treatment I didnt lose my hair but I got down to like  pounds People thought I had anorexia  Patients who keep their diagnosis to themselves may also find it challenging when they finally do spill their cancer beans  their friends and family may not understand why they werent told Its a good question especially when so many people are as Young puts it turning their cancer into a reality show or story with videos and blogs Mandi Hudson a yearold marketing maven from Salt Lake City uses Twitter Facebook and other social media tools to keep her loved ones up to speed on her breast cancer But she admits to mixed feelings about her transparency I still battle with it sometimes she says People have told me that Im not making a wise choice by tying my name to cancer that people wont want to hire me And Ive thought about deleting my blog But cancer is part of who I am Im not going to pretend I dont have it Hudson admits her awesome support system often outweighs her desire for privacy When I became the mayor of the cancer center on FourSquare my friends were really upset she says And they were really happy when I was usurped They were like Yes finally Secret cancer Facebook cancer compartmentalized cancer  experts say its ultimately up to the patient as to how they want to handle their disease Theres no right answer says Harden Everybody has to make their own decision as to what feels right to them and what doesnt But cancer isnt something to be ashamed of and nobody should feel that If somebody makes you feel that way thats their issue Gaining support is not a bad thing And asking for support shows strength not weakness
