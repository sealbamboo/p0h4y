When Gina Poe lost her mom to breast cancer she was devastated Michal Poe a yearold home hospice social worker had been the rock of the family carrying on with humor and strength even as her disease became more advanced After her death in February though Gina discovered her mother wasnt just the rock of the Poe family she was also a loved and celebrated member of a virtual family of advanced breast cancer patients from around the world who talked daily on the website Inspirecom Now Gina has embraced the family she didnt even know existed She even invited them to attend her moms celebration of life service on yesterday  delayed at her mothers request until spring when the flowers would be out  and livestreamed video for the online group members who couldnt come in person A lot of them said theyd like to watch They are wonderful people says Gina  a yearold neuroscience professor from Ann Arbor Mich who is in regular email contact with some of them and has met one in person  Gina stumbled upon her moms other family when she signed on to Inspirecoms advanced breast cancer forum to share the news of her moms passing The sentiments members shared about her mom were so poignant she realized immediately the huge impact Michal must have had in their lives Michal was gifted in so many ways a yearold member from Iowa wrote on the sites In Memoriam section Her words were comforting or funny or informative or loving She made a big difference in this world Her positive and witty comments are what kept me coming back to this site when I was desperately looking for someones upbeat spin on this terrible disease wrote another member from Virginia For Gina the words and stories from this loving community helped assuage the pain of her moms passing It was wonderful to hear these womens reactions as to how they were affected by my mothers life she says It made the mourning and grief more of a community process It shared the burden Gina says being in contact with several of the women has given her some added insight into her moms final months  It was great to know that she had been with these people daily online while she was going through all of these trials and tribulations Gina says She loved helping so I knew she was helping them too and that made her life feel more worthwhile By all accounts Michal Poe who went by the screen name Fragilistic or Frag had a sparkling wit and upbeat energy that made her connect with people instantly Her daughter says shed often strike up conversations with strangers and within five minutes would know their most intimate secrets So its not surprising shes sorely missed by both of her families   Frag had the sweetest face says Anne Loeser a yearold retired software development project manager from Salt Lake City who met Michal on Inspirecom a year and a half ago Just the kind of face that you smile when you see it I started reading her posts and what struck me was their timbre She was candid about herself but always in a very positive way Even if she had something to rail against she would interject humor That humor and heart came through during the service Saturday which Loeser watched by livestream There were many smiles and much laughter she said If someone was going through something shed be right there trying to help as many of us do said Loeser But there was something about the quality of her words that really resonated Diagnosed at age  with an aggressive triple negative breast cancer Michal had a mastectomy followed by chemotherapy followed by breast reconstruction After that her daughter says she went to work on her bucket list Having that first serious illness put a fire under her says Gina She started doing a lot of things shed always wanted to do like learning ventriloquism She had a dummy and even performed at Christmas parties It was highly entertaining Michal also started writing  funny andor poignant limericks that she shared with her breast cancer buddies on Inspirecom  as well as short stories based on her years as a hospice worker Unfortunately after four cancerfree years Michal was faced with another diagnosis in the summer of  her cancer had metastasized to her lungs sternum and rib cage Michal went through another round of chemotherapy and participated in a number of clinical trials She also moved to Ann Arbor to be closer to her family Heather Greenwood a yearold hairdresser from Newcastle Australia with Stage IV breast cancer says Frags humor is what she remembers most about her online friend I always found Michals wisdom and insights spot on however her humor is what often buoyed me the most she says recalling the first time Michal commented on one of her posts a Just for Laughs list that included items like The best way to forget your troubles is to wear tight shoes In response Michal shared one of her favorite cancer jokes Cancer schmancer as long as you got your health Mindy Greenstein a psychooncologist author and breast cancer survivor from New York says friendships with other cancer survivors  online or off  can be incredibly important There havent been a lot of studies on this but for me the relationships are invaluable she says Both for support and information These cyberfriends are real friends who get us through terrible times and we can feel even closer to them than people around us We tell each other things we might not tell other people and we can often help each other in ways the people around us cant help because they dont understand what were going through as well For Gina knowing that her mother had such love and support from a group of virtual strangers  and also that she touched them  makes her own grief a bit more bearable Its nice to know they had been there for her all that time and made her life better says Gina I think when youre facing something so devastating its really good to know your life counts for something that it will matter in the long run and make a difference
