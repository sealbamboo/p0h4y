Earlier Thursday Kesselly told CNN that the authority will seek to prosecute if Duncan lied on his health screening questionnaire before leaving West Africa Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told Canadian public broadcaster CBC on Thursday that she would consult with lawyers to decide what to do with Duncan when he returns home The fact that he knew he was exposed to the virus and he left the country is unpardonable quite frankly Johnson Sirleaf told CBC I just hope that nobody else gets infected With the US doing so much to help us fight Ebola and again one of our compatriots didnt take due care and so hes gone there and  put some Americans in a state of fear and put them at some risk and so I feel very saddened by that and very angry with him to tell you the truth Duncans family said he hadnt mentioned any exposure to Ebola in Liberia His girlfriend  with anyone with Ebola Wilfred Smallwood Duncans halfbrother said Thursday that he doesnt believe Duncan knew he had Ebola when he left Liberia for the United States But he said it isnt out of the ordinary to come to the assistance of suffering people Asked about whether Duncan had contact with Ebola patients he said its what we do in Liberia  our tradition is to help somebody who needs help The health questionnaire typically contains questions about the passengers recent contact with Ebola patients Passengers also are asked whether theyve experienced any symptoms consistent with Ebola such as vomiting diarrhea or joint pain in the past couple of days  Duncan was screened three times before he boarded his flight in Liberia to Brussels Kesselly said  The first screening was at the gate before you get to the parking lot The second time is before you enter the terminal building and the third is before you board the flight At every point your temperature is scanned His temperature at those checkpoints was a consistent  degrees Fahrenheit Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief Thomas Frieden told reporters Thursday Basically he didnt have a fever Frieden said noting that the Ebola patients temperature was taken by a trained CDC health care worker with a thermometer approved by the Food and Drug Administration Kesselly said airport authority would seek to prosecute Duncan if it is determined that he made a false declaration during the health screening questionnaire  We cannot make the Ebola risk zero until the outbreak is controlled in West Africa said Frieden He went on to say that isolating West African countries completely through travel restrictions would make it more difficult to assist in controlling the outbreak and would eventually put the United States at greater risk Duncan is in serious condition at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital So far no one who had contact with Duncan has shown any indication of having contracted Ebola Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins told reporters Thursday Smallwood said that when Duncan first visited Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital neither Duncan nor the hospital knew then that he had Ebola This was Duncans first time in the United States Smallwood said The Liberian national was visiting his son and his sons mother in Dallas Smallwood said  The partner of Duncan has been quarantined in her Dallas apartment where Duncan became sick with the virus the woman told CNNs Anderson Cooper The woman who asked to be identified only by her first name Louise is quarantined with one of her children who is younger than  and two nephews in their s The four of them were in the apartment when Duncan became ill Cooper said  Louise and her family are in   Cooper said Louise did use bleach to clean her apartment but its not clear to me how systematic the cleaning was he said Authorities are working to find more suitable living arrangements for the family Jenkins said Health officials are reaching out to as many as  people who may have had contact with Duncan a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of State Health Services said Thursday These are people who are still being questioned because they may have crossed paths with the patient either at the hospital at his apartment complex or in the community  Out of an abundance of caution were starting with this very wide net including people who have had even brief encounters with the patient or the patients home spokeswoman Carrie Williams said The number will drop as we focus in on those whose contact may represent a potential risk of infection The number of direct contacts who have been identified and are being monitored right now is more than  a federal official told CNN on Thursday By the end of the day we should have a pretty good idea of how many contacts there are the official said  Being monitored means a public health worker visits twice a day to take the contacts temperature and ask them if they are experiencing any symptoms None of the people being monitored has so far shown symptoms Most are not being quarantined though Dallas County health officials have ordered four close relatives of the patient to stay home and not have any visitors until at least October  The family was having some challenges following the directions to stay home so were taking every precaution Texas Department of Health spokeswoman Carrie Williams said about why the state had issued a legal order  Two things are still spreading in Dallas fear and frustration  Some parents are scared to take their kids to the schools that his girlfriends children attended Attendance at those schools Thursday was down to about  on Thursday said Mike Miles superintendent of the Dallas Independent School District  Custodians are stepping up cleanup work at the schools he said We dont think theres any virus at any of those buildings but well take that off the table so were doing extra cleaning and disinfecting Miles said Others are upset at the hospital where Duncan first sought care which sent him home and raised the possibility he could infect others for at least two additional days  US President Barack Obama contacted Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings on Thursday to make sure Dallas was getting the federal resources it needs to treat the patient safely and control this case so that it does not spread widely the White House said  On September  four days after he arrived in Dallas from Liberia Duncan started feeling symptoms That day is significant because thats when he started being contagious  Late the following night he went to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas with a lowgrade fever and abdominal pain the hospital said Duncan told a nurse he had been in Africa  But regretfully that information was not fully communicated throughout the full team said Dr Mark Lester executive vice president of Texas Health Resources Duncan was sent home with painkillers and antibiotics only to return in worse condition on September  Thats when he was isolated It was a mistake They dropped the ball Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said of the miscommunication at the hospital You dont want to pile on them but hopefully this will never happen again  The CDC has been vigorously emphasizing the need for a travel history  prevented doctors from seeing Duncans travel history even though he shared it on his first visit to the hospital  Duncan told a nurse hed been in Africa but that information was entered into a document that isnt automatically visible to physicians Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas said in a statement Thursday  After discovering this the hospital says it has changed the system so doctors and nurses will see travel history documentation  We feel that this change will improve the early identification of patients who may be at risk for communicable diseases including Ebola the hospital said The hospital released a detailed description of what it said was the chain of events when Duncan first came to the hospital on September  In the interest of transparency and because we want other US hospitals and providers to learn from our experience we are with Mr Duncans permission releasing this information the hospital said  Nurses and doctors at the hospital followed protocols the hospital said When Mr Duncan was asked if he had been around anyone who had been ill the statement said he said that he had not
