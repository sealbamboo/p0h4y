People are floored when they see me Ianuale said They all say I dont even look like the same person At her heaviest Ianuale weighed  pounds At foot that made her body mass index   clinically extremely obese Today she weighs a healthy  pounds I was embarrassed by the way I looked she admitted When my husband introduced me to people I felt bad because I wasnt that pretty or thin of a wife even though he loves me for who I am and didnt care what I looked like   I always thought people were judging me especially when I would walk into places So how did she lose  pounds And would her secrets work for you  She started by cutting back on her portion sizes I always used to eat until I was feeling uncomfortably full she said I just lessened my portions to normal consumption paying attention to labels but not counting calories  She didnt go to the gym at first she started at home on the exercise bike and elliptical She started working out  to  minutes six days a week I was losing  pounds a month in the beginning she said As I had less and less to lose it got harder So she upped her game She signed up for a local gym and began strength training My goal was to lose half said Ianuale I almost made it there So now its basically maintaining Ill go up or down a few Ive put on a lot of muscle weightlifting at the gym She plans to stay around  to  pounds Today Ianuale goes to the gym six days a week She runs between  and  miles a night and does  to  minutes of weight training I do upper body work then the next night lower body Her husband Nino was persuaded to join her at the gym Also new to exercise he has since lost  pounds She hit the ground running when she decided shed finally had enough and hasnt looked back since he said I had anticipated that she might quit or lighten the load  Instead she got more intense Its really amazing to see her go through her change Not long ago Ianuale started using a juice blender drinking  ounces of juice every day which she says is a major part of her weightloss program Her drinks vary but typically she juices frozen blueberries lemons kale spinach pineapple flax seeds broccoli and carrots Once she got her food portions under control she started adding more fruits and vegetables and protein at dinner Ianuale stays away from processed foods altogether  I dont eat greasy foods or junk food  my stomach cant handle that anymore she said But she isnt on her diet every day Fridays my cheat day  I dont go overboard with cheating but thats my day She usually gets a weekly latte and goes out for a nice dinner still eating somewhat healthy with a salad or a protein with a vegetable side dish And the occasional ice cream After all of this weight loss Ianuale feels amazing I feel like I can do anything she said I have never been this weight or close to it before in my adult life This is not a diet its a life change This is my new lifestyle and I will never go back
