Good morning, everyone, and how are you today? A warm and shiny sun is enveloping the Pharmalot campus, where the shortest of short people has left the building and the official mascots are snoozing away. As for us, we are fending off a stubbornly scratchy throat, which calls for a few cups of stimulation. But we are adding a twist by favoring Earl Gray tea today, along with a dab of honey, of course. Feel free to join us. Meanwhile, here are some tidbits. Hope you have a smashing day and stay well…. Bio-Rad Laboratories agreed to pay $55 million to settle U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission foreign bribery investigations; Stryker agreed to pay about $1 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed over its Rejuvenate and ABGII hip implants, which the device maker had recalled in 2012; and Allergan, which has been fighting an unsolicited takeover bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals for six months, disclosed in a regulatory filing that another company is interested in buying it.
