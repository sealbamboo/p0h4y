Good morning everyone and how are you today A warm and shiny sun is enveloping the Pharmalot campus where the shortest of short people has left the building and the official mascots are snoozing away As for us we are fending off a stubbornly scratchy throat which calls for a few cups of stimulation But we are adding a twist by favoring Earl Gray tea today along with a dab of honey of course Feel free to join us Meanwhile here are some tidbits Hope you have a smashing day and stay well BioRad Laboratories agreed to pay  million to settle US Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission foreign bribery investigations Stryker agreed to pay about  billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed over its Rejuvenate and ABGII hip implants which the device maker had recalled in  and Allergan which has been fighting an unsolicited takeover bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals for six months disclosed in a regulatory filing that another company is interested in buying it
