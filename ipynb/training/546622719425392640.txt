Im a proud nurse from a proud family of nurses yet I would never claim that a layperson would enjoy watching mainstream medical dramas with us We end up yelling at the screen There is nothing about that sexy getup that remotely resembles a nursing uniform and Doctors dont fire nurses nurse managers fire nurses and No emergency room nurse would ever have to be told by a doctor to start CPR So when the Baymax the nurserobot in the hit Disney movie   turned out to be reasonable competent and not dressed in fishnet stockings I was thrilled You know your profession has an image problem when you point to a balloonish animated robot doll and say Yes thats good That accurately reflects what I do on a daily basis More representations like that please Baymax might not look like any nurses you know but unlike most nurse characters in the media he actually provides nursing care He assesses the health condition of his charge the boygenius Hiro makes recommendations related to his health and teaches him about his neurochemical processes Once Hiro reprograms Baymax with fighting capabilities Baymax becomes Hiros terrifying defender If youve ever heard a nurse on the phone with an insurance company insisting that a patient get needed care paid for you know this is not a misplaced metaphor Contrast this with the Nurse Dawn character in the HBO comedy   She has sex with a new nurse manager within hours of meeting him doesnt seem to notice when a patient dies cowers submissively in front of even the most incompetent doctors and never seems to provide any actual nursing care because she is too busy with selfcreated drama and paperwork Or the Nurse Beverly character in Foxs comedy   She is fired from an office medical practice for incompetence breaks a doctors nose in angry response and when she is rehired in a clerical position expresses relief that she finally has a job where she doesnt have to wash her hands Or the nurses in the Fox medical drama   Rather than being sexually inappropriate or incompetent these nurses all seem to be on a serieslong coffee break It is the doctors who are shown providing nursing care starting IVs doing patient teaching negotiating complicated family dynamics at the bedside Even when nurses are shown to be competent compassionate patientfocused experts like Jackie Peyton the main character in Showtimes   the creators arent satisfied with the lifeanddeath drama of a highlevel trauma center in a huge city The nurse character has to be an unethical lying stealing not quiteinrecovery drug addict as well The argument could be made that its the job of Hollywood to create fiction of all the professions and that popular culture gets everything about health care wrong Certainly examples of this exist the new Fox teen drama   is populated by exceedingly healthy looking extremely attractive gravely ill teenagers who live for months in hospital rooms the size of twobedroom apartments for no other apparent reason than to make it more convenient for them to kiss each other Any scenes in which the dying but randy teens are portrayed interacting with medical care one patient is shown receiving dialysis for liver failure are so ludicrous that it makes you wonder if the procedure for the shows writers is to ask their medical adviser how something might accurately be conveyed and then write the exact opposite But even though this is just entertainment the stakes for the future of nursing are high   that Americans believe what TV shows say about medical care and health policy For  years the nonprofit advocacy organization Truth About Nursing has been researching and documenting nurse representations in popular culture and has   the vast gap between what skilled nurses really do and what the public thinks they do is a fundamental factor underlying most of the more immediate apparent causes of the nursing shortage including understaffing poor work conditions and inadequate resources for nursing research and education This is bad news for nurses but worse news for patients Nurses make the difference in good health care   rate as well as the   When nurses show more signs of burnout related to understaffing  And theres the hardtoquantify but essential benefit of being cared for When I was in the hospital this past January after a lifethreatening complication of kneereplacement surgery I woke up one night in pain and unable to figure out how to move within the many drains tubes and wires attached to or inserted in my body I muttered an expletive and from around the corner a nurse appeared Im right here she said Even before she started to untangle my IV and troubleshoot better pain management my panic was instantly calmed Baymaxs programming wont allow him to disengage until the patient has answered Are you satisfied with your care in the affirmative This is inconvenient for the characters in an action adventure movie but its a good question to ask in a hospital If youre satisfied with your care you may well have a nurse to thank
