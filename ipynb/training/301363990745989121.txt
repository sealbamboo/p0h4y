  Talk about navelgazing Since February a group of scientists at North Carolina State University has been studying the   that inhabit our belly buttons as part of a study called the Belly Button Biodiversity project Sounds like an odd research project but the belly button is the ideal location to study germs says Jiri Hulcr PhD a postdoctoral research assistant who is heading the project Were trying to educate the public about the role bacteria play in our world says Dr Hulcr Bacteria are always present on our skin and in our bodies In fact there are many many more bacterial cells on and in our bodies than actual human cells Each person carries about  trillion microbes the human body contains about  trillion cells Unlike such body parts as the nose or armpits the navel doesnt secrete anything Also since most people tend to ignore their belly buttons  after all you dont scrub or   it like you do your face  navel bacteria tend to be untouched Believe it or not the belly button serves as a good representation of the types of bacteria found on the body Hulcr says The scientists so far have collected nearly  samples from belly buttons on cotton swabs and posted magnified images of each persons microbes on their Wildlife of Your Body Web site You dont need to be a biologist to notice that the cultures vary greatly from person to person So what types of bacteria inhabit our belly buttons All kinds says Hulcr although his team has mostly found two common skin bacteria Streptococcus and Staphylococcus which he says are for the most part friendly We absolutely need bacteria in order to survive he says Its like asking an animal who lives in a forest if he needs the trees The presence of bacteria is not harmful  its only under certain conditions when these bacteria can be potentially unhealthy like if someone has lowered immunity or a skin injury like a sunburn The takeaway Dont be freaked out by your belly button germs We asked Hulcr and other experts to tell us everything you never knew about your navel Here the top seven fascinating finds Learn more in the Everyday Health
