I was living a bachelor lifestyle says McLaughlin I would eat and drink a lot which played havoc with the weight He tried The Atkins Diet and Weight Watchers but nothing seemed to click  He watched as his mother lost  pounds on a diet program called   which advocates dieting without deprivation of the foods you like And he saw his girlfriend shed  pounds on Weight Watchers  Seeing living proof that people can lose weight inspired him to make some changes of his own  It was tough to stop going out to eat for lunch and dinner McLaughlin says He used to go out with his coworker a couple of times a week and indulge in a halfdozen strong cocktails before and after lavish threecourse meals   Id usually have an appetizer of cured meats the largest available steak or a rack of lamb for mains a side of vegetables sauted in butter or oil rich desserts like molten chocolate lava cake or chocolate ganache and a cheese board with dessert wine to finish says McLaughlin Between the two of them McLaughlin says they would split three bottles of wine with dinner I cant remember a meal where I walked away not feeling completely stuffed to the point of almost being sick he says Dinner and drinks used to add up to  calories alone Now he follows the Slimming World plan and prepares his meals at home They usually consist of fruit and either chicken rubbed with dry spices or fillet and broccoli or cauliflower When he does eat out he chooses carefully  I love the dining experience and social aspect says McLaughlin But I realize a  or ounce filet is more than enough now  He also tries to skip cocktail hour  Now I tend to drink wine only and I enjoy and savor the taste instead of just drinking for the sake and experience McLaughlin says  McLaughlins girlfriend Allison Dressler says she found it hard to cook in the beginning of their relationship due to their different diet meal plans She followed Weight Watchers which focuses on a point system to limit calories For Slimming World McLaughlin would worry about every drop of oil butter or cooking spray because those were restricted under the diet plan  As we cooked more and more we realized a lot of the things he eats are actually good for me says Dressler And a lot of things I eat arent that bad for him either  Neither Dressler nor McLaughlin have gym memberships they simply walk a few miles a couple of days of the week McLaughlin didnt want to drastically change his workout plan because he feared he wouldnt be able to stay motivated Its hard to go to the gym after work he says I really wanted to focus on controlling my eating habits more than anything  That strategy worked In the last three years McLaughlin has lost  pounds McLaughlin now goes to work more than two hours earlier than he used to and finishes earlier which has increased his productivity  I dont feel that constant sluggish feeling anymore he says His energy has also increased dramatically he no longer lies in bed watching The Food Network until the afternoon When he first moved to New York his only hobby was eating and drinking  now he spends his weekends researching farmers markets to visit chili festivals wine stores and fruitpicking spots The couple recently went on vacation and chose to walk to their terminal rather than take the moving pavements like they use to  Dressler says its these small changes that make the biggest differences A lot of my life still revolves around food and drink but its no longer destructive says McLaughlin
