As a clinical psychologist and sleep researcher at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University Kelly Glazer BaronÂ frequently heard complaints from aggrieved patients about exercise They would work out they told her sometimes to the point of exhaustion but they would not sleep better that night  Dr Baron was surprised and perplexed A fan of exercise for treating sleep problems but also a scientist she decided to examine more closely the daytoday relationship between sweat and sleep  What she and her colleagues found according to a study   is that the influence of daily exercise on sleep habits is more convoluted than many of us might expect and that in the short term sleep might have more of an impact on exercise than exercise has on sleep  To reach that conclusion Dr Baron and her colleagues turned to data from a study of exercise and sleep originally   For that experiment researchers had gathered a small group of women and one man who had received diagnoses of insomnia The volunteers were mostly in their s and all were sedentary  Then the researchers randomly assigned their volunteers either to remain inactive or to begin a moderate endurance exercise program consisting of three or four minute exercise sessions a week generally on a stationary bicycle or treadmill that were performed in the afternoon This exercise program continued for  weeks At the end of that time the volunteers in the exercise group were sleeping much more soundly than they had been at the start of the study They slept on average about  minutes to an hour longer on most nights waking up less often and reporting more vigor and less sleepiness  But Dr Baron wondered if the novice exercisers had experienced immediate improvements in their sleep patterns And on a daytoday basis had working out on any given day produced better sleep that night  Boring deep into the data contained in the exercising groups sleep diaries and other information for the new study Dr Baron discovered that the answer to both questions was a fairly resounding no After the first two months of their exercise program the exercising volunteers all of them women were sleeping no better than at the start of the study Only after four months of the program had their insomnia improved  They also rarely reported sleeping better on those nights when they had had an exercise session And perhaps most telling they almost always exercised for a shorter amount of time on the days after a poor nights sleep  In other words sleeping badly tended to shorten the next days workout while a fulllength exercise session did not in most cases produce more and better sleep that night  At first glance these results might seem a bit discouraging Dr Baron said They also would seem to be at odds with the earlier conclusion that four months of exercise improved insomniacs sleep patterns as well as a wealth of other recent science that has typically found that regular exercise lengthens and deepens sleep  But Dr Baron pointed out most of these other studies employed volunteers without existing sleep problems For them exercise and sleep seem to have a relatively uncomplicated relationship You work out fatigue your body and mind and sleep more soundly that night  But people with insomnia and other sleep disturbances tend to be neurologically different Dr Baron said They have what we characterize as a hyperarousal of the stress system she said A single bout of exercise on any given day is probably not enough to overcome that arousal she explained It could potentially even exacerbate it since exercise is itself a physical stressor  Eventually however if the exercise program is maintained Dr Baron said the workouts seem to start muting a persons stress response Her or his underlying physiological arousal is dialed down enough for sleep to arrive more readily as it did in the  experiment  Of course both of these studies were small involving fewer than a dozen exercising volunteers all of them middleaged or older women We think the findings would apply equally to men Dr Baron said But that idea has yet to be proved  Likewise it is impossible to yet know the sleeprelated impacts of workouts of different types like weight training intensities or timing including morning or lateevening sessions  Still the preliminary message of these findings is heartening If you habitually experience insomnia and dont currently exercise Dr Baron said start Dont however expect that you will enjoy or even complete workouts the day after a broken nights sleep or that you will sleep better hours after youve exercised  The process is more gradual and less immediately gratifying than the sleepdeprived might wish But the benefits do develop It took four months in the original study Dr Baron said but at that point the exercising volunteers were sleeping at least  minutes more a night Thats huge as good as or better than most current treatment options for sleep disturbances including drugs she said
