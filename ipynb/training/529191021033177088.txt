Reality if you think about it is a kind of social contract You and I might be strangers but we agree at least at a really basic level on what is real So when you talk to someone who isnt signed onto that same contract its kind of unsettling What do the gloves do Im asking a guy named George about the thin plastic hospital gloves he was wearing when we met Its so the cosmic dust doesnt get on my hands is his reply I met George at the Citywide Mental Health Center in San Franciscos tenderloin district Its the type of place where men wearing unseasonable winter parkas loiter around the entrance smoking cigarettes The clinic let me come in and talk to its clients on the condition that I wont use their last names Staff there says that part of looking out for their patients best interests is protecting their privacy  something thats also required under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act    George was upstairs in a computer room Hes in his s with neatly combed hair and faded tattoos on his forearms And when I spoke to him he told me he saw flashes of light coming from my mouth It looks like yellow with light pinkish color When I asked him if hes always seen colors when people speak he told me he has and that seeing the colors helps him understand life and makes him feel superior Im not proud of it but this conversation made me uncomfortable It was something about the particular way that George drifted back and forth between delusions and reality that was unsettling And thats partly why when antipsychotic drugs were invented in the s they seemed revolutionary Up until that point the treatments for schizophrenia were pretty draconian says   a psychiatrist and researcher at the San Francisco VA Medical Center Wrapping them in wet towels locking them in a padded cell frontal lobotomies if the behavior was really out of control she says So when antipsychotic medications did evolve and they did reduce psychotic symptoms it was like the heavens had opened Antipsychotic   are good at tamping down the kinds of symptoms that scare people  those strange beliefs and visions And to be clear for a lot of people this is a lifesaver But for others the drugs dont work that well They can have bad side effects make people gain weight have tremors or get slow and sleepy Some people with schizophrenia say they dont want to get rid of their hallucinations because they are a part of who they are And for Vinogradov and other researchers who study the disease the antipsychotics arent really getting at the disease itself They are just treating one symptom of it We havent been addressing these underlying cognitive dysfunctions which are really at the heart of what impede peoples ability to have a fulfilling and successful life says Vinogradov This is important but its a little bit complicated So lets back up Schizophrenia the word means literally split mind And thats how people usually think of schizophrenia as a disease defined by weird ideas like believing in cosmic dust Or that the FBI is following you But this public perception of schizophrenia hasnt kept up with the science When you talk to scientists today who study the disease these weird beliefs are not what they emphasize If you want to really understand schizophrenia look instead to how the disease begins says   a neuroscientist at the University of California San Francisco Kids seem to be growing up OK But somewhere typically in the teenage years you start to see a decline in their functioning he says They were doing better in school now theyre doing worse They may have they had friends when theyre younger but theyre starting to be more socially isolated This stage in life is supposed to be a time when the intellect flourishes But for teenagers who go on to develop schizophrenia the opposite can happen They start to lose focus Some say they used to be able to read books and now they cant They used to be able to play the guitar well and now they cant At its core schizophrenia is a decline in basic brain functioning says Mathalon and others Abilities like memory and basic motor skills start to falter Its almost like a dementia that hits young people Then theres what scientists call   Someone without schizophrenia can hear a car alarm go off in the distance and barely register it The brain instantly knows that the car alarm isnt salient You can ignore it But for some people with schizophrenia says Vinogradov its as if the filter is broken They are walking down the street trying to have a conversation and their brain is being flooded with the sound of the door slamming the airplane going overhead The brain of someone with schizophrenia tries to process all that information as though it has meaning says Vinogradov And maybe though this is just a theory this onslaught of extra stuff extra data  that is what gives rise to hallucinations It tries to make sense of it so that the person can go about with their life says Vinogradov And theres some evidence to suggest that thats what gives rise to delusional ideas to paranoia to hallucinatory activity Considered this way schizophrenia is a disease in which the stream of consciousness has swollen into a tsunami This seems to be the case with Paul another guy I met at the clinic Paul is an Asian man in his s whose conversation is hard to follow Punjab Punjab Punjab Paul keeps repeating Then Ive never been to India but I saw pictures of it books You go places you never been like books Pretty soon hes talking about his brother Kenny Chuck Norris Stanley tools Battlestar Galactica and on and on Everything I say to Paul or he says to me triggers a jumble of tangentially related ideas Its like playing pinball with a machine where the ball never comes back down the chute It just keeps bouncing around So what if you could teach someone like Paul to tune out the distractions in his head to have a real conversation This is what researchers in schizophrenia want to achieve these days Theyre less focused on making delusions go away They want to help people with schizophrenia simply think more clearly One way to do this might be with a  designed to improve memory and basic brain performance Pharmaceutical companies have been working on this but without much success so clinicians are prescribing things that seem to be good for the brain like   and   And at the mental health clinic where I met Paul and George Vinogradov is conducting a   to see whether the brain can be essentially retaught It uses computer games designed to train people with schizophrenia to tune out distractions and focus on simple instructions The idea isnt that video games would replace antipsychotic drugs at least not for everyone Vinogradov says there are many people whose voices or delusions are so destructive so violent that they need to be turned off Medication is still the best way to do that But for another group of people these kinds of approaches might let doctors focus on a different set of questions says Vinogradov Is this person able to have the kind of life they want Are they able to have friends people they love who can love them back Are they able to keep food and shelter Voices and beliefs may not be what are getting in the way of that Simpler problems like memory and focus may be the bigger obstacles to a good quality of life Addressing those questions may be a lot more important than whether someone hears voices or not
