The aidindying movement may be enjoying a boost from the purposeful death of beautiful yearold   but another case across the ocean is emerging as political kryptonite  a British moms courtbacked decision to end her disabled childs life Charlotte Fitzmaurice chose in August to remove hydration from her yearold daughter to halt horrific pain for a girl born with severe defects Fitzmaurice told NBC News   Nancy was unable to eat drink or comprehend her plight She died in August The mothers recent media interviews are bringing the situation to light only now Her euthanasia  a UK precedent because Nancy still was able to breathe and was not terminal  would violate all US deathwithdignity laws and rulings In five states doctors can prescribe lethal drugs only to adults who are mentally competent and diagnosed with terminal illnesses Other states  But the tale of Charlotte and Nancy Fitzmaurice is precisely the sort of scenario that ignited harsh warnings from the critics of Maynard  who carried out a plan Nov  to end her life before terminal brain cancer claimed her naturally Many groups pushing for more end of life options find these kinds of cases to be political kryptonite and want to be able to say thats totally different not the thing we are talking about said Glenn Cohen director of the PetrieFlom Center for Health Law Policy Biotechnology and Bioethics at Harvard Law School My own sense is that Compassion and Choices and other proassistedsuicide legislation groups will only push for domestic legislation to govern cases like these once political victories are more secure in the more typical case they are interested in Cohen said Indeed Compassion  Choices a nonprofit with whom Maynard teamed in her final weeks to expand endoflife choices for more Americans declined to comment to NBC News on the actions of the British mom and court Fitzmaurice also declined to speak with NBC News She is doing only paid interviews to raise money for a charity fund in her daughters name said Paisley Gilmour features editor at Talk to the Press a UK agency that helps people sell their stories to newspapers and magazines But in an interview with ITV Fitzmaurice said that once the court allowed her to end hydration she told her daughter Im so sorry I kept saying to her Im so sorry Im so sorry I had to do this and that I loved her She acknowledged hearing the views of those who oppose her decision saying I respect that completely But I just say to them to see the pain and agony and fear in her eyes and tell me what I did was wrong then Some US medical ethicists allow there is room for discussion on what Fitzmaurice ultimately chose for her daughter who was not expected to live past age  Such decisions however should be decided by medicalethics committees not made by parents in private said Arthur Caplan founding head of the division of bioethics at NYU Langone Medical Center and a contributor to NBC News He has asserted that Maynards planned death was   Because Nancy was enduring tremendous pain and was cognitively prevented from grasping the meaning of her pain it might be ethically proper to remove lifesustaining measures if such steps are deemed to be the sole way to control that pain Caplan said But instead of removing hydration he would have leaned toward increasing pain medications despite increased the risks to Nancys breathing There is no interest in America in trying to extend the practice to children None Caplan said Critics may point to it  but European or even Canadian endoflife care controversies just dont play any role in statebased debates for or against legalization At Harvard Cohen acknowledged that risk of devaluing life  often raised by disability advocates  is much greater when parents are making decisions about their childs quality of life and claiming death is preferable That doesnt mean that these decisions should be necessarily blocked by law but it should make us more careful Cohen said Disability advocate Joni Eareckson Tada  who openly disagreed with Maynards choice  said the decision by Fitzmaurice represents the exact slippery slope she fears when it comes to social and legal campaigns on aid in dying With the UK ruling the door for the dehumanization of the disabled has now just been just totally swung wide open said Tada whose advocacy group is based near Los Angeles She became a quadriplegic in a  diving accident Her personhood her rights her volition as a human being all have been erased It sends a signal it creates a dire concern for millions of Americans with significant disabilities whose families are legal guardians that they may think their disabled childs life is not worth living that they have no quality of life Eareckson Tada said As a severe quadriplegic this sends chills up and down my spine because Im a friend to many special needs parents like Charlotte and I can attest that many of their children have value they have meaning and they have strengthened the character and the cords of family unity Thats what I think Americans as a whole need to grasp from this UK decision
