With a Catholic mother and a Muslim father Ive always had a great interest in religion but Ive never practiced one myself After I received a diagnosis of an aggressive form of leukemia at the age of  I put my faith in medicine During my first cycle of induction chemotherapy I did what Ive always done best I studied Growing up I had always been an avid bookworm and a straightA student I approached my cancer the same way I approached writing my senior thesis in college I buried my head in research journals interviewed experts and scoured the Internet for information As they say knowledge is power And I believed that the more I could learn about my disease the greater my chances of survival Two and half years later I realized how nave I was Knowledge Ive learned has its limits  Back in  after four weeks in isolation in the oncology ward at a New York City hospital my doctors had bad news not only had the standard treatments not worked but my cancer seemed to have become more aggressive Despite the chemotherapy I was going into bone marrow failure My immune system was no longer functioning and my body could not produce blood products on its own leaving me dependent on blood transfusions At the age of  I began to consider my own mortality It had never occurred to me that with all of the progress that has been made in cancer research none of the standard treatments would work for me Thats when I learned about something called a clinical trial When my doctors first recommended I enroll in an experimental clinical trial which involved a combination of two chemotherapy drugs that I had never heard of I was skeptical Well to be perfectly honest I was terrified In my mind clinical trials were only for the terminally ill  a last resort option a shot in the dark The words experimental and trial conjured up images of mad scientists and guinea pigs In reality a clinical trial is not an experiment in the classic sense In the world of medicine a trial refers to clinical research that follows a predefined plan or protocol A clinical trial must comply with strict health safety and ethical regulations determined by the Food and Drug Administration There are three different phases to a clinical trial Phase  trials are the first test of a treatment on humans to determine if its safe Phase  trials focus on whether a treatment is effective And Phase  is the final test before FDA approval to determine if a treatment has advantages over the standard treatments available My doctors recommended a Phase  trial meaning it was not yet known whether the new chemotherapy combination was even effective let alone better than the standard of care At a time when everything seemed so uncertain I craved hard facts statistics and proof that my cancer treatments were worth the havoc they wreaked on my mental and physical health The last thing I wanted was to become one of those guinea pigs I wanted a cure not a trial Suddenly I found myself faced with a leap of faith that wasnt based on religion but it felt deeply spiritual anyway No treatment had worked so far so how could I be sure that this one would My doctors had no certain answers for me After a few sleepless nights I hesitantly agreed to try it After all I had very few other options left and the longer I waited the slimmer my options might become The clinical trial tested my faith each step of the way The combination of chemotherapy drugs weakened my immune system to dangerous levels I spent countless nights in the emergency room with surging fevers that worried my doctors and I was hospitalized with lifethreatening complications ranging from septic shock to a risky infection with Clostridium difficile   But after six months the regimen had done its job reducing my blast count to a safe level for a bonemarrow transplant Last spring I had that transplant with my brother as my donor And today Im very lucky to be able to say Im cancerfree I still dont pray or attend church or consider myself religious But I have a different kind of faith now  a faith in my incredible team of doctors in the strength of my body and in the power of scientific research But Im still left with a lot of questions Why did my good friend Anjali who was also young and had the same disease not respond to the treatments that saved my life Part of the answer has to do with science But the other part is a mystery And even if I dont practice a formal religion I spend a lot of time thinking about why Im still here
