German doctors are highlighting the dangers of headbanging after a yearold man developed bleeding in the brain following a Motorhead concert The man complained of a constant headache when he was treated by Hannover Medical School neurosurgeons four weeks after the rock concert A scan revealed a blood clot on the right side of his brain which surgeons removed successfully A braininjury charity said the case was very unusual  Dr Ariyan Pirayesh Islamian and colleagues from Hannover Medical School said the man  who wanted to remain anonymous  had no history of head trauma and denied misusing drugs or alcohol when he was referred to them in January  But he did say he had been headbanging at a heavy metal concert several weeks previously Headbanging is a violent and rhythmic movement of the head in time with rock music most commonly heavy metal  It was first seen in the early s and Motorhead were one of the bands who popularised the practice with the invention of speed metal  fast tempo songs with a rhythm of up to  beats per minute In their case report the German authors said that while such music could be fun some fans might be endangered by indulging in excessive headbanging Only three other cases of subdural haematoma or bleeding in the brain have been linked to headbanging In this case after draining the blood clot in the patients brain doctors found a cyst close to the clot which would have made his brain more susceptible to haemorrhage The German doctors concluded We assume that headbanging with its brisk forward and back acceleration and deceleration forces led to rupturing of bridging veins causing haemorrhage into the subdural space They also said there could be more cases of this type of brain injury that only cause mild headaches They added This case serves as evidence in support of Motorheads reputation as one of the most hardcore rocknroll acts on Earth if nothing else because of their musics contagious speed drive and the hazardous potential for headbanging fans to suffer brain injury Headbanging has been linked to other health complications such as neck and spine injuries  but is generally considered to be harmless Luke Griggs from Headway the braininjury association said Repeated aggressive movement of the head can lead to damage being caused to the brain as it moves inside the skull but its fair to say this is a very unusual case  He also said it would be highly unlikely for a person to sustain a haematoma from headbanging at a concert However we strongly recommend that anyone who suffers a constant worsening headache for an extended period of time  having been to a concert or otherwise  should seek medical advice
