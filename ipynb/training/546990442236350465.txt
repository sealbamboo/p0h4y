A controversial plan to delay the dispatch of ambulances in some urgent medical cases is to be put on hold after a backlash against the highly dangerous proposals As   was accused of keeping parliament in the dark about the plan the Department of Health indicated that it was highly unlikely that the changes would be introduced by the original target date of the first week of the new year Government sources indicated that the changes would be introduced on a less ambitious timescale after a backlash against plans by the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives AACE to change the response time for some Red  patients  those with serious but not the most lifethreatening conditions  from eight to  minutes in England A document drawn up by the association which was leaked to the Mail on Sunday showed that Hunt gave his approval to the introduction of the changes by the first week of January subject to the approval of the chief executives and medical directors of the  ambulance trusts in England Government sources indicated on Sunday night that the changes which have yet to win the approval of the  ambulance trusts would have to be sent back to Hunt and the leaders of   England for final approval The Department of   swung into action after the leaked document revealed plans to respond to increased demand for ambulance services by lengthening response times for some seriously ill patients Under the plans the existing target times for Red  cases which cover lifethreatening incidents such as heart attacks trauma serious bleeding and instances where patients have stopped breathing would continue The national target is  of all Red  patients must be reached in eight minutes and  must be reached within  minutes The changes involve Red  cases covering serious illnesses which are not immediately life threatening which currently have to be answered within the same period with an extra  seconds Red  would be broken into three groups The most serious covering conditions such as strokes would be recategorised into the most urgent Red  But two new categories of Red  would be treated on a slightly slower timetable The first Red  category  just under half  would be covered by the  eight minute target plus an extra three minutes to allow the emergency services to spend slightly more time assessing the case The second Red  category around  would see their ambulance response time delayed from eight minutes to  plus the extra three minutes disposition to allow for a better medical assessment Unions were quick to raise concerns demanding to see the clinical evidence for changes which they said could put lives at risk What they are doing is highly dangerous  instead of admitting that there is a serious problem in ambulance and emergency care and putting solutions in place said Rachael Maskell head of health at Unite who argued that cuts in social care and other parts of the NHS along with fragmentation and privatisation have put increased pressure on emergency services But Anthony Marsh of the AACE insisted that the reforms are safe and would improve services after research found that  of ambulance calls are categorised as life threatening while only around  should fall into this category The research found that around half of patients who are sent an ambulance within eight minutes could be safely sent an ambulance within  minutes In a statement Marsh said We firmly believe that our proposals are safe and deliver benefits for patients and for staff who have been concerned for some time that we continue to try and reach many patients in eight minutes when it is not clinically required therefore unnecessarily adding to the pressures they are working under At this stage these are only proposals and they will not be formally approved until NHS England and the secretary of state are convinced as we are that they are clinically safe and that they offer better care for our patients  the shadow health secretary told Sky News This looks like a panic measure The government is rewriting the rules and moving the goal posts during the winter  without proper debate or proper consultation Burnham wrote to Hunt to accuse him of misleading the public after failing to mention the changes when he was summoned to answer an urgent question in the House of Commons on Thursday on accident and emergency departments and ambulance services  three days after he signed off the ambulance association plans Burnham said Jeremy Hunt was dragged before Parliament last Thursday to answer questions on NHS winter planning but treated with contempt It is outrageous that he decided to keep MPs and the public in the dark about a decision he had already taken and one which will have farreaching implications across the NHS Government sources said Hunt saw no need to mention the reforms because they were still under discussion Marsh hit out at Labour on the grounds that it had been been informed by the ambulance association of the planned reforms We have been surprised by some of the reaction today given that over the last three months the principles of what we are proposing and the benefits for patients that we envisage have been shared with Labour Conservative and Liberal Democrats and we have received no negative feedback on the thrust of those principles Clifford Mann president of the College of Emergency Medicine said the proposals were in large measure a pragmatic response to an an enormous number of responses which did not really correspond to that much of an increase in very severe illnesses and injury But he criticised the way the proposals had emerged The first I have heard of them is today I think that any change for it to be credible needs to be tested he told BBC Radio s The World this Weekend I would have thought the sensible thing to do is to pilot this either for a period of time or in a number of different areas and to be able to produce data which compares with the same area or the same period last year Last week London Ambulance Service LAS asked for help from paramedic teams from the rest of the country because of increased demand The appeal followed its busiest ever week with  callouts for the most seriously ill and injured Despite increased demand LAS has more than  vacancies as it struggles to recruit people As demand surges LAS is missing response targets A Department of Health spokesman said This government has absolutely no plans to double ambulance wait times We have given ambulances an extra m this winter to ensure the service remains sustainable and the secretary of state agreed that NHS England should investigate a proposal from the ambulance services themselves to see whether the service they offer the public could be improved No decisions have been made and the secretary of state would only agree to proposed changes that improve response times for urgent cases
