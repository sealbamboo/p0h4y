Common chemicals that disrupt human hormones could be costing more than bn bn bn a year in damage to human health in Europe a series of studies claims  The data suggests the high economic impact of chemicals in pesticides plastics and flame retardants  The team led by New York University said the estimates were conservative However experts cautioned the findings were informed speculation and called for more detailed research   The data was presented at the annual meeting of the Endocrinology Society Endocrinedisrupting chemicals EDCs can be physically similar to the hormones that naturally control our bodys physiology so mimic their function They can also block the function of hormones  They have been linked with declining sperm counts some cancers impaired intelligence obesity and diabetes  The main concern surrounds their impact during early development  The authors of the study argued that limiting exposure would have significant benefits   In the EU one of the most famous disrupting chemicals bisphenol A BPA has been banned in    Yet the European Commission   and health is not clear and has called for more detailed studies  Many of the conditions linked to EDCs are also influenced by a wide range of other environmental influences  And some scientists contest the levels in the environment are not high enough to influence health  The international research team acknowledge there is uncertainty and adapted techniques used by the International Panel on Climate Change to balance the uncertainty with the potential scale of the impact  Their mathematical models suggested that across the  members of the EU the most likely cost was bn bn bn a year but could be much higher That equates to  of Europes GDP  This included healthcare costs as well as lost economic potential  Their calculations said it was more than  certain that at least one of the chemicals was indeed having an impact on health            Male reproductive disorders cost bn bn bn per year          Premature deaths including through cardiovascular disease cost bn bn bn per year          Obesity and diabetes cost bn bn bn per year          Neurological impact including reduced intelligence cost bn bn bn per year The major economic impact was from pesticides bn bn bn followed by chemicals found in plastics bn bn bn and flame retardants bn bn bn   Dr Leonardo Trasande a paediatrician at the New York University school of medicine told the BBC These results suggest that regulating endocrine disrupting chemicals could produce substantial economic benefit that would be less than the cost of implementing safer alternatives and produce net economic benefits  Clearly we need further research but there is a greater than  probability that these chemicals contribute to disease  The overwhelming majority of the reported costs were from lost cognitive potential The studies claimed around m IQ points were being lost across Europe and  cases of intellectual disability could be attributed to EDCs Dr Trasande argued If one child comes back from school with one less IQ point the parent might not notice the neuropsychologist might not notice but if  children come back with one less IQ point then the economy notices  The studies looked at less than  of suspected EDCs and did not look at conditions such as cancer and female reproductive diseases Hence the scientific team argue that these are conservative estimates  Prof Richard Sharpe from the UK Medical Research Councils Human Reproductive Sciences Unit based in Edinburgh told the BBC he agreed with the authors that more research was needed in this area  But he cautioned Most of the content of these publications is interpretation and informed speculation and none of us should lose sight of this  What worries me about this approach is that whilst this may help to focus attention on the need for further research to clarify the huge number of uncertainties in these areas these highly presumptive estimations inevitably become viewed and presented as being far more solid than they actually are
