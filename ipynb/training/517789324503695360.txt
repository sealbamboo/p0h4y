The rapid nationwide spread of the enterovirus  respiratory infection is unlike any previous outbreak of the disease public health officials have seen As of this week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have confirmed nearly  cases of the infection including   although its uncertain what role the virus played in their deaths Experts say the true number of cases is likely much higher since only a fraction of patients suspected of having the infection have been tested and the infection is usually neither fatal nor severe Most of the patients seriously affected are children Experts say that   for children with difficulty breathing chest pain wheezing or blue lips Those are signs that the child requires immediate medical care Children with asthma and other chronic lung conditions are particularly vulnerable To learn more I spoke with Rafal Tokarz of the Center for Infection  Immunity at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University Dr Tokarz is   who has studied previous outbreaks of the disease including a cluster of cases that he and his colleagues identified in New York City in  Here is an edited transcript of our conversation Until recently a lot of people had never heard of enterovirus  Is this outbreak  or the scope of it  unusual I think the most surprising aspect of it is how severe it is particularly the symptoms in kids Because that hasnt really been seen before As far as the extent of it in the past  years there have been reports by our group as well as several around the world that the virus has been increasing in incidence There have been clusters in Southeast Asia in Europe in Africa and in North America Its been increasing in the past decade What is different about the symptoms seen in this outbreak compared to previous clusters In most cases it manifests itself as a cold or maybe a mild case of the flu and it probably got diagnosed as such I believe in a lot of cases its still no different than a severe cold or the flu even during this outbreak But in certain individuals the symptoms are more severe and that hasnt been seen before Whats different now is that kids are going to the ICU But the fact is that we dont know a lot about this virus Until the last  years or so it was very rare Why is this outbreak so different than others Is the virus evolving Absolutely It is evolving A hypothesis of mine is that the strain thats circulating now probably is a novel variant It may have mutated into something thats more easily transmissible and more pathogenic The virus is mutating and there are a lot of different variants circulating around the globe We dont know much about this particular strain because that data to my knowledge hasnt been released yet by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention But enteroviruses do change over time fairly rapidly If you look at the strains that were circulating in the past the strains from   or  years ago theyre very different genetically Is it typical for a virus to cause more severe infections as it evolves Not necessarily It can go the opposite way You could have a virus thats very pathogenic become attenuated or weakened What can adults do to protect their children from the virus Right now there really isnt much Theres no vaccine for it The only thing parents can do is the same thing that they can do to protect their kids from other respiratory viruses Make sure they wash their hands thoroughly because its transmitted very similarly to influenza And if the child feels sick then dont send them to school But other than that there really isnt much that one can do at the moment Why is this outbreak so much more widespread than previous ones I would guess that the strains that are circulating now are basically more transmissible They can be spread more easily from person to person  maybe more infectious Thats something we wont know until we can compare the strains circulating now to earlier strains So we wont know that for a while Some   that in the past enterovirus  may have been commonly overlooked or mistaken for similar infections like the common cold Is that true It definitely was underreported Its likely there had been more cases last year and many of them were missed because enterovirus was not something one would immediately think of since the virus was so rare This is really the first time theres been such a large outbreak with severe symptoms But in the past there have been clusters in the United States We discovered a cluster in New York City in  There were clusters documented across the United States in  and  So there have certainly been clusters of this virus in the past but what is different now is the scale and the symptoms The outbreak this year is largely affecting children Is that typical of enterovirus In most cases yes Its always been associated predominantly with children  probably because they show more symptoms But it has been reported in adults as well There have been cases in adults documented here in the United States and in Asia as well It affects adults as well but with less severe symptoms There have been reports of muscle weakness paralysis and other poliolike symptoms in a small number of children Is that common with enterovirus Its very very unusual There have been cases in the past  albeit extremely rare  in which enterovirus  caused encephalitis So it can travel to the central nervous system and cause central nervous system disease But its extremely rare to my knowledge Have we seen such cases in the United States before There was a cluster in California last winter in which it was reported that five kids had a poliolike illness And out of the five two or three tested positive for enterovirus  That was the first time there was a link But to my knowledge it hasnt been conclusively proven that this virus had anything to do with this particular syndrome And in this case I dont think it has been definitively proven as of yet Its very unusual for this virus to cause these symptoms But again because it used to be so rare we still dont know a lot about it Is it possible that we may be nearing the end of the outbreak Based on what enteroviruses normally do it should be tapering off Normally you see a peak in September maybe into October and then basically what you should see is that sometime this month the numbers come down Generally enterovirus season is late summer very early fall Based on past events with various enteroviruses thats usually what we would expect to see But again with this strain we dont know
