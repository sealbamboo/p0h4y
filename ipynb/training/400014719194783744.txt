Movies aimed at teenagers now include more scenes of gun violence than films made for adults new research shows In  box office hits that received a PG rating from the Motion Picture Assn of America contained an average of more than  dramatic sequences involving guns per hour according to   published Monday by the journal Pediatrics PG movies have matched or exceeded the gun violence of Rrated movies since  the researchers found In fact scenes of gunfueled death and destruction have become so frequent in PG movies that the overall rate of gun violence in movies has more than doubled since  even though guns have become less common in G and PG movies during that time and remained essentially flat in movies rated R The PG rating was introduced in  Although a   is intended to warn parents that some material may be inappropriate for children under  such movies are routinely watched by younger children  especially when they make it to TV or the Internet the researchers lamented Children much younger than  years can easily view films that contain ample gun violence they wrote Four researchers from the University of Pennsylvanias Annenberg Public Policy Center Ohio State University and VU University Amsterdam focused on the  highestgrossing movies for the years  to    films in all Each of those films was watched by trained coders who kept track of the violent sequences in each minute chunk of each movie They counted a total of  such sequences in those  movies Then they narrowed their analysis to the  films that came out since  the first full year the PG rating was in effect Among those movies   a whopping   contained atÂ least one minute segment with some sort of violence Those segments were further analyzed to see if they included a gun which the researchers defined as a weapon that can be carried with  or both hands that fires a bullet or energy beam with the intention of harming or killing a living target By this definition a battle scene with only rocketpropelled grenades wouldnt count as an instance of gun violence neither would a scene of hunters shooting at animals or cops taking target practice at a shooting range Altogether they counted  segments that met their criteria for gun violence Among the  movies rated G and  movies rated PG instances of gun violence decreased between  and  the researchers reported During the same period there was no clear trend of gun violence becoming more or less common in the  movies that were rated R But among the  movies rated PG the rate soared These findings were troubling to the researchers because children often look to the movies for guidance on how to solve problems in their own lives They noted that when James Holmes suited up in full tactical gear and began spraying bullets into an Aurora Colo movie theater during a screening of Batman he told police he was the Joker Gun violence in movies may seem too overthetop and absurd to play any role in real life but there are scientifically sound reasons to take the matter seriously Many studies have linked smoking and drinking in movies to increases in   and   among kids and teens the researchers noted Way back in  psychologists demonstrated that simply sitting in the same room as a revolver or shotgun made people more aggressive In   test subjects were seated at a table that held either a gun or badminton equipment  said to be left over from a previous event  or at an empty table Subjects were asked to evaluate a persons performance on a task and give them a corresponding electric shock Those who were in the presence of a gun delivered more aggressive shocks than subjects confronted with badminton racquets and shuttlecocks or subjects seated at bare tables The effects of exposure to gun violence in films should not be trivialized the researchers concluded The mere presence of guns in these films may increase the aggressive behavior of youth    and like   on Facebook
