We all know food is fuel so it only makes sense that a proper fillup is critical to a rewarding workout Even if youre looking to lose   skimping on calories before exercise is not the path to success Not only will it result in a lack of energy but more muscle mass will actually be lost than created Basic exercise does not burn all that many calories says William D Hart PhD assistant professor in the department of health sciences at Rogers State University in Claremore Okla You cannot get rid of the three pieces of pumpkin pie at the gym tomorrow But exercise adds muscle so that over time your body naturally burns more   per day For a healthy diet Hart recommends following the United States Department of Agriculture My Pyramid guidelines emphasizing whole grains fruits and vegetables while avoiding fried and fatty foods As for   its critical to combine weight training with highintensity interval work during aerobic activities such as walking or jogging on a treadmill or using an elliptical machine While its important to eat something before exercising be careful to allow enough time for digestion A good blood supply is required to process food so conflicts can occur when the same blood is needed to bring nutrients to muscles during a workout Your goal is to make sure that the meal is essentially gone when you start the exercise says Hart A good rule of thumb would be eating no closer than one and a half to two hours ahead of time Keep in mind that the amount of fat in the meal and the intensity of the exercise can also affect digestion time The more fat the longer it takes to be digested and the more time should be allowed How taxing the workout is can change the amount of blood needed for the muscles If the exercise is mild eating closer to the start time is acceptable As to the type of food Thomas A Fox an exercise physiologist and author of   recommends fresh fruit vegetables and whole grains such as wholewheat bread An ideal preworkout meal consists of protein   to  percent carbohydrates   to  percent and fat   to  percent And what about those who   vs the evening The timing really shouldnt affect the diet Many people have a preference for foods appropriate to the time of day but as long as the right amount and type of calories are ingested the specific selection is not important If the exercise has been intense its crucial to eat within an hour of the end of the workout in order to refuel the bodys cells A decentsized meal within that minute postworkout period will greatly increase the ability to recover and help build lean muscle tissue says Jonathan Mulholland DC a chiropractor exercise scientist and consultant for the US Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid NY An ideal ratio is  carbohydrates to protein with an easy option being a glass of chocolate skim milk For mild workouts a light snack is sufficient to tide you over until the next meal Another good idea is eating less but more frequently since consuming more than can be digested and burned at one time translates to the extra food turning into fat Finally no matter when or how vigorous the exercise be sure to always eat breakfast A variety of studies have shown people who ate the most in the morning are generally thinner and consumed fewer calories the rest of the day Turns out Mom was right all along
