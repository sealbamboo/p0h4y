BOSTON  There wasnt  going to be a happy ending The patient had metastatic cancer and had just gone through her third unsuccessful regimen of chemotherapy Now it seemed that everywhere we looked we found disease An Xray of her belly revealed an obstruction in her intestines A CT scan of her chest uncovered a pulmonary embolism Her labs demonstrated that she had almost no white blood cells left with which to defend herself  When she arrived in the intensive care unit she was delirious I asked her the usual questions about her medical history and whether she wanted us to do CPR if her heart were to stop beating but she didnt answer I was just setting the clipboard aside when she raised a hand and told me in a moment of lucidity Doc do everything you can I need to make it to my daughters wedding She was in a lot of pain She had a tube down her nose draining her stomach  When is the wedding I asked  Next summer I blinked I blinked again She didnt  she was looking right at me At this point I doubted shed make it through the hospitalization let alone eight more months I didnt know what I could say I put the stethoscope against her chest and retreated into silence  I met Stefanie her daughter the next morning She was  but was only  when her mothers cancer was first diagnosed Stefanies mother had MuirTorre syndrome a condition that gave her a predisposition for malignancies So Stefanie had shared her home with cancer for many years and had always seen her mother fight  But she knew that this time was different The oncology fellow who had been treating her mother as an outpatient was the one to tell her that her mother was dying Stefanie broke down but understood there was no use denying it The dream of a family wedding under the summer sun turned sour  Stefanie called her fianc that morning Crying she told him the news But he flipped the fatalistic script Without hesitation he told her I want her to be there too and he proposed not only to have the wedding done sooner but to have it done right there in the ICU  Our team was used to dealing with all kinds of crises Handling a lastminute wedding was not one of them While having more than one opinion on a medical team regarding how best to manage a patient is fairly routine we received no push back from anyone as we started to make arrangements for the wedding Soon the whole medical team was involved We sent a letter to the court to expedite the marriage certificate A pastor and harp player were booked The hospital cafeteria baked a chocolate cake and the nurses brought in flowers In just a few days we were ready   My job was to make sure our patients pain was controlled while also avoiding the confusion that is a side effect of narcotic medications But almost miraculously she didnt need pain medications for hours and was fully aware of everything that was going on Looking at the bride and groom from her hospital bed she seemed more comfortable than I had seen her before The whole day had an unreal feel to it everything felt like it slowed down The sun shone through the windows and glistened on the bags of fluid For once in the hospital there were tears but no pain It felt as if after all these years of chasing our patient down even the cancer took a break  The next morning the family decided to transition to hospice No intubation no CPR  nothing that would prolong life It was all about trying to make the patient comfortable And yet four months later she is still alive and doing as well as can be hoped in hospice   In todays outcomedriven efficiencyobsessed medical world its easy to forget that healing patients isnt just about treating diseases and relieving symptoms There are things doctors and nurses can do meaningful interventions  like helping patients fulfill final goals or spend quality time with their families  that cannot be documented in a discharge summary or be converted into a blip on a screen  As a physician I never liked the word miracle I preferred to think in terms of medical outliers And yet that day of the wedding did feel like a miracle Physicians often share their patients sorrow but rarely their joys No we had not discovered the cure to cancer but we felt that we had achieved something powerful  freeing if only temporarily our patient from her disease  One of the nurses smiling through her tears spoke to me after it was all over It was magical she said None of the patient alarms went off
