Nausea sensitivity to bright lights headache Chris Coyne knew right away that the helmettohelmet hit during football practice had given him a concussion His fifth in fact So he knew just what to do He reasoned that since only  days remained in the season and he was both team captain and a senior at Staples High School in Westport Conn he would tough it out He had played through worse concussions So he avoided the schools athletic trainer and ducked direct looks from his coach either of whom might have noticed that he was dazed  I put pressure on myself to do well and not to let my teammates down said Mr Coyne now a junior at Yale Mr Coyne a foot defensive end and tight end was supposed to continue playing football in college But during preseason practice freshman year he got a sixth concussion His symptoms were so severe and protracted that he had to rely on an independent notetaker and take Ritalin for wandering attention for three semesters He was finished with football An   about sportsrelated concussions in young people released last week by the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council made recommendations that included bolstering research collecting data examining injury protocols and educating the public But the report identified one particularly stubborn challenge the culture of resistance among high school and college athletes who may be inclined to shrug off the invisible injuries and return immediately to the field   There is still a culture among athletes the report said that resists both the selfreporting of concussions and compliance with appropriate concussion management plans Dr Frederick P Rivara a pediatrician at the University of Washingtons Seattle Childrens Hospital and a vice chairman of the committee that produced the report said Its a culture where the idea is to man up to not let your teammates or coach down and play with your symptoms Because concussions are not graphic like a bloodied nose or a broken leg players hide their symptoms and continue to play Even so Dr Rivara said one of the reports recommendations  to teach athletes coaches school districts and parents about the possibility of exacerbating the effects of a concussion if an athlete returns to the field hastily  can start right now before research  Concussions vary widely and the prognosis depends on age and on the location and force of the injury as well as on other less quantifiable factors Most concussions resolve within a few weeks but more severe ones can have longterm complications including problems with memory and concentration particularly if subjected to continuing trauma If an athlete incurs a second concussion before the first one has healed the consequences may be compounded But educating athletes about concussions is one thing Changing the convictions of a culture that values playing through pain is quite another One obstacle is the adolescent belief in invincibility We all knew concussions were bad said Mr Coyne who frequently speaks to athletic organizations and youth teams about   But we didnt believe in the severity It wont happen to me I can play through one  In May   of  high school football players by doctors at the Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center found that more than  percent could identify the symptoms of a concussion including headaches dizziness and sensitivity to light and sound And  percent of the players knew they risked serious injury if they returned to the field too quickly after a concussion Yet only  percent said they would report such symptoms to their coach and  percent said that even if they had a headache from an injury they would continue to play A   in The Journal of Pediatrics found that cheerleaders also underreported concussion symptoms  Awareness about the potential seriousness of concussions particularly on developing brains has increased markedly in the last few years Most states have baseline legislation mandating concussion education for athletes and coaches But at the same time the allure of athletic success has grown among young people  not only because of the possibility of college scholarships but because of the salaries and celebrity status conferred upon star professional athletes Theres a machismo to sports whether youre male or female said Dustin J Fink an athletic trainer who supervises a dozen sports at Mt Zion High School in Illinois Its most often seen in professional sports where they are celebrated for being warriors and champions for doing everything they can to stay on the field and play That message trickles down to parents and children said Mr Fink who writes   about concussion research My dad would say Play unless you cant walk And with some injuries like broken fingers you can play through the pain But once your brain is hurt its hurt Yet what gets instilled in the child is You play no matter what  As an athletic trainer at other junior high and high schools Ive seen coaches who tried to be the decisionmaker with injuries Mr Fink said They need that win so they will try to override the athletic trainer or manipulate the athlete to get back in the game  He added that Mt Zion coaches did not behave in this manner  Mr Fink did say he had begun to see some change in the culture in recent years When he pulled a student from a game because of a concussion he said parents and other coaches used to say What do you know Its no big deal Now more often he hears Thank you well get it checked out Mr Coyne whose concussions came not just from football but from hitting his head on a pole standard during a high jump and from roughhousing in the locker room said that this his junior year was the first in which he felt symptomfree and did not have to rely on extensive accommodations  He is majoring in political science and economics and longs to return to sports But his football days are over and he hasnt been medically cleared for his next choice volleyball  Another possibility I love skiing he said I havent hit my head hard in skiing for years
