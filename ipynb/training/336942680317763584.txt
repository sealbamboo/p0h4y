Health insurance deductibles typically only go one direction up Its not unusual for people these days to be responsible for paying thousands of dollars in medical claims   Rewards to policyholders for claims that dont meet the annual deductible can be a boon for healthy people But the approach   next year when the Affordable Care Act bans discriminating against people based on their health A deductible credit program sponsored by UnitedHealthcares   is available in  states on most of the companys renewable plans sold on the individual market according to Ellen Laden a spokeswoman Heres how it works If someone has a plan with say a  deductible and doesnt have that amount in claims the first year   by  percent to  The following year the deductible falls by another  percent if the deductible isnt met to  The third year the amount can shrink another  percent to  half the original deductible and the maximum reduction allowed under the program Its a way to retain customers says Carrie McLean a senior manager of customer care at eHealthInsurancecom an online vendor Policyholders who might otherwise go shopping for a plan when they get their annual rate increase may be persuaded to stick with the same company if they think theyre getting a better deal than they could elsewhere she says Of course as deductibles have risen in recent years people are less likely to meet them According to an analysis by eHealthInsurancecom of one large insurers  claims just under  percent of people with a  deductible met the deductible for that year For those with a  deductible plan the figure dropped to just under  percent Only  percent of people with a  deductible had that much in claims and at the  deductible level the figure was just over  percent Thats not true for the smaller number of people with serious medical conditions Many of them regularly meet and exceed even high deductible thresholds Starting next year the Affordable Care Act will prohibit insurers on the individual market from denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions or charging them more And   a health law professor at Washington and Lee University said the deductible credit program could be considered discriminatory under the federal health law next year Its designed to permit continued cherry picking of patients he says Golden Rules Laden says the company is still finalizing its strategy for next year Were currently reviewing the Affordable Care Act and its impact on the deductible credit feature to ensure that our products and practices remain in compliance with it and all other applicable laws she said in a statement
