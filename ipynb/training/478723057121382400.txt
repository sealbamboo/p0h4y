Feeling achy Got creaky knees Joint pain from osteoarthritis Theyve got a new drug for that that and its completely free walking Scientists say taking as few as  steps per day may help older adults remain active in their golden years While it may seem counterintuitive to move more when moving hurts the new study suggests about one hour of walking per day at an average pace of  steps per minute may be the perfect dose to ward off the debilitating effects of osteoarthritis The disease is the most common form of arthritis it afflicts more than  of adults over  and more than a third of those over  according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention It creeps into many parts of the body but most commonly affects the knees Simply growing old puts this joint at risk but being a woman being overweight or having a previous injury doesnt help either Currently there are no cures for osteoarthritis said Daniel White an assistant professor of physical therapy at Boston University And theres no real cure for the pain All doctors can do is try to prevent patients symptoms from progressing past pain to paralysis White said Otherwise osteoarthritis can make it hard to accomplish basic tasks like rising from the dinner table or getting out of bed So White and colleagues set out to determine if the benefits of exercise could be achieved not just through regimented exercise programs but through unstructured activities around the home and office To do this they used pedometers similar to the now ubiquitous Nike FitBit or Jawbone UP to tally participants daily steps The researchers published their findings last week in the journal Arthritis Care  Research I thought heck we have numbers for everything else  cholesterol blood pressure  why cant there be a number for the physical activity targets we want to hit White said For two years the researchers tracked a group of adults in Alabama and Iowa who ranged in age from  to  Although some had signs of osteoarthritis at the start none had problems with everyday activities like going to work cooking dinner or walking faster that  miles per hour  the speed needed to safely cross a neighborhood street which scientists used as a cutoff for healthy performance Knee problems cropped up in about  of the roughly  participants before the study ended These people either reported a limited ability to function normally or failed to pass the performance test of walking speed The researchers also monitored the participants for physiological signs of osteoarthritis such as joint space narrowing or bony growths using knee Xrays When they analyzed the step data from the pedometers they found a strong link between participants activity level and knee health Their results suggest  steps marks an important threshold  of participants who developed knee impairments walked less than this amount while  of those who remained healthy walked more This number held true even after the scientists accounted for all the other possible reasons why those who walked less might have developed problems including age sex level of education and how many physical signs of osteoarthritis they saw in their Xrays at the beginning Most adults with arthritis walk only  minutes per week less than  steps per day Recognizing this the scientists also developed intermediate goals for sedentary adults who want to avoid future knee problems Just  steps seemed enough to protect most participants in the study and their chances of remaining healthy improved by about  for everyÂ  additional  steps they took each day The benefit from walking demonstrated by this paper is good news said Dorothy Dunlop a professor at Northwesterns Feinberg School of Medicine who was not involved in the study Walking is easy to weave into daily routines and requires no membership fees One limitation of the study was that it monitored the normal lives of regular people complete with all their reallife complications rather than doing a highly controlled clinical trial considered the gold standard of medical studies However White thinks thats not a big problem here This is not rocket science White said The concepts not surprising In fact the late Robert Butler founder of the National Institute on Aging is often quoted as saying if exercise could be packaged in a pill it would be the most prescribed and beneficial medicine in the nation The importance of this study White said is that it demonstrates how easy staying healthy can be This exercise is not like going to gym and putting on your sweats and sweating away These are very attainable goals that can be met in the context of daily life by just walking a little bit more
