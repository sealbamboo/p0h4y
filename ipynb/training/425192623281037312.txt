If you want to lift weights or use the treadmill at Downsize Fitness you have to be at least  pounds overweight Kendall Schrantz is a fan  and a member The yearold has struggled with her weight since she was in the second grade The looks she got at other gyms made her uncomfortable But now she drives more than an hour to Downsize Fitness in Fort Worth three times a week just to exercise Its worth every single penny I paid for gas she said Its worth the time I spend on the road the miles Downsize which opened in Chicago has locations in Fort Worth and Dallas The gym says it eliminates the selfconscious and alienating atmosphere that may be found at other fitness centers Exercises and equipment are tailored to larger bodies Its one of a number of companies and organizations that are marketing fitness to people who are overweight or obese Its not a bad business strategy considering that   of American adults fit in that category according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The Planet Fitness chain touts its   In Omaha Neb   promises you wont find size s in sports bras sprinting on treadmills This gym started by Marty Wolff who competed on NBCs The Biggest Loser says it is for people of size And many YMCA facilities feature photos of the faces and bodies of actual members  real people  instead of supermodels or body builders Schrantz used to be a chronic gym quitter Shed sign up go once and never return The looks she got at other gyms made her uncomfortable My thought on that is why are you looking at me when I got off of the couch I got off of my bed and Im actually doing something about it Schrantz said during an interview at the gym Still she says Its hard As she said that she began to tear up Other members of the gym came to comfort her They put their arms around her while she cried Here members sweat together  and shed tears together Kishan Shah is the CEO of Downsize which has hundreds of members across the US They weigh anywhere from  to  pounds Shah used to weigh   and have a inch waist Today hes half that weight and always finds time for a yoga or cardio class in between business meetings Fitness is about a lot more than just looks Shah says If you ask that person why they want to get healthier its not about looks Shah says Its about being able to get up off the floor being able to keep up with your kids fitting into an airplane seat and really being able to be around for your grandkids So instead of aiming for sixpack abs trainers emphasize  The majority of trainers at Downsize were once considered obese themselves This is their passion not their job Shah said Indeed everything at Downsize is intended to make the gym a welcoming place for those who are overweight even the equipment The stationary bikes elliptical machines and treadmills all are designed for larger heavier people There is thicker cushioning and wider seats There are no mirrors and the windows are tinted so passersby cant see in And there are striking beforeandafter photos of clients on the wall That may be good for people who are anxious about what other people think about their appearance according to   an assistant professor of psychology at Southern Methodist University in Dallas But that doesnt work for everyone Those who have high levels of physique anxiety they preferred to be around others who were also overweight and obese Baldwin says pointing to a   Whereas people with low levels of physique anxiety actually preferred the opposite They preferred to be around people who were more fit The idea of being surrounded by other plussized gym members doesnt bother   a holistic health coach in New York But she says she wouldnt go to a gym called Downsize Fitness Any gym that boasts total pounds lost   so far at Downsizes across the country  is selling a familiar message Poretsky says Fat is bad The problem is that places like this do well because fat is so stigmatized in our society and theres all this pressure to lose weight Poretsky said And to me its more of the same Oh we can hide out while we lose weight until we become more societally acceptable That doesnt appeal to me in the least But Poretsky does like the idea of having a strong support community which Downsize is known for Trainers often stay in touch with members when theyre outside of the gym with text messages and Facebook posts Kendall Schrantz says shes already seeing results  a few inches off her waist And shes discovered a new passion I love to run And ultimately thats the goal for these gyms  to make fitness gratifying instead of degrading
