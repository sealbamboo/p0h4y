 The makers of Pom Wonderful pomegranate juice are not allowed to make any claim that the drink is effective in curing or treating health conditions such as heart disease and prostate cancer, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said Wednesday.. In a 5-0 ruling, the FTC upheld an administrative law judge's decision that the makers of the beverage deceptively advertised their products.. The commission also said that food companies making specific claims about the health benefits of their products will have to provide evidence from randomized clinical trials, the Wall Street Journal reported.. In a statement, Pom Wonderful said it "categorically rejects the FTC's assertion that our advertisements made any misleading disease treatment or other health claims.". The company also said the FTC was ignoring millions of dollars of scientific research and history on the benefits of pomegranate juice, WSJ reported.. While pomegranate has not been tested in humans as a rheumatoid arthritis treatment, a recent study found that mice who received an extract of pomegranate in supplement form had less inflammation and less deterioration of their joints than mice that did not take the supplement.. With all juices, beware of hidden sugar count. Medical News Today reported that most people underestimate the sugar content of a popular pomegranate juice by a whopping 18 teaspoons.
