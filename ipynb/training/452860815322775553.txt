One of these days there could well be a simple blood test that can help diagnose and track cancers We arent there yet but a burst of research in this area shows we are getting a lot closer In the latest of these studies scientists have used blood samples to identify people with lung cancer At the Stanford School of Medicine   spends some of his time as a radiation oncologist treating patients with cancer and some of his time delving into the world of DNA In particular hes been working on ways to detect DNA that has been shed from a tumor and ends up in a patients blood The problem has been that theres a very small amount of the DNA there usually so its very hard to detect Diehn says But new technologies allow him to find tiny amounts of DNA and scan large parts of it to look for mutations that come from tumors And that opens up all sorts of possibilities The initial impetus was having something I could use in my own patients  as a blood test that would let us both detect the presence of cancer as well as monitor how a patients cancer responds to various treatments he says Right now doctors often just wait and hope And it can take months or even years to see whether a cancer treatment has worked But Diehn and his colleagues say theyve developed an exquisitely sensitive DNA test that can tell them right away whether there is tumor left in a patient If there is cancer DNA in the body left that suggests there are still cancer cells left so that patient is probably not cured he says whereas if the cancer DNA is gone that suggests the patient is likely to be cured And if the cancer is still there they can try other treatments Their new experimental test is specific for lung cancers  nonsmallcell lung cancers to be precise They report in   that they were able to detect tumor DNA in every patient they studied who had a more advanced cancer stage  or higher And more remarkably they have been able to detect very early stage  lung cancer about half the time with a test theyre still working to perfect Now since we can already detect half of them with the current assay were very hopeful that the majority of cases will have detectable DNA Diehn says Researchers at Stanford not only are working to improve the lungcancer test but also are developing tests for other cancers  including lymphomas cancers of the breast esophagus and pancreas But the ultimate holy grail would be to move this to the early detection of cancer says   at Stanford The early detection of cancer could save many lives by being amenable to being treated They arent the only lab on that quest   and colleagues at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine   a blood DNA test targeting  different tumor types The team at the Hopkins Kimmel cancer center also found about half of the earlystage cancers in their volunteers Diaz says even a test that finds early stage cancer only half the time is still a big step forward When you have a stage  tumor the patients feel healthy Diaz says Theyre still going to the gym theyre still performing all their activities of daily living without any sort of feeling that somethings wrong This blood test will detect the cancer at a very early stage  albeit only in  percent of cases The researchers are optimistic they can improve the test so it will catch many more cases but they dont yet know whether thats a matter of better technology or if some tumor DNA will simply always remain hidden And its not entirely clear yet how many false alarms might turn up But even now this emerging DNA technology has many uses For me this is very exciting because there is momentum building in this field Diaz says Many skilled and capable research groups are   so what were going to see is really cool questions answered that we couldnt have answered in any other way And while new medical technologies often drive up the cost of care these researchers hope that a few years from now a cancer blood test will be available for a few hundred dollars Using it could help patients avoid costly scans  and avoid latestage diagnoses when cancer is often more difficult and more expensive to treat
