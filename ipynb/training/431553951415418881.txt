Researchers looking for simple ways to treat autism say they may have explained why at least some cases occur It all has to do with the stress babies undergo at birth Theyre already testing a simple drug for treating kids with autism and say their findings may point to ways to treat the disorder earlier in life Its all experimental but the study published in the journal Science should inspire other researchers to take a closer look This is exciting stuff to people in the field because its getting at a basic mechanism says Andrew Zimmerman of the University of Massachusetts Medical School who reviewed the study Yehezkel BenAri of the Mediterranean Institute of Neurobiology in Marseille France and colleagues have been treating children with autism with a diuretic called bumetanide that reduces levels of chloride in cells Diuretics lower blood pressure by making people urinate more reducing fluid BenAri has had mixed success in his trials in kids and wanted to prove his theory that chloride was the key He worked with two rodent models of autism  theyre the closest things scientists have for replicating autism in a human One has mutated genes linked with autism and another develops autism when given valproate an epilepsy drug blamed for causing autism in the children of mothers who take it while pregnant They looked at what was going on in the brains of the mouse and rat pups just before and after birth Then they gave the mouse and rat moms bumetanide  and fewer of their newborns showed autisticlike behaviors It suggests that a reset button isnt working in the brains of newborns as they are delivered We have proven the concept that in autism indeed chloride is elevated and perhaps our diuretic acts in reducing that BenAri told reporters on a conference call We have shown that if we administer the diuretic to the mother for  hours before and during delivery the offspring is  cured BenAri has founded a company that is looking to develop a drug that might be used to treat autism No one suggests giving any such drug to a pregnant woman and especially not to a newborn Its safety would have to be tested Plus right now theres no way of telling whether a pregnant womans unborn baby is going to develop autism Its impossible in humans  thats the problem Zimmerman says Autism is becoming   among US kids and researchers dont quite understand why The latest survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows  percent of US children   with an autism spectrum disorder which refers to a broad range of symptoms from the relatively mild social awkwardness of Aspergers syndrome to profound mental retardation debilitating repetitive behaviors and an inability to communicate Genetics are a large factor  if one twin has autism the other twin is very likely to  but genes dont explain it all Better diagnosis doesnt explain all of it either and many scientists are looking at what happens in pregnancy Some studies suggest that infections such as   may play a role Theres no cure and no good treatment Zimmerman says the brain is overexcited in autism and BenAri says his study shows that chloride is responsible for at least some of this The process of giving birth can reset the overexcited neurons and the new study in Science suggests that   the socalled love hormone which is released during birth may play a role in doing so The diuretic has similar effects BenAri says He is currently treating kids aged  to  with it but thinks if autism could be diagnosed younger and kids treated younger it might be more useful The possibility for perinatal treatment with an agent such as bumetanide is an enticing possibility for the prevention or early treatment of the disorder BenAris team wrote in their report However this would require an accurate way to determine whom to treat because symptoms of autism spectrum disorder often do not appear until the second year of life The study suggests a way to do this Zimmerman says The blood and amniotic fluid of pregnant women could be tested for chloride levels and the newborns followed to see if those that develop autism wee exposed to more chloride in the womb
