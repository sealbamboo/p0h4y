Recall if you will some of the biggest foodborne illness outbreaks of the past decade There was the nasty   of listeria from cantaloupe in  that killed  people And the ugly     from Foster Farms chicken which has sickened   in multiple states since  What do those outbreaks have in common Well the government solved them tracking down both the food and the pathogen that made people sick Because of that we learned a lot about how to prevent future outbreaks But according to a   released Monday by the Center for Science in the Public Interest the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been reporting and solving fewer and fewer outbreaks over the past decade In fact CSPI says outbreak reporting dropped  percent from  to  Also during this time between  and  percent of all outbreaks reported annually to CDC lacked necessary information such as the contaminated food or contaminant the CSPI report says And that doesnt necessarily mean that fewer Americans are getting sick from their food the group contends Underreporting of outbreaks has reached epidemic proportions said CSPI food safety director Caroline Smith DeWaal in a statement Despite the improvements in food safety policy in the past decade far too many Americans still are getting sick being hospitalized or even dying due to contaminated food How many exactly Some  million people are sickened annually from bugs in their food and of those  are hospitalized and  die according to the CDC The report also notes that people were more likely to get sick from eating out at a restaurant rather than cooking at home and fingers salmonella and norovirus as the most common culprits of illness Now no one is saying these illnesses are easy to investigate When an outbreak strikes the task of figuring out exactly whats making people sick how bad the outbreak could be and where it came from falls to all kinds of government agencies  from local public health departments to the bigwigs at the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration The investigations are often extremely challenging and involve a lot of false leads and confusion But the longer it takes the disease detectives to find the source of the problem and inform consumers how to avoid the tainted food the more people may get sick How might the CDC become more effective in tracking outbreaks Well the agency is asking for more money for tools that can give its detectives more detailed information on pathogens like listeria or salmonella that are making people sick The fancy name for the technology is advanced molecular detection Its a way of doing DNA fingerprinting and sequencing the genome of a pathogen and analyzing it to figure out whether cases are linked to each other The CDC in its most recent budget request for     million to go toward these DNA sequencing tools It says they can help it catch on to illness outbreaks faster respond to them faster and ultimately prevent more cases So far this year the CDC has used DNA to decode listeria infections In one   in which eight people in two states were sickened after eating cheese products from a company in Delaware the CDC said sequencing helped it figure out that five of the strains isolated from the sick people were closely related The agency says it receives reports of about  confirmed cases of listeriosis each year in the US Outbreaks in recent years have been linked to dairy products raw sprouts and cantaloupe The symptoms of listeriosis the disease caused by listeria bacteria are typically fever and muscle aches sometimes with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms Pregnant women the elderly and newborns are the most susceptible to the disease But even though the cheese from the Delaware factory is the outbreak du jour CSPI says that its analysis of outbreaks over the past decade showed that seafood is by far the most hazardous food to eat in terms of the number of illnessesperpound of food consumed
