A brain that trains can stay in the fast lane Thats the message of a   showing that playing a brain training video game for a month can rejuvenate the multitasking abilities of people in their s s and s After training they improved their multitasking beyond the level of yearolds says   one of the studys authors and a brain scientist at the University of California San Francisco And the improvement extended beyond multitasking Gazzaley says Participants also got better at remembering information and paying attention Moreover the training actually changed participants brains Brain wave patterns associated with focus got stronger Gazzaley says So did connections between visual areas of the brain and areas involved in making decisions And tests showed that six months after training the improvements were still there Gazzaley got the idea for a video game after years of publishing papers showing how the ability to multitask declines with age I became inclined to see if we could do something in the lab to actually help he says So with assistance from some professional video game developers Gazzaleys lab came up with a multitasking driving game called NeuroRacer The game has players perform two tasks simultaneously Gazzaley says One is to use a joystick to navigate on this winding road thats going left and right and up and down The second task is to hit a button whenever the player sees a road sign in the form of a green circle To test the game Gazzaleys team recruited  healthy people who ranged in age from  to  years old One of them was Ann Linsley  who says she volunteered in part because she was having mental lapses  like going to the refrigerator and being unable to remember what shed come for When I saw this study I thought Oh cool maybe Ill learn something  she says Linsley and other participants initially played the NeuroRacer game in Gazzaleys lab while researchers studied their brain activity The idea was to gather baseline data so the scientists could look for any changes after the monthlong training After the initial evaluation some participants went home with a laptop version of the game Over the next month these participants played three times a week for an hour As they got better the game got harder Linsley says she didnt want to give back the laptop at the end of the month because every day I was getting a little better at it Participants dramatic improvement in memory and attention suggest that this sort of mental exercise could help older people function better in their daily lives Gazzaley says We know that these cognitive abilities really underlie a lot of our performance in how we interact in the real world he says But Gazzaley cautions that even with a lot of training people dont do a very good job performing several tasks at the same time So driving while talking on the phone or texting is still a bad idea he says Also even though many commercial video games claim to train your brain most have never been evaluated for that purpose Gazzaley says The studys finding confirms earlier research suggesting that healthy brains are still highly capable as they age says   of the University of Michigan As people get older they tend to adopt more conservative strategies when it comes to evaluating information and taking action Meyer says That can slow them down and lead to poor results when they do something like playing a video game that requires quick responses he says But the ability to act quickly hasnt been lost Meyer says And the video game may help in part because it simply encourages older people to adopt a less conservative strategy Meyer who is  says video games are not the only way to keep your brain sharp Exercise is a proven way to preserve mental function he says And so is strenuous mental exercise like reading difficult books or solving tricky math problems Im trying to do a combination of both physical and mental exercise in order to maintain my capacities at the highest possible level for my age Meyer says
