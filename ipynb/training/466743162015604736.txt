Citalopram an antidepressant better known by its commercial name Celexa has a remarkable side effect a new study has found In both mice bred to develop Alzheimers disease and in healthy human volunteers the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or SSRI drives down the production of a protein called betaamyloid which in the brains of those with Alzheimers clumps together in sticky plaques and is thought to shortcircuit the brains wiring In study participants free of Alzheimers disease or any other neuropsychiatric affliction citalopram was found to reduce the concentration of betaamyloid in the cerebrospinal fluid outside of the brain by  Researchers see that as a clear sign that betaamyloid protein in the brain too declines in those taking the antidepressant In older mice bred to develop an animal version of Alzheimers disease a day regimen of citalopram arrested the growth of betaamyloid plaques and reduced the appearance of new plaques by  In healthy volunteers the slowdown in betaamyloid protein production as measured in cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture was virtually immediate occurring within hours of their having receive two doses of citalopram at  mg each The   published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine suggests that the widelyused antidepressant  and possibly several others in the same class  could become a relatively simple cheap and potentially powerful way to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimers when taken by those at greatest risk of developing the devastating dementia That promising news could not come at a more opportune time In their wideranging research on Alzheimers disease scientists have made enormous strides in devising means to detect and diagnose Alzheimers in its earliest stages But theyve had far less success in developing therapies to thwart the disease before its symptoms of memory loss and confusion become evident The result of that mismatch is that many of those at greatest risk of developing Alzheimers dementia feel they have little to gain from early screening for the disease They would live with the knowledge that the disease would rob them of memory independence and even a sense of self But they could do nothing to avert that outcome But Alzheimers specialist Dr Lon Schneider of USC says its far too early for people fearing a future marred by the disease to start taking citalopram particularly at the dosage levels shown to be effective in the current study For starters he noted the success of antifdepressants in preventing Alzheimers disease rests on an assumption that has not always panned out in research that reducing betaamyloid in the brain will change the course of the illness Beyond that Schneider cautioned that an article published two months ago on citalopram as treatment for agitation associated with Alzheimers found further cognitive impairment and cardiac toxicity in those taking it The maximum dose used in the current study  the equivalent of  milligrams  is three times higher than the highest dose recommended for those over  he added People should not start popping citalopram or other antidepressants in the expectation that they will prevent Alzheimers disease said Schneider who was not involved in the latest study They could be doing some substantial harm In the study researchers from University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and Washington University Medical School in St Louis set out to explore the untapped powers of SSRIs to reduce production of betaamyloid Past research has found that while SSRIs do little to improve the clearance of betaamyloid protein from the brain they do reduce the proteins production in the brain Studies tracking the progression of Alzheimers disease have suggested that years and even decades before symptoms appear betaamyloid proteins become more plentiful in the brain and spill into cerebrospinal fluid where they are more easily measured First the proteins aggregate in a sort of soluble goo form and with time they turn into insoluble hard plaques Both can disrupt signals among brain cells but as plaques proliferate normal communication among neurons is completely broken and dementia takes hold That conversion from goo to gunk appears to accelerate when betaamyloid proteins become more concentrated said the researchers Thus in theory a medication that can keep concentrations of betaamyloid low might prevent amyloid plaques from forming altogether Citing their own past research the authors of the article suggested the same effect seems to take place with a wide range of SSRIs In the current study the suppression of betaamyloid production was not only substantial but it could also be detected very rapidly in as few as five minutes after the drug was taken by healthy human volunteers The researchers found the suppression of betaamyloid production to be greater at larger doses of citalopram but the most effective dose tested on mice was comparable to a mg dose of citalopram a dose that is substantially higher than that commonly used to treat those with depression
