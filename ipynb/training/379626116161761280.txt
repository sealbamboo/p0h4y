Five antidepressant drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating obsessivecompulsive disorder But they are sometimes ineffective and guidelines suggest adding an antipsychotic drug to the regimen Now scientists have found that adding cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT may be more effective than an antipsychotic Researchers studied  people with OCD who were taking antidepressants without sufficient improvement They randomized  to the antipsychotic risperidone brand name Risperdal  to a placebo pill and  to exposure and ritual prevention a special form of CBT delivered twice a week over eight weeks All continued their antidepressants as well The study was   and several of the authors have financial relationships with pharmaceutical companies Using wellvalidated scales and questionnaires the researchers found that  percent of the CBT patients responded with reduced symptoms and improved functioning and quality of life About  percent got better on risperidone and  percent on the placebo Its important to discontinue antipsychotics if there isnt continued benefit after four weeks said the lead author Dr Helen Blair Simpson a professor of psychiatry at Columbia OCD patients who still have symptoms should first be offered the addition of CBT and some will achieve minimal symptoms Theres a hopeful message here she added There are good treatments
