December is supposed to be the time of year filled with family gatherings and holiday good cheer For medical residents quite the opposite is true There are no school breaks during residency Being a medical resident is a real job and a stressful one at that Residents   even with caps that max out at  hours for the newbies and up to  hours for those beyond the first year For many of our trainees  especially those fresh out of medical school  this will be the first holiday season without time off Its wellknown among residency program directors like me that interns trainees in their first year enter the doldrums as daylight wanes and they have to come to and leave the hospital in cold darkness At holiday time interns are approaching the midpoint of their year Thats long enough to feel committed to their chosen path but not nearly far enough along to see the finish lines banners Doubts amplify Combine the low emotional ebb with the   that more of our patients die at this time of year and interns feel understandably vulnerable Many wonder at this point if theyve made the right professional choice In   they wonder if theyll survive I remember lamenting my first December having to work straight through A wise mentor helped me reframe my selfpity Its a privilege to work on Christmas he told me Our patients count on us You may not want to be in the hospital but think of what theyre going through He smiled as if he were welcoming me to a special club one that I wasnt wholeheartedly ready to join Your mere presence helps reduce each patients sense of loss I was rotating in intensive care where the outlook for patients can be quite grim on   day regardless of the season A something patient Ill call Will was brought in after paramedics found him unconscious on the street He was in a coma We didnt know the cause but set to work trying to give him every opportunity to arise from the slumber of his critical illness I was on the rotation with two other interns We took turns spending nights in the hospital  each of us taking every third night on call The first night my buddy Paul spent the night at Wills bedside trying to figure out a way to replenish his body with fluid given the massive output that was draining into his urine bag Will had suffered a brain injury One effect was   a condition that meant his kidneys couldnt hold onto his bodys water The result can be rapid dehydration and death Pauls work saved him Paul squeezed a few bags of IV fluid into Will to rehydrate him and administered a drug called   that restored his water balance I was certain I wouldnt have known what to do It soon became clear that Will wouldnt recover from his brain injury His brain had simply been without oxygen too long before Will got medical attention When it was my turn on call the instructions were simple Keep Will alive until his relatives could come and say goodbye in person Wills grieving mother had expressed the wish and we felt honor bound to make it happen We saw ourselves in Will and his mother could easily have been our own Two days later when everybody had said their goodbyes we somberly withdrew the ventilator keeping Will alive He died soon thereafter Years later reflecting on my first holidays in the hospital I realized that my mentors wisdom had been crucial That December Paul and I had started the long process of becoming professionals
