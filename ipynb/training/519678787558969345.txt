A brain imaging technique that uses no radiation and no contrast agent appears to detect the earliest signs of impending cognitive decline in the elderly a new study says  Paired with an assessment that looks for other warning signs researchers said the imaging test may offer an easy  lowcost way to single out seniors at high risk of developing Alzheimers disease for intervention before mental decline is evident In a study of  seniors with no neuropsychiatric diagnosis and  with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment the imaging technique  called arterial spin labeling  detected a telltale spot of low blood flow in the brains posterior cingulate cortex that predicted mental decline  months later Incidental to their findings the researchers also discovered two neuropsychological tests that appeared useful in predicting impending mental decline Neither test assesses memory explicitly and one of the two is not widely used in batteries testing patients for mild cognitive impairment The latest research conducted in Switzerland and the Netherlands was published Tuesday in the journal   Upon recruitment and then  months later the studys  participants who were free of dementia at the outset all took a battery of neurocognitive tests and their brains were scanned using arterial spin labeling At the month mark the subjects were divided into two categories those who were found to have stable cognitive function  subjects and those whose test performance betrayed deteriorating cognitive function  subjects The researchers then compared both groups brain scans using arterial spin labeling with those the  patients with mild cognitive decline Even  months before their mental faculties were judged to be deteriorating the scans of those subjects showed low blood flow in the posterior cingulate cortex a structure that sits atop the midbrain and becomes highly active when our   and we ponder our inner worlds The telltale pattern of low blood flow to the posterior cingulate cortex was also highly evident in the scans of subjects with mild cognitive impairment On average those whose cognitive status showed no downward shift showed normal blood flow to this key brain region In those with impairments the researchers noted a less dramatic trend of low blood flow to the bilateral superior and middle frontal gyrus of the brain part of the brains frontal lobe that governs higherorder thinking Many imaging studies have found that in patients with fullblown Alzheimers disease the posterior cingulate cortex shows dramatically reduced activity and reduced blood flow But the finding that these trends are evident well before Alzheimers sets in is new The authors of the latest study conclude that the technique demonstrated here may help identify those at highest risk of Alzheimers for early intervention But for the close to  million Americans projected to suffer from Alzheimers disease by  no intervention early or otherwise has yet been found to slow or reverse the inexorable loss of memory and function that comes with the condition Still the technique described here may prove useful in helping detect which  promising measures or therapies are working Unlike many scanning techniques including positron emission tomography designed to measure perfusion or blood flow arterial spin labeling introduces no contrast dye into the brain To clock the speed or measure the volume of blood passing through a region scientists magnetically tag certain water protons in circulating blood making them visible by magnetic resonance imaging The techniques low cost and risk make it an attractive option for neuroscience researchers whove been using it for about  years to peer into the brains of healthy subjects as well as for patients who will need repeated scans or who have kidney problems that make the use of contrast dangerous
