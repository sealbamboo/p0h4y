Youre showing a lot for three months With that one line from a wellmeaning Macys sales clerk I felt a rush of anxiety about my body For some women particularly those who have suffered through infertility and miscarriages a swelling baby bump is a badge of honor I wish I could say I have enough confidence to be part of that pack But that day in the Macys maternity section surrounded by the racks of bellyhugging knitwear and boyfriend jeans with added elastic waists all my fears of face bloat and waddling took over It was all I could do to keep from dropping my intended purchases and obsessively nitpicking every detail of my body in the nearby mirrors Since I announced my pregnancy Ive been met with comments from two camps Theres the older generation like my stereotypically overbearing grandmother who starts phone calls with Are you fat yet Then there are my friends particularly those in New York and Los Angeles who immediately recommended that I stop looking in fulllength mirrors These are the same people who ask with a certain degree of admiration and astonishment Did you see how great insert the name of an ethereal yet pregnant friend looked Whats a merely

before She calls it social construction and says that women are taking cues from their culture as to what an ideal body type is And even if a woman can limit pregnancy weight gain there are those getting back into shape issues to contemplate after delivery  sometimes theres a back story behind that postbaby body I met Louisa Kendrick Burton an actress in the Fairfax district at a baby shower six weeks after she delivered twins At the party she was constantly praised for her svelte frame Chances are most of the wellwishers didnt know about the prolonged morning sickness and eventual bed

prebaby state Claire Mysko a body image and eating disorder expert and coauthor of the advice book Does This Pregnancy Make Me Look Fat says that comments and fixations on womens bodies are sometimes

myself asking my sartorically challenged husband for guidance on an outfit selection But there are also days when I look in the mirror rub my belly and smile because Ive accepted the form my body has chosen to take and know that it is not a permanent one Those days I dont mind ending the night with a bowl of ice cream and no it does not come topped with pickles  Women have long been confronted
