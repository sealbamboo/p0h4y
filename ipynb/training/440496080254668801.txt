By Caitlan Reeg. For years, pregnant moms have pumped music into the womb with headphones. Now parents are piping sounds from the inside out.. A new gadget aims to ease the worries of budding parenthood with digital audio and social-networking technology.

It also creates a sound file on parents’ smartphones that can be uploaded to Facebook or email, and hosts an online community of other users.
