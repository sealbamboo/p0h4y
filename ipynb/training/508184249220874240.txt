Dr Walter Willett is the chair of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health Hes also a cows best friend Earlier this month Willett and colleagues who have studied the link between diet and health for decades published a study that followed more than  people over more than  years  and found that the amount of red meat they ate was linked to a rise in risk of premature death The notion that red meat might not be so great for you isnt exactly new but carnivores cried foul Willett answered a few of the critics this week We looked at total mortality And it wasnt too surprising that we did see a linear stepwise increase in risk of dying prematurely with higher red meat consumption We went another step and we compared one serving of red meat to other major protein sources like poultry and fish and legumes In every instance there was an advantage to consuming something else instead of red meat Individuals make their choices on the basis of many factors health outcomes being one religious beliefs concerns about the environment many things But focusing in on health it does appear that the data are quite strong Theres no sharp cutoff But when you get down to maybe one serving of meat or less per week the risk gets pretty low If you really want to go for the lowest possible it does look like not consuming red meat at all or a couple times a year is where youd want to be   No we are not funded by any of those industry sources These studies are funded by the National Institutes of Health I eat poultry and I eat fish Maybe a few times a year I eat red meat That certainly wasnt always my habit I grew up in the Midwest and I think probably I had red meat three times a day like some of the people in the study But Ive seen the data come in In principle the ideal study would take  people and randomly assign some to eating several servings of red meat a day and randomize the others to not consume red meat and then follow them for several decades But that study even with any amount of money in many instances is simply not possible to do Most people dont want to stay on any prescribed diet particularly if theyre living in an environment where other people around them are eating other things We dont know for sure In this study we were investigating red meat as it is consumed in the United States which is mostly lotfed grainfed beef Im quite sure we would not have enough people consuming mostly grassfed beef to be able to look at that on its own There are some differences Omega fatty acid levels are somewhat higher in the grassfed beef But if someones getting other sources of omega fatty acids  if theyre having fish once or twice a week  the additional amount probably wont make too much difference The total fat may be a bit lower But we dont see that the fat per se is really related to the risk of getting heart disease or cancer Cholesterol is more in the lean part of the red meat so thats going to be just as high and maybe even higher in the grassfed animals I think it would be nice to be able to study grassfed beef directly but I think in the meantime its reasonable to assume that the answer is probably not going to be very different from what we saw here Of course yes You can find people who smoked a pack of cigarettes a day and lived to be  too Any one example doesnt make the case It is pretty clear that people back in the s eating all this red meat were not living very long compared to how long were living today Red meat consumption has gone down poultry has gone up There has been a general shift in a better direction in our diets Red meat is not the whole picture but the reduction probably has been a contributor to the reduction in mortality rates that we have today
