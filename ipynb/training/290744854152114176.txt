A smoldering epidemic already affects an estimated  million Americans most of whom dont know it Its   an insidious virus that can hide in the body for two or three decades without causing symptoms  and then wreak havoc with the liver scarring it so extensively that it can fail Half of all people waiting for liver transplants have hepatitis C The virus is also driving a recent twentyfold increase in liver cancer Liver cancer is the fastestgrowing cause of cancer mortality  at a time when most cancer mortality is declining says Dr John Ward of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention A   last fall from the CDC underscores the magnitude of the problem The agency says everybody born between  and   around  million baby boomers  should be tested for hepatitis C Two out of three Americans living with hepatitis C infection are baby boomers Theyre people like yearold Nancy Turner Shes a mental health nurse in Massachusetts who never suspected hepatitis C when she went to her doctor with nagging unspecific symptoms more than three years ago I was feeling a little bit more tired she recalls Just kind of an upset tummytype thing Just chalked it up to stress from work and being busy But tests revealed skyhigh levels of hepatitis C in her blood Turner was devastated she says Her first thought was where I possibly could have gotten it Many baby boomers got hepatitis C by experimenting with illicit drugs  either by injecting or by snorting Either way the virus can get directly into the bloodstream  the only way hepatitis C is transmitted You cant catch it by coughing kissing or sharing a coffee cup Some baby boomers got the virus from having a blood transfusion before  when all donor blood began to be tested for hepatitis C Hepatitis researcher   of Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health says today infections are often discovered when somebody gives blood You go back and talk to them and more than half of them will say Well yeah of course when I was in high school I messed around a little bit but Im not a drug user  Thomas tells Shots Thats the kind of thing that really drove hepatitis C and expanded it in our population back in the s and s Turner says she smoked a little marijuana back then but never experimented with other drugs But she is a nurse and health care workers are at higher risk of catching hepatitis C because they can be exposed to infected blood An accidental needle stick or any break in the skin can do it Turner doesnt recall any such incident Like perhaps a third of hepatitis C patients she may never know the source of her infection Turner went on what was standard treatment at the time she was diagnosed  two potent drugs called   and   Soon her life was disrupted by the side effects  severe fatigue depression and other problems It was a long tough road she says But she was determined to beat the virus And at first the treatment seemed to work I did a year of treatment she says and at that time there was no more hepC virus that was evident When I went back after stopping the drugs for my threemonth blood work it had come back full force Most discouraging day of my life But in  two new drugs   for hepatitis C    brand name Incivek and   Victrelis Turner tried one of those along with the older drugs The new regimen was even tougher She suffered severe rashes and other side effects including a total loss of appetite She lost  pounds Nurse practitioner Kathleen Coleman of Tufts Medical Center in Boston helped her get through it We can get them through therapy she says We do manage the nausea we do manage the anemia we do manage the rash And once again the treatment seemed to work Tests indicated the drugs rapidly cleared the virus from Turners blood as it is for most patients these days Were going from  to  percent clearance rates to    percent clearance rates Coleman says That is a tremendous change Three months after Turner completed this round of treatment she went back for a checkup I actually have been wonderful since the treatment stopped Turner tells Coleman Food tastes wonderful again I think thats my favorite part of this whole thing But the real test is whether the virus doesnt show up in her blood months after treatment stops So Turner says shes walking a little bit on eggshells waiting for that last blood test Recently Turner got the results The virus has roared back unfortunately So shes among the  percent or so who arent cured by the latest drugs But thats not the end of the story There are a couple of dozen new drugs in the pipeline Turner might yet be cured by one of those  and maybe with a lot fewer side effects
