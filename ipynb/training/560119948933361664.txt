Television producer and writer Jason Katims is known for tackling emotional stories Even his new NBC comedy About a Boy deals with bullying and depression But family challenges are most apparent in his dramas especially Parenthood finishing its fifth season on NBC for which Katims sometimes draws on his own experiences Its something that I was very hesitant to do in the beginning because I was not really sure I wanted to tell a story that was that autobiographical What has been so rewarding is the response that weve gotten over the five seasons of the show to that character  and not only to Max but to the family surrounding him Telling the story has been very meaningful to both people who have children on the autism spectrum people who are themselves on the spectrum or to people who just have friends who have kids like that Also Ive gotten so much response from viewers who have other challenges going on with their kids who have found that they very much related to the experience that was being written about in the show One of the things on my mind as my son gets older you start to worry about What is the future People think about autism as something with kids Well those kids grow up Its not an easy story to tell You have an actor like Ray Romano doing it and its just such a fantastic experience telling the story making it feel authentic and real I feel a tremendous amount of responsibility because my wife has been going through that Even after youve finished treatment its still an ongoing story One of the things you realize when you have a health crisis in your immediate family is that life does not stop so that you can go through that experience Life goes on That made me really want to tell that story in this way so yes Kristina is going through this at the same time her husband Adam is still starting whats a relatively new business And then Max decides to run for student council president and it scares the living hell out of them because they dont know how its going to go Its actually one of my favorite story lines this year What is going to be the third act of their life when it gets to the point when theyve raised their kids and they have to make choices about whats next Its about two people who have very different visions of their future but are trying to figure out a way to make it work Its about Zeek having to dig deep to change and evolve My dad passed away a few years ago He was a World War II veteran who had this sort of toughguy persona not unlike Zeek What I found really fascinating in the last decade of his life was how much he was open to new things that never in a million years I thought he would be open to Im proud that weve been able to tell stories that go on for very very long arcs Like the Aspergers story its actually not even an arc it has just become part of the show Its one of the things that I think makes Parenthood what it is We didnt say Oh we want to do a story on autism so some neighbor has autism and its three episodes and youre out
