The crisis begins for the children of Syria before they even leave the hospital At the Taanayel hospital in Lebanon just over the border with Syria there are only  hospital beds but  working isolettes for newborns  just one sign of the humanitarian crisis here on the border Before the conflict about one woman per day gave birth here Now doctors report  births per day plus Csections Syria has lost most of its hospitals in the conflict so many women come here just in time to give birth And although the hospital still sees Lebanese patients Syrian refugees now outnumber Lebanese patients  to one Taanayel was our first stop of the day  and its where I will be spending the next  hours for the NBC News special series Forgotten Syrias Children of War The live documentary will unfold on Tuesday and Wednesday following the lives of Syrian children over  hours on   TODAY and Nightly News Tucked behind two plant nurseries the small Taanayel hospital seems unassuming Through the metal grate on the windows we saw a shepherd tending a flock of sheep Groups of men were drinking strong Turkish coffee in the adjacent caf But the reality is that this small hospital serves more than  percent of Syrian refugees in Lebanon The staff keeps the facility clean but unlike most American hospitals there are no frills In the delivery rooms two almostmothers labored in street clothes side by side in stirrups without a birth coach or even a family member in the tiny room to help them along After the hospital I returned to a refugee camp I had visited just two months ago when I was doing a report on the polio epidemic It is known as onion camp because the fertile land made it an ideal place for growing onions and potatoes and the strong scent of onions was omnipresent I remember this as a rich hot vibrant camp with children running around and small stalls set up throughout When we arrived today however it was almost barren Practically nothing remained from two months ago The air stunk of raw sewage and food scraps I managed to find a woman I met during that previous visit She was pregnant at the time and she has since given birth to a healthy baby She was able to remain on the land because her husband had some carpentry skills and built a semipermanent structure on cinder blocks He was able to find work in Beirut and commutes almost  hours each day Most of her neighbors though had moved on Because of the influx of refugees many are forced to settle on private land and the landowners become de facto landlords  sometimes charging large sums for the privilege of setting up a tent But the refugees find that without the infrastructure provided by humanitarian groups living conditions are sometimes unbearable These are people who left unimaginable wartorn conditions for hopes of a better life in Lebanon but have landed in a relative nomans land with daily uncertainties of how to provide shelter and food for their families Today we watched mothers excitedly take newborns home but the question remains  where are they going and what does the future hold for these children
