Back in August scientists   that the Ebola virus is mutating during this epidemic When a virus spreads between people and reproduces it copies its genetic code in a sloppy way So there can be unpredictable changes In theory its possible that these genetic changes could alter the way that   spreads It could make transmission easier Or it could make it harder to spread But how likely is the virus to switch the way it spreads transmission Currently Ebola is known to spread only through contact with body fluids Some people have worried that Ebola could start spreading between people through the air making it as contagious as a cold or the flu What I can tell you is that this has not happened in the past in any outbreak says   with the Public Health Agency of Canada He has worked on two animal studies looking at Ebola transmission In one   pigs infected with Ebola somehow gave it to monkeys housed in the same room without touching them But there may be other explanations for that study A previous Goats and Soda blog post noted The lead author has pointed out its possible the monkeys caught the virus when droplets from the pigs splashed into their cage during cleaning And another study found no evidence of transmission through the air from infected monkeys to other monkeys He says from one outbreak to the other scientists havent seen a lot of variation in this virus suggesting there may be limits to how much it can change and still be able to infect humans Other virologists say an airborne Ebola virus might be a theoretical possibility But it doesnt keep them up at night Id say its highly unlikely that Ebola virus would be able to do that says   a virologist at Columbia University in New York He says in people this virus has always been transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person I dont know of any human virus that has switched from being transmitted by contact to being transmitted by aerosol in as long as weve been studying viruses you know just over  years he says Think of HIV think of hepatitis C There have been millions of infections These viruses still only spread through body fluids Why should Ebola be different I dont think we need to worry about this says Racaniello I think we need to focus on stopping the epidemic and treating the people and that in itself is a huge job But other virologists are more concerned about the possibility of the virus going airborne This is a real concern and its one for which we cant tell you it will or wont happen says   director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota But it surely is a possibility Osterholm says he doesnt know how likely it is that Ebola could start spreading through the air But the fact that its possible creates an urgent need to stop this outbreak because a respiratory transmitted Ebola virus for the world would be an absolutely catastrophic event As things stand this outbreak is expected to last for months The World Health Organization estimates that some  people will likely become infected And thats with the virus spreading in the same way that it always has
