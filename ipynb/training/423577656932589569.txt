A doctor testifying in the insider trading trial of Mathew Martoma said Wednesday he was "flabbergasted" when he realized the former SAC Capital Advisors LP portfolio manager knew confidential results of a clinical drug trial..  Joel Ross, a New Jersey doctor, said he was "shocked" when Mr. Martoma quoted "exact numbers" to him during a 2008 meeting, because Dr. Ross was one of a small group of doctors who had been given the results shortly before their meeting during a confidential presentation.
