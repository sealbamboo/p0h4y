Multiple brief snacksized portions of exercise may control blood sugar better than a single continuous workout according to new research that adds to a growing body of evidence about the wisdom of spreading exercise throughout the day For some time scientists have been intrigued by the idea that breaking up exercise into repeated short sessions might be as beneficial as longer workouts and most related experiments to date have been encouraging   for instance volunteers controlled their blood pressure better throughout the day if they completed three minute walks rather than one minute stroll  But little research in this area had been directed at people with blood sugar problems So for the new study   scientists in New Zealand recruited nine adult men and women with medically confirmed insulin resistance a common precursor of Type  diabetes The scientists checked their volunteers general health aerobic capacity and blood sugar responses to food As would be expected the volunteers developed severely elevated blood sugar after they ate an unhealthy condition that continued for hours The researchers then asked their participants to exercise in the lab on three separate occasions During one session the men and women walked on a treadmill at a moderate pace for  minutes finishing half an hour before dinner Their blood sugar levels were tracked that day and into the next On the other occasions the volunteers broke their workouts into three bitesize portions which the researchers helpfully dubbed exercise snacks undertaken shortly before breakfast lunch and dinner In one case these snacks consisted of highintensity intervals with the volunteers walking as fast as they could manage for one minute on a treadmill powering down to a gentle stroll for an additional minute and repeating that sequence six times for a total of  minutes In the final session the volunteers again completed three walking intervals but these were interspersed with a minute of highintensity upperbody resistance training using stretchy bands The volunteers would walk for a minute rest hurry from the treadmill to the bands perform as many pulling and woodchopping types of exercises as possible in a minute rest then rush back to the treadmill to complete another walking interval The total exercise time again was  minutes and the sessions were repeated before each meal The results were striking Physical activity of any kind is of course known to lower and regulate blood sugar levels because contracting muscles draw sugar from the bloodstream to fuel their efforts And that finding was reaffirmed here After the minute walk the participants postdinner blood sugar levels were lower than they had been in the baseline testing But only with the two snackingstyle workouts were those effects visible throughout the day not just after dinner and they lingered with volunteers blood sugar remaining lower than during the baseline testing for about  hours after a day of exercise snacking The message for those hoping to keep their blood sugar under control is that brief bouts of exercise several times during the day are likely to be more effective than a single session said James D Cotter a professor at the University of Otago in Dunedin New Zealand who with his doctoral student Monique Francois primarily conducted the research  It seems to help too if the exercise morsels are taxing Highintensity exercise shows a more potent effect on blood sugar than moremoderate exertion Dr Cotter said Of course few people have a treadmill handy to allow for frequent quick bursts of exercise But Dr Cotter said such equipment is not necessary Any activity that rapidly raises your heart rate and leaves you panting and sweaty for  seconds can substitute for treadmill intervals he said  For some people simply walking anywhere will provide ample stimulus whereas fitter individuals might need to go up one or even a few flights of stairs or up a slope or jog somewhere Jogging on the spot would be just as good he said The key is to exert yourself to the point that the exercise feels like about a nine or so on a scale of one to  he said Check with your doctor first before beginning any new exercise program of course Maintain that level of exertion for a minute slow down for a minute and repeat several times Complete several of these exercise hors doeuvres during the day Exercise snacking may not be the ideal away to achieve all health goals however Dr Cotter said For example whether it is optimal for controlling fat mass he said is still unclear despite much research But exercise snacking did have one signal advantage in his study The volunteers enjoyed it far more than the longer sustained workout Dr Cotter said meaning that as with snacking in general they were willing to come back for more
