The European Commission has responded to criticism of its billioneuro Human Brain Project declaring confidence that objections will be satisfied The   also defends the ability of the project to set its own scope which critics have said is too narrow But it says new recommendations for management of the HBP and the balance between its core and partner projects both contentious issues are expected in September Critics cautiously welcomed the reply Under the heading no single roadmap for understanding the human brain Robert Madelin the relevant directorgeneral within the EC responded directly to last weeks   As a public funding agency we take all such signals seriously he wrote We welcome debate Responding to the concern that the HBP concentrates too exclusively on simulations of the brain Mr Madelin stated The exact scope of the project is a matter for the project itself He also addressed the sidelining of cognitive neuroscientists who study the brain from a more topdown functionbased perspective than the bottomup cell and network modelling that is at the heart of the HBP This type of work was recently repositioned outside the core of the project As part of a review of the projects Framework Partnership Agreement a necessary hurdle to unlock funding from within   the EC statement suggested there will be recommendations on the balance between the core project and a number of partnering projects  presumably including cognitive work That review due in September should also address the governance of the overall initiative and is being conducted by highlevel and independent experts wrote Mr Madelin The projects critics had demanded a review by top neuroscientists who are not associated with the HBP Dr Zachary Mainen one of the principal organisers of the protest letter told the BBC he was cautiously optimistic while noting a lack of specific commitments in the ECs response We appreciate the commissions recognition of our concerns and of the importance of neuroscience and a diversity of approaches he said We look forward to working with the commission in the coming weeks and months
