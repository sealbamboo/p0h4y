A couple of months ago at the height of the summer tomato season I gave you a recipe for a delicious   I was so enthralled with the bread that I decided Id come back to it and post a weeks worth of focaccia recipes I made a savory focaccia topped with the last of my cherry tomato crop another one with eggplant and peppers and one with some wild oyster mushrooms I found at my farmers market I also experimented with a dough that contains mashed potatoes as well as the Community Grains whole wheat flour I love the bread was fluffy and moist Then I decided to play around with sweet focaccia I added a small amount of sugar to the dough topped the breads with fruit and nuts drizzled on rosemaryscented olive oil and sprinkled them with chopped rosemary and a little more sugar The combination of the savory woody rosemary and the sweet fruit was wonderful and I found myself eating the breads at breakfast lunch and dinner When they were a few days old I topped them with a little blue cheese or feta and lightly toasted pieces in my toaster oven for a sinfully good treat Toasting one or twodayold focaccia in a toaster oven or on a grill is the perfect way to make this irresistible bread last Focaccia takes more time to make than pizza but I find that its less challenging to make and its more versatile in some ways You can serve it warm or at room temperature as a snack or as a small meal Its easy to transport freezes well and lends itself beautifully to whole grain flour
