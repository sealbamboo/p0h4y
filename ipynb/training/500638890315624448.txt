Depression and anxiety are twice as common in people newlydiagnosed with Parkinsons disease compared with the general population research suggests Writing in the journal Neurology US researchers say depression increases in frequency in Parkinsons patients and is often left untreated Previous research suggests that the diseases impact on the brain can be a trigger for depression Parkinsons UK said depression could be due to a number of causes Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine examined  newlydiagnosed Parkinsons patients and tracked their mental health over two years At the outset  of patients with Parkinsons disease were found to have depression compared with  of a group of healthy volunteers During the followup there was a small rise in the frequency and severity of depression in the group with Parkinsons while in the control group a decrease was noted At the start of the study  of patients with Parkinsons were taking an antidepressant and this increased significantly to  two years later But  of patients who screened positive for depression were still not being treated with medication the study said Dr Daniel Weintraub associate professor of psychiatry and neurology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania said depression in Parkinsons disease was underrecognised There are psychological reasons why people who have been diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease like Parkinsons can become depressed but their brain pathways are also affected by the disease and these are closely associated with mood Prof David Burn from the University of Newcastle who is funded by Parkinsons UK said depression can be a sign of Parkinsons  It is wellrecognised that people do get depression and anxiety up to  years before they develop Parkinsons disease People recognise the tremor and movement problems of Parkinsons but the disease actually starts in the brain affecting certain chemicals This can cause sleep problems initially and can also lead to minor forms of depression Depression can also be a side effect of Parkinsons drugs Because of the range of possible causes Parkinsons UK says it is important that patients speak to their healthcare professional if they are worried about their symptoms  After Robin Williams died in an apparent suicide last week it emerged the actor  who had depression  was in the early stages of Parkinsons disease
