On June   an yearold boy returned home from the UK which was experiencing a large number of mumps cases at the time He then went to a summer camp for Orthodox Jews in upstate New York This turned out to be the spark that led to an outbreak of mumps among Orthodox Jewish communities in and around New York City Ultimately more than  people got sick Many of them were children who had already received the standard immunization  two shots of the measlesmumpsrubella or   vaccine The outbreak which lasted for about a year was largely confined to three neighborhoods in Brooklyn There were also cases in a few towns in Orange Rockland and Sullivan counties in New York and Ocean County New Jersey But mumps spread so widely within the Orthodox Jewish communities in these areas that public health officials concluded that a quarantine the usual response to a mumps outbreak wouldnt work So they tried something new After receiving approval from the   and the   at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the officials administered a third dose of MMR vaccine to children who hadnt yet contracted the disease Why didnt the standard twoshot dose of the vaccine protect the children Public health officials who   in this weeks   say it was the unique style of study in yeshivas religious schools for Orthodox Jews In a yeshiva students are paired up in partnerships called chavrusas The two students in a chavrusa share the same desk and the same book and engage in a vigorous dialogue about the days lesson Throughout the school day which lasts up to  hours in a yeshiva the students rotate among different chavrusas changing their study partner each time Albert Barskey an epidemiologist with the CDC who worked to contain the outbreak says the chavrusa style of studying probably exacerbated the spread of mumps The mumps virus gets around on respiratory droplets saliva and other bodily fluids Because of the close prolonged contact uninfected students were probably bombarded with large amounts of the virus from the infected students and the virus overwhelmed the vaccine Barskey tells Shots Fortunately there were no deaths in this outbreak Less than  percent of the people infected with mumps reported serious complications though Barskey says there was one case of permanent deafness There were also very few side effects to the third dose of the MMR vaccine Of the  students who received an extra dose only  reported any side effects Half of those consisted of pain or swelling at the injection site Public health officials released their   of the third dose in a separate paper published in the journal   Barskey is quick to note that Orthodox Jews arent any more or less susceptible to mumps than any other group Recent outbreaks have also been reported at summer camps and in   Its not necessarily any particular behavioral or religious custom he says Its just being in close quarters
