 The high rate of intracerebral hemorrhage among young Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders appears to be related to race researchers suggested In a cohort of  patients with intracerebral hemorrhage ICH Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders were five times more likely to experience hemorrhagic stroke than Asians according to Kazuma Nakagawa MD of the Queens Medical Center in Honolulu and colleagues That association was independent of all other risk factors including the use of methamphetamine Moreover on average Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders were younger   versus   than Caucasians when they experienced ICH researchers reported here at the International Stroke Conference The Native Pacific Islander population has been aggregated with Asians in stroke studies but there are clear differences that are unique to this population Nakagawa told   We need to study this population as a separate race from Asians so we can effectively intervene to reduce their cardiovascular risk Nakagawa and colleagues had previously conducted a study that found higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors for Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders as well as a disparity in age at the time of ICH onset compared with Asians and whites It was unclear however whether the high rate of methamphetamine abuse among native Pacific Islanders was the real reason for the increased risk of ICH To find out they performed the current retrospective study Nakagawa and colleagues reviewed the records of  ICH patients who were treated at the Queens Medical Center the only primary stroke center in the state of Hawaii between  and  Of these patients  percent were Native Pacific Islanders  percent were Asians and  percent whites Researchers found the incidence of ICH in those younger then  was significantly higher in Native HawaiiansPacific Islanders  percent compared with Asians  percent and Caucasians  percent The Native Pacific Islander cohort also had a higher rate of methamphetamine use  percent compared with Asians  percent and whites  percent Additionally twice as many Pacific Islanders had diabetes compared with whites  percent versus  percent and the same was true regarding hypertension  percent versus  percent To determine independent predictors of ICH researchers constructed four models unadjusted adjusted for meth use adjusted for meth use and untreated hypertension and fully adjusted age all vascular risk factors and meth use But the use of methamphetamine did not escape culpability In all four models methamphetamine use was also independently associated with ICH in young Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders Further studies are needed to determine factors other than methamphetamine abuse that are contributing to the young age of ICH presentation in this unique racial group researchers concluded Source
