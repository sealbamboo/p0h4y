Theres new information on the   of a rare meningitis caused by a fungus that somehow got into a steroid drug Federal officials now say the drug got injected into  patients   more than earlier thought All but one of the  cases reported thus far were caused by a fungus called   that is almost unheard of as a cause of meningitis One nonmeningitis infection in a Michigan patient occurred after the tainted drug was injected into an ankle Fourteen patients have died so far Little is known about how to diagnose and treat this kind of fungal meningitis It can be slowgrowing so officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who previously said the incubation period was a month are now saying that patients and doctors need to be vigilant for headache fever and other symptoms for at least several months following injection Moreover diagnostic tests are unreliable Patients and doctors should not assume that a negative test means there is no infection the CDCs Todd Weber said on a Thursday   Patients may be diagnosed with meningitis but fungal testing may be negative Such patients should be treated with powerful antifungal drugs anyway Weber says This is new territory for public health and the clinical community he says Meanwhile there were new developments in the investigation into how the drug contamination occurred Its shaping up to be a spectacular failure of consumer protection For instance Massachusetts officials say the New England Compounding Center which shipped nearly  doses of the suspect drug called   misled them about its operations Thus they didnt realize the company was operating on such a large scale The regulatory authority of the Massachusetts Board of Pharmacy does not include tracking volumes of medicines says Dr Madeleine Biondolillo of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Likewise she says state officials did not realize until this outbreak that the New England Compounding Center was not following the pharmacy boards requirement that compounding pharmacies dispense drugs only upon receipt of a patientspecific prescription That is its not supposed to ship large quantities of drugs to hospitals clinics and doctors offices for administration to anonymous patients It looks through the investigation as though they have violated that aspect of the state licensing regulations despite their assertions they were operating under the regulations Biondolillo says But others note the New England Compounding Center advertised openly   on the Massachusetts Board of Pharmacy Lax oversight of compounding pharmacies  a type of drug supplier few Americans have heard of  is not a problem that popped up overnight Its a trend that reaches back more than a decade as some compounding pharmacies have gone national Out of an estimated  compounding pharmacies in the nation one pharmacy expert estimates the number of industrialscale firms that ship nationally is in the tens not the hundreds Originally every corner drugstore was a compounding pharmacy custommixing prescriptions patient by patient Federal and state laws still pretend thats what all compounding pharmacies are But Deborah Autor a deputy commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration acknowledges that regulatory authority is outofdate The world has changed a lot since the days of the mortar and pestle Autor said during the Thursday briefing And this is the time for pharmacists for lawmakers for regulators for doctors to sit down and grapple with this new model and come up with a regulatory scheme that appropriately controls the risk Autor clearly believes the FDA needs more authority Some say the FDA could have done more with the authority it has For decades the agency has been aware that compounding pharmacies were morphing into minidrug companies And its been aware that many patients have been injured and killed by their products Unfortunately weve been here before Erin Fox of the University of Utahs Drug Information Service told Shots There have been a number of bad patient outcomes related to compounded drugs Just last year   killed nine patients and injured  others But pharmacy experts say such episodes stretch back to the s Back then the FDA got Congress to pass a law giving it more authority over compounding pharmacies But in  the US Supreme Court struck down its noadvertising provisions on First Amendment grounds and the rest of the statute fell too After that the FDA really had the wind knocked out of its sails in terms of trying to regulate these types of pharmacies says Kevin Outterson a Boston University law professor So regulation has largely been left up to  state boards of pharmacy Jay Campbell director of the North Carolina board says a mistake at an industrialsize compounding pharmacy poses a much bigger problem than one at a corner drugstore The corner drugstore patient may be harmed he says but theres very little risk of that sort of harm being spread among hundreds or even thousands of patients Campbell says the growth of large compounding pharmacies is simply a product of market opportunity and permissive regulation You cant help but look at the scope of some of the things that have been going on and the risk undertaken and not be concerned that greed is an underlying factor here he says
