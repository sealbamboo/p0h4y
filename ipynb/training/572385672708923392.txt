After growing steadily for nearly two decades the rate of Type  diabetes among American adults appears to have stalled according to a comprehensive new study from researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The CDC team said the plateau may be a downstream effect of another positive trend a stabilization of obesity rates in the US first seen in  and  However the metabolic disorder continues to spread among African Americans and Latinos researchers report in Wednesdays edition of the Journal of the American Medical Assn And among Americans ages  to  and those with a high school education or less the likelihood of a diabetes diagnosis is still rising as well Its good news in a way but its not good news for everybody said Shakira Suglia an epidemiologist at Columbia Universitys Mailman School of Public Health who wasnt involved in the JAMA study While many Americans have gotten the message that better food choices and more exercise can keep diabetes at bay she added were just not reaching certain populations The new research assessed changes in the prevalence of diabetes the rate at which the disease is present in an overall population and its incidence the rate at which new diagnoses are made within a given time frame Prevalence gives a sense of a diseases overall public health impact while incidence allows physicians and public health authorities to infer an individuals average risk of developing a disease Collectively measures of incidence and prevalence make it possible to compare the disease risk among groups based on such characteristics as gender age and ethnicity Fueled by the runaway spread of obesity in the s and s the rate of Type  diabetes among American adults ages  to  more than doubled from  in  to  in  the study found In  that figure was essentially unchanged at  In addition for every  Americans in that age group  were diagnosed with diabetes in  and  would be newly diagnosed in  By  that figure fell to  The statistics are based on the responses of  American adults who answered annual health surveys The questionnaire does not distinguish between Type  and Type  diabetes But Type   in which patients are unable to make insulin to convert food into fuel  represents only about  of new diagnoses in adults and experts say theres no reason for it to have become more common By contrast rates of Type  diabetes  in which patients lose their ability to use insulin efficiently  have certainly grown Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are major risk factors for the chronic disease which makes patients more likely to suffer a heart attack stroke kidney failure blindness or pain or numbness in the lower extremities that can lead to amputation The study authors acknowledged that their results probably understate the true prevalence of diabetes in the United States since an estimated  of diabetes sufferers never receive a formal diagnosis If rates of detection have not changed however the findings do provide a useful gauge of the rate and extent of diabetes spread CDC statistics show that in   million Americans  nearly  in   suffered from either Type  or Type  diabetes but only  million knew they had the disease The shifting tides of obesity and diabetes have major economic implications for US healthcare spending Lifetime medical costs for those with diabetes are roughly twice as high as for those without For groups that are still seeing higher rates of diabetes public health experts will have to offer more than exhortation to turn things around Suglia said With certain populations you have to look beyond messages that promote more healthful eating and more exercise she said For adults working two jobs to feed their families or coping with violent neighborhoods these factors fall down on the list of priorities so there has to be a bigger effort to go beyond eat healthy and exercise and to ask How do we facilitate that
