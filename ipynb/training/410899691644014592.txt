Ballet looks elegant and effortless but it is by far one of the most physically demanding professions While all ballet dancers require flexibility strength and stamina male dancers also need tremendous core strength and stability to safely lift carry and hold ballerinas in awkward positions To find out more about how ballet dancers attain their high level of fitness we asked Robert Fairchild a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet to describe his exercise routine Mr Fairchild has been with the company for eight years and he is well known for his acclaimed performances including a   He currently has a leading role in the New York City Ballets annual production of The Nutcracker which is also choreographed by Mr Balanchine and runs through Jan  at Lincoln Center We caught up with Mr Fairchild to talk about his workout the exercises that strengthen his core and why ballet dancers dont grunt like other athletes Heres an edited version of our conversation I started dancing when I was  It was tap I think for little kids having something on the bottom of your feet that makes noise and getting to dance to something thats not necessarily classical music is a really great introduction You learn your musicality and you learn your rhythm I also loved Gene Kelly videos Watching him dance on screen was a huge inspiration for me  I did Shes been in the company three years longer than I have and I would say she was my biggest inspiration Whatever she did I did She played the violin so I played the violin She went to dance so I went to dance  She ended up going to the School of American Ballet which is the school that feeds into the New York City Ballet I did jazz competitions But she saw a competition video of mine and said it would be a good idea for me to do a ballet summer course because ballet is the basis for all dance forms When I came here I was nervous because I was a jazz dancer at a ballet school But ever since that point its been all ballet I just fell in love with it  Ballet is an art form but it also is incredibly athletic The thing about sports is that you can push yourself to your limits but you can grunt you can scream and you can yell to get yourself fired up We have to go out there and do the same amount of physical activity while thinking about a pleasant demeanor It has to look like its the easiest thing youve ever done just pure enjoyment You have this fire but you also have to mask it with ease and poise  Yes The work is so intense in the legs and in the feet and the calves that its not until I get to do partnering where I feel like Im using the same amount of effort in my upper body It requires a lot of core strength because youve got your limbs twisting and moving around and often times for the guys youre holding a girl in those positions So you need the range of motion to go there with your partner and the core strength to hold yourself in those positions  I start in the morning with opening up my lower back because theres so much in dance where youre holding your stomach in as much as you can when youre lifting a girl above your head In order for her to get there she has to go above your head so your upper back is moving backward and your back is getting tight In order to keep it open theres a lot of ball work that we do a lot of rolling out  I like to do gentle stretching and moving I do whats called a downward dog in yoga but I do a variation that Ive been working on with my Pilates instructor Another exercise I do involves inflating a ball  called an overball  putting it behind the back and working the abs in different areas This way I can really pinpoint which parts of my core to work on because the general situp or crunch is not as specific as I need it to be I also work on shoulder stability doing variations of a pushup to warm up my upper body  I think the average person who goes to a gym works their muscles and strengthens them and then stretches at the end But for ballet dancers in order to do the positions we have to roll out our muscles we have to stretch them out in order to start using them and firing them Otherwise if you cant get to the positions that you need to get to whats the point in strengthening the muscles Yes In ballet especially for guys your lower back takes a lot of abuse whether your leg is up at  degrees or youre jumping but especially when youre lifting a girl She has to go right above your head because you just dont have the strength to go straight above So no matter how much youre holding your stomach you are going to go back with her Its complicated but you practice and you do it over and over again and learn what your body can handle and what you need to do to maintain it  Most of the time I eat pretty healthy But I really just have to eat My metabolism is so fast that I have to snack throughout the day otherwise I start to look depleted and pale and really skinny We work from  am to  pm Youre not doing an exercise every second of the day but you can imagine burning that many calories So I have to make sure I eat  a lot  I used to have a superstitious meal before a show I would have a Greek yogurt a Vitamin Water a banana and a Clif Bar That was to make sure I had some fuel to burn without feeling heavy I used to have shakes before a show but then I would have to go to the bathroom right before my entrance and that didnt make sense I realized I was taking in too much liquid and had to find a proper routine that can make you as efficient as possible  The Nutcracker is our sixweek run every holiday season and its a great opportunity for all the kids in the School of American Ballet to dance with the company There are probably as many kids in the production as there are company members My role is the cavalier I present the sugar plum fairy to the audience and I dance with her and its our presentation to Marie and the prince  Our lives have followed the same track We both got into the company We both got promoted to principal at the same time and in the same studio To share being on stage with someone that you love so much is a huge opportunity You work your whole life for this moment to show  people what youve been up to what you feel like your gift is And to get to share that on stage with someone that you share your life with and your love with is pretty cool
