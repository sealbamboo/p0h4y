Treatment for Alzheimers probably needs to begin years or even decades before symptoms of the disease start to appear scientists reported at this weeks Society for Neuroscience meeting in New Orleans By the time an Alzheimers patient is diagnosed even with mild or moderate Alzheimers there is very very extensive neuron death said   of Mount Sinai Medical School in New York And the neurons that die are precisely those neurons that allow you to navigate the world and make sense of the world Once those neurons die he says critical brain circuits involved in thinking and memory are gone forever Morrison said We need to move way back in time and intervene before theres extensive neuron death Morrison and others said its possible that several recent trials of drugs for Alzheimers have failed because the drugs were given after symptoms had already started to appear Its possible weve tested things and discarded them prematurely said Sam Gandy also at Mount Sinai Now that we can see the changes in the brain that underlie Alzheimers we really should reevaluate some of the things weve looked at Its still not clear just how early treatment would have to start But one study presented at the neuroscience meeting suggested it could be a decade or more The study has been following  people as they age said Lori BeasonHeld of the National Institute on Aging Participants have undergone periodic scans that measure the function of certain areas of the brain she says Our study has discovered changes in the brain that occur up to  years before any symptoms occur BeasonHeld said But its likely that the process that leads to Alzheimers begins even earlier she said If we need to stop things before they even start it could be  years before somebody develops the symptoms BeasonHeld said If it turns out that we can reverse some of the pathology then it might be say  years The new interest in early intervention has some scientists reconsidering experimental drugs that   in people But to retest these drugs they would have to be administered to younger people who are not experiencing problems with thinking or memory and might never get Alzheimers That raises some tricky ethical issues Gandy said People have to understand the risks and make the decisions for themselves with their physician whether its right for them to begin a drug for which the longterm risks might not be known he said One group that might take part in that kind of experiment is people with a family history of earlyonset Alzheimers researchers said Despite   in the search for treatments many scientists at the neuroscience meeting still think theyre closing in on drugs that will work One reason is the relatively recent discovery that neurons dont die just because someone is getting older They appear to to remain healthy as long as the connections between them known as synapses remain intact Morrison said So it may be possible to prevent Alzheimers by giving middleaged people drugs that protect these synaptic connections he said This current thinking that neuron death is not inevitable is a far more optimistic view Morrison said And I think we will get to a point where we push back the average onset of Alzheimers and may even decrease its prevalence But some scientists said they were discouraged by the recent failures with Alzheimers drugs Twenty years ago when I began this work I was hoping by  I was going to have a pill for myself said Fred van Leuven a researcher from KU Leuven in Belgium Thats next year and I dont have a pill yet But during the neuroscience meeting Van Leuven also presented a study showing that a new type of drug was able to help mice with an Alzheimerslike condition
