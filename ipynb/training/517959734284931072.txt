Over recent years new institutions targets campaigns and funding have steadily helped drive improvements in cancer care treatment and survival  However in this weeks Scrubbing Up respiratory consultant Dr Toby Maher of the British Lung Foundation argues that while efforts by the Government NHS and other healthcare bodies to fight cancer are welcome other diseases with similar rates of incidence and mortality should be given the same priority Great efforts have rightly been made to improve cancer diagnosis treatment and support in recent years  Last month the government announced an extra m for the Cancer Drugs Fund which covers the cost of expensive cancer treatments This is in addition to the m package announced last year  Over bn has been invested in cancer research in the last  years while multimillion pound awareness campaigns such as Be Clear on Cancer have helped improve public awareness and early diagnosis The National Cancer Intelligence Network now a part of Public Health England has been set up to drive improvements in care standards and clinical outcomes Cancer also has its own Strategic Clinical Network within NHS England to coordinate improvements in care  So far so good  Cancer is a horrible group of diseases The UK still lags behind Europe and the US in many aspects of cancer care so it is absolutely right that we do what we can to tackle it  However is it fair that the kind of efforts mentioned above are not being made for other diseases  Especially when many other medical conditions have survival rates worse than a lot of cancers Take for example one of my main areas of work idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF  a dreadful disease that causes progressive scarring in the lungs making it increasingly difficult to breathe The number of people with IPF in the UK is increasing by around  a year today it kills more people each year around  than leukaemia  It often progresses with devastating speed with half of IPF patients dying usually of respiratory failure within three years of diagnosis  To the terminally ill patients I have met and the grieving loved ones they have left behind IPF is every bit as devastating as any cancer Yet despite this IPF receives nothing like the same level of prioritisation as cancers of comparable mortality like leukaemia  The government invested only  in IPF research last year   leukaemia research received over m from all sources  Awareness is also far lower most of you will have heard of leukaemia but many even within the medical community have never heard of IPF  Unlike for cancer there are an inherent lack of integrated services no Strategic Clinical Network for respiratory diseases and currently no approved quality standards  An urgent referral for an IPF patient can take months  for cancer the vast majority are seen within two weeks As a result IPF patients often endure delayed diagnosis inconsistent care limited or inadequate information concerning their disease limited treatment options and a lack of endoflife palliative care  Added to this we still dont even know what causes IPF let alone how to cure the condition  Ultimately this is costing lives While mortality rates for leukaemia have fallen by almost a fifth over the last  years they have increased sixfold for IPF  Though shocking I therefore understand when IPF patients tell me that they wish they had cancer instead And while IPF may be one of the most significantly neglected diseases it is by no means alone  Im sure many other medical professionals will be nodding their head at this article asking too why their disease area does not receive the same level of prioritisation as cancer despite having similar incidence progression and morality rates Of course cancer is horrible and it is right that we do what we can to tackle it  However to the thousands of patients and loved ones living with equally devastating diseases it does seem unfair that their condition isnt receiving the same level of prioritisation just because its name does not contain the dreaded Cword The focus of government the NHS and other healthcare bodies should be to help ill people live longer happier healthier lives  The name of the disease which happens to be causing a persons illness should not be the factor which determines their standard of care
