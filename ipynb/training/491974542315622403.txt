A woman is about to give birth It will be her second child and shes not looking to have a third anytime soon She doesnt want to take birth control pills while shes breastfeeding And condoms arent as errorproof as shed like There are a couple of alternatives that are safe effective and could work for years   or   Shell need a doctor to get those Heres the catch Her Medicaid plan wont pay for contraception if she tries to get it while shes still at the hospital New York has just joined five other states in making it easier for our fictional mom to have access to the kind of family planning options she was seeking without worrying about the price tag At first glance this is a technical issue about Medicaid reimbursements But it is also about postpartum contraception and which women have access to it There are a number of reasons why states would want women who have just given birth to have access to birth control For one waiting longer before having another baby is   Plus   that paying for birth control is cheaper in the long run The bottom line priority is to remove barriers to contraception says Deborah Kaplan New York Citys assistant health commissioner A relatively small group of people is directly affected by the policy change   by New York state and city health officials on July  It relates only to women in the Medicaid   who have just given birth With a feeforservice plan health care providers get money from Medicaid so that lowincome people can get the care they need without the cost There are rules of course about what the plan will pay for In most states for example Medicaid will not reimburse the doctor for delivering a baby and giving a woman an IUD in the same visit If the mom waits six weeks for a postpartum appointment she can get an IUD and her doctor will get money from Medicaid But women are much less likely to get contraception at that point says Kaplan So New York has changed its Medicaid reimbursement rules Now women with feeforservice plans can get an IUD or implant immediately after giving birth IUDs and implants are not popular with women in the US despite being   of birth control Womens health advocates are   to consider them With the Affordable Care Act new insurance plans should fully cover these methods though there are exceptions An IUD is a Tshaped piece of plastic that is put inside the uterus by a health care provider One type of IUD releases hormones to prevent fertilization and another uses copper to fight off sperm The kind with hormones can stay put for  to  years the one with copper lasts for about  The hormonal implant is a flexible rod about the size of a match that goes just under the skin in the upper arm yes you have to go to the doctors office for this one too It also uses hormones to prevent pregnancy It works for three years No daily reminders or regular pharmacy trips needed with these methods If a woman decides she wants to have a baby she can have a doctor take out the IUD or the implant at any time With hormonal birth control such as the pill there are    particularly for women who plan to breastfeed But the hormone found in the IUD and the implant progestin is   for women who are breastfeeding New York is not trying to imply that IUDs and implants are the best choice for everyone Kaplan told Shots But the state is trying to make a point We want women to have the options she says and then work with their provider to make the best decision with all the information available Kaplan says New York officials are hoping that this small policy decision will persuade other states and insurance providers to look at their coverage too
