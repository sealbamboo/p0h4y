When I invited people over for brunch not long ago the last thing I expected was a wander into the murky world of food preservatives It started off so simply  with enchiladas in fact Enchiladas are my goto brunch dish mostly because a little store near me stocks incredible tortillas from a local factory in Maryland called   The tortillas are made only from corn salt and lime the same way theyve been made for hundreds of years They are pliant and delicate yet still a good chew I love to dip them in hot homemade salsa not oil wrap them around whatever fresh local produce I can find top them with cheese and steam them in the oven We make  tortillas a day Karen Ponce of Moctec informed me when I called there recently Weve been doing this since the s with only fresh ingredients But the day before my party I discovered my neighborhood place had stopped carrying Moctec tortillas So I went to four Latin American bodegas and two large local chain grocery stores in search of corn tortillas My options were a far cry from the Moctec tortillas Id grown to love All of the corn tortillas carried by the stores were made on the other side of the country And when I scrutinized the labels I discovered that they all contained not one but   different kinds of parabens  are chemical preservatives and Ive spent years trying to avoid them in beauty products and sunscreen  But to be honest Im not even sure why Probably I read someplace it was a good idea and when youre living in a world so awash in mysterious chemicals and antibiotics it just seemed like an easy thing to control  So it was troubling to see parabens when I checked the tortilla labels Historically tortilla production in Latin America where they originated and beyond has been very local but increasingly in the US people depend on tortillas that arent made where they live People who live in northern Michigan for example or parts of New York state or Washington DC are buying tortillas that require preservatives to stay fresh But I discovered that parabens are in all kinds of food Scientists in Albany NY found them in  percent of the food they bought in local markets  they wrote about it in a    published by the journal  So how much should we worry about parabens I called Dr   who studies food safety at Cornell University to find out She told me that most of the concerns about parabens in food arose from a    published in the   But she wasnt all that impressed with the findings which claimed a link between breast tumors and the concentration of parabens in the tissues You see a lot of shampoos and beauty products advertising now as parabenfree because of the media attention that study received not because of the science itself she said The problem with the study Mukai said is that it didnt compare the tumorous tissue to normal breast tissue to see if similar concentrations of parabens could be found there too And she said the researchers only examined tissues in one part of the breast  the part nearest to the armpit So their suggestion was that deodorant was causing breast tumors she said Because they didnt have a patient without a breast tumor they didnt have a control group So that research doesnt really tell us anything Mukai said some parabens are naturally occurring They act as antimicrobial agents in some fruits wine and other edible plants When I asked her why we need to add synthetic ones to our food Mukai said well parabens are cheap As a preservative they get lots of food to lots of people who need it Parabens have been used for more than  years  and they are safe she said She said no direct link has ever been found between parabens and cancer But more research needs to be done she said to understand whether they have any effect on health Fine Im still going for Moctec tortillas whenever I can
