 Achille Guémou was one of three health workers to survive Ebola after becoming infected in late August while performing a caesarean section on a woman who had the disease but hadn’t yet been diagnosed.. Now, the 44-year-old Guinean says he is considering donating his blood to help others conquer the virus as well. In return, though, he wants compensation such as food or medical care, along with help finding a job in an anti-Ebola campaign. The illness has ruined his status in the neighborhood, he said.
