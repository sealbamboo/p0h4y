If we hit the gym dont we deserve a little extra something maybe something sinfully sweet The idea that sacrifice begets reward is embedded in our collective thinking But a fascinating new study from the folks at the Cornell Food and Brand Lab shows how this thinking might backfire Thinking of exercise as work can lure us into mindlessly devouring calorie bombs such as a big helping of pudding or extra handfuls of MMs And compensating for physical activity with sweet treats this way may lead to weight gain  a professor of marketing and his colleagues studied the behaviors of two groups of adults who were attending a consumer camp at Cornell Just before lunch a guide led one group on a walk framed as scenic to enjoy the view of the lake and wildlife They walked  kilometers or a little more than a mile Another group was led on the same walk at the same pace But their guide framed the walk as exercise as a real workout Halfmile to go the guide would call out encouraging them to go the distance Then Wansink observed what the participants ate at lunch The group that had framed their walk as exercise ended up taking  percent more chocolate pudding than the scenic walk group Wansink tells The Salt And it wasnt even supertasty stuff it was pudding from a can served in a bowl The   is published in   this month So was Wansink surprised that scenic walkers who believed they were just supposed to be enjoying the birds and the stroll ate so much less I knew the compensation would happen Wansink says What I found surprising is that  it only really happens with dessert The exercisers didnt eat more salad or vegetables Wansink found similar differences among another group of campers who were instructed to listen to music as they walked The guide told them to focus on the music asking them for instance where they heard the music more clearly Wansink documented that the musicfocused walkers consumed far fewer MMs offered up as a snack after the stroll compared with participants who had just focused on the exercise of walking Its a lesson in how we frame things in our mind Dont think of your workout as well work This might bias you to seek a reward at the end and snack more Do whatever you can to make your workout fun says Wansink Play music watch a video or simply be grateful that youre working   instead of working   the office You can find more tips from Wansink and his team on how to eat mindfully at
