Remember when Angelina Jolie decided to have a double mastectomy to reduce her risk of breast cancer The Hollywood star   her experience in   in May Her story got a lot of   about preventive mastectomies But it didnt do much to increase peoples understanding of breast cancer risk a study found Researchers at the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins surveyed over  Americans and found that while  out of  knew that Jolie had gotten a mastectomy fewer than  percent properly understood Jolies condition The   were published this week in the journal   Jolie whose mother died of breast cancer at  said she decided to have both her breasts removed after discovering that she carried a rare gene mutation that increased her risk of cancer Indeed Jolie might have gotten some people more confused about how a family history of cancer plays into an individuals risk the survey found The researchers surveyed participants while Jolies story was still fresh in their minds  within three weeks of when she published her piece in the   Having a family history of breast cancer wasnt related to a better understanding of the disease according to the study And women were actually a little less knowledgeable than men Celebrities are not health educators says lead researcher   a professor of public health at the University of Maryland Instead Borzekowski tells Shots celebrities are good at raising awareness I actually think that what Jolie did was extremely courageous Borzekowski says I think its a positive thing News coverage about Jolies mastectomy tended to gloss over how rare her situation was another   found The   that Jolie has accounts for only  to  percent of all breast cancer cases Its not surprising that people dont retain the details says   director of the graduate bioethics program at Columbia University especially with rare and complex cases Overall the point is there was more awareness he says If more women are aware that their genes could affect their risk of breast cancer theyre more likely to ask their doctors about it according to Klitzman And Jolie has very likely played a role in reducing the stigma associated with mastectomies Klitzman says A   show that there was a slight increase in awareness about AIDS after Magic Johnson announced he was HIVpositive in the s But celebrities can have negative effects on peoples health if they spread inaccurate information Jenny McCarthy is the most recent poster child for this says   a professor of general medicine and population health at New York Universitys Langone School of Medicine and the author of  In  McCarthy said her son had been diagnosed with autism which she attributed to vaccines But numerous studies have shown that vaccines dont cause autism The actress remains a very vocal critic of vaccines This can be an issue Lerner tells Shots if people read a celebritys opinion and think they fully understand the issue But I found that most celebrities who come out and do this are being pretty altruistic and sincere Lerner says And he says Jolies oped at least was very thoroughly researched
