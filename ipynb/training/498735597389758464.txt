When people lose their vision as they get older they lose a lot of other things too They lose their ability to do the things they love You cant read you cant cook and you cant socialize  and as a result you may become demoralized withdrawn and depressed says   a geriatric psychiatrist at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia Rovner is not talking about typical eyesight deterioration as we age Hes talking about a specific condition called agerelated   which in severe cases afflicts about  million older Americans The macula is the central part of the retina that contains the densest concentration of lightsensing receptors and its crucial for making out fine details Perhaps the scariest part of the loss is that people often cant recognize faces or read someones facial expression If you cant see somebodys face you feel disengaged and frightened Rovner says The consequence is you may withdraw many people withdraw In fact research suggests about  percent of people with macular degeneration in both eyes go on to develop   So Rovner decided to test a style of psychological therapy called   This treatment helps give patients strategies to build on whatever functional vision they have so they can continue their daytoday activities and carry on an active social life Rovner wanted to see if the approach would help people with macular degeneration ward off depression He recruited  people mostly women in their early to mids who had agerelated macular degeneration in both eyes and mild depressive symptoms Each was considered at risk for more severe clinical depression Everyone in   had a therapist come to their house six different times in two months In half the cases the therapists simply talked to patients for an hour about their vision loss and disability In the other half the therapists used the hour to help the patient develop a strategy for coping with the lost vision Marilyn Freedman took part in the study Shes  years old and lives in Cherry Hill New Jersey Freedman developed macular degeneration in both eyes and as the condition worsened she was starting to get depressed Many of the things she loved  reading watching television driving  were becoming difficult she says My world was stopping I couldnt do anything anymore But the most depressing thing for Freedman was to no longer be able to cook or bake for her big family If I cant read a recipe I cant bake she says That stopped me right there I didnt do any more baking Freedman was put in the group that was given behavior activation therapy For Freedman that meant writing giantsized recipes with one ingredient on every page One page had a cup of sugar the next page will be a spoonful of salt the next page would be three eggs she says It was a simple plan but it soon got Freedman back in the kitchen Now she says shes cooking entire dinners again for her family Each person in the study got different strategies Some people wanted to get out and socialize again so their plan included calling a friend at regular set times to schedule an outing Book lovers were encouraged to update the yearold lighting in their homes and invest in a variety of different magnifiers that enabled them to keep reading Patients who could no longer recognize faces were encouraged to admit the vision loss to their friends instead of withdrawing out of fear of making a mistake or seeming rude The results were dramatic Patients in the study who created a plan and stuck to it cut their risk of depression by more than half Rovner says compared to those who received only the talk therapy Vision is the primary way sighted people engage in the world he says If you can help someone who is losing their sight come up with coping strategies theres a good chance youll keep them engaged  and keep depression at bad People tend to ruminate on what theyve lost says Rovner Thats why we say Do the plan Follow the plan not your feelings
