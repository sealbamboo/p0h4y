Older people are working more voting more and drinking and smoking less than they used to Thats the good news But nearly threequarters of older men and about twothirds of women over age  are overweight or obese making them more likely to have to deal with diabetes arthritis and impaired mobility This snapshot of the new reality of aging comes in a   from the US Census Bureau that was released Monday by the National Institute on Aging The biggest bad news Chronic diseases among older Americans are on the rise and because of demographic changes there may be fewer people to care for the growing population of older adults The  population is now over  million and is expected to more than double by  In earlier reports the Census Bureau estimated that  in  Americans will be  years old or older by  Thats one more big social shift caused by the baby boomer generation So who will care for all these older sicker people The cost of longterm care varies widely but its not cheap in any form The average cost of a nursing home is more than  a year Less than  percent of older people can afford to live in a nursing home for more than three years and nearly twothirds cant even afford a year of nursing home care So its probably fortunate that fewer older adults are becoming longterm nursing home residents In   percent of the older population resided in nursing homes the Census report found By  that number was just over  percent Medicaid the government program that pays for longterm care when an individuals funds run out has accelerated that trend by shifting funds away from nursing homes In  just  percent of Medicaid funds for longterm care were spent on home and communitybased services In  that number had almost tripled to  percent The vast majority of longterm care for the aging is provided by unpaid family caregivers but baby boomers have had fewer kids than their parents and more divorces Combined with that generations sheer size it means that there will be fewer family caregivers available for aging boomers In  when the tail end of the baby boomer generation reaches  there will be fewer than three people of working age to support each older person Other highlights from the study
