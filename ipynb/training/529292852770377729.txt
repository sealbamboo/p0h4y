indoors alone in bed indefinitely That would hardly be a life worth living But many people do respond to health risks however small in ways that take joy out of their lives all the while falsely believing that they are protecting themselves I once wrote that there are as many cancercausing mutagens in two raw mushrooms as in a serving of peanut butter It was supposed to be reassuring but a reader lamented Now I cant eat mushrooms What health risks do you worry about and how do those concerns affect your behavior Do you become anxious after learning of a new or increasing threat no matter how remote Or do you ignore the risk of developing a common and possibly lifethreatening ailment like heart disease or the flu resisting protective measures and persisting in behaviors even if they increase your risk In an ideal world people would base medical decisions on an unbiased evaluation of available evidence But people are often irrational and many perhaps most of their actions are driven more by emotion than facts Fearmongering intentional or otherwise is epidemic now that every health threat  real potential or imagined  can instantly go viral on the Internet Widely disseminated graphic images of people dying of Ebola for instance have greatly enhanced the publics fear But even without instant communication panic can ensue A childs risk of getting cancer from asbestos insulation in a school building is about one third the chance of being struck by lightning Dr Lisa Rosenbaum   in The New England Journal of Medicine Nevertheless in  frightened New York City parents agitated for asbestos removal from schools Although many experts endorsed containment not removal as a saner and safer solution fear prevailed Billions of dollars were spent on asbestos removal that should have been spent on education And removal probably increased  not decreased  childrens exposure to airborne asbestos Many medical decisions involve considerable uncertainty and complex tradeoffs wrote Dr Rosenbaum a national correspondent for the journal And while it is widely believed that better educating and informing prospective patients will keep them from acting irrationally she cited studies that clearly show otherwise Sometimes in fact more information can heighten peoples concerns and prompt them to act in ways unsupported by evidence For example one study used   to reassure parents that vaccinating children against measles can be lifesaving and is not linked to autism The effort not only failed to increase vaccination intent but also cemented some parents conviction that there is a link between vaccines and autism Dr Rosenbaum wrote People did not respond as expected Dr Rosenbaum said in an interview Many got even more freaked out Research by Dan Kahan who heads the Cultural Cognition Project at Yale University indicates that people pick and choose evidence that   and the groups they belong to That partly explains the persistent belief among some parents in a link between vaccines and autism or in the risks of genetically modified foods We dont process negative events only positive ones Anyone who doesnt get Ebola falls beneath the radar Dr Rosenbaum said No one wants to hear Calm downÂ  As shown with Ebola people are more fearful of things they cant control however remote the risk may be In her book Communicating Health Risks to the Public A Global Perspective Dawn Hillier wrote of genetically modified foods The public views GM foods as riskier to health than natural carcinogens because they believe they have no control over their exposure to the GM foods they consume I think one of the biggest problems in the face of fear is how unforgiving we are Dr Rosenbaum said When were scared we have this zerotolerance policy How many times has the CDC had to deal with an Ebola scare in the US Never So its not going to go perfectly We have to forgive little bumps along the way We cant ask people not to be scared but we can ask them to forgive In another   that preceded the Ebola outbreak she wrote The big the dramatic and the memorable occupy far more of our worry budget than the things that kill with far greater frequency strokes diabetes heart disease In the interview she said Even though youre far more likely to die of cardiovascular disease youre inclined to fear Ebola more Current efforts to have patients participate in medical decisions must go way beyond conveying information she added People interpret information according to their preconceived notions Their sense of risk is often determined less by facts than by their feelings and emotions she said Emotions also strongly influence peoples desire to be screened for various cancers As Dr H Gilbert Welch of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice   patients have been taught to think there are no harms in cancer screening Its always good to know It is just about gathering information Of course you want it It is a braindead decision But all screening tests have benefits and risks that should be considered before deciding to undergo them The most serious risks are overdiagnosis of a condition that turns out not to exist and overtreatment for conditions that would never have compromised the patients survival Yet even knowing this many  perhaps most  people still opt for screening In an   Dr Joann G Elmore and Dr Barnett S Kramer emphasized the need for physicians to discuss with patients their values and personal philosophies Does the patient think that less is more prefer to minimize his or her interactions with the medical care system or want to do anything that might yield some benefit even if it comes at a cost or with potential risks
