You noticed that your pants were getting a little snug but didnt think much of it When you could barely button your favorite skirt you forced yourself onto a scale and discovered youd gained eight pounds But why You havent changed your eating or exercise habits Chances are you overlooked some of the most common weightgain culprits Frequent dining out nighttime snacks in front of the television and even your fondness for coffee can all cause a slowbutsteady weight gain Once you identify and combat these hidden fat traps youll find it easier to shed pounds and maintain a healthy weight Getting older is one of the most frequently overlooked reasons for gaining weight says Sheah Rarback RD a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association based in Miami Youre more susceptible to weight gain with every passing decade because your metabolism slows and you lose muscle mass says Rarback What that means is you cant eat the same way you did when you were twenty If you do youll gain weight Strength training helps build muscle mass and combat this effect of aging says personal trainer Brad Schoenfeld author of   Generally speaking a pound of muscle burns about fifty calories a day he says So if you add a pound of muscle youll increase your metabolic rate by about that much Adding muscle keeps your bones strong as well If you spend most evenings curled up on the couch watching TV chances are you snack too And those snacks can add up to hundreds or even thousands of calories Eating in front of the set distracts you from how much youre consuming causing you to eat even more Studies also show that women eat less when they concentrate on their food If you sit in front of the TV every night and eat then every time the TV comes on youll have the urge to eat warns Jackie Berning RD an assistant professor of   at the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs Women tend to undereat during the day so they overeat at night says Berning Make sure you eat enough at mealtimes so youre not hungry for a snack after dinner Most importantly turn off the TV whenever you eat Americans waistlines have been growing along with portion sizes Even snack foods are growing increasingly larger But the battle can be won Leah Ingram of New Hope Pennsylvania has kept  pounds off for more than a year and a half just by controlling her portions I have peanut butter on toast every morning for breakfast Before I lost weight I slopped peanut butter on the toast says Leah But now I measure out a tablespoon and make it last Eyeballing doesnt work because its too easy to add more and suddenly your pants are tight Have the treat but   says Rarback Even if its a snack food such as chips or peanuts put a small portion on a plate If youre reaching into the bag you dont realize how much youre eating You can also buy individual snack bags at the grocery store or make your own portionsize snacks using sandwich bags If you   frequently its almost impossible not to overeat In fact a study found that restaurant portions of foods like hamburgers and French fries are two to five times larger than they should be Theres a mentality that says If Im going to pay for it Im going to eat it says Berning And were paying for it with the high incidence of obesity in this country We also tend to think of eating out as special so we choose fattier foods Its easy to think I dont have to prepare it and therefore Im going to treat myself says Berning In addition to restricting the number of meals you allow yourself to eat out implementing portion control is extremely important Eat only half of your meal and leave the rest or take it home in a doggie bag If you dont like leftovers ask your dinner partner if he or she would like to split a meal A lot of busy women skip breakfast and live off coffee during the morning hours This not only affects your waistline but also your performance and mood Studies show that breakfast eaters are more alert and retain information more easily than breakfast skippers plus theyre less likely to be depressed Missing this critical morning meal can also lead to overeating later in the day People think if they skipped breakfast they deserve to snack or to eat more at lunch says Joan Carter RD a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association based in Houston Once youre starving all bets are off in terms of eating sensibly One study showed that  percent of people who lost more than  pounds and kept it off ate breakfast every morning Always make time for this essential meal even if its just a banana and yogurt eaten on the run Do you nibble as you cook Finish the fries off your kids plates Some moms tend to finish the familys dinners whether its the last crust of pizza or the last few bites of pasta says Carter You can easily consume  or  calories without even noticing it  If youve fallen into this habit remind yourself that its OK to throw food away Serve your kids smaller portions or save the leftovers for the next day Five years ago you probably just had regular   in the morning If youve switched to a latte or mocha have you accounted for the additional calories Even bottled drinks that say health or vitality or energy can be loaded with calories says Rarback Juices are a source of good nutrients but some have the same amount of calories as soda does You dont have to give up your favorite drinks Just make sure youre aware of the calories consumed since they can add on the pounds Also drink plenty of water If youre thirsty that should be your first choice How many of your meals and snacks come in plastic The more packaged foods you eat the more likely you are to be consuming empty calories that add pounds People dont eat enough unprocessed foods says Carter Generally the less processed the food the higher the   More fiber means your stomach stays full and you feel satisfied for a longer period of time Opt for fruits vegetables and whole grains instead of packaged processed foods Foods that are less processed such as dense wholegrain breads salads broccoli and other vegetables force you to be more aware of what youre eating says Carter Having a snack is not inherently bad It can serve as a bridge between meals and help you maintain your energy level throughout the day But if youre constantly putting food in your mouth most likely youre going to gain weight Recognize the reason for your snacking It may be because youre bored or thirsty I tell people to drink a lot of water throughout the day in order to maintain hydration Most people snack less when they do this says Berning To become more aware of how much youre snacking keep a food journal You may be surprised at what you are actually eating Karen Preston  of Portland Oregon a customerservice representative lost  pounds over three years and four months She kept a food journal to record her eating and exercise and continues to keep one today Losing weight is hard enough but keeping it off can be an ongoing battle especially as you get older Although you dont have to diet for the rest of your life you do need to pay attention to your eating and exercise habits Weigh yourself once a week or notice how your clothes fit to keep track of where you are Even after youre done with the strict diet its still important to pay attention to what youre eating and to remain physically active Karen bought a diamond and ruby ring to celebrate her weight loss and she wears it to keep herself motivated and on track I only wear the ring if Im at my goal weight or below she explains A visual reminder really helps me stay on target While there are hundreds of lowfat reducedcalorie and lite versions of your favorite foods available not all of them are good for you Watch out for these hidden fattrap foods that can derail even the most dedicated dieters progress A ounce Starbucks Coffee Frappuccino has  calories Toss in a scone and youve just had  calories for breakfast You may use this in recipes thinking its leaner than ground beef but percentlean ground beef can actually have less fat and calories than ground turkey Check the nutrition label on the package before you buy Some versions have half the calories and fat of regular versions but its easy to go overboard If you use lowfat cheese its not an excuse to eat twice as much There are dozens to choose from many of which are enriched with beneficial vitamins and minerals but theyre still high in calories For instance a Balance Gold bar has  calories When you need a quick   choose a piece of fruit instead A salad can be a dieters best weapon if you stick to   and go easy on the dressing But watch the prepared salads and toppings like cheese ham bacon bits and sunflower seeds all of which are high in calories
