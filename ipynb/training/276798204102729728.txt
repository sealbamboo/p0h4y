We all know that nobodys perfect But now scientists have documented that fact on a genetic level Researchers discovered that normal healthy people are walking around with a surprisingly large number of mutations in their genes Its been well known that everyone has flaws in their DNA though for the most part the defects are harmless Its been less clear however just how many mistakes are lurking in someones genes Its such an interesting question that people had been trying to make estimates from indirect approaches for a long time says   of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge England There were estimates that ranged from just a handful up to  or more serious diseaseassociated mutations But TylerSmith and his colleagues wanted to get a more precise direct estimate So they analyzed the DNA of  people from the United States Japan China and Nigeria who had volunteered to have their entire genetic blueprints deciphered through the   Now in a   appearing in the   the researchers are reporting a big surprise We found quite amazingly large numbers of deleterious and known diseasecausing mutations TylerSmith says According to their analysis the average person has around  defects in his or her genes including at least a couple that are associated with disease The weird thing is none of the people whose DNA was studied were sick They all seemed perfectly happy and healthy It could be that in some cases theres another copy of that gene or a similar gene that takes over TylerSmith says About  in  people studied had genetic mutations that should cause a disease but hadnt TylerSmith has a theory Its a bit surprising that people should be walking around apparently healthy yet were seeing known diseasecausing mutations in their genomes he says But the answer was that these tended to be for mild and very often lateonset conditions Things like heart disease an increased risk of developing cancer    Other researchers praised the research for trying to get a handle on what scientists really know about genetic mutations and disease I was very surprised by the total number and frequency that they found says Harvard geneticist   But Green and others say the research also raises serious worries It shows how easily widespread genetic sequencing could find mutations that could scare people for what turns out to be no good reason The critical takehome medicine here  one that needs to be reinforced over and over  is that as we enter the age of genomic medicine simply having a mutation in a disease gene does not mean you have the disease or will get the disease Green says So as   of the University of North Carolina puts it the new study shows were all going to have to get used to the idea that no one is perfect Far from it Were all mutants Evans says The good news is that most of those mutations do not overtly cause disease and we appear to have all kinds of redundancy and backup mechanisms to take care of that
