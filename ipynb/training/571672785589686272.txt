Unless youve been living in a cave youve probably heard of the primalpaleo diets They urge us to eat like a cave man or cave woman and dine like our early ancestors did consuming a diet brimming with foraged veggies seasonal fruit meats and seafood The diets have lasted past the fad stage and show true staying power They also earned a big boost last week when the Food and Drug Administration rolled back its admonitions on cholesterol something the primalpaleo crowd has been saying for years But the lifestyle goes beyond whats on your plate said Mark Sisson a retired triathlete and marathoner turned founder of the Primal Blueprint diet and the popular health website Marks Daily Apple like a caveman is just as important and maybe even more so To be sure our ancestors had to deal with periodic stressors Times when food was scarce Or dodging a fourlegged predator now and again But early humans never had to deal with the ceaseless stressors brought about by todays  workaholic culture Sisson said not to mention crushing commutes financial burdens and the tyranny of smartphones with their neverending need to check one more email account one more social media platform Eating primally is just one aspect of an overall lifestyle said Sisson  And that lifestyle is about the enjoyment of food and life and relationships and activity And as much play as possible We asked Sisson to give us a look at what a perfect day looks like on the primal lifestyle Before you start the eyerolling and the Yeah if only I could afford to be selfemployed and live in Malibu too snark know this Sisson said he hardly ever achieves the perfect day its a goal that he recommits himself to every day The first rule of living like a caveman A good nights sleep I wind down early Sisson said starting at around  pm Dinner is done and he settles in for a little TV with his wife Downton Abbey and Homeland are favorites Then they retire for some quiet time alone and some reading Were talking old school As in actual books Thats because he believes reading on a lightemitting device such as a tablet tinkers with the bodys production of melatonin and can interrupt your ability to sleep He reads by a lamp that uses a special yellow light bulb so that the bodys natural clock is unaffected  and before long hes drifting off to sleep The goal he said is to go to bed so early and sleep so soundly that he wakes up refreshed and without an alarm clock Unless Im trying to catch a plane he joked then I set an alarm He wakes about  am and prepares a mug of organic coffee made strong in a French press He adds a splash of heavy cream because the primal approach embraces animal fats Then he adds  gasp  a spoonful of sugar Everyone has that reaction Sisson said with a laugh early one morning in his kitchen as his two dogs scampered about I enjoy a teaspoonful of sugar in my coffee each day Im not going to deny myself But thats the only sugar Ill have all day What follows is Sissons longstanding ritual enhanced no doubt by the majestic view of the Malibu canyons that rise and fall beyond an infinity pool I do about  minutes of a gratitude exercise he said I enjoy the sensation of the wind on my face or the sunshine and have a real appreciation for  my family my kids my friends and then I think about what I have in store for the day Sisson said he ends the exercise with a thought that centers him and gently reminds him that he is responsible for his choices I ask myself If today were my last day on earth would I be satisfied with what I have done A little spurt of playtime follows Sisson keeps his mind nimble by ripping through six or so puzzles  crosswords Jumbles and Sudokus  that come with his morning newspapers I try to give myself  or  minutes at most to finish them all he said I think my personal record is  minutes and  seconds With his mind caffeinated and revved its time to get to work A barefoot Sisson who also oversees a book publishing platform uses a standing desk and a pebble mat for a dose of tactile stimulation that keeps him alert Theres the usual blizzard of emails and work calls But instead of a midmorning coffee break Sisson heads to the backyard Balancing on a slack line strung between two palm trees about  inches off the ground requires all of his attention lest he topple off Its enough to make him feel like a kid again and clears his mind before he resumes his stance atop the pebble mat Lunch his first meal of the day follows at noonish He keeps it simple according to his primal way of eating often a big salad layered with meat or seafood and a homemade dressing The primal and paleo diets have many similarities and differences might seem nitpicky The primal approach can be a little more forgiving as it allows some forms of dairy is less restrictive regarding legumes and emphasizes overall lifestyle The afternoon work session is broken up once again by a little playtime It could be a hike A little paddle boarding Or a minute HIIT workout  that stands for high intensity interval training Twice a week he logs weightlifting time at a gym One thing he does not do what he calls chronic cardio A former marathoner Sisson earned a qualifying spot at the  US Olympic Trials and finished fourth in the  Ironman World Championship I used to run  miles a day for consecutive days Sisson said But I was always injured I was racefit but I was unhealthy More than  years later he says My overall fitness is way better and Im far healthier And this is a lot easier But what about the rest of us those of us who are chained to an office desk no slack line in sight no nearby hiking trail Im the first to say that I have carved out the perfect life for me Sisson said But everyone can get a good nights sleep and wake up to a cup of rich coffee and a few minutes of gratitude Everyone can find a way to stand up a little more and move around each day he said adding that he coaches newcomers to the primal lifestyle to start just by slashing the junk food and walk more calling it the best exercise that there is And if you cant Sisson said Dont you think its time to consider reorienting and reframing your life and how you live it
