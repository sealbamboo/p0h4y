The bill that prevented the nation from plunging over the fiscal cliff did more than just stop income tax increases and delay acrosstheboard spending cuts It also included several provisions that tweaked Medicare and brought bigger changes to other health care programs The health care change that got the most attention saved doctors who treat Medicare patients from a   A really really big cut says David Bronson president of the   and an internist in Cleveland We know that this would really devastate access to seniors to just cut payment rates by almost  percent says Bronson A pay cut that big would almost certainly drive doctors to stop taking new Medicare patients and perhaps even to drop existing ones But the language in the bill wasnt exactly what doctors were hoping for Its just another oneyear delay in whats become a familiar series since what just about everyone agrees is a   dating back to  Were happy that the cuts arent going into place but were hopeful that somehow this year a longer solution to get a stable payment system for physicians will get done Bronson says Of course thats been the plan every year since  when Congress first started putting off the cuts It hasnt happened yet Hospitals meanwhile arent happy because this socalled doc fix was paid for in part by    billion in Medicare and Medicaid payments to them over the next  years In the shorter term Bronson says doctors are worried about what might happen when the acrosstheboard cuts known as the sequester are back on the table in just eight more weeks Were particularly concerned about graduate medical education he says Thats the program in which the   for the training of young doctors nurses and other medical professionals Thats listed as a potential place where cuts could be made and GME is vital to the medical workforce in this country And we need to be expanding it not reducing it Bronson says But a health care program almost no one was watching was eliminated as part of the fiscal cliff deal It was called the   and it was originally part of the  health law Added to the bill by Democratic   of Massachusetts just before his death the CLASS program was intended to provide publicly administered longtermcare insurance at a modest cost Longterm care in the broadest sense of it is responsible for people including families the  days a year theyre not in the hospital and the  hours a day theyre not in the doctors office says Larry Minnix president of   a group of more than  nonprofit providers of services to seniors and people with disabilities There was no product available for those people and we thought it was time that that gap be filled he says Republicans however saw the CLASS Act as a new and   that couldnt possibly pay for itself We went from something that most every family is going to need but nobody wanted to talk about into the most controversial part of it said Minnix So in   with the entire health law under legal attack Obama officials put the CLASS Act into what Minnix refers to as an administrationinduced coma We understand why they did it It became too controversial at a controversial time Minnix says But the administration had successfully   until now At the insistence of Democratic Sen Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia CLASS was replaced by a new bipartisan commission charged with coming up with plans to help Americans pay for longterm care Its still essentially back to square one for the program Medicare has been a major sticking point in all the recent budget battles And its likely to come up again in upcoming fights over the delayed budget cuts raising the debt ceiling and when last years temporary spending bills expire all before the end of March Were going to have three more cliff issues over the next three months says health policy analyst   But we dont even have a Medicare entitlement fix on the table from either side Which means the th Congress is almost certain to get off to a rocky start
