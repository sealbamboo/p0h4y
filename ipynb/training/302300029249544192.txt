 A new   gene mutations in women a new study finds These mutations significantly boost the risk for breast or ovarian cancer which often develop at an early age in women with the mutations The screen could provide a quick affordable alternative to current genetic testing and may help women and their doctors make decisions about ways to reduce cancer risk according to the authors of the study published Jan  in the journal   The current tool for mutation detection is gene sequencing mapping which is expensive timeconsuming and in many cases lacking clear and decisive clinical decisionmaking information study author Dr Asher Salmon a breast cancer specialist at the Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center in Israel explained in a journal news release In many cases the current sequencing tool identifies a mutation but we do not know if the mutation is neutral or harmful Salmon noted The researchers developed the multiple gene expression profile test after   taken from otherwise healthy women They said that the test is highly accurate affordable and quick In wealthy societies it can become a screening tool for identifying individuals with a very high susceptibility for carrying a mutation so that they can be sent on to more rigorous full DNA mapping Salmon said In societies in which sequencing is not feasible this test can substitute for it with a very high accuracy rate The effectiveness of the test in different racialethnic groups will be assessed in a large study in Europe and North America the researchers said
