Therapists who specialize in   often use a childs own interests toys or obsessions as a way to connect and sometimes to reward effort and progress on social skills The more eye contact a child makes for example the more play time he or she gets with those precious maps or stuffed animals But now a group of scientists and the author of a new book are suggesting that those favorite activities could be harnessed in a deeper more organic way If a child is fascinated with animated characters like Thomas the Tank Engine why not use those characters to prompt and reinforce social development Millions of parents do this routinely if not systematically flopping down on the floor with a socially distant child to playact the characters themselves We individualize therapy to each child already so if the child has an affinity for certain animated characters its absolutely worth studying a therapy that incorporates those characters meaningfully said   director of the child neuroscience laboratory at Yale He and several other researchers including   of MIT   of the University of Cambridge and   are proposing a study to test the approach The idea came from   a former Wall Street Journal reporter whose new book Life Animated describes his familys experience reaching their   son Owen through his fascination with Disney movies like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast It was   that first referred to affinity therapy He approached the researchers to put together a clinical trial based on the idea that some children can develop social and emotional instincts through the characters they love Experts familiar with   say the theory behind the therapy is plausible given whats known from years of studying the effects of other approaches The hypothesis they have put forward is sound and absolutely worth studying said   a professor of psychiatry at the MIND Institute of the University of California Davis If you think about these animated characters theyre strong visual stimuli the emotions of the characters are exaggerated those eyebrows and the big eyes the music accompanying the expressions Watching those characters is the way many of us learned scripts that are appropriate in social situations But Dr Rogers cautioned that using animated characters is hardly the key to reaching all autistic children Many are fascinated by objects or topics without inherent social content  maps for instance But for those who fixate on movies television shows or animated characters affinity therapy makes sense she said The researchers brought together by Mr Suskind have written a proposal for a study of the approach It calls for a week trial for  children with autism ages  to  Half the children would receive affinity therapy using the shows or movies they love as a framework to enhance social interaction building crucial abilities like making eye contact and joint play The other half the control group would engage in the same amount of interaction with a therapist but in free play led by the childs interest Therapists have had some success using the latter approach most notably in a therapy called   developed by   In autism therapy progress is measured in increments and tends to be slow especially in severely affected children experts say But the disorder  the autism spectrum as its known  includes a very diverse group of children whose prospects for improvement are unpredictable and individual Some children develop social skills relatively quickly while others are stubbornly unreachable Dr Pelphrey said that the affinity approach would incorporate many elements of   a type of therapy being intensely studied It incorporates a system of rewards into normal interactions between a therapist or parent and the child playing together Sarah Calzone of Stratford Conn said her son now  years old became more socially adept in a pivotal response trial at Yale The way it works is that for instance one time the therapist was playing with my son blowing bubbles Ms Calzone said Then the therapist stopped and looked away Of course my son still wanted to see the bubbles so he had to stop too and look in the same direction then make eye contact and ask to continue Those two responses making eye contact and socalled perspective taking recognizing another persons point of view developed quickly in the therapy Her son who has engaged in various therapies nearly every day for most of his life is now in regular classes at school Dr Pelphrey said that affinity therapy would deploy some of the same techniques with the therapist playacting a favorite character and inhabiting the scenes with the child Instead of watching Thomas the Tank Engine as a reward for instance we would have the child enter the social setting with Thomas and Percy and the other characters and learn through them about eye contact joint play and friendship he said The scientists plan to submit their study proposal to the   for funding The whole thing has been exciting and a little weird said Mr Suskind now a senior fellow at Harvard having these leading neuroscientists listen to me and say OK what can we do to helpÂ
