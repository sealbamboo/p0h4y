A Novartis scientist and former Vanderbilt University researcher who engaged in research misconduct has been banned from receiving federal funding for three years and has also been dismissed by the drug maker, a Novartis spokesman tells us.  The data found its way into six papers in different medical journals and cited more than 500 times, but are now being retracted.. At the time of publication, the employee worked as a researcher at Vanderbilt University, but Novartis is conducting an internal review to ensure there was no misconduct involving work at its facilities. The episode marks “the first case we’ve seen in which a drug company has immediately fired someone for such revelations,” according to Retration Watch, a blog that follows research misconduct.
