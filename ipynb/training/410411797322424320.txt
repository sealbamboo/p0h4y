Eat candy and fight tooth decay What a sweet concept right Well microbiologists in Berlin are trying to make that dream a reality Theyve created a sugarless mint thats aimed at washing out cavitycausing bacteria from your mouth And the candy works in a curious way Its spiked with dead bacteria Its like probiotics for your teeth The experimental mint is still in the early days of development  and far from reaching the shelves at Walgreens But a study involving a few dozen volunteers   in September suggests that the concept is promising Sucking on the bacterialaced mints lowered the levels of cavitycausing bacteria in the saliva of volunteers microbiologists reported in  So how does the candy work Our mouths are microbial jungles Theyre filled with   of bacteria Most of them are harmless But in terms of tooth decay one critter is the major culprit   These bacteria take sugars in our food and turn them into toothdissolving acids So microbiologist   at Organobalance  a German research and development firm that focuses on probiotics  thought why not get the good bacteria to fight off the bad ones We were looking for something new for oral hygiene Lang tells The Salt Something that specifically recognizes and binds to   but wouldnt kill the other microbes in the mouth Lang and her team screened nearly  different types of bacteria until they found one critter that keeps   from sticking onto the surface of teeth The healthy bacteria called  are found in yogurt and kefir and they seem to stop   even when theyre dead Thats because the good bacteria hook onto   and cause it to clump up Lang says So the researchers spiked a sugarless mint with the dead   and then had people suck on the candies Ten minutes later the researchers measured the levels of the bad bacteria in the volunteers mouths They found that the dead bacteria did strip away some of the   in the volunteers saliva However the effect was small and researchers dont know yet how long it lasts Even so the results are encouraging enough Lang says that her team is planning a larger and longer experiment But   at the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry is more skeptical The concept is sound the research dentist tells The Salt Anything we can do to reduce the concentrations of strep mutans in the mouth is good But its way too early to draw many conclusions he says The reduction by the candy is really temporary and very small he says To fight cavities Bader says the candy would have to go after bacteria stuck in the plaque on the teeth  not bacteria in the saliva What the researchers have shown is that it sucking on the candy has some activity in deactivating   that are freefloating in the mouth he says They still have to prove that it reduces the bacteria in the biofilm on the teeth And that can be a trickier task Bader says For decades he notes dentists thought that a chemical put in sugarless candy and gum called xylitol reduced cavities by killing  inside the plaque But a large longterm   by Bader and his colleagues this year didnt support the claims Even sucking on xylitol lozenges five times a day for three years didnt significantly cut a persons risk for developing cavities the study found Gum manufacturers have taken a long look at the effect of sugarless gum on teeth Bader says People have less plaque when they regularly chew gum but the companies havent shown that they have less caries
