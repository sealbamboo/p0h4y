 Few would argue with the statement that   Between the long hours of classroom and prep work a growing mania for teacher accountability tied to standardized tests and frequent villainization by politicians and the press not to mention dealing day in and day out with unruly students teachers   can take a beating And while some teachers may blow off steam and recharge by going salsa dancing training for triathlons or playing in rock bands a new study by researchers at the University of California San Francisco suggests a novel approach for those looking to find psychological succor and zap stress   The UCSF study published in the April issue of the journal   found that teachers who participated in an eightweek intensive meditation course were less stressed   and depressed Whats more after beginning to meditate the teachers were also more compassionate and empathetic to others The study was conducted by a team of psychologists who wished to analyze the effects of meditation on emotions Previous studies have linked the practice with improvements in such things as metabolism   and blood pressure but less is known about its emotional impact Working with researchers from other universities the UCSF team recruited  female teachers aged  to  who had no previous meditation experience According to a press release published on UCSF Web site the subjects completed  hours of instruction involving three areas of meditative practice sustained focused attention on a specific mental or sensory experience mindfulness practices involving the close examination of ones body and feelings and finally practices designed to promote empathy and compassion toward others In what could only be described as a slam dunk for proponents of meditation the study found that after the course the teachers showed improved understanding of the relationship between their thoughts and emotions and were able to better recognize emotions in others and their own emotional patterns so they could better resolve difficult problems in their relationships UCSF psychologist Margaret Kemeny lead author of the study noted in the universitys release that further research is needed on meditations longterm emotional effects particularly once the glow of the experience wears off as she puts it Yet Kemeny is upbeat about her teams initial findings of meditations beneficial influence on emotional behavior And not just for teachers either The study is particularly important because opportunities for reflection and contemplation seem to be fading in our fastpaced technologydriven culture she says in the release
