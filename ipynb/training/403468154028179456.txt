Trying to hold onto a job while caring for a family member is a tough juggling act Caregivers sometimes have to arrive late or leave early cut back to parttime work and decline travel or promotions For women these competing responsibilities may prove particularly perilous a study recently published in the Journal of Applied Gerontology suggests Women who are caregivers are also   compared to women who are not caregivers Yet for men caregiving has no impact on employment status The authors two professors of social work unearthed these patterns in national data gathered in  in the Health and Retirement Study They looked at participants aged  to  more than  people roughly a third of them family caregivers About  percent were caring for a spouse  percent for a grandchild and about  percent for a parent some took care of more than one relative Every study seems to use a different definition of caregiving In this case the researchers defined it as caring for parents or grandchildren for at least  hours over two years spousal caregivers had no minimum time requirement As in virtually every other study women were more likely to care for parents Seven percent of the total sample assisted with parents personal needs compared to  percent of men Close to  percent of men helped parents with chores errands and transportation while more than  percent of women did Gender differences did not arise much between those caring for spouses or grandchildren Gender made a significant difference in employment however Most of these middleaged adults were in the labor force meaning that they had jobs were unemployed but looking for work or had recently taken sick leave or been laid off But women were significantly less likely to be in the labor force if they were providing personal care for parents or caring for grandchildren or if they were caregivers for more than one person Among men caregiving had no relationship to employment status Its possible that mens income supports households so that they dont have the option to leave the work force said Yeonjung Lee the studys lead author who teaches at the University of Calgary in Alberta Canada Its also possible that jobs combine more easily with the instrumental tasks men tend to assume like errandrunning than with the personal care women are more apt to provide like bathing Of course this amounts to one of those correlationnotcausation findings Based on this data I cannot argue that caregiving makes people leave the labor force Dr Lee said The relationship could work the other way around women not in the labor force may be more apt to become caregivers Moreover the recession might have changed the picture since  But in forthcoming studies which well report on so stay tuned Dr Lee has used longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study to determine that caregiving does lead women to withdraw from the work force What makes this particularly worrisome is that older women already have higher poverty rates than men Last year according to the Census Bureaus Current Population Survey  percent of women over age  lived in poverty compared to  percent of men An analysis by the National Womens Law Center points out that   nearly  percent and among black Hispanic or Native American women over  percent In the long term if women leave the labor force they are at risk Dr Lee said They dont have enough opportunity to contribute to pensions or save money for the future We can go back and forth about the impact of caregiving its burdens versus its benefits both of which researchers have documented But when it comes to working we didnt see any positive effect of caregiving on employment for women Dr Lee said Most Americans regard caregiving as a family responsibility our government sees it that way too But if caregiving pushes people out of the work force during what are often prime earning years if it depresses their eventual Social Security income and increases the odds of an impoverished old age particularly for women thats a scary prospect  and a greater sacrifice than we can ask individuals to handle alone
