I was  when my husband and I began trying to have a child Three years later I finally accepted it wasnt going to happen naturally We narrowed our options to two use eggs donated by another woman or adopt We visited a couple who had adopted two children to learn more As we talked about the lawyer they used the cost the probability that the birth mother would change her mind all I could think about was something the mother told me when we arrived She said her son now  had reached a rebellious stage and sometimes when they argued he would yell Youre not even my real mother I wouldnt be able to handle that I told my husband on the way home We decided to go the donor egg route A year and a half later using eggs anonymously donated by a yearold woman I gave birth to our son Eddie Weighing  pounds  ounces he was the spit and image of my husband Some said he had my eyes but I knew that couldnt be true He has none of my genetic material It bothered me but I told myself nature is only half the equation I would contribute greatly on the nurture front And of course our baby would be Jewish given that I am Under Jewish law a babys religious identity is determined by his mother Or so I thought Since the s the consensus among Jewish authorities has been that the bearing mother not the woman who provided the gametes is the childs mother But recently the pendulum has begun to swing the other way Some rabbis in Israel now say if the donor is not Jewish then the child is not Jewish Opinions coming out of Israel carry a lot of weight If the egg is from a nonJew then the DNA is from the other person said Rabbi Shaul Rosen who founded   a support network for infertile Jewish couples In order for that child to be Jewish it would have to go through a conversion ceremony like any other nonJew After hearing that I was in tears Its not a question of whether authorities like Rabbi Rosen find egg donation acceptable Its that they dont think Im the mother of my own child In the last year or two there are some in the Orthodox world in Israel who have begun to take the issue in another direction said Rabbi Elliot Dorff chairman of the law and standards committee of the Rabbinical Assembly which governs Conservative Judaism Jewish authorities are finding evidence in the Scriptures to support both arguments that the egg donor is the mother and that the birth mother is the mother So Rabbi Kenneth Brander the dean of the Center for the Jewish Future at Yeshiva University in New York has suggested a pragmatic solution for children of in vitro fertilization If any of the participants in the equation are not Jewish the child should go through a conversion ceremony anyway For infants that requires immersion in a mikvah a religious bath and boys must be circumcised I dont think theres final closure on the opinions yet and I think its important for one to be cautious Rabbi Brander said I would hate to give someone advice that left them outside the pale of everyones definition of whos a Jew For some thats hardly a solution Rabbi Dorff once counseled a man whose child was conceived by using a nonJewish surrogate He told him to have his child go through a conversion ceremony The man refused saying a conversion ceremony would confirm there were questions about the childs parentage and they needed to feel the child was truly theirs J David Bleich an Orthodox rabbi who teaches Jewish law ethics at the Benjamin N Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva believes the problem is even more complex If motherhood involves giving a child your DNA and giving birth to him and if science has allowed us to bifurcate those two roles perhaps we have created two mothers he said If so then for the child to be Jewish both mothers must be Jews Moreover theres a prohibition in Jewish law against suppressing parental identity for fear that people may marry family members and unwittingly commit incest Yet women who donate eggs often do so anonymously In theory such a procedure would be prohibited under Jewish law just as closed adoptions are Rabbi Bleich finds the issues so complicated he discourages in vitro fertilization altogether Theres been no clear decision on IVF motherhood based on Halakhic law which governs Jewish life And Jewish parents have been obtaining opinions about this issue case by case Given these factors the most important thing we can do is not to cast aspersions on the children born of surrogates and donated eggs said Rabbi Gideon Weitzman of the PUAH Institute which provides infertility counseling We dont want people to say My child is more or less Jewish than your childÂ  Rabbi Weitzman said It would be easier if Jewish law followed the secular American model Rabbi Michael J Broyde a law professor at Emory University said California and many other states loosely determine motherhood by motive or intent Which woman wants the baby  the donor or the birth mother When a woman is pregnant and walks into a hospital and goes into labor and gives birth to a baby you know what we call her Mommy said Rabbi Broyde a scholar of Jewish law who has served as a rabbinical court judge The other night I was making dinner and my husband had taken our son for a walk After about half an hour I heard our screen door opening and the patter of toddler feet running toward the kitchen MuhMAH Eddie said as he ran into my arms I should have just asked my son who his mother is Hes known all along
