It takes just a peek at the online store   to appreciate the variety of   out there Flavors like island punch banana split and bubble gum   with batteries that last up to  minutes Glowinthedark condoms promising  minutes of glowing fun And under the category Celebrity Condoms there is the   each condom embossed with an image of the president giving two thumbs up But even if that presidential seal of approval were real it would not overcome a chronic and serious public health obstacle Most men do not like condoms Now an influential player in global health the   is getting into the game The foundation just finished collecting applications for what it calls a   to develop a nextgeneration condom that significantly preserves or enhances pleasure The goal is to address two significant problems unintended pregnancies and   like   Condoms cheaply and effectively prevent both but around the world only  percent of men wear them and there are  million new HIV infections a year To stem that tide health experts say the number of men regularly using condoms needs to double Decreased sexual pleasure is typically the predominant reason for not using them said Stephen Ward a program officer for the Gates Foundation Can we actually make them more desirable Thats what were shooting for More than  applications poured into the Gates contest which will award winners  this fall and up to  million subsequently And in a first for a Gates challenge Mr Ward said people sent samples Boxes of condoms condom accessories condom cases that look like something else so women can be very discreet while carrying them he said We received a completely stocked carrying case with condoms lubricant and breath mints Contestants have been advised not to discuss their applications publicly meaning that the   who pitched Mr Gates a condom applied via slingshot is probably not a serious contender But condom experts  some of whom have studied the subject for years  have ideas of what might work and what decidedly wont I dont think weve seen the condom that knocks the socks off for everybody said Ron Frezieres vice present of research and evaluation at the   a longtime tester of condoms for industry government and nonprofit organizations Guys would like it if they first of all dont believe theyre wearing it Mr Frezieres continued And second of all its got to be a little better than what theyre used to We still have to find that perfect bullet Perfect may not be the enemy of the good in this case but it is awfully hard to pin down When I saw that Gates announcement said Jeff Spieler a senior technical adviser on population and reproductive health at the United States Agency for International Development I wrote and said Its great that youre doing this but Ive been there before and I hope youre going to surface something that I couldnt surface This has been my passion for years and years Mr Spieler added I started thinking Gosh if we could develop a condom that made sex better with the condom than without   If at least it didnt take sexual pleasure away it would not be like taking a shower with a raincoat on At first he recalled his bosses said Hey Jeff be careful We dont want Congress to come beating down on this because Jeff Spielers trying to make sex better Several manufacturers have worked on more appealing condoms Some models like Pleasure Plus and Twisted Pleasure designed by an Indian surgeon   whom Mr Spieler called the Leonardo da Vinci of condoms addressed complaints of tightness and friction They are roomy ballooning sort of like the swirl of a Dairy Queen ice cream Mr Spieler said The movement of extra material is intended to be stimulating Another design the eZOn condom was aimed at the donning problem Made of polyurethane not latex it was baggy gathered up inside what I call a tutu Mr Frezieres said It was not directional so you could pull it down from either side  or as Mr Spieler put it like slipping your foot into an open sock But only some men appreciate that feature It turns out that condoms are subject to a wide array of likes and dislikes Some men want it absolutely clear so if they look down they can think they dont have anything on Mr Frezieres said Others want to make it red and vibrating like a neon sign Mr Frezieres and his colleague Terri L Walsh conducted studies involving condoms with lubricants that create a heating sensation Some people said This is burning me  he said but others reported a mild pleasant feeling or even more intense orgasms On the other hand as Ms Walsh pointed out a stimulating condom could make matters worse for men with   so for them the question is How much more exciting do you want to make a condom Another testing quandary Mr Spieler said is that you cant compare one sex act to another sex act You can come into a sex act having just argued and having makeup sex You could have three days of bad sex so you dont rate the condom youre testing very well That has not stopped innovation in the condom industry There are vibrating condom rings like the Durex Play  Ring of Bliss said Bidia Deperthes a senior HIV technical adviser for the United Nations Population Fund Mr Spieler calls her the condom czarina Some men invariably gripe about the battery life Bidia  minutes its not that long Her response Guys give me a break Fifteen minutes is already flattering you Ms Deperthes whose office features a wall of condoms has versions packaged like lollipops miniature chocolate milk cartons and cellophanewrapped taffy And whats that pinned to her silk blouse A brooch of batik fabric But on the flip side of the pin is yes a condom Talk about wearable art One unsuccessful innovation was the Hat condom resembling a little shower cap designed said Mr Frezieres to fit just over the tip to provide maximum sensation Alas in clinical testing couples experienced difficulty keeping the Hat condom from popping off he said Another idea was the   applying liquid latex to create a condom shaped for the man using it Great concept Mr Frezieres said But it did not have a tip to collect fluid and we were like how do you get it off afterward One promising design already available in some parts of the world is the Pronto Secs condom its box decorated with   Secs its name both a pun and the time it is supposed to take to put on is a condom in a plastic applicator resembling a life preserver This is really cool said Ms Deperthes demonstrating how the applicator splits apart to allow the condom to be put on rightside up And perhaps the most innovative new Americanmade product is the   still in clinical trials Its inventor Danny Resnic said he was motivated by his own experience when a latex condom broke and I wound up with an HIV diagnosis Years of experimenting led him to devise a condom with accordionlike pleats loose to allow movement inside Made of silicone which is meant to feel more like skin it goes on in less than a second he said and theres no wrong way to put it on Besides male condoms which Origami calls external condoms the company has a female version an internal condom and the first condoms for anal sex and oral sex Mr Resnic said The Gates Foundation contest also welcomed designs for female condoms but female condoms have historically been less popular While some men prefer the experience and some women feel it affords them greater ability to protect themselves it is much more expensive and needs to be positioned correctly to avoid getting pushed in or shifted to one side One idea to make it more attractive Mr Frezieres said is to attach the female condom to a stringbikinilooking panty like a thong In the developing world condoms raise other issues In some cultures men are so resistant that women must engage in delicate condom negotiation And women who carry condoms might be assumed to be prostitutes Ms Deperthes and Franck DeRose executive director of the nonprofit   use songs and dances about condoms to try to make them seem fun and give women ways to carry condoms discreetly including containers that look like breath mint boxes Ms Deperthes also wants more options for example she noted that the two standard sizes were too big for some men so smaller sizes should be included in packages donated to developing countries And she wants more variety I told the condom working group at USAID Guys you are boring boring boring  Ms Deperthes said The standard condom that countries receive doesnt smell good  it smells like rubber Told that  choices are offered she said better marketing was needed since most countries choose the same plainvanilla type Ms Deperthes is developing a chocolate box displaying different condoms like truffles to send to foreign health ministers Indeed given the wide array of personal and cultural differences she and others said the value of the Gates Foundation contest may be in finding several types of condoms  perhaps of new materials  and in helping them be produced inexpensively enough for the developing world As Mr DeRose put it Sometimes you want to wear boots sometimes you want to wear flipflops As guinea pigs in scientific clinical trials Amy and Max H take their commitment seriously They perform the required tests of each product at least several times They fill out the required forms After all they consider it a big responsibility testing   for the California Family Health Council We call it sex for science said Amy who like Max is  They agreed to speak only if their full names were withheld They are so diligent that they fill out the forms right after testing a condom If I fall asleep and I wake up in the morning and do it Im not going to be able to remember the answer to any of the questions Max said The questions couples are asked are detailed They include what they like didnt like did it break did it flip did it hurt how was sex how was orgasm said Ron Frezieres vice president of research and evaluation for the council which recruits many of its study participants through Craigslist Max has not been a great fan of condoms For about  months he and Amy who live in Los Angeles and have been together for eight years used condoms for   and God it was stressful he said While youre naked and youre with another naked person and youre in bed and youre not  percent focused on like how I put this on properly Its really difficult And its a situation where you often dont probably find yourself with two hands free Also he said if surprise sex happens and youre not near your condom drawer you have to go get your condom Amy had fewer quibbles Yes sometimes it was like the worst thing to ever happen on the planet she said But even if youre like I want you right now it can be almost like a fun pause because youre forced to let it linger for a little bit longer When they started testing condoms for the council neither was overwhelmingly impressed with the new versions which were mostly standarddesign condoms made of materials besides latex They had some differences of opinion Amy liked polyurethane for example because it kind of heats up a little bit more she said But Max said They felt very plasticy Latex stretches and the other materials didnt so much But they were unanimous in their antipathy to the female condom As Max put it We both found the female condom to be aggressively unsexy It didnt really seem to make much difference in terms of feeling but visually we were like Oh man we should just stop
