A controversial tax on soft drinks is currently being debated in Mexicos Congress But can a tax really reduce the nations waistlines Sometimes coming top isnt such a good thing Over a third of Mexican adults are overweight putting them way up the global league tables for obese nations  A possible cause is found in another of Mexicos dubious honours  being the worlds biggest consumer of soft drinks The health consequences are taking a hefty toll on the countrys finances  In   of the countrys GDP was used to treat obesityrelated diseases such as diabetes which is the same percentage as Canada spent on its entire military In recent years Mexicos government has tried to combat this epidemic by reducing sugar and fat levels in school breakfasts and removing processed foods from vending machines in schools But now the current administration is trying to take a much more controversial step adding a tax of one peso equivalent to  US cents on to every litre of soft drink One man who saw his life come crashing down after the highs of soda is yearold teacher Armando Murillo Salgado He was diagnosed with type  diabetes  years ago and sugary drinks are now strictly off the menu But it was difficult to see the warning signs as he used to drink them just like any Mexican does However he is currently in hospital being treated for heart complications related to his diabetes He says I think  of my condition is down to soft drinks because of the ingredients You can see on any bottle the kind of stuff that goes into them But Armando is sceptical that higher prices would have stopped him drinking them What youre looking for in soft drinks is the flavour the taste I might have stopped for a second to ask myself  Wow how much  but I would still have bought it Ines Sanchez a nutritionist at Centro Medico Hospital  de Noviembre in Mexico City where Armando is being treated agrees that more is needed than a tax We need other strategies to address health problems before we even get to measures like taxes Its better to teach healthy eating habits and give people alternatives  The tax is being hotly debated around the country Those in favour say it is a significant first step while opponents are certain it will not reduce obesity levels and feel it is just a way of swelling the governments coffers Jorge Ramo represents the National Association of Soft Drinks and Carbonated Water Manufacturers ANPRAC Not surprisingly he scorns the idea that a tax would do any good Taxes are never important in beating health problems The government has to create adequate programmes to improve the health of Mexicans  but not with a tax He argues that soft drinks make up only  of the average Mexicans daily calorie intake But Alejandro Calvillo director of Consumer Power Poder del Consumidor one of the NGOs pushing for the tax to be introduced points to Mexicos number one spot for global soda consumption  a yearly average of  litres per person If you take out the people who dont drink them  about   and those who only drink them once or twice a week youre left with a percentage of the population who drink ml of soft drinks every day But why tax soft drinks rather than other unhealthy culprits Kelly Brownell professor of public policy at Duke University in the US was the man who introduced the idea of a soda tax back in  There are a long list of reasons to target sugared beverages first he told the BBC Sugared drinks have no nutritional value The caffeine and sugar may be triggering craving and withdrawal setting up an addictivelike process  Finally the body does not register calories very well when they are delivered in beverages  you do not feel as full He believes such taxes will be routine in a few years and the wisdom of using them will be taken for granted  much like taxes on tobacco Mexico isnt the first country to toy with the idea of socalled fat taxes Hungary France and Denmark have all introduced taxes on unhealthy comestibles in the past few years  But last year Denmark repealed its tax on food with more than a  saturated fat content  a fact that many of those who oppose the Mexican bill bring into the debate It failed because people looked for other options says Jorge Ramo But fat taxes need to be hefty to work according to a  study published in the British Medical Journal It showed the benefits only kicked in when taxes increased prices by about   and the proposed Mexican tax amounts to just a  price hike Really steep increases are likely to leave consumers frothing at the mouth Indeed in the United States  where some states have taxed fizzy drinks  there has been strong opposition to the government interfering with something as personal as diet But Prof Nicholas Finer a specialist in obesity medicine at University College Hospital in London believes that governments do have a role to play not least because it is so difficult for individuals to lose weight of their own accord Humans have evolved to survive famine so our brains tend to tell us its good to eat as much as we can while its there in order to survive the periods of food shortage  We havent adapted to our appetites to live in a society with less food shortages So it makes sense for governments to step in One thing that both those for and against the tax agree on is that by itself it will not be enough to significantly reduce the obesity epidemic in Mexico More support is needed they say for the health system as a whole and for healthy eating campaigns especially those targeted at children And with or without the tax Mexico has a long way to go before it slips down the global obesity charts
