In the everincreasing competition for stellar grades nearly one in five Ivy League college students without a diagnosis of ADHD is turning to prescription stimulants used to treat the disorder to help improve focus and get an added edge new research suggests And more than  percent of them dont look at ADHD drug misuse as cheating according to the study that will be presented at the Pediatric Academic Society meeting in Vancouver British Columbia this weekend Researchers analyzed responses from an online questionnaire of more than  Ivy League sophomores juniors and seniors who were not diagnosed with ADHD  attention deficithyperactivity disorder  and therefore did not have a prescription for the medication Writing essays and studying for an exam cause the most angst for students  of those who used stimulants  percent said they used them to stay focused while writing and  percent said they used the drugs to help study More than onequarter of the students who admitted to using ADHD stimulants such as Ritalin or Adderall said they tried them four to eight times and  percent used stimulants on eight or more occasions More students who played a varsity sport and were affiliated with a Greek house reported stimulant misuse compared with students affiliated with only one or neither The honor system is on shaky ground with about onethird of students saying the use of stimulant medication to improve grades didnt constitute cheating Slightly more than  percent thought it was cheating and onequarter were unsure ADHD drug abuse doesnt come as a surprise to the researchers Its everywhere and our results are in line with what other studies have identified says senior investigator Dr Andrew Adesman chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Steven  Alexandra Cohen Childrens Medical Center of New York Once kids go off to college all bets are off in a parents ability to monitor ADHD medications and whether their children are diverting their drugs to friends and classmates Part of the problem is that ADHD medications really do work well in improving focus and attention But there is a dark side Although the medications are generally safe and effective when prescribed and monitored by a healthcare professional    the concerns are greater when a medicine is being diverted he says Whats safe for one patient may not be safe for that patients buddy Aside from the potential for medical problems students may also face legal problems Its unlawful distribution of a controlled substance says Adesman The law isnt going to look at someone any differently if they gave their drugs to a friend or if they sold those drugs downtown for some extra cash These kids are jeopardizing their futures
