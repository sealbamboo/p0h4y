 — If you’ve ever tried . , your first sweaty session may have triggered a mix of fleeting thoughts: Am I .  this out of shape? Burning thighs! Is this what a heart attack feels like? Thighs on fire!. While the highly intense workout isn’t known to cause heart problems, Swedish researchers have discovered an interesting tidbit about the human body on spinning: Chemically, it looks a lot like a . .. Heart attacks increase cardiac biomarkers in the blood, and this . , published in . , found that a short spinning session increases those biomarkers, too. Previous research had shown that longer bouts of endurance exercise (like . ) have the same effect, but few studies had focused on short-term workouts.. For the study, researchers measured 10 healthy participants’ cardiac biomarkers before and after a one-hour spinning session and found that levels of the heart enzyme troponin T (a common cardiac biomarker) doubled an hour after the session — a reaction to exercise they say is normal, and not dangerous, in healthy people.. Still, the findings are important to emergency room teams who might treat people with elevated cardiac biomarkers.. "When somebody with chest pains comes for emergency treatment, and a blood test shows that the cardiac biomarkers are rising, it's important to recognize that this kind of increase can also occur in healthy people after a normal exercise session," study author Smita Duttaroy, MD, PhD, said in a release.. So the next time you’re in the zone during a great spin class, think of the cool biochemical action going on inside your body. Oh, and how great it’s making your thighs look.
