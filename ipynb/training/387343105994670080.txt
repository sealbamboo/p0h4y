Maybe Miley Cyrus wont be having sex after  but an awful lot of people do During Mondays   the yearold Cyrus repeated an oftheard claim of the young  that old people like those over  dont have sex any more Do you know how old I am Matt asked Im going to guess  said Miley  Matt corrected  Miley laughed Oh well then youre really definitely not sexual  Oh yeah Sex expert Joan Price nearly yearsold and not slowing down a heck of a lot believes the misconception comes from a society that says if you dont look like Miley Cyrus youre not having sex Price is the author of Naked at Our Age Talking Out Loud about Senior Sex  According to a  study in the New England Journal of Medicine roughly  percent of people ages  to  were still sexually active The rate did drop as people got older with  percent of those  to  saying they still had sex and about one quarter of those  to  reporting they did too Theres no question that sex changes with age Studies show a significant fall off in desire especially among women after menopause Challenges such as vaginal dryness erectile dysfunction and general health issues can affect older couples  not to mention simple boredom among longmarried people But for every problem there is a solution Price said For example she advises older women not to wait for spontaneous desire because it may not happen I tell women to just do it and the mood will follow she said Thats opposite of when youre younger According to Sue Goldstein a sexuality educator and program coordinator for San Diego Sexual Medicine sexual interest and activity is not agebased We have patients as young as  and as old as  coming to be treated so they can once again enjoy a satisfying sexual life she said Writer Suzy Spencer says all you have to do to disprove Miley Cyrus statement is go to a swing convention to see people over  having lots of sex And there are millions of swingers in the United States said Spencer who spent eight years reporting her  book Secret Sex Lives A Year on the Fringes of American Sexuality Of course most people over  are not swingers But attitude is one change that actually seems to improve sexuality and sexual enjoyment as we age Older people tend to be more confident  or at least more comfortable with  their sexuality They care less what anybody thinks Spencer said  When Spencer attended a beautiful people party in Miami populated with an under crowd she encountered lots of selfconscious preening not the most sexually stimulating kind of scene In fact both Spencer and Price said that people over  tend to be more relaxed about themselves and therefore freer to enjoy whatever sexual life  mild or wild  they choose   While some older folks are done with sex I have many more who say Why should I be done with it Just because were wrinkled doesnt mean were not having great sex said Price
