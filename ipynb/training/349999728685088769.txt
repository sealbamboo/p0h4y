In the decidedly nutty sport of ultramarathoning the stakes keep getting higher The courses get longer and the terrain steeper but runners continue to push the boundaries of human endurance and sheer will So a team of researchers in exercise physiology led by   of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland explored what happens when these ultralongdistance runners whose muscles are already fatigued are also deprived of sleep To do this they found a group of hardcore runners at the   a particularly excruciating race in the Italian Alps These volunteers were willing to be poked prodded and covered with electrodes in the name of science while competing What the researchers found was that these runners experienced significantly less overall muscle fatigue by the end of the race than a similar group at a race of only half the distance The   were published by   The   is unique in that the clock is continuously running So unlike races such as cyclings Tour de France that are run in daily stages over predetermined distances these runners have to figure out when to sleep and for how long The   lasts days And the runners are often in a state of intense sleep deprivation In  the average racer finished in  hours with only nine hours of sleep To test muscle fatigue under the   extreme conditions Saugys team administered a battery of tests before during and after the race Volunteer sat upright in a chair equipped with straps pedals strain gauges and electrodes A series of leg and ankle extensions tested the runners voluntary muscle strength To test involuntary muscle strength electrodes zapped the runners muscles and the researchers measured the reactions  runners experienced a roughly  percent loss in muscular strength compared with a loss of  percent in a shorter race over equivalently difficult terrain Saugy says the Tor runners preservation of muscle strength can be explained by pacing strategy including sleep breaks during the middle of the race They try to run a maximal distance in a minimal time which involves a great deal of sleep deprivation he says In the second half of the race the runners speed decreases significantly and this decrease of speed involves a decrease of intensity and therefore a preservation of muscle tissue The overwhelming exertion in the first half of the race also means that runners sleep a lot more in the second half which helps to preserve their muscles Its been   that muscle fatigue in long races reaches an eventual plateau but these new results surprised Saugy I thought that the decrease of force would stay at this plateau but I was surprised to see that we found   fatigue after this race he says Shots spoke with   veteran and running coach   about his experience on an ultramarathoning circuit lasting days A regular runner should plan to cover  percent of the distance in half of their realistic goal time and  percent in the second half he says At one point in his career Weber completed a quadruple solo crossing of   one of ultrarunnings most notorious gauntlets Usually after  hours of running I would get so sleepy that I couldnt go on he says So I would lay down and sleep with the idea that I could sleep as long as I wanted but the second I opened by eyes I would immediately start moving And how much shuteye did this mean for Weber Generally I would sleep extremely soundly for  to  minutes he says But analyzing the bodys response to these challenges only tells you so much about these extreme runners Ultramarathoning is an expression of the soul of the runner their tenacity their will to go beyond their perceived limits Weber says Its more important than the physiology Its about whats inside and you see that at the finish line
