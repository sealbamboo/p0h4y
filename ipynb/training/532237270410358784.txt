If you have trouble swallowing pills its not your fault Youve just been doing it wrong And now a group of German experts is ready to show you a better way Two ways in fact The first is the popbottle method and it makes tablets go down with ease The second isÂ  the leanforward technique which sends capsules straight down the throat   have been rigorously tested by  volunteers who swallowed numerous dummy pills for the sake of science And now they are being shared with the world via their   in the Annals of Family Medicine This is more than a discomfort for patients though it surely is It also causes patients to reduce the dose of their medications or skip it altogether And studies   that these behaviors make patients medical problems worse and more expensive to treat So the researchers devised four shapes of capsules and tablets including round oval and oblong Each came in four sizes for a total of  placebos Next came the  volunteers These men and women ranged in age from  to  and slightly more than half reported some difficulty taking pills In most cases tablets were the biggest problem The solution offered by the German experts was the popbottle method That involves putting a tablet on the tongue and closing ones lips around the opening of a flexible plastic water bottle Then its time to take a drink keeping contact between the bottle and your lips by pursing your lips and using a sucking motion according to the Annals study By swallowing both water and pill right away theres no chance to think twice  the medicine slides right down the hatch It worked About twothirds of those who said they had trouble swallowing tablets reported improvement while using the popbottle method the study authors found Even among those with no swallowing difficulties the popbottle approach made things easier for  of volunteers taking large tablets and  of those taking very large tablets Capsules were less of a problem than tablets but the German experts had a trick for these pills too In the leanforward technique you put a capsule on your tongue and take a sip of water but dont swallow it immediately Instead you bend the head forward by tilting your chin slightly toward your chest Then keeping the head in this downward position you swallow capsule and water together It may sound counterintuitive to tilt your head forward rather than backward but it worked even better than the popbottle method Everyone who tried it with very large capsules rated it an improvement over their previous swallowing method as did  of people with no history of swallowing problems who used it on large capsules and  of their counterparts who did report swallowing difficulties Other evidence that these two swallowing methods were superior included higher rates of successful swallows on the first try fewer reports of an unpleasant feeling in the throat and fewer cases of pills being lodged in the throat Most tellingly  of participants said they would adopt these methods in their daily routines the German study authors wrote They concluded that both methods should therefore be generally recommended
