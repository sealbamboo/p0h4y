We tried my sister and I Every fall and winter we discussed what extremely practical gift we should get our father for his September birthday and for Hanukkah A flannel shirt because his current two were fraying A warm new sweater because he disliked paying utility bills and always kept his apartment cool A leather wallet because his old one stuffed with years of photos and credit cards and nolongerrelevant IDs was held together with rubber bands And we failed consistently Months or years later wed find the shirts and sweaters still in their gift boxes unworn He was saving them he said because what was wrong with his old ones This was a guy I remind you who discovered that he and his friend were both sending credit card payments to the same address and so started mailing them in together to saveÂ postage When the inevitable happened and Discover mixed up their payments a snafu only resolved after many phone calls did they stop this practice No they just stapled their checks to their statements and continued each preserving his savings of  cents every other month I have told this tale before and a reader emailed me Did we have the same father Anyway we could have used the smart   written by geriatricians and palliative care specialists most of them at the University of California San Francisco Compiled by Anna Chodos a UCSF research fellow who more typically publishes stuff about Tcells antigens and underserved populations the very geri holiday list includes useful gadgets and gizmos for people with mobility problems like grabbers and jar openers and glam crystalencrusted canes And aids for those with difficulty hearing and seeing like magnifying glasses and TV amplifiers And products to help jog failing memories like medication reminder clocks And some fun ideas just because Also there were links to help you find this stuff though I notice Dr Chodos is offering no counsel on how to get your elders to actually use it That parts up to you I get press releases daily from companies announcing new products for old people and I regretfully say we dont post about them because we have way to assess how well theyd function under realworld conditions We need an independent Consumer Reportslike organization to roadtest products intended for older and disabled people In the meantime though I consider the UCSF folks a reliable guide And if you or your older relatives have used any of these products Id like to hear what you think As for my father Murray Span he had a Hanukkah request which never happened before Last winter during a discussion group or maybe a concert at his facility he lent his favorite sweater vest to another resident who felt chilly She subsequently wore it back to her room and forgot shed ever borrowed it Dad didnt want to embarrass her by asking for its return or asking the staff to intervene so he asked me for a new one Great A gift he would actually use I happily located a navy blue vest I thought hed like  but I never got to give it to him He died last year at about this time before Hanukkah I sent it back But among the belongs Ive kept is the wallet held together with rubber bands just because
