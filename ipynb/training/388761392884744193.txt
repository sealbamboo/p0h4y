Columbia are   exchanges and the federal government is setting them up in  states In seven states federal and state officials are partnering to run the exchanges You can get information about the exchange at   which has details on the federal exchanges and   Some people do but definitely not everyone These exchanges are for two major groups of people Those who dont have insurance now and those who currently purchase their own insurance meaning they dont get it through an employer If you have insurance at your job or through a public program like Medicare Medicaid or the VA you dont need to pay attention to the exchanges unless you lose that coverage for some reason If you have insurance through your employer you can shop for and buy insurance on an exchange if you like but you probably wont qualify for a subsidy or tax credit And you would lose the contribution your employer makes toward health insurance In theory you can do it all or most of it online You go to   or to your staterun exchange if there is one and create an account You provide some basic information like where you live and how old you are and youll get a list of plans available in your area If you provide income information youll be able to get an estimate of whether youll eligible for federal help paying for insurance or whether you might qualify for Medicaid The exchange will offer a list of health plans and their premiums and outofpocket costs including deductibles and copayments If you decide to buy one of those plans in most cases you will be directed to the insurers Web site to make the payment Some plans or insurance companies may require a phone call to set up payment In some jurisdictions consumers will make their first premium payment to the exchange and then further monthly payments to the insurer If your income makes you eligible for a tax credit subsidy it will be applied upfront to the monthly premium payment You wont have to wait until you file your taxes in  to get the credit You can also fill out paper applications or apply over the phone The federal government has set up call centers to answer questions from people in states with federal exchanges That phone number is  States running their own exchanges also have individual call centers Most states have also trained people called assisters and navigators who can walk people through the process although in some states the training for them has been delayed Contact information can be found on the exchange websites Even if your employer offers coverage you can opt to buy a plan on the exchange However you may not be eligible for a subsidy Consumers can shop for coverage on or off the exchange However subsidies for those who are eligible are generally available only for plans sold on the exchange No You cant just sign up when youre sick and facing big medical bills Otherwise thats what everyone would do The exchanges under the Affordable Care Act have been designed pretty much the same way most employer insurance plans are Theres an   every year when you can buy or change plans and thats generally the only time you can buy or change plans No Medicare is   of the health insurance exchanges and Medigap policies are not being sold or subsidized through the exchanges As a Medicare beneficiary you can enroll at   to get the programs traditional drug coverage or a Medicare Advantage plan where Medicare enrollees get coverage through private health insurance plans The Medicare open season begins Oct  If you are disabled and have no income you most likely wont be shopping for insurance on the exchanges Rather you may qualify for Medicaid In   if you qualify to collect Supplemental Security Income or SSI you also qualify for Medicaid For more information on Medicaid eligibility and links to your states Medicaid office click   Most federal workers will continue to get their health coverage through the  and not be required to purchase coverage through the health laws marketplaces Members of Congress and their personal staffs however will be required to buy health insurance through the exchanges No if you live abroad for   you are not subject to the mandate to have health insurance Insurance bought on the exchanges generally wouldnt cover you while overseas anyway neither does Medicare by the way Youll need to find insurance that will cover you in the country where you live The State Department   For countryspecific information   Legal immigrants are permitted to use the marketplaces  and may qualify for subsidies if their income is less than about  for an individual and  for a family of four Legal immigrants may qualify for Medicaid if their income is low enough The laws governing benefits to lawful immigrants are quite complex The federal Department of Health and Human Services   for immigrants Immigrants who are in the country illegally are   from buying insurance on the exchanges There are no requirements for employers with fewer than  workers to buy health insurance for their employees Many small business do offer health care as a benefit however and for them the insurance exchanges represent a new option for them in terms of where to shop Certain employers with fewer than  workers are eligible for federal tax credits To qualify the company has to cover at least half of the premium for all of its employees and also have average wages of less than  For details on these tax credits   It depends on several factors including your income the state in which you live your age whether you smoke or not and your family size among other factors You could end up paying very little or nothing at all if your income falls within a certain range If you do not qualify for a subsidy coverage could be quite expensive  well over  a month in some cases But this may still be lower than what you are paying now if you have an individual policy There are caveats One is that the cheaper plans come with big deductibles and lots of other outofpocket costs Now if you dont think youre going to have much in the way of medical expenses that may be fine But people should be aware that if they buy a plan that only costs  or  a month they may have a  or  deductible before the plan starts paying benefits The other is that some of these less expensive plans come with very limited lists of doctors and hospitals So if you have a particular doctor or hospital you know you want to use you should check that before you sign up The health law provides fairly generous subsidies for many people effectively lowering their monthly premiums The subsidies are on a slidingscale though so they become less generous as your income grows If your income is income between  percent of the    for an individual and  percent  you can get some help paying for premiums A family of four can get a subsidy although just a small one with income up to  Some people also can get help with deductibles and copayments To qualify your income has to be less than  times the poverty level  for an individual or  for a family of four You also have to choose a socalled silver plan Thats the second lowest cost of the four levels of coverage that will be available  bronze silver gold and platinum Subsidy amounts are calculated based on your modified adjusted gross income a figure you can find on your annual tax return by   That includes things like wages and interest less deductions like tuition and alimony and additional payroll taxes paid by the selfemployed it does not include assets such as the value of your house stocks or retirement accounts Youll be asked to estimate what your income will be for next year if youre wrong youll have to reconcile with the IRS come tax time the following year If your income increases during the year notify the exchange promptly so that you can avoid having to pay back the subsidy On the other hand if your income goes down you could be eligible for a bigger subsidy Either way its important to notify the exchange if your income changes If you qualify for a subsidy to pay your premiums you can choose to either have the credit sent directly to the insurer or pay the whole premium up front and claim the credit later on your taxes If you qualify for help with deductibles and copayments that subsidy will be sent directly to the insurer and you wont have to pay as much out of pocket You wont have to pay more for insurance if you have a medical condition and that condition will be covered when your policy begins But older people can be charged more than younger people and smokers face a surcharge The number of plans that you can choose from varies widely In some states only a couple of insurers are offering policies though the marketplace while in others there may be a dozen or more Even within a state there will be differences in the number of plans available in different areas Insurers generally offer a variety of types of plans including familiar models like PPOs and HMOs Each plan offered has to cover  essential health benefits These include prescription drugs emergency and hospital care doctor visits maternity and mental health services rehabilitation and lab services among others In addition recommended preventive services such as preventive mammograms must be covered without any outofpocket costs to you Its important to keep in mind that the insurer does   about which specific therapies theyll cover within each category of benefit So its very important to study the plans carefully to make sure it is offering any specific benefits you may need Theres a cap on how much you pay outofpocket for medical services each year That cap is  for individual policies and  for family plans in  Your regular monthly premiums do not count toward the cap Plans are divided into    bronze silver gold and platinum  varying based on the size of their deductibles copayments and other consumer costsharing The bronze plan pays for  percent of medical costs the platinum  percent Premiums are highest and deductibles the lowest for platinum plans Bronze plans generally have deductibles in the thousands of dollars  and  deductibles are not unusual for bronze plans Within each tier the amount you pay for deductibles copayments and coinsurance may vary from company to company and even from plan to plan within companies No matter which plan you choose the  essential benefits remain the same There is also the option to purchase catastrophic insurance  low cost plans that cover minimal services but provide a safety net in the event of an accident or serious illness But those plans do not come with subsidies People up to age  will have the option of buying   that will cover only minimal services until they meet a deductible of roughly  The premium is usually much lower than the other plans After the deductible is met the plan covers the  essential health benefits  a kind of safety net coverage in case you have an accident or serious illness according to the   Catastrophic plans usually do not provide coverage for services like prescription drugs or shots And there are other limits It depends on which subsidy youre talking about One subsidy is to help pay your monthly premiums If you qualify for that subsidy   you can apply it toward the purchase of any plan  bronze silver gold or platinum Where silver plans come into play here is in calculating the amount of your subsidy Its based on the price of the secondlowest silver plan in your area If you choose a gold or platinum plan youll still get the subsidy But those plans have higher monthly premiums and youll have to make up the difference Likewise if you choose a bronze plan youll get the subsidy and your monthly premiums will be less Theres another subsidy to be had in the form of help with deductibles and copayments To qualify for that subsidy you do have to choose a silver plan Your income also has to fall below  for an individual or  for a family of four You should carefully weigh the state of your health with your financial situation For example a person whos  and in excellent health may decide that the low premium and high deductibles of a Bronze or Silver plan are their best bet Of course an illness or accident can arise at any time so youll need to take that into consideration Thats why they call it insurance For older adults with a chronic health condition or regular prescription expenses it may be best to consider a Gold or Platinum plan with a higher premium that gives you a policy with lower outofpocket expenses for doctors visits and hospital stays If youre shopping for a new policy on the insurance exchanges or are eligible for Medicaid the answer is Maybe For private policies purchased through the exchange it all depends on the list of doctors that the health plan considers in network If your doctor isnt in the plans network youll likely pay a higher amount for coinsurance or copayment The number of doctors who take Medicaid is growing in states where the program is being expanded but the number of doctors who take Medicaid is still limited in most areas Your insurer generally cant drop you as long as you keep up with your insurance premiums and dont lie on your application No Insurers   to sell through the exchanges In several states for example the largest insurers decided not to offer insurance this year while they wait to see what happens Some were concerned about the negative publicity that might result if the exchanges got off to a shaky start Others wanted to wait to see if this market would be profitable No The Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of prior or existing health conditions Generally you are only able to enroll in or change plans once a year during an open enrollment period This first year that period runs from Oct   to Mar   In subsequent years the time period will be shorter running from Oct  to Dec  There are certain circumstances when you will be able to change plans or add or drop someone from coverage outside the regular annual enrollment period This could happen if you lose your job get married or divorced give birth to or adopt a child or move to a different state Any of those life events triggers a special day enrollment period where you can change or buy health insurance on an exchange Otherwise youll have to wait until the next open enrollment Youll need to set up an account with your name address and social security number If you have an email address you can provide that too The exchange will want to know about your marital status the number of children under  birthdays of anyone wholl be covered whether you smoke financial information and citizenship status The financial and citizenship information will be checked against records at the Internal Revenue Service and other government agencies See other Frequently Asked Questions on the Affordable Care Act Additional coverage from NPR Member Stations
