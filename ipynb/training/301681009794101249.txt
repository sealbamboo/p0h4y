 Patients who undergo knee replacement surgery may be at higher risk of gaining weight than those who have not had the surgery according to a study led by a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University Study author Daniel Riddle PhD and his team reviewed the medical records of about  patients who had kneereplacement surgery in the Mayo Clinic Health System and found that  percent of them had gained  percent or more of their body weight in the five years after having the surgery In a control group of people who did not have the surgery only  percent gained the same amount of weight in the same time period Part of the explanation is that people may have spent years adapting to their circumstances by avoiding activities that could cause knee pain   We need to encourage patients to take advantage of their ability to function better and offer strategies for weight loss or weight management Overweight patients are often encouraged to lose weight prior to surgery to help them recover faster and avoid surgery complications but study authors found that losing weight before surgery was a risk factor for gaining weight after the procedure So is being young Researchers found that younger patients who lost greater amounts of weight in the fiveyear preoperative period were also at greater risk for postsurgical weight gain Future research should develop weight lossmaintenance interventions particularly for younger patients who have lost a substantial amount of weight prior to surgery the researchers wrote in the study The study was published online in the journal  According to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons   are performed in the United States each year usually on people who have arthritis Most knee replacement patients need a walker to get around for about two weeks and a cane for two weeks after that After a month most patients should be able to get around without walking aids There are plenty of exercises you can do after having total knee replacement surgery Your doctor may recommend walking biking swimming or water exercises once stitches or staples are removed Staying active will not only help control your weight it will also help you keep your strength flexibility and endurance long after your wounds heal
