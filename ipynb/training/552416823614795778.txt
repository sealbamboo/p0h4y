wentyfive hundred years ago the young Gautama Buddha left his princely home in the foothills of the Himalayas in a state of agitation and agony What was he so distressed about We learn from his biography that he was moved in particular by seeing the penalties of ill health  by the sight of mortality a dead body being taken to cremation morbidity a person severely afflicted by illness and disability a person reduced and ravaged by unaided old age Health has been a primary concern of human beings throughout history It should therefore come as no surprise that healthcare for all    UHC  has been a highly appealing social objective in most countries in the world even in those that have not got very far in actually providing it The usual reason given for not attempting to provide universal healthcare in a country is poverty The United States which can certainly afford to provide healthcare at quite a high level for all Americans is exceptional in terms of the popularity of the view that any kind of public establishment of universal healthcare must somehow involve unacceptable intrusions into private life There is considerable political complexity in the   often led by medical business and fed by ideologues who want the government to be out of our lives and also in the systematic cultivation of a deep suspicion of any kind of national health service as is standard in Europe socialised medicine is now a term of horror in the US One of the oddities in the contemporary world is our astonishing failure to make adequate use of policy lessons that can be drawn from the diversity of experiences that the heterogeneous world already provides There is much evidence of the big contributions that UHC can make in advancing the lives of people and also and this is very important in enhancing economic and social opportunities  including facilitating the possibility of sustained economic growth as has been firmly demonstrated in the experience of southeast Asian countries such as Japan South Korea Taiwan Singapore and more recently China Further a number of poor countries have shown through their pioneering public policies that basic healthcare for all can be provided at a remarkably good level at very low cost if the society including the political and intellectual leadership can get its act together There are many examples of such success across the world None of these individual examples are flawless and each country can learn from the experiences of others Nevertheless the lessons that can be derived from these pioneering departures provide a solid basis for the presumption that in general the provision of universal healthcare is an achievable goal even in the poorer countries   my book written jointly with Jean Drze discusses how the countrys predominantly messy healthcare system can be vastly improved by learning lessons from highperforming nations abroad and also from the contrasting performances of different states within India that have pursued different health policies  Over the last three decades various studies have investigated the experiences of countries where effective healthcare is provided at low cost to the bulk of the population The places that first received detailed attention included China Sri Lanka Costa Rica Cuba and the Indian state of Kerala Since then examples of successful UHC  or something close to that  have expanded and have been critically scrutinised by health experts and empirical economists Good results of universal care without bankrupting the economy  in fact quite the opposite  can be seen in the experience of many other countries This includes the remarkable achievements of Thailand which has had for the last decade and a half a powerful political commitment to providing inexpensive reliable healthcare for all Thailands experience in universal healthcare is exemplary both in advancing health achievements across the board and in reducing inequalities between classes and regions Prior to the introduction of UHC in  there was reasonably good insurance coverage for about a quarter of the population This privileged group included wellplaced government servants who qualified for a civil service medical benefit scheme and employees in the privately owned organised sector which had a mandatory social security scheme from  onwards and received some government subsidy In the s some further schemes of government subsidy did emerge however they proved woefully inadequate The bulk of the population had to continue to rely largely on outofpocket payments for medical care However in  the government introduced a  baht universal coverage programme that for the first time covered all the population with a guarantee that a patient would not have to pay more than  baht about p per visit for medical care there is exemption for all charges for the poorer sections  about a quarter  of the population The result of universal health coverage in Thailand has been a significant fall in mortality particularly infant and child mortality with infant mortality as low as  per  and a remarkable rise in life expectancy which is now more than  years at birth  major achievements for a poor country There has also been an astonishing removal of historic disparities in infant mortality between the poorer and richer regions of Thailand so much so that Thailands low infant mortality rate is now shared by the poorer and richer parts of the country There are also powerful lessons to learn from what has been achieved in Rwanda where   Devastated by genocide in  the country has rebuilt itself and established an inclusive health system for all with equityoriented national policies focusing on social cohesion and peoplecentred development Premature mortality has fallen sharply and life expectancy has actually doubled since the mids Following pilot experiments in three districts with communitybased health insurance and performancebased financing systems the health coverage was scaled up to cover the whole nation in  and  As the Rwandan minister of health Agnes Binagwaho the US medical anthropologist Paul Farmer and their coauthors discuss in   a paper published in the Lancet in July  Investing in health has stimulated shared economic growth as citizens live longer and with greater capacity to pursue the lives they value The experiences of many other countries also offer good lessons from Brazil and Mexico which have recently implemented UHC with reasonable success to Bangladesh and the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu with progress towards the universal coverage that has already been achieved by Kerala Bangladeshs progress which has been rapid makes clear the effectiveness of giving a significant role to women in the delivery of healthcare and education combined with the part played by women employees in spreading knowledge about effective family planning Bangladeshs fertility rate has fallen sharply from being well above five children per couple to   quite close to the replacement level of  To separate out another empirically observed influence Tamil Nadu shows the rewards of having efficiently run public services for all even when the services on offer may be relatively meagre The population of Tamil Nadu has greatly benefited for example from its splendidly run midday meal service in schools and from its extensive system of nutrition and healthcare of preschool children The message that striking rewards can be reaped from serious attempts at instituting  or even moving towards  universal healthcare is hard to miss The critical ingredients of success that have emerged from these studies appear to include a firm political commitment to the provision of universal healthcare running workable elementary healthcare and preventive services covering as much of the population as possible paying serious attention to good administration in healthcare and ancillary public services and arranging effective school education for all Perhaps most importantly it means involving women in the delivery of health and education in a much larger way than is usual in the developing world  The question can however be asked how does universal healthcare become affordable in poor countries Indeed how has UHC been afforded in those countries or states that have run against the widespread and entrenched belief that a poor country must first grow rich before it is able to meet the costs of healthcare for all The alleged commonsense argument that if a country is poor it cannot provide UHC is however based on crude and faulty economic reasoning The first  and perhaps the most important  factor overlooked by the naysayers is the fact that at a basic level healthcare is a very labourintensive activity and in a poor country wages are low A poor country may have less money to spend on healthcare but it also needs to spend less to provide the same labourintensive services far less than what a richer  and higherwage  economy would have to pay Not to take into account the implications of large wage differences is a gross oversight that distorts the discussion of the affordability of labourintensive activities such as healthcare and education in lowwage economies Second how much healthcare can be provided to all may well depend on the countrys economic means but whatever is affordable within a countrys means can still be more effectively and more equitably provided through universal coverage Given the hugely unequal distribution of incomes in many economies there can be serious inefficiency as well as unfairness in leaving the distribution of healthcare entirely to peoples respective abilities to buy medical services UHC can bring about not only greater equity but also much larger overall health achievement for the nation since the remedying of many of the most easily curable diseases and the prevention of readily avoidable ailments get left out under the outofpocket system because of the inability of the poor to afford even very elementary healthcare and medical attention It is also worth noting here as European examples richly illustrate that providing UHC is compatible with allowing the purchase of extra services for the especially affluent or those with extra health insurance and the demands of UHC must be distinguished from the ethics of aiming at complete equality This is not to deny that remedying inequality as much as possible is an important value  a subject on which I have written over many decades Reduction of economic and social inequality also has instrumental relevance for good health Definitive evidence of this is provided in the work of     and others on the social determinants of health showing that gross inequalities harm the health of the underdogs of society both by undermining their lifestyles and by making them prone to harmful behaviour patterns such as smoking and excessive drinking Nevertheless the ethics of universal health coverage have to be distinguished from the value of eliminating inequalities in general which would demand much more radical economic and social changes than UHC requires Healthcare for all can be implemented with comparative ease and it would be a shame to delay its achievement until such time as it can be combined with the more complex and difficult objective of eliminating all inequality Third many medical and health services are shared rather than being exclusively used by each individual separately For example an epidemiological intervention reaches many people who live in the same neighbourhood rather than only one person at a time Healthcare thus has strong components of what in economics is called a collective good which typically is very inefficiently allocated by the pure market system as has been extensively discussed by economists such as   Covering more people together can sometimes cost less than covering a smaller number individually Fourth many diseases are infectious Universal coverage prevents their spread and cuts costs through better epidemiological care This point as applied to individual regions has been recognised for a very long time The conquest of epidemics has in fact been achieved by not leaving anyone untreated in regions where the spread of infection is being tackled The transmission of disease from region to region  and of course from country to country  has broadened the force of this argument in recent years Right now the pandemic of Ebola is causing alarm even in parts of the world far away from its place of origin in west Africa For example the US has taken many expensive steps to prevent the spread of Ebola within its own borders Had there been effective UHC in the countries of origin of the disease this problem could have been mitigated or even eliminated In addition therefore to the local benefits of having UHC in a country there are global ones as well The calculation of the ultimate economic costs and benefits of healthcare can be a far more complex process than the universalitydeniers would have us believe  In the absence of a reasonably wellorganised system of public healthcare for all many people are afflicted by overpriced and inefficient private healthcare As has been analysed by many economists most notably Kenneth Arrow there cannot be a wellinformed competitive market equilibrium in the field of medical attention because of what economists call asymmetric information Patients do not typically know what treatment they need for their ailments or what medicine would work or even what exactly the doctor is giving to them as a remedy Unlike in the market for many commodities such as shirts or umbrellas the buyer of medical treatment knows far less than what the seller  the doctor  does and this vitiates the efficiency of market competition This applies to the market for health insurance as well since insurance companies cannot fully know what patients health conditions are This makes markets for private health insurance inescapably inefficient even in terms of the narrow logic of market allocation And there is in addition the much bigger problem that private insurance companies if unrestrained by regulations have a strong financial interest in excluding patients who are taken to be highrisk So one way or another the government has to play an active part in making UHC work The problem of asymmetric information applies to the delivery of medical services itself It makes the possibility of exploitation of the relatively ignorant a likely result even when there is plentiful market competition And when medical personnel are scarce so that there is not much competition either it can make the predicament of the buyer of medical treatment even worse Furthermore when the provider of healthcare is not himself trained as is often the case in many countries with deficient health systems the situation becomes worse still As a result in the absence of a wellorganised public health system covering all many patients denied any alternative remain vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous individuals who robustly combine crookery and quackery While such lamentable conditions are seen in a number of countries there are other countries or states within countries that as has already been discussed demonstrate the rewards of having a functioning universal public healthcare system  with better health achievements and also larger development of human capabilities In some countries  for example India  we see both systems operating side by side in different states within the country A state such as Kerala provides fairly reliable basic healthcare for all through public services  Kerala pioneered UHC in India several decades ago through extensive public health services As the population of Kerala has grown richer  partly as a result of universal healthcare and nearuniversal literacy  many people now choose to pay more and have additional private healthcare But since these private services have to compete with what the state provides and have to do even better to justify their charges in a region with widespread medical knowledge and medical opportunity the quality of private medical services tends also to be better there than where there is no competition from public services and a low level of public education In contrast states such as Madhya Pradesh or Uttar Pradesh give plentiful examples of exploitative and inefficient healthcare for the bulk of the population Not surprisingly people who live in Kerala live much longer and have a much lower incidence of preventable illnesses than do people from states such as Madhya Pradesh or Uttar Pradesh A system of universal healthcare also has the advantage that it can focus on vitally needed  but often ignored  primary medical attention and on relatively inexpensive outpatient care when a disease receives early attention In the absence of systematic care for all diseases are often allowed to develop which makes it much more expensive to treat them often involving inpatient treatment such as surgery Thailands experience clearly shows how the need for more expensive procedures may go down sharply with fuller coverage of preventive care and early intervention Good healthcare demands systematic and comprehensive attention and in the absence of affordable healthcare for all illnesses become much harder and much more expensive to treat If the advancement of equity is one of the rewards of wellorganised universal healthcare enhancement of efficiency in medical attention is surely another  The case for UHC is often underestimated because of inadequate appreciation of what wellorganised and affordable healthcare for all can do to enrich and enhance human lives It is one thing to accept that the world may not have the resources and the dexterity at this moment to provide the finest of medical care to all but that is not a reason for eliminating our search for ways of proceeding towards just that nor a ground for refusing to provide whatever can be easily provided right now for all In this context it is also necessary to bear in mind an important reminder contained in Paul Farmers book Pathologies of Power   Human Rights and the New War on the Poor Claims that we live in an era of limited resources fail to mention that these resources happen to be less limited now than ever before in human history In addition we have to take note of the dual role of healthcare in directly making our lives better  reducing our impoverishment in ways that matter to all human beings  as well as helping to remove poverty assessed even in purely economic terms Reduction of economic poverty occurs partly as a result of the greater productivity of a healthy and educated population leading to higher wages and larger rewards from more effective work but also because UHC makes it less likely that vulnerable uninsured people would be made destitute by medical expenses far beyond their means Here again Thailands experience shows how penury caused by medical costs can fall rapidly once UHC is established The mutual support that healthcare and economic development can provide has been brought out very extensively by the results of UHCoriented policies in southeast Asia from Japan to Singapore The complementary nature of health advancement and economic progress is also illustrated in the comparative experiences of different states within India I remember being admonished  years ago when I spoke in support of Keralas efforts to have statesupported healthcare for all I was firmly told that this strategy could not possibly work since Kerala was then one of the poorest states in India The thesis of unaffordability was however wrongly argued for reasons already discussed Despite its poverty Kerala did manage to run an effective UHC programme that contributed greatly to its having by some margin the longest life expectancy in India and the lowest rates of infant and child mortality among its other health accomplishments But in addition to these socalled social achievements it was possible to argue even in those early days  despite scorn from those who were opposed to UHC  that with the help of a more educated and healthier workforce Kerala would also be able to grow faster in purely economic terms After all there are no influences as strong in raising the productivity of labour as health education and skill formation  a foundational connection to which Adam Smith gave much attention This has actually happened In fact the previously poor state of Kerala with its universal healthcare and universal schooling now has the highest per capita income among all the states in India Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh both of which have made substantial moves towards the provision of education and basic healthcare for all have both progressed admirably and now belong solidly among the richer Indian states There is thus plenty of evidence that not only does universal healthcare powerfully enhance the health of people its rewards go well beyond health There is indeed a strong relationship between health and economic performance and we have every reason to base public policy on a proper understanding of the nature and reach of what is clearly a positive interdependence There is no mystery in all this given the centrality of health for better lives and for enhancing human capabilities
