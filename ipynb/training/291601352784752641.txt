How evil is sugar Thats long been a hard question for researchers to answer Most of the studies about sugars health effects to date have been too small too shortterm or too poorly designed to nail it one way or another But a new   on sugar and weight tries to fill that void Researchers at the University of Otago in New Zealand looked at more than  of studies on sugar and obesity at the request of the World Health Organization which is updating its guidelines on sugar intake Most were disqualified because they followed people for less than two months or asked participants to diet exercise or undergo medical treatments at the same time The  studies that made the cut together confirmed that adults who upped their intake of sugary foods or drank sugarsweetened drinks gained  pounds a year while people who cut back on sugar lost about the same amount The results were reported in the  l Whats emerged most clearly is that sugar in the form of water sodas fruit drinks energy drinks is especially problematic says   a professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health and author of an   that accompanies the new study He thinks thats because its easier to drink than eat Its almost impossible to eat  teaspoons of sugar but its very easy to drink at ounce soda with  teaspoons of sugar The weight gain seen in the   review is probably just due to the energy in sugar the researchers say not because of any uniquely bad effects of fructose or sucrose Those two sugars are vilified by the   school which blames them for most health ills Scientists say its only very recently that theyve started to get a grasp on the connection between sugar obesity and the risk of chronic disease This is after decades of claims that sugar causes a host of ills including tooth decay cancer hyperactivity gout and diabetes  and plenty of pushback from sugarproducing countries and the food industry Sugars as defined by the New Zealanders included sweetened beverages fruit juice jam cookies and candy desserts and plain old sugarThe study didnt quantify how much more sugar each person who gained or lost weight was eating which isnt much help in figuring out how much is too much But the study authors say the findings confirm that the World Health Organization guideline of keeping sugar intake at  percent or below is justified Its also impossible to say how much cutting back sugar would reduce obesity the New Zealanders say because sugars not the only factor A quick glance at todays   hall of shame from the Center for Science in the Public Interest makes that clear Winners include Smoothie Kings Peanut Power Plus Grape Smoothie with  calories and  teaspoons of added sugar But theres also the Bistro Shrimp Pasta from the Cheesecake Factory which at  calories and  grams of saturated fat will meet your fat needs for an entire week Willett agrees that its not just about the sugar A totally narrow focus on sugar is just too limiting he tells The Salt We really need to focus on carbohydrate quality and not on sugar alone Willett is a longtime proponent of the   which emphasizes whole grains fruits and vegetables fish and vegetable oil Still refined sugar remains a tempting target In  the   that people keep their added sugar consumption below  percent of daily calories a number that sparked a barrage of criticism from the food industry Americans typically average  percent while the   recommends just  percent of discretionary calories equal to  calories a day for a man or  for a woman The CocaCola company joined the fray this week with   that it says will help society beat one of the most serious complex issues of this generation  obesity One which debuts today on   makes it perfectly clear right up front that a can of CocaCola has  calories the global beverage giants blog proclaims You could take that as helpful advice on an easy way to cut back on added sugar Or you could take that as an invitation to indulge Big beverage companies have been moving to selling lowersugar options as NPRs Dan Charles   last month but a big chunk of their income still comes from selling sugar water
