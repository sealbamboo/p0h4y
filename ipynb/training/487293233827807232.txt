The series on family caregivers that NPR ran over the Fourth of July weekend sparked an extraordinary response with tens of thousands of comments and likes on   and   Many people responded to the intimate photographs of families caring for sick or disabled parents siblings and children And not all those responses were positive One photo in particular of James Lee carrying his yearold son Justin wearing only a diaper struck many readers of a   as undignified and disrespectful Im sure this may be a great story NPR but as a person with a disability myself Im unhappy with the picture you chose Did you consider this mans personal privacy when you decided to use the photo Ed Ahern   on NPRs Facebook page Others felt that it was an honest view into the life of family caregivers Abigail Moe   on Facebook What I see as a person directly unaffected by circumstances like this is a loving father carrying and embracing his son  this isnt just a shock value photo it provokes more than that I called photographer Andrew Nixon a multimedia producer for Capital Public Radio in Sacramento Calif and asked him about the comments and photos which he shot over the course of two months Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity We tried to get a wide range of experiences that the family went through And part of that is bathing your son because he cant do it himself The Lees were very comfortable being photographed I felt it was clear to them that I wasnt there to embarrass them His parents demonstrated pretty thoroughly that they really have his best interests at heart And hes not in a position to tell them what he does and does not want I think the photo served the purpose of showing a father taking care of his son If it was just Justin I think that would have been disrespectful It would have crossed that line Some of them did so we just didnt publish them And I saw some of the comments that said You know you dont need to show someone in this situation to get that point across and thats true to an extent The story is more about the parents and their experiences caregiving If Justin were alone I feel it would undermine the photo But he wasnt He was with his father and you can see that he clearly loves him Most of it was positive  what wonderful parents what a great thing that their faith let them tackle this There were people complimenting them on how they take care of their son people complimenting them on their marriage I felt that people had a good handle on the Lees and how extraordinarily loving and patient and what nice people they are I dont think they were expecting some of the comments on Facebook Some of the ugly comments about them as a family threw them off They werent bothered by the photo at all When I read the description of the series I knew a lot of the photos were going to be similar A lot of the photos were going to involve touching interaction  there wasnt a lot of intense action It was more intimate and subtle A lot of people dont think their daily life is very interesting but when youre an outsider observing people whose lives are affected by the story youre trying to tell then the whole of their day becomes interesting
