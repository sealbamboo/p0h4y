WASHINGTON—Almost 6.4 million people selected a health-care plan on the federal marketplace or were automatically re-enrolled in the first month of the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment season this fall, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said Tuesday.. That figure compares with about 5.4 million people who had selected plans using the federal exchange in the original enrollment period of Oct. 1, 2013, through March 31, 2014.
