Most of us know that moderate exercise is good for us But surprisingly few of us know what moderate exercise means  research shows An instructive new study found that many of us underestimate how hard we should exercise to achieve maximum health benefits and overestimate how vigorously we are actually working out  Its been six years since the federal government  Straightforward and flexible they recommend that adults complete  minutes of moderate or  minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise each week Either  prolonged sessions or multiple shorter workouts are OK and the form is never specified Jog cycle swim walk do tai chi rake leaves or jump rope  any activity is fine the recommendations suggest as long as you reach and maintain the specified intensity Since then the governments of many other nations including Canada and Britain have endorsed essentially the same guidelines for their citizens and doctors now routinely advise their outofshape patients to begin exercising moderately So does this column  But no scientific studies had determined whether average people know what the recommended intensities feel like in action So for a   researchers at York University in Toronto recruited  sedentary adult Canadians  ages   to   and set out to see what they knew about exercising for health  The formal exercise guidelines do offer guidance for determining the intensity of your workout You can use heart rate for instance During moderate exercise according to the Canadian guidelines your pulse should rise to about   percent to  percent of your maximum heart rate during vigorous exercise your pulse should hover between about  percent and  percent of your maximum More casually the American guidelines suggest that during moderate exercise you should be able to talk but not sing while during vigorous activity you will not be able to say more than a few words without pausing for a breath The Canadian researchers began by asking their volunteers if they were familiar with the national exercise guidelines A few said that they were although most were not So the researchers handed out copies of the guidelines for the volunteers to study and then asked if they felt that they understood the guidelines could comply with them and were perhaps already complying  With surprisingly little demur almost all of the volunteers said that the guidelines were clear and they felt confident that they could complete the requisite amounts of moderate exercise Quite a few of the volunteers said that they believed that they indeed were already meeting the guidelines The scientists then measured the volunteers actual maximum heart rate with a treadmill test before having them walk or jog on the treadmill at a pace that they felt to be alternately light moderate and vigorous The volunteers were asked to maintain each of the desired intensities for about three minutes so that the researchers could track their heart rates Finally the volunteers were asked to walk at the slowest pace that they felt would qualify as moderate meaning the slowest pace at which someone could expect to gain significant health benefits from the exercise  The volunteers were as it turned out quite inept at judging intensity Few maintained a heart rate above  percent of their maximum when they were supposedly exercising moderately even fewer reached a heart rate above  percent of maximum during their version of vigorous exercise  Perhaps most telling a majority of the volunteers walked at a decidedly languorous pace when asked to estimate the lowestintensity exercise that would qualify as moderate and provide robust health benefits Only about  percent reached a pace that raised their heart rate into the moderate range The rest gently strolled  In general during each of the tests the volunteers overestimated how hard they were exercising said Jennifer L Kuk a professor of kinesiology at York University who oversaw the experiment The implications of that finding are worrisome she continued on both a personal and public health level At present   percent to  percent of American and Canadian adults report in surveys that they exercise intensely enough to meet the national guidelines But if many of them are exaggerating their efforts however unintentionally Dr Kuk said the problem of physical inactivity may be even larger than the surveys suggest At a more intimate level those of us who misjudge our exertions may be gaining fewer health benefits than we expect from exercise she said If you are unsure of how well you gauge intensity she said take your pulse frequently during a workout If it lingers below about  percent of your maximum heart rate raise your pace The standard formula for determining maximum heart rate   minus your age  is notoriously inaccurate A more precise formula   is  minus  percent of your age  And without belaboring the obvious remember that any amount of physical activity at almost any intensity will have some health benefits Dr Kuk said
