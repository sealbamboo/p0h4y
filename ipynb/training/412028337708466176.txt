The female condom flopped when it was launched some  years ago but it never disappeared entirely and now a number of companies are entering the fray with new products Could its time have come Its formal name was the FC though many of us knew it as the Femidom or Reality and jokers called it all sorts of names  plastic bag windsock hot air balloon Two decades on Mary Ann Leeper has yet to see the funny side of such quips I so believed in that product she says I so believed that women would want to be able to take care of themselves We were naive or I certainly was naive Leeper was the president of Chartex the company that made the FC Before the launch there was an atmosphere of curiosity and anticipation but those involved underestimated just how unfamiliar the large slippery device would look and feel to customers in Europe and the US  Leeper traces the backlash to a single negative article in an influential US womens glossy magazine  That story was the pivotal story that became like a domino effect she says It was a shock to me to tell you the truth Why would you make fun of a product that was going to help young women stay healthy that was going to protect them from sexually transmitted infections as well as unintended pregnancy To be fair the FC had something of a design flaw Made of polyurethane it was a bit noisy during sex and it was inevitable that comic stories of rustling under the bedclothes would be told and retold In the early years Chartexs successor the Female Health Company considered folding but instead it set about developing an education programme Then one day in  Leeper received a telephone call from a woman called Daisy responsible for Zimbabwes HIV and Aids programme She said I have a petition here on my desk signed by  women demanding that we bring in the female condom recalls Leeper  It was the start of a set of partnerships that took the female condom to women in large parts of the developing world  The FCs successor the FC  made of nonrustling synthetic latex  is far more successful than many in the West realise  It is available in  countries sales have more than doubled since  and the Female Health Company has been turning a profit for eight years The vast majority of sales are to four customers  the US aid agency USAID the UN and the ministries of health in Brazil and South Africa Donors and public health officials are keen on anything that gives women the upper hand in what they call condom negotiation with men Female condoms have other advantages too They can be inserted hours before sex meaning that there is no distraction at the crucial moment and they dont need to be removed immediately afterwards For women there is better protection from sexually transmitted infections since the vulva is partially covered by an outer ring that keeps the device in place  User feedback is also pretty good  A  survey found that  of women were interested in using the method again and  would recommend trying them to friends  Many people report that female condoms heighten sexual pleasure says Saskia Husken from the Universal Access to Female Condom Joint Program UAFC For men they are less tight than male condoms For women the large ring of the condom  which remains outside the vagina  can also be stimulating   In Africa the free availability of female condoms at clinics has led to an unexpected fashion trend Women have taken to removing the flexible ring from the device and using it as a bangle If you are romantically available you have a new bangle on says Marion Stevens from the female health campaigning body Wish Associates If you are in a longterm relationship your bangle is old and faded Meyiwa Ede from the Society of Family Health in Nigeria says that while men are often excited by the prospect of sex without having to wear a regular condom women are taken aback by their first glimpse of the device They look at it and say OK  are you saying I have to put that in myself she says  Edes team of demonstrators use a mannequin to show the condom is inserted and compare the task to using a new phone  bewildering at first but second nature after a while  In most developed countries there is still that yearold image problem to overcome I think the issue is when you open the package theyre already open  theyre not like male condoms that are in these neat little packages and then theyre unrolled says Mags Beksinska from the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa In fact theyre the same length as a male condom so if you hold the two together open theyre not that different  Beksinska is the lead author of a clinical trial  of three new models of female condom The Lancet study which showed that all were no less reliable than the FC improves their chances of gaining wide acceptance internationally Other radically redesigned female condoms are either available now or will be soon  The Air Condom on sale in Colombia features a little pocket of air to aid insertion The Panty Condom made by the same Colombian manufacturer Innova Quality is packaged with a special pair of knickers which keep the condom in place though this product currently lacks a distributor Meanwhile a female condom known as the Origami is about a year away from market launch in the US  Its designer Danny Resnic who started to work in this area after contracting HIV because of a broken condom in  paid close attention to the jokes about the FC Theres a reason it looks like a plastic bag  it  a plastic bag he says Its putting a round peg into a differentshaped hole  His female condom is ovalshaped which mirrors the female anatomy he says It is packaged as a teatshaped capsule see image at the top of this story and once inserted it expands like the bellows of a concertina The outer ring of the condom is designed to sit flat against the labia rather than dangling as some others do Its an intimate product and a shared experience for two people he says So our female condom is intended to be attractive for both men and women Since the Origami condom is made from silicone it has the added benefit of being reusable  it can be washed in a dishwasher Saskia Husken of UAFC says its important for couples to have a choice of products if the female condom is to achieve its potential  There is a need for variety says Husken Some women prefer one product and some prefer another and men as well We are not all the same A  study bears this out Researchers asked  South African women to try out three different female condoms five times After nine weeks they could choose to stop the research or continue using the female condom of their choice Eightyseven percent chose to continue and by this time almost all of them had a definite preference  opted for the womens condom while  went for the FC and  for the VA Wow The fact that  years have passed and the female condom has not matched the success of the male condom  it still accounts for only  of global condom procurement and costs about  times as much  does not dent the confidence of these entrepreneurs Mary Ann Leeper explains how she came to realise that it could be a very long game Several years after the disastrous launch of the FC a man from Tampax came to talk to her He said it had taken not years but decades before doctors put their faith in tampons and women stopped seeing them as weird and gross He showed me the learning curve Leeper recalls  I said Oh God dont tell me Have I got to wait all this time I dont know if I can last that long But the female condom evangelists may yet have the last laugh
