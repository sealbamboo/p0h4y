Fruit doesnt have gluten potato chips usually dont either But at the Celiac Disease Foundations annual conference and product expo over the weekend FritoLay and Dole had tables and offered samples Remember when grapefruit was labeled as fat free The idea is either clever marketing or consumer education depending on the perspective FritoLay in  began to test and certify products that had no gluten  protein found in wheat barley and rye and a substance that people with the autoimmune condition celiac disease must avoid In addition many people  as many as one in three in this country  say they feel better when they dont eat it Our consumers with celiac disease and gluten intolerances have told us it is helpful when they shop to see a glutenfree indication on product packaging FritoLay said in a flyer at the show held at the Pasadena Convention Center As for Dole it was sampling fruit cups but announced five new soups including black bean and corn carrot ginger and tomato vegetable that are gluten free The company also has an eightpage list of its products that dont have gluten There were some interesting new ideas at the show too  new to me at any rate Nicoles Naturals of Irvine launched just three weeks ago with a delicious pancake and waffle mix I got tired of making two meals glutenfree for her and with gluten for her husband Nicole Washington said so she came up with a mix that everyone would be happy to eat In fact she said her husband liked it so much he persuaded her to turn it into a commercial product Washington an industrial engineer said her son liked to host waffle parties adding all sorts of fruit and other items to waffles When he became a fan of her glutenfree waffles and took them to class that made me feel really good she said Six cans are  at   Like so many glutenfree products the Yes Bar also started in a family kitchen Abigail Walds son had a lot of food allergies and could not eat gluten I was always saying no to everything she said After lots of sobbing and many trials she said she came up with a bar her son and his friends said yes to It comes in macadamia chocolate chip and mocha cayenne not too spicy flavors Theyre full of nuts and seeds and sold in several dozen stores including Erewon near the Grove in Los Angeles for about  each Deb Wheaton said that when learned she had celiac disease nine years ago Id be thrilled to have a cookie even if it was like a hockey puck Its a different world now Her world is different too as the president of   a Montana company that sells oat groats oatmeal and related products The company grows a hullless variety of oats that in rolled form look smaller than Quakers and in groat form look like rice The groats Wheaton said can be cooked like steel cut oats or like rice and eaten for breakfast or dinner s glutenfree food colorings may appeal not just to people avoiding gluten but to those who dont want to eat the chemicals found in many ordinary recipes Consumers are searching for alternatives said Tamara Biedebach the marketing and sales director for the Anaheim company Theyre  for a box of four colors Its tough to recreate all the vibrant colors available for cookie and cake decorators Yellow dyed with turmeric looks great and so does pink But reds a challenge The deeper colors are harder Biedebach said We are developing a Halloween collection and its hard to make black The company uses beets carrots annato red cabbage and other plants to create its dyes Gretchen Bender gave up her career as a community college dean three years ago to become a candy maker And so far things are working out very well for Salty Sisters a San Diego candy company thats doesnt use wheat syrups making it glutenfree Salty Sisters makes toffees caramels and sauces that it hopes will reintroduce the public to fresh candy Bender saidÂ  She started selling the product at a farmers market in  Its available at two shops in San Diego and online The toffee is  for a halfpound box Most of the ingredients were naturally free of gluten including corn syrup But many customers want their foods to be free of genetically modified ingredients she said so she began looking for an alternative because much of the corn in this country is grown with GMOs They settled on brown rice syrup We found our flavor profile went through the roof It really added a depth of flavor Bender said Everybodys seen Breton crackers on the cheese platter Now the Canadian company Dare has produced glutenfree versions made with arrowroot and lentils Theyre the familiar shape come in original and herb and garlic flavors and cost  a box
