
 In the days before the London Marathon last year scientists from the Research Group in Breast Health at the University of Portsmouth in England approached female racers at the events registration center and asked them to complete an anonymous questionnaire about their exercise habits and breast health  Sore breasts are a common experience among women of all ages and sizes athletes and nonathletes alike  But scientists had not examined whether and to what extent exercise contributes to breast pain and conversely whether and to what extent breast pain alters how women exercise  So they surveyed almost  of the women registered for the race and learned as their   in The British Journal of Sports Medicine makes clear that exercise does significantly impact breast pain and vice versa  It should surprise no one of course that exercise influences breasts just as it does virtually every tissue in the male and female body  Female breast tissue is unusual however being weighty even in smallbreasted women but with little natural anatomical support As a result unconstrained breasts move independently when a woman does and that movement is exacerbated during exercise  Earlier   by the Portsmouth scientists established that unsupported female breasts  that is those not contained within a bra  oscillate as much as eight inches in space when a woman runs and not just up and down but also side to side forward and backward  Even when the volunteers wore a standard sports bra the scientists found their breasts often continued to sway considerably during running But whether this breast motion was linked to later soreness was unclear   Which is why the researchers now set out to examine the realworld consequences of being an active woman and having sore breasts  It is an important quality of life issue for women said Nicola Brown a member of the Research Group in Breast Health at Portsmouth a lecturer in exercise science at Saint Marys University College in London and the lead author of the study It is also an issue with too many dimensions to effectively study in a single laboratory experiment so the scientists decided instead to survey a cross section of active women And contrary to popular belief a cross section of active women is what the registration roll of a major marathon conveniently provides  Some people have the perception that female marathon runners are all slender and boyish as elite racers often are and dont have breasts Dr Brown said but she and her collaborators focused their study on the London Marathons massparticipation runners who are a variety of shapes and sizes she said When the scientists analyzed the surveys from these runners they found that they had data about women with  different bra sizes from an AA cup to an HH and chestband sizes from  to  inches The women ranged widely in body weight too with the average being about  pounds   More than  percent reported that they always wore a bra including during exercise But these active women were not immune from breast pain More than a third reported that their breasts were frequently were sore although not necessarily because of exercise Sore breasts most commonly were because of hormonal changes associated with the menstrual cycle the runners reported  The incidence of breast pain was highest among the women with the largest breasts More than half of those wearing an F cup or larger reported frequent breast pain But smallerbreasted women also were affected about  percent of those who wore an A cup or smaller said that their breasts often were sore Motherhood reduced the likelihood that a woman would report breast pain perhaps the authors speculate because pregnancy and breastfeeding alter the composition of the breasts   What the researchers found particularly striking was that for many of the women exercise induced or aggravated breast soreness and in consequence breast pain often altered how the women trained About a quarter of those with sore breasts said that they reduced the intensity of their workouts when their breasts hurt  walking in lieu of running for example  while others skipped exercise altogether In aggregate Dr Brown said the results suggest that exerciserelated breast pain can compromise the quality and quantity of physical activity for many women Of course many of us might consider that a selfevident finding  anecdotal evidence suggests that my friends and I complain all the time about how our breasts feel when were running But this is the first study to formally examine and validate the issue  It also Dr Brown said highlights the importance and significance of research into the treatment of breast pain A wellfitting supportive bra she said has been shown to lessen breast pain in about  percent of women with the condition But a large number of women including by inference many of the London runners are not wearing the right bra  The Research Group in Breast Health has published a   But far more research is needed into   Dr Brown said an undertaking that she hopes will progress rapidly having herself just completed her first marathon and been hampered occasionally during training by sore breasts
