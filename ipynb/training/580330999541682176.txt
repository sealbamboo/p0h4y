While most women in the UK have a one in  chance of developing ovarian cancer in their lifetime for those who inherit faulty genes like Angelina Jolie the risk increases to one in two  If women know they have BRCA gene mutations they can choose to take action before cancer develops  But weighing the risk of cancer that might never grow against the very real trauma of surgery to remove healthy tissue as a preventive measure is an incredibly difficult conundrum as Angelina Jolie explains I did not do this solely because I carry the BRCA gene mutation and I want other women to hear this  A positive BRCA test does not mean a leap to surgery she says in her diary in the New York Times In my case the Eastern and Western doctors I met agreed that surgery to remove my tubes and ovaries was the best option because on top of the BRCA gene three women in my family have died from cancer BRCA and BRCA are genes that help repair damage to the DNA in our cells If people inherit a mutated version of either of these genes it puts them at greater risk of certain cancers Jolie learned some time ago that she had inherited a faulty BRCA gene from her mother  She had already lost her mother grandmother and aunt to cancer which alerted doctors that she might also be at risk In the UK around one in every  people will carry a BRCA mutation  Generally experts only recommend screening if a person has a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer For example  For women carriers of BRCA it means their lifetime risk of breast cancer will range from  and their risk of ovarian cancer from   Men with BRCA mutations also have a slightly elevated risk of breast cancer Jolies doctors estimated that she had an  risk of breast cancer and a  risk of ovarian cancer in her lifetime unless she underwent surgery  In  awardwinning actress decided to have both breasts removed And now in  she has had her next preventive surgery  the removal of her ovaries and fallopian tubes  Her doctors advised that she should have this surgery about a decade before the earliest onset of cancer in her female relatives Her mothers ovarian cancer was diagnosed when she was  Jolie is now  No but it does greatly reduce the risk  Surgery does not completely guarantee that cancer will not develop  it is impossible to remove all of the atrisk tissue And there are side effects to consider  taking out the ovaries removes a womans fertility and puts her into the menopause for example Faulty BRCA genes are responsible for around  of all breast cancer cases and  of ovarian cancers meaning the rest are caused by other factors  Although Jolie says surgery was the right choice for her she says it may not be for others faced with the same dilemma  There is more than one way to deal with any health issue The most important thing is to learn about the options and choose what is right for you personally Some people may opt instead for enhanced screening  frequent checkups to make sure no cancer is growing   Doctors may also prescribe drugs like tamoxifen to reduce the risk of cancer developing  As Jolie says There is more than one way to deal with any health issue The most important thing is to learn about the options and choose what is right for you personally
