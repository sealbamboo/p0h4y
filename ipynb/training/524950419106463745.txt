A new examination of TB numbers shows there are more than  more cases globally than anyone thought And no surprise  governments are not fully funding global health and so efforts to get it under control are failing More than  million people developed tuberculosis in  the World Health Organization reports and  million of them died of it And there are nearly  in the US   imported Its the secondbiggest infectious disease killer after the AIDS virus As with the outbreak of   public health experts say its a lack of investment in health care systems that lets disease persist and spread in developing countries TB is virtually gone in rich countries The good news is that the mortality rate from TB is still falling and has dropped by  percent since  and while the new look at numbers shows more cases than thought the number of people developing active TB disease is falling by  percent a year WHO says in a new report released Wednesday Tuberculosis is especially insidious and hard to fight because people can be infected for years and even decades without showing symptoms It takes weeks if not months of treatment with antibiotics to eradicate it TB spreads in the air and untreated kills  percent of patients although it can take a decade to do so Worse the bacteria that causes tuberculosis has mutated and there are forms that resist multiple antibiotics and even types that are immune to almost every drug Theyre called multidrugresistant TB or MDRTB for short and extensively drugresistant or XDR TB The multidrug resistant TB MDRTB crisis continues with an estimated  new cases in  WHO says in a statement Worldwide about  percent of all people who developed TB in  had this form of the disease which is much harder to treat and has significantly poorer cure rates And  percent of are considered XDR meaning they resist almost all drugs and are even harder and more expensive to treat It only costs about  to  to cure someone of normal TB in the countries that have the most cases  almost all of them poorer countries in Africa and Asia If tuberculosis is eradicated before it can mutate into drugresistant forms its cheaper and easier for all involved experts say The cost per patient treated for MDRTB ranged from an average of   in lowincome countries to  in upper middleincome countries WHO says In the US it costs  to treat MDRTB compared to  for a normal case That can shoot up to  for an extensively resistant case This dismal news must serve as a wakeup call for governments donors and drug companies to step up and improve the DRTB response today said Dr Grania Brigden TB adviser for Mdecins Sans Frontires or Doctors Without Borders But companies and countries alike are actually cutting their investments in TB WHO says  billion is needed each year to find and treat patients and to invest in better drugs and work on a vaccine But only  billion is being spent The pharmaceutical industry is less interested in developing countries where the potential gains are limited Dr Mario Raviglione director of the global TB program at WHO told reporters The issue is how to push the pharma industry perhaps through novel financing methods
