Mothers carrying babies skintoskin could significantly cut global death and disability rates from premature birth a leading expert has said Prof Joy Lawn says kangaroo care not expensive intensive care is the key The  million babies every year born at or before  weeks gestation account for about  of the global burden of disease and one million of them die Of those who survive just under  have moderate or severe impairments and  have mild impairments  Prof Lawn from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine LSHTM said The perception is you need intensive care for preterm babies  But  of babies born premature are six weeks early or less They need help feeding with temperature control and they are more prone to infection Its really only before  weeks that their lungs are immature and they need help breathing She added Unless there are those breathing problems kangaroo care is actually better because it promotes breastfeeding and reduces infection Speaking ahead of World Prematurity Day on Friday UN Secretary General Ban Kimoon who leads the Every Woman Every Child movement which promotes improvements to healthcare for women and children said Threequarters of the one million babies who die each year from complications associated with prematurity could have been saved with costeffective interventions even without intensive care facilities Duncan Wilbur from the UK charity Bliss  said While kangaroo care saves lives in Africa it is also incredibly important for babies born too soon all over the world  Here in the UK our medical technology is extremely advanced but simply giving a baby kangaroo care or skintoskin can help make a babys breathing and heart rate more regular it can help a babys discomfort during certain medical procedures and importantly can benefit breastfeeding and bonding between the baby and parents Studies to be published this weekend in the Pediatric Research journal show boys are  more likely to be born prematurely  and boys who are premature are more likely to die or experience disability than girls Common disabilities include learning disorders and cerebral palsy Prof Lawn said One partial explanation for more preterm births among boys is that women pregnant with a boy are more likely to have placental problems preeclampsia and high blood pressure all associated with preterm births She added Baby boys have a higher likelihood of infections jaundice birth complications and congenital conditions but the biggest risk for baby boys is due to preterm birth   For two babies born at the same degree of prematurity a boy will have a higher risk of death and disability compared to a girl  Even in the womb girls mature more rapidly than boys which provides an advantage because the lungs and other organs are more developed
