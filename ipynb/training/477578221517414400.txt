Its hard not to be charmed by Hazel and Gus the flippant yet noble teenagers with cancer in the hit film   But movies have a bad habit of taking lifeordeath health crises and turning them into clich To find out if   stayed true we called on the experts  people who have had cancer as teenagers and young adults Not surprisingly most of them have read the book and seen the movie We talked with    a college student who is halfway through chemotherapy for astrocytoma a brain cancer Sammy Lorch  who was  when she was diagnosed with medulloblastoma a brain cancer    who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia a month after she graduated from college and Heather Wick  who was diagnosed with nonHodgkins lymphoma at age  Heres a condensed version of our conversations edited for length and clarity Katherine I was thought they might make it really cancery and overdramatic  have giant bags of chemo everywhere But they didnt I felt good about that actually My nurses had to tell me in order to get me sign the papers to start chemo If youre thinking its like what you see on TV thats not it I had this warped perception of how the chemotherapy would affect me I dont want other people to feel that way Sammy My main criticism of the movie is that they dont look sick Its great that Hazel has the nasal cannula and Gus learned to walk like someone with an amputation I know someone with that same amputation and he walks just like that But she wouldnt look to put together all the time Heather Two months after I was diagnosed with nonHodgkins lymphoma my boyfriend found a lump after his arm and was diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma What are the odds of that So I could totally identify with Hazel watching someone go through cancer and be in pain It was definitely a happier ending for us than in the book Katherine I would totally say things like that I would totally hashtag that on Instagram Sammy I almost did have my stereotypical Disney wish When you have a cancer diagnosis you get to make a wish right away When they asked me I didnt feel sick yet I felt like I kind of didnt deserve a wish So I asked to go to Orlando Fortunately that wasnt my final wish My wish was to be stage manager for the day for The Lion King on Broadway It was incredible oh my gosh I had worked in theater a lot in middle school and high school It was incredible to see what it took to do a show on Broadway Allison You feel alone In the movie and the book they meet with other cancer patients Ive never met other people my age going through this Its really hard to find people to relate to Heather Your parents are just waiting hand and foot on you but thats not really the kind of connection or social interaction that youre needing and craving at that point It affected friendships dramatically youre just starting life and youre facing the reality that life might be ending Thats something that I think most yearolds arent equipped to cope with Most of my friends went off to college and life went on for them and my life was on pause That was a tough pill to swallow I did have a few friends who called and texted and that was great But it was really lonely I was treated at a childrens hospital the same way Hazel was I could connect with that When youre  you cant have a good conversation with a yearold girl Its good for the heart but not the head Sammy I never worried too much that I was going to die because I had pretty good odds But when I did worry about it I thought about what would happen to my parents and the burden that you feel you put on your family You consume all of family life because theres so much going on with you Allison I find it hard to talk to my mom Its hard on her Its almost better to keep it to yourself but then it gets hard Thats where you feel the isolation Thats what happens in the movie Her parents get all scared Heather There were no typical cancer patients who were bald Maybe if one or two of the people in the support group had lost their hair and the movie touched on that it would have been better Sammy Shailene Woodleys hair was always perfect The description in the book that John Green has is very similar to what   a teenage cancer patient that Green knew looked like Having watched her videos and knowing how much she struggled it doesnt give the full picture Heather I was diagnosed five days before my high school graduation I had super long hair losing that was difficult Allison In the beginning my hair was falling out in clumps I went out and bought a wig Then one day I woke up and it was growing back Honestly as a girl hair was my biggest concern I consider myself very lucky Sammy When I went to the movie it was mostly high school girls who were there You could tell that the love story was why they were there And thats fine Its important to know that its something that really happens to people and this is what the experience is like Katherine I definitely related more to Hazels approach than to Gus She was being very realistic about it She has a disease where she knows that shes going to die eventually Shes on this drug thats keeping her alive and they dont know how long its going to keep working for her Shes prepared to die at almost any moment Thats more how I looked at it I need to be OK with dying for me to get through every day even though I have a much better prognosis than I think Hazel does Heather I think I survived so I could help other people through their struggle I survived You can do it too
