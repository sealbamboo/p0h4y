Death and taxes have always been twinned in clich for their unavoidable awfulness But death only happens to each of us once not annually Wouldnt our annual encounter with the Internal Revenue Service be more aptly paired with the Medicare Part D open enrollment period a yearly torture between midOctober and early December Both take days out of our lives and leave us sitting in a heap of papers with a splitting headache and residual worry that we got something wrong and will wind up in jail or the poorhouse  Its my third year of eligibility for Part D the Medicare option added in  that provides coverage for prescription drugs When I turned  I had nothing but good things to say about Medicare Parts A and B the  hallmark legislation that covers hospital and outpatient medical care Thats still mostly true but for the growing numbers of doctors who have opted out of the government program because of inadequate reimbursement and onerous paper work Part D designed as a publicprivate hybrid is another story Forgive my cynicism but any benefit that twins the insurance industry with Big Pharma cant really have the public interest at heart My first experience choosing a drug plan was chronicled here after a Fourth of July weekend that will   I should have expected as much since my colleague Gina Kolata a whiz at math wrote of her effort to choose a plan for her father testing if the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services website was as simple as promised and   Since my mathematical abilities are limited to counting on my fingers and Gina had struggled I was braced for trouble But not the trouble I found myself in  Year two I had an excuse not to try even when the booklet of changes for the coming year arrived from my insurance carrier and everything was more expensive by many multiples In the midst of selling one home and buying another who could fault me for taking a slide And how comforting to find out and recount here that a   study had   between  and  made no change even when they knew they were overpaying because it was too hard  Kaiser went so far as to say that the Part D plans had observed and responded to this behavior offering reasonable rates one year and overthemoon rates the next in a classic baitandswitch  Now in year three I vowed I would behave responsibly and do what the experts advised Review my current plan and its changes since  then compare it to everything else available  The biggest overall changes in Part D for  are fewer plans to choose from Still in  there will be  Part D plans available nationwide and an average of  in each region for Part Ds  million customers Most of the plans are more expensive and all have more drugs in the highest more expensive tiers with many requiring monthly preapproval Experts also cautioned not to be seduced by plans with no deductibles versus those that expect the consumer to pay the first  since the medication you take will often push the total price higher than a  deductible plan Heres when befuddlement set in On the government website   you can compare plans but only three at a time But I was interested in five So I ended up going to the individual health insurers websites and punching into each the medications I take the dosage and the frequency Theres one plan with no deductible I now pay  and a  vs  monthly premium But all my drugs now ranked at Tier One the least expensive would either bump up to Tier Four the most costly or require prior approval each and every month  Sometimes figuring out each plan required a call to the health insurance company for clarification In each case you have to to spell your name give your date of birth your phone number home and cell your mailing address and billing address the last four digits of your social security number and your mothers maiden name Usually you have to say them more than once In a halfdozen calls I spoke to agents named Bamer Sergei Miyosha to name a few All were very polite Few understood the policies they were selling  And some relieving my tedium went off script The temptation to hang up was trumped by knowing Id only have to start over  At the end of the process after adding up all the numbers and seeing which plan was most economical for me I had a new plan It had taken me two days maybe  hours I wish I had started earlier but like taxes we procrastinate And those wishing to change their plan have only until Dec  a Sunday to make a change  My new plan came with a digit customer ID number There was also a customer service phone number available  am to  pm seven days a week Somehow Id wind up automatically disenrolled from my current plan and one refill on each prescription would be transferred from my existing pharmacy chain to the new one which is right across the street If I did the math right this would cost me about  a year That seemed reasonable assuming unanticipated medications didnt get added to the list  Id made a decision In a year Id know if it was a good one Meantime my cholesterol medication has been discontinued It was one where the new plan saved me a dollar a month And I might as well pay for a Tier Four shingles vaccine now If I dawdle until after the first of the year it will cost  because the deductible wont be met Now I can get one for   The pharmacy I now must use advertises on television as being at the corner of healthy and happy Only time will tell
