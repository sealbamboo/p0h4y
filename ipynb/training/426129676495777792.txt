An emergency flight took her to BarnesJewish Hospital in St Louis on January  where she remains on a ventilator reported    The couples baby did not survive Creekmore spontaneously miscarried on January  her husband said  Her right lung collapsed over the weekend Chris Creekmore said He agreed to let doctors at the hospital talk about the case  Dr Rosanna GraySwain an obstetriciangynecologist at BarnesJewish Hospital who is not directly caring for Leslie Creekmore but is familiar with her case said Creekmore remains unconscious Its a little too early to tell what her outcome will be at this point GraySwain said  Tuesday Creekmore underwent surgery to receive a treatment called   her husband said ECMO is a therapy that provides heartlung bypass support and circulates blood through an artificial lung back to the body Chris Creekmore said one of the doctors told him it was a long shot but the procedure went well and she came out stable he said  Shes being cared for and her status is still very very tenuous GraySwain said earlier Tuesday If she had had the flu vaccine she probably wouldnt be here in this state Chris Creekmore said he and his wife had researched tips for healthy pregnancies and they had come across a recommendation to avoid the flu vaccine in the first trimester of pregnancy He said he asked his wifes OBGYN in Arkansas in October about the matter and the doctor told them he was wary of giving flu shots during the first trimester   I for one dont count it as a screwup on his end or anything like that Chris Creekmore said of the doctor who advised delaying the flu shot  The couple did not know that this guidance runs counter to federal health recommendations   to protect against serious complications as soon as the yearly vaccine becomes available in her area advises the US Department of Health and Human Services website   Women can receive the flu shot at any point during their pregnancies regardless of trimester according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports the CDC recommendation that all women get vaccinated if they will be pregnant during the influenza season Vaccination early in the season and regardless of gestational age is optimal    No harm has been demonstrated to pregnant women or their babies as a result of the vaccine the CDC said  BarnesJewish Hospital used to recommend that women wait until after the first trimester of pregnancy to receive a flu shot too GraySwain said But that policy changed four years ago with emerging evidence that the vaccine was safe for all pregnant women  The flu vaccine protects against many strains during the season from October to March Pregnant women who receive the vaccine may still get the flu but it would likely be a milder illness than otherwise and severe consequences would be improbable GraySwain said  A national effort to prevent the  HN pandemic flu has contributed to a dramatic increase in the number of pregnant women who receive flu vaccines according to the CDC Less than  of pregnant women received a flu shot before  in the next two seasons more than half of pregnant women got the vaccine protection  The flu may increase the risk of miscarriage premature birth and low birth weight the CDC said  Pregnancy puts extra stress on your heart and lungs Pregnancy can also affect your immune system These factors increase the risk of becoming severely ill due to the flu   Lifethreatening developments like Creekmores in flu patients are generally rare but not unheard of GraySwain said  Pregnant women are five times more likely to end up in the ICU or have severe complications related to the flu than nonpregnant women who get infected with the flu she said   The flu vaccine that is safe for pregnant woman is in injectable form and it does not contain the live virus GraySwain said The nasal spray versions should not be given to pregnant women If you are pregnant inform the health care staff administering the vaccine before you receive it  Washing your hands after using the bathroom touching public surfaces and other activities is also important she said  Pregnant women can also take a drug called Tamiflu It is most commonly taken to reduce the length of symptoms but it is also given to people with highrisk flu exposure as a prevention The Creekmores had planned to call the baby Jera KSDK reported The baby was too young to be able to be resuscitated GraySwain said  She was a far too young far too tiny but beautifully structured almostbaby girl Chris Creekmore said  His wife was unconscious during the miscarriage  She wanted to know the gender as bad as me Chris Creekmore said but I dont know how  how in the hell  Im going to when she wakes up tell her whats going on  Chris Creekmores friend set up a   to help the family raise money to support Leslies care The response is far greater than Chris Creekmore expected He thought the page might generate gas money for hospital visits Now donations are in the thousands of dollars  If there is money left over from the campaign after he pays his wifes medical bills Chris Creekmore wants to use the extra funds to help his sisters child who has a medical condition and to help support free flu vaccination clinics  His public message is Vaccinate yourself against the flu  Leslie had planned to get a flu shot at a clinic on January  the same doctors visit as her week ultrasound her husband said  It would have been the same day that she was placed on the ventilator
