For those who count Don Draper among their TV loves or lovetohates it comes as no surprise that drinking and smoking go hand in hand Public health researchers have long   that smokers tend to drink drinkers tend to smoke and heavy smokers see nearly anyone on   tend to drink even more heavily Weve also   that increasing state taxes on cigarettes actually reduces smoking and helps people break the habit Raising cigarette taxes also lowers the amount of drinking the most recent analysis finds The   published Wednesday in   highlights the tie between the vices It seems logical that as smoking decreases due to these policies that drinking might also decrease   a data analyst at the Washington University School of Medicine and one of the authors of the study tells Shots However the beneficial effect only applied to beer and spirits not wine Wine drinkers the authors say are more likely to have healthier lifestyle habits than beer or spirits drinkers As Krauss says The results made sense to us because prior research shows that wine drinkers are less likely to smoke Granted this doesnt explain Betty Drapers propensity to light up Krauss and her fellow researchers analyzed US data between  and  looking at how much alcohol was consumed per state per person each states price for a pack of cigarettes and their smokefree air policies Controlling for other variables like income unemployment rate and religious affiliation they saw the price of cigarettes a median of just  per pack in  compared to  in  and adoption of smokefree policies increase while alcohol consumption dropped States that showed the highest tax increases per pack also showed the greatest reduction in drinking   percent compared to just  percent in states with low cigarette price increases The researchers suggest its possible to kill two birds with one stone a  percent increase in cigarette price would correlate to a nearly  percent reduction in per capita drinking We already know that strengthening tobacco policies has great benefit in reducing smoking prevalence says Krauss This shows that there are unintended consequences that are having good public health benefits as well
