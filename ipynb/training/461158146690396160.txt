As a special adviser on health policy to the While House from  to  Dr Ezekiel Emanuel was deeply involved in the creation of the Affordable Care Act So its no surprise that in his new book   Emanuel defends the law But he also makes some surprising predictions about where health care is going in the next decade and beyond including forecasting the death of health insurance companies as we know them And   offers up healthcare trivia including the fact that compulsory health insurance dates back to  when ship owners had to buy medical insurance for their seamen Who knew We talked with Emanuel now a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania about the future of health care This is an edited and condensed version of that conversation I hope I put it in context Im not an unalloyed advocate of the Affordable Care Act I recognize and say explicitly in the book that its not a perfect law But the health care system was broken in  and everyone agreed we needed to do something and reform was essential This is certainly a step in the right direction across all relevant domains access cost quality and prevention I have lots of criticisms and I point them out in book But staying with what we had was untenable A major purpose of insurance is to protect people from large random losses and the insurance on the exchange definitely does that That is the fundamental thing One of the better parts of the bill is that were going to give people coverage in preventive services and in the primary care area and that does seem to me to be the right balance You encourage people on the primary care side and protect them from large random losses It turns out not to be that much cheaper because  percent of people use  percent of the dollars So allowing more people to buy those plans doesnt save that much Theres been some talk on the Hill of setting up a new class of plans that have lower premiums and higher outofpocket costs than the current bronze plans but youre not going to save that much money The communications strategy wasnt so hotsytotsy Thats been a problem Not only preventive services but what were trying to do to decrease obesity and improve wellness We needed a better communication strategy Its been one of the sore points even before the law was passed I think eventually people will realize theres no copay for preventive services And that thats interesting and exciting One of the problems for most consumers is the fragmentation of care the fact that theres pretty bad communication and coordination of care between your primary care physician and any specialist you might go to One of the strengths of bundled payment is that it requires coordinated care and a reorientation toward the patient Lots of people agree the feeforservice financial incentive structure is a problem The appeal of bundled payment is that its the easiest way to shift doctors and hospitals away from fee for service Im definitely in the minority in that prediction I recognize that Massachusetts is the best example against me In Massachusetts after reform there were more employers adding coverage And my prediction is conditional on the exchanges getting to be really desirable shopping venues They have to get up to the range of quality of Zappos or REI I think the only way it makes sense for people is if they can get pretty equivalent plans on the exchange People say Heres my plan and theres one thats roughly equivalent on the exchange I dont agree with you In general integrated systems do a pretty good job compared to lots of other ways care could be delivered
