 Diabetic patients treated by healthcare professionals who had poor communication skills were less likely to refill their cardiometabolic medications than those whose doctors were good communicators researchers found Among a cohort of more than  patients with diabetes a point decrease in scores for healthcare provider communication quality increased rates of poor adherence by a significant  percent according to Neda Ratanawongsa MD of the University of California San Francisco and colleagues Patients of healthcare professionals with low ratings on involving patients in decisions understanding patient problems with treatment and eliciting trust and confidence were significantly more likely to have poor adherence than those with higher ratings they wrote online in the   The researchers noted that future studies should look at whether communication interventions for providers with poor communication scores could improve adherence The study analyzed associations between patient perception of healthcare provider communication with adherence to refilling cardiometabolic medications among a cross section of  diabetic patients ages  to  who were taking one or more oral hypoglycemic lipidlowering or antihypertensive medications within  months of the survey The researchers used a subset of questions from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Survey CAHPS to evaluate provider communication skills Participants were asked to rate providers on overall communication quality shared decisionmaking with patients understanding patient problems and trust Outcomes for patient refill adherence were gathered through pharmacy data based upon the continuous medication gap which sums the proportion of days without sufficient medication supply across refill intervals over a period of time Poor adherence was defined as an absence of medication supply for greater than  percent of the time period examined Medication gaps were calculated for hypoglycemic medications lipidlowering medications and antihypertensives Differences in rates of adherence between patients with physicians who scored lower or higher in communication abilities were adjusted for age sex raceethnicity education English language proficiency functional health literacy income prescription and outpatient copayment requirements depression Charlson comorbidity index external locus of control and conscientiousness Participants had a mean age of  were about equally split by gender  percent female received a mean of  cardiometabolic medications and had seen their primary care provider for a mean of  years In terms of racialethnic groups the largest percentage   percent  were white followed by African Americans  percent Latinos  percent Asians  percent and Filipinos  percent A total of  percent of respondents had poor adherence to their cardiometabolic medication regimens with poor adherence seen for  percent of patients taking antihypertensive drugs  percent taking lipidlowering drugs and  percent of patients on oral hypoglycemic drugs Compared with providers who received high scores low scores on receiving patient input in decisionmaking were associated with an adjusted absolute decrease of  percent in adherence low scores on understanding patient problems with treatment were associated with an adjusted absolute decrease of  percent in adherence and low scores on trust and confidence were associated with an adjusted absolute decrease of  percent in adherence There was no association seen between adherence to refills of blood pressure medications and provider communication scores In an accompanying editorial Aanand Naik MD of the Michael E DeBakey VA Medical Center in Houston Texas noted that patientcentered healthcare lags because it lacks specificity in defining what a patientcentered approach to healthcare is Naik speculated that patient centeredness will require a twophase redesign The first he said would focus on patientdefined outcomes with scientific evidence and professional judgment informing treatment options and processes This would be followed by a more controversial second phase of offering patients transparency and control in their treatment though he added that information defining quality either does not exist or cannot be understood universally The authors noted the study was limited by recall bias singlemeasures for refill adherence missing insulin therapy adherence lack of following patients who changed healthcare providers and unmeasured confounders Source
