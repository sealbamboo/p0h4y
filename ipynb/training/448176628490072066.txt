One of the joys of turning  is that your doctor will start recommending a   Many people dread the test which involves having a tube inserted into the rectum to look for cancers and precancers Even so acceptance has grown tremendously In   percent of Americans ages  to  had been tested nearly three times the rate in  and the figure was even higher  percent in people over  All that screening seems to be paying off The incidence of   in people over  has dropped  percent in the last  years and deaths have also declined according to a   by the American Cancer Society Good news but not good enough experts say Too many people are still dying  expected this year along with  new cases Incidence and death rates are significantly higher in blacks than in whites for reasons that are not fully understood More poverty among blacks appears to account for some of the difference but not all This is a disease that can often be cured if it is found early It is also one of the few types of   that can be prevented by using   to find and remove abnormal growths called   which can turn cancerous Experts can detect about  percent of cancers and large polyps with a colonoscopy but smaller polyps are more easily missed Many of the deaths occur in patients who were not tested according to the cancer society which estimates that about  million people ages  to  are not up to date on screening One problem A colonoscopy is expensive   depending on whether polyps are removed and in what part of the country it is done   and some other insurers pay in full for the exam but not for polyp removal Patients sometimes receive an unexpected bill for hundreds of dollars or more A colonoscopy also requires time off from work and a regimen of strong laxatives and the procedure poses small but real risks of bleeding or injury to the intestine For all of its perceived drawbacks a colonoscopy at least does not have to be done very often  once every  years for most people if no polyps are found Those with polyps or other risk factors are usually advised to have the test done more often There are   which look for blood in the stool or examine the lower part of the intestine But many people dislike them because they require handling stool samples or having instruments poked into the rectum And the stool tests must be done once a year a schedule that many people fail to follow But doctors keep hoping that if more methods become available more people will find a screening test they can tolerate Last week a study of a new type of stool test was published in   The test   checks DNA from intestinal cells that have been shed into the stool and looks for   If abnormalities are found the patient is told to have a colonoscopy The goal of the study was to compare the DNA method with an existing test for blood in the stool called the   or FIT Nearly  people at average risk for colon cancer had the two tests and then underwent a colonoscopy Then the two stool tests were measured against colonoscopy Colonoscopy found  cancers and the DNA test detected  percent of the  The DNA test also detected  percent of the  potentially precancerous polyps that colonoscopy found The older stool test FIT did not perform as well detecting  percent of the cancers and  percent of the polyps But the DNA test had more falsepositive results than the other stool test  percent compared with  percent for the FIT meaning that  percent of healthy patients would get a false alarm and be urged to have colonoscopy Unlike the current stool test which uses a brush to collect a tiny bit of stool from the toilet the DNA test requires that patients send an entire bowel movement but no more than  grams or twothirds of a pound to a laboratory The test kit includes a quartsize container with a bracket that holds it just below the opening in a toilet seat You cant miss said Kevin Conroy the president of Exact Sciences which makes Cologuard The test is not available yet but an advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration is expected to review it this week and vote on whether to recommend approving it The panel will also consider a blood test that can detect about  percent of colon cancers A final decision from the federal agency will come later  senior director for cancer control at the American Cancer Society said the group thinks a DNA stool test is a good idea because people need all the options they can get The cancer society and other health groups announced a campaign last week to increase the screening rate in people over  to  percent by  and Dr Smith said he thought a new type of test could help But   chairman of the department of surgery at the University of Minnesota had concerns about the DNA test finding only  percent of polyps The great advantage of colonoscopy he said was its ability to prevent cancer entirely by finding these growths so that they could be removed Sometimes a tests overall detection rate can be increased if it is done often  say once a year which is recommended for the standard stool tests But the optimal test interval for Cologuard is not clear Its price has not been set either but could be about  Mr Conroy said The standard FIT costs about  Even if the new test is approved it will not replace colonoscopy or even the existing stool test which people may prefer because it is cheaper and requires a much smaller sample Anyone with a positive finding on the DNA test will still be urged to have a colonoscopy And a colonoscopy will still be recommended for people at high risk because of family history or their own history of polyps or other problems Dr Smith said
