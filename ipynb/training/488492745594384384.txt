One in three cases of Alzheimers disease worldwide is preventable according to research from the University of Cambridge The main risk factors for the disease are a lack of exercise smoking depression and poor education it says Previous research from  put the estimate at one in two cases but this new study takes into account overlapping risk factors Alzheimers Research UK said age was still the biggest risk factor  the Cambridge team analysed populationbased data to work out the main seven risk factors for Alzheimers disease These are  They worked out that a third of Alzheimers cases could be linked to lifestyle factors that could be modified such as lack of exercise and smoking  The researchers then looked at how reducing these factors could affect the number of future Alzheimers cases They found that by reducing each risk factor by  nearly nine million cases of the disease could be prevented by  In the UK a  reduction in risk factors would reduce cases by  or  by  they calculated Current estimates suggest that more than  million people worldwide will be living with Alzheimers by   more than three times the number affected in  Prof Carol Brayne from the Institute of Public Health at the University of Cambridge said Although there is no single way to treat dementia we may be able to take steps to reduce our risk of developing dementia at older ages We know what many of these factors are and that they are often linked Simply tackling physical inactivity for example will reduce levels of obesity hypertension and diabetes and prevent some people from developing dementia  As well as being healthier in old age in general its a winwin situation Dr Simon Ridley head of research at charity Alzheimers Research UK said there was still much to discover about the disease  While age is the biggest risk factor for most cases of Alzheimers there are a number of lifestyle and general health factors that could increase or decrease a persons chances of developing the disease  However we still do not fully understand the mechanisms behind how these factors are related to the onset of Alzheimers  Dr Ridley said there were more than  people in the UK living with dementia and an ageing population would lead to spiralling numbers being affected As there is still no certain way to prevent Alzheimers research must continue to build the strongest evidence around health and environmental factors to help individuals reduce their risk  He added This new study also highlights that many cases are not due to modifiable risk factors which underlines the need to drive investment into new treatment research Of the seven risk factors the largest proportion of cases of Alzheimers in the US UK and the rest of Europe can be attributed to physical inactivity The study says about a third of the adult population in these countries are physically inactive Physical inactivity is also linked to increased risks of other health problems such as cancers and cardiovascular diseases
