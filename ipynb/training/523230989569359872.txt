How many times do top officials have to say that the Ebola virus is not airborne A lot apparently Here is President Obama Thursday This is not an airborne disease It is not easy to catch And the day before It is not like the flu It is not airborne And Friday a reporter asked the inevitable question about airborne Ebola when Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases held a press briefing about nurse Nina Phams transfer to the National Institute of Health There is no evidence whatsoever that this virus is airbornetransmitted said Fauci emphatically Everything we know about this virus is that it is direct contact with bodily fluids This gets said over and over Its backed up by epidemiological studies of past outbreaks Yet the possibility of Ebola spreading through the air keeps being raised At a hearing Thursday for example lawmakers grilled Dr Thomas Frieden the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Youve already said a couple of times that you dont believe that this is airborne said Republican Congresswoman Renee Ellmers from North Carolina And yet she noted the two nurses still got sick They followed precautions I am sure and now we are having this conversation and Im very concerned about that Frieden responded that the investigation is ongoing but the nurses treated the Ebola patient when his vomit and diarrhea contained a lot of virus We are confident this is not airborne transmission When government officials keep saying this isnt airborne it seems like what theyre really trying to tell the public is Dont worry about catching this virus in the course of your normal daily activities I think that what they are trying to convey with the idea that its not airborne is that you likely need to be relatively close to the person where there are some bodily fluids present says Rachael Jones who studies infectious disease transmission at the University of Illinois at Chicago She says if someone down the hall from you had Ebola and threw up vomit that contains the virus those particles are not going to travel hundreds of feet or hundreds of meters to cause an infection But if a health care worker or a family member gets very close to someone who has a lot of symptoms which is when people with Ebola are most contagious Jones says droplets of body fluid could potentially travel through the air for short distances If you vomit there are projectile droplets that could spray up she notes And she says theres reason to be concerned that an Ebola patient might produce even smaller droplets that someone in close quarters could inhale and get sick from  during medical procedures like putting in a breathing tube A lot of these medical processes that health care workers perform produce small aerosols says Jones This is why she and a colleague recently   saying this needs to considered when protecting health care workers So even though Jones takes issue with the White Houses flat statement that the Ebola virus cannot spread through air she says this is really not a concern for the public There is not epidemiological evidence that communitybased exposure such as being at a shopping mall or walking down the street or riding a bus is associated with disease transmission she notes Still what if the Ebola virus mutates Thats another fear that keeps surfacing The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Martin Dempsey spoke about that   Im worried about it because we know so little about it he said Youll hear different people describe whether it could become airborne He said that scientists did not agree I dont know whos right I dont want to take that chance So Im taking it very seriously Its true that researchers cant absolutely rule out the idea that mutations might change how the virus spreads but this seems unlikely says Alan Schmaljohn a virologist the University of Maryland School of Medicine He said the chance of that is very low probably in the range of winning the multistate lottery On Capitol Hill the CDCs director said his team has been on the lookout for any significant genetic mutations What weve seen is very little change in the virus Frieden told lawmakers We dont think it is spreading by any different way Chances are thats not the last time hell have to say that
