Oregon has spent more than  million to build its own online health care exchange It gave that money to a Silicon Valley titan Oracle but the result has been a disaster of missed deadlines a nonworking website and a state forced to process thousands of insurance applications on paper Some Oregon officials were sounding alarms about the tech companys work on the states online health care exchange as early as last spring Oracle was behind schedule and worse didnt seem able to offer an estimate of what it would take to get the states online exchange up and running It is the most maddening and frustrating position to be in absolutely says Liz Baxter chairwoman of the board for   the states online exchange We have spent a lot of money to get something done  to get it done well  to serve the people in our state and it is maddening that we cant seem to get over this last hump Oregon had an ambitious goal to create a place where anyone from Medicaid recipients and smallbusiness owners to people in the individual market could go to shop for insurance In hindsight  which is always wonderful  we made decisions that made our system much more complicated to build Baxter says Initially Oracle promised it could get the job done But by midMay the head of Cover Oregon Rocky King had written the company pleading for a simple calendar schedule  to ascertain whether or not we will be able to deliver a working exchange by Oct  Five months later when Oregons exchange was supposed to go live the site still didnt work And as recently as two weeks ago the state had not yet managed to sign up a single person for private health insurance under the federal Affordable Care Act In desperation Baxter says Cover Oregon hired hundreds of temporary workers and cobbled together an application based on paper  currently the only way to apply Its very easy try to envision you can automate a paper process Baxter says But its been very complex to take this  complicated online system that weve been building and turn that into a paper process David Kline an author and freelance journalist with a wife and two young children is dealing with the fallout A Portland resident Kline is selfemployed and eager to shop for new health insurance coverage on Oregons exchange It costs a lot of money to buy your own insurance he says We spend about  a year on insurance premiums copays unreimbursed expenses Thats a lot of money Some people can live on that Kline quickly realized that he could buy better insurance for less on Oregons new exchange but signing up hasnt been easy After realizing that the website was hopeless Kline tried applying by paper But he soon realized the paper application had flaws that made reporting an accurate income impossible Then he    and was soon promised a fix  but says he hasnt seen one I just downloaded the new application this morning  its the same application he says Originally Oregon had hoped that Kline and tens of thousands of others would be able to do all of this online The state hired Oracle to make that possible and has paid the company  million so far But Oracle has missed deadline after deadline Kline is fed up with the delays for the rollout They told us Oct  they told us Oct  they told us Nov  they told us Nov  Kline says Come on Oracle declined repeated requests from NPR to comment Now Cover Oregon is telling its citizens who need insurance that they need to get their paper applications postmarked by Dec   this week  to get coverage by the beginning of  Theyll then need to finish the process and pick a plan by Dec  Oracle is now telling state officials that the website should be up and working by Dec   one day after the deadline King the executive director of Cover Oregon announced Monday that he will resign citing health reasons But there is little hope the state will get its money back from the tech company Baxter says there will be investigations into what went wrong and Oracles responsibility But for now she says shes trying to focus on Cover Oregons mission We have tried very hard to be clear that our goal is about coverage
