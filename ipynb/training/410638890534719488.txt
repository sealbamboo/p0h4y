Exercise can be as effective as many frequently prescribed drugs in treating some of the leading causes of death according to a new report The study raises important questions about whether our health care system focuses too much on medications and too little on activity to combat physical ailments For the study   researchers compared how well various drugs and exercise succeed in reducing deaths among people who have been diagnosed with several common and serious conditions including heart disease and diabetes  Comparative effectiveness studies are a staple of science of course especially in pharmaceutical research Scientists often track how well one drug treats a condition compared with the outcome if they use a different drug But few studies have directly compared drugs with exercise and even fewer have compared outcomes in terms of mortality or whether the intervention significantly lessens the chance that someone with a disease will die from it despite treatment So Huseyin Naci a graduate student at the London School of Economics and Political Science and Dr John Ioannidis the director of the Stanford Prevention Research Center at the Stanford University School of Medicine decided to create a comprehensive comparison of the effectiveness of drugs and exercise in lessening mortality among people who had been diagnosed with one of four diseases heart disease chronic heart failure stroke or diabetes They chose these particular conditions because those were the only ones for which they could find studies that had examined whether exercise lessened the risk of death among patients with that disease Mr Naci said  He and Dr Ioannidis then gathered all of the recent randomized controlled trials as well as previous reviews and metaanalyses of older experiments relating to mortality among patients with those diseases whether they had been treated with drugs or exercise  They ended up with data covering  past experiments that collectively involved almost  participants which is an impressive total But most of the volunteers had received drugs Only  of the experiments involving  volunteers had examined the impact of exercise as a treatment  Still the numbers were large enough that Mr Naci and Dr Ioannidis could create an elaborate network of crossreferences comparing the outcomes when people received certain drugs followed exercise regimens or occasionally both The exercise routines typically part of rehabilitation programs usually involved walking or other aerobic routines but sometimes consisted of weight training or other exercises  The researchers compared mortality risks for people following any of the treatment options  The results consistently showed that drugs and exercise produced almost exactly the same results People with heart disease for instance who exercised but did not use commonly prescribed medications including statins angiotensinconvertingenzyme inhibitors or antiplatelet drugs had the same risk of dying from  or surviving  heart disease as patients taking those drugs Similarly people with diabetes who exercised had the same relative risk of dying from the condition as those taking the most commonly prescribed drugs Or as the researchers wrote in statisticsspeak When compared head to head in network metaanalyses all interventions were not different beyond chance  On the other hand people who once had suffered a stroke had significantly less risk of dying from that condition if they exercised than if they used medications  although the study authors note that stroke patients who can exercise may have been unusually healthy to start with Only in chronic heart failure were drugs noticeably more effective than exercise Diuretics staved off mortality better than did exercise  Over all Dr Ioannidis said our results suggest that exercise can be quite potent in treating heart disease and the other conditions equaling the lifesaving benefits available from most of the commonly prescribed drugs including statins Statins are at the   that could   taking the drugs The results also underscore how infrequently exercise is considered or studied as a medical intervention Dr Ioannidis said Only  percent of the available and relevant experiments in his new analysis involved exercise We need far more information about how exercise compares head to head with drugs in the treatment of many conditions he said as well as what types and amounts of exercise confer the most benefit and whether there are side effects such as injuries Ideally he said pharmaceutical companies would set aside a tiny fraction of their profits for such studies  But he is not optimistic that such funding will materialize without widespread public pressure  For now Mr Naci said he hopes that this new study will prompt smallerscale negotiations We are not suggesting that anyone stop taking their medications he said But maybe people could think long and hard about their lifestyles and talk to their doctors about whether exercise could and should be incorporated into their care
