If you were led blindfolded a few blocks east from Los Angeles grand City Hall you would know instantly when you entered Skid Row There is the pungent smell of urine and marijuana smoke and the sound of music and easy laughter  a carnival rising out of misery This is the chaos that Chris Mack plunges into on most days Once homeless himself Mack is an outreach worker for the   a free clinic in the heart of Skid Row Mack is part of a concerted push to enroll the nations homeless in   As of January the health insurance program thats   by federal and state governments is being opened for the first time to all poor adults not just those with disabilities or dependent children The outreach is important homeless experts say In addition to   regular medical care is a critical intervention for getting lost lives back on track A person who is not feeling very well cant behave or perform very well Mack says so I think health care is primary The Medicaid expansion was a central provision in the Affordable Care Act the federal health care law But after the Supreme Court declared the expansion optional for states rather than mandatory   have chosen to do so Even without all the states participating some   people are expected to enroll in Medicaid across the country and  million homeless people could be newly eligible for coverage Homeless advocates have cheered the expansion Men and women living   will be able to see a doctor regularly keep prescriptions filled to treat their asthma diabetes and schizophrenia and get referrals to private specialists for lingering ailments Macks journey through Skid Row is an arduous even perilous undertaking Some  people live on the   and as elsewhere in the nation up to   are mentally ill or addicted to drugs or alcohol That makes enrolling them in a complicated public insurance program all the more difficult Sometimes on certain streets people are following their habit smoking or drinking or shooting up says Mack Thats part of the ugly reality Mack greets a woman perched on an upsidedown plastic bucket with a Burberry scarf covering her head Her eyes are clouded with drink or drugs and her cheeks are smeared with ash She tells Mack that her name is Martha Castro that shes slept on the streets for four years and that she has been to the doctor just once for a lung infection Do you realize that you can have health insurance Mack asks her No I dont want to apply for nothing else right now Castro replies in a slur of words and confusion She is adamant that at  years old shes healthy enough And anyway she says she doesnt have any identification or money So then how we gonna have insurance for the clinic Castro asks I tell her the insurance  Medicaid  is free to her and she doesnt need an ID card But that doesnt matter to Castro who is high or drunk and perhaps touched by mental illness Thats it she says signaling that the conversation is over Mack says he cant force anyone to sign up  even someone like Castro who he suspects has chronic asthma You see what I did he says to me I left the door open  Martha if you need help you can come to us  In a city crowded with chauffeurdriven black SUVs and upscale hotels Los Angeles homeless are a reminder of lifes cruel turns For George Farag an Egyptian immigrant and former security guard that cruel turn came when he fell asleep one night on the job I work in security before I sleep on the job Kick me out says Farag standing in the lobby of the John Wesley Community Clinic As if to prove the veracity of his story he shows me the emblem embroidered on his shirt Its his old companys logo After me lost the job I lost everything Farag says I sleep on the city two years One of those nights sleeping on the streets he says someone ran over him A hitandrun that crushed his right leg Hes come to the JWCH clinic before for the occasional prescription but on this day hes signing up for Medicaid Through an opening at the glass enrollment window a clinic worker hands Farag a copy of his new insurance forms and he stuffs them into a worn plastic bag God bless you Farag says through the window Once he is enrolled the clinic will coordinate his medical needs and perhaps do something about the makeshift brace on his leg Dr Dennis Bleakley has been treating Skid Row patients at the clinic for more than a decade Before he says uninsured homeless adults like Farag had little access to specialists Fractured bones bulging hernias diseased hearts  all of these things went untended Now at least you have a reasonable length of time with a patient and access to specialists Bleakley says Its going to open up a whole new world for us But even with new services available to them the homeless will remain some of the toughest most confounding patients Disorder and addiction easily sabotage the bestlaid plans and those who work with the homeless acknowledge that few make it out That sobering reality doesnt stop Mack the outreach worker who heads back out on the street to find people who might qualify for Medicaid Hes like a rescue diver plunging into a roiling ocean to bring those whove fallen overboard back to safety  again and again
