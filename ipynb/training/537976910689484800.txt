Phillip Hughes collapsed after being hit by a cricket ball at the top of his neck and the base of the skull  One of the major arteries into the brain split and caused massive bleeding The brain is a very delicate and vulnerable organ which is surrounded by the skull  a defensive wall of bone  and a cushioning fluid  But it is not a simple case of the brain having specific weak spots The brain is protected by the skull but the upper neck is vulnerable said Peter Hutchinson a professor of neurosurgery at University of Cambridge  He told the BBC We evolved to enable a neck with a lot of movement but the consequence is a risk of injury to the vessels from excessive movement or direct trauma The vertebral arteries run up both sides of the neck and the blow from the ball caused a dissection in which the artery ruptures Antonio Belli professor of trauma neurosurgery at the University of Birmingham said The vertebral arteries supply the brain stem which controls breathing and heart rhythm so I think that could be why he stopped breathing immediately  While vertebral artery dissections are rare there are two common types of brain injury known as focal and diffuse Focal injuries tend to be caused by falls and assaults They are the result of a damage to one area of the brain which results in a blood clot This occupies space and causes pressure on the surrounding brain starving the organ of oxygen leading to brain cells dying It is treated by removing the clot However damage may not be confined to just the site of the impact  known as a coup injury The brain floats inside the skull so can collide with the side of the skull opposite the impact causing a contracoup injury  The front of Olympic rower James Cracknells brain was damaged when he was struck on the back of the head while cycling The other class of injury is largely the result of high speed road accidents In diffuse injuries the damage is spread across the brain which becomes swollen The pressure builds in the tight confines of the skull and the flow of blood can be impaired Treatment requires lowering the pressure in the brain It is also possible to damage the brain without a direct blow to the head  The brain sits in fluid inside the skull and can bounce around if there is enough force In something like severe whiplash the brain can be shaken around the skull even though no blow is delivered Mr Belli told the BBC Often what does the damage is not the direct impact but rotational forces You could argue from an evolutionary point of view were well designed to withstand a direct blow but not engineered well to withstand the rotational forces in a road traffic accident The skull itself does have stronger and weaker parts  A region called the pterion close to the ears is the thinnest part of the skull so is most vulnerable to fracture But the relatively reinforced forehead and back of the skull can still be damaged They may be thicker parts of the skull but you can still fracture them if you transmit enough force Prof Hutchinson noted There isnt a safe point or a weak point you get a lot of damage from the way the force travels through the head added Mr Belli Damage varies hugely from one patient to another  one patient who has a seemingly severe injury can show better recovery than injuries which appear minor Prof Hutchinson said it the lasting damage depended on where the damage was caused as some areas are more critical  Bleeding in the motor cortex can result in paralysis while damage to the visual cortex would result in blindness He said sport was not taking head injury seriously enough but changes in American football were driving reform In terms of sport the most controversial is boxing because it is a deliberate act horse riding creates a lot of serious injuries and rugby increasingly so There are racing drivers who have had an accident in the early part of the weekend raced the whole weekend and not remembered a thing People need to be aware of brain injury
