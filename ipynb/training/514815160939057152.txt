Dr Aaron Motsoaledi had arrived in the US for a twoweek visit Im here to meet influential people he says energetically despite having just gotten off a transatlantic flight Motsoaledi became the South African Minister of Health in  He took over a national health system attempting to deal with the worst HIVAIDS epidemic in the world with nearly   His highly controversial predecessor   was possibly bestknown for claiming that AIDS could be cured with a cocktail of garlic and beetroot TshabalalaMsimang was forced out in September  and briefly replaced by an interim minister Then Motsoaledi took over Here are excerpts from his conversation with NPR Motsoaledi oversaw the expansion of antiretroviral drug treatment for HIV to public clinics across South Africa Motsoaledi One of the weaknesses in South Africa in the past was a wrong HIVAIDS policy Im sure you know about that Its legendary So we started five years ago to put together huge programs on HIVAIDS Thats why now our program is one of the biggest in world Thirty percent of all the people who are in treatment for HIV in the world are in one program  the South Africa program Its huge but were actually planning to double it in the next  months Now its got  million people on treatment We want to raise it to  million people in the next  months  is the leading cause of death in South Africa with  deaths in  attributed to TB directly Death notifications cite  deaths in which the patient had both HIV and TB infections but in those instances the cause of death is given as HIV The health minister says his country is now making significant progress against the disease crediting a diagnostic machine called the   Motsoaledi Before the advent of GeneXpert it used to take us five days to a week to diagnose a person with TB In other words if youre coughing you have TB signs you go to health facility theyll take your sputum then you wait a week before they give you the results With GeneXpert you only wait two hours you can be treated immediately Before GeneXpert when you are in treatment for TB and youre not getting better it took us three months to conclude that this must be drugresistant TB That decision was made after  months of you actually spreading drugresistant TB But with GeneXpert we are able to make that decision within two hours of the diagnosis That is a game changer Motsoaledi says South Africa is also facing what he calls exploding pandemics of noncommunicable diseases high blood pressure diabetes cancer chronic lung disease These ones are on the march in any part of the world he says It no longer matters whether you are rich or poor Noncommunicable diseases are now placing a huge burden on public hospitals and clinics in South Africa Motsoaledi has started telling people they need to take more responsibility for their own health Motsoaledi Changing peoples behavior is a very difficult thing In South Africa people are already saying Youre becoming a nanny state You must allow us to choose In simple language theyre saying Allow me to get as sick as I can and you fix me as a state Which is a very wrong phenomena It means people are starting to assume that for every illness government or scientists have a readymade solution to reverse it Thats not how the world is Its just a dream of people They dont want to say Look I must also try my best not to get ill especially when it comes to lifestyle diseases In order to cut rates of high blood pressure Motsoaledi has been trying to force South African food companies to reduce the amount of salt in bread soups snacks and other processed foods But hes met fierce resistance both from industry and ordinary people Motsoaledi Some companies are very uncomfortable Theyre fighting and saying Why cant the government provide dialysis and kidney transplant Its some form of mental retardation to think like that really We say If you do this you are going to keep your normal kidneys You say No I dont want to keep them You must provide me with new kidneys Its very difficult to get a kidney transplant yet thats what people seem to be fighting for and we want to reverse them from that South Africa is a long way from the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak and hasnt had any cases but Motsoaledi says his nation is nonetheless affected by the crisis Motsoaledi Just two weeks ago somebody posted on the web in China that there is a case of Ebola in South Africa The post lasted about  or  hours and it caused us big damage People started canceling trips to South Africa So last week I had to travel to Hong Kong and Beijing to talk to tour operators Because China had a big problem with the flu virus   five years ago many of them thought Ebola spread like hn I explained that it is not true When I left South African tourism officials reported that about  bookings which had been canceled have been reenacted Motsoaledi has dispatched a South African diagnostics lab to help in West Africa but he says his country doesnt have large numbers of doctors or nurses available to help treat Ebola patients He also noted that South Africa has put in place travel restrictions on people coming from Ebolaaffected countries Even though the South African media calls it a ban Motsoaledi says he doesnt like to use the word ban Motsoaledi All we said is people from that area when they travel it shouldnt be just willynilly It must be essential People traveling for business we dont stop them All we wanted was to make them apply so we can screen them and so I know who traveled from that area into South Africa
