Ebola has rightly gripped the worlds attention but its death toll pales in comparison to other infectious diseases like tuberculosis TB is the worlds second leading infectious killer after HIVAIDS and its claiming more victims than previously thought   million last year alone  according to a report released today by the World Health Organization Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that typically attacks the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body such as the kidneys spine and brain It spreads when infected people expel bacteria by coughing sneezing or even just talking especially in confined spaces like airplanes or prisons The report says an unacceptably high number of lives are being lost to this curable disease The death toll represents roughly one sixth of all cases last year says   director of WHOs global TB program We are also hearing that because of the Ebola outbreak in western African countries many people are hesitant to attend hospitals or polyclinics because they fear getting infected with Ebola Heres a glimpse of the concerns  and the glimmer of hope  from the   There were an estimated  million cases in    percent higher than experts had thought theyd see Improvements in reporting in Nigeria for example resulted in roughly half a million additional reported cases last year and a mortality rate in the African region  percent higher than the year before TB numbers are expected to rise further as more countries improve their reporting There is good news in the report Effective diagnosis and treatment saved some  million lives between  and  Globally the TB mortality rate fell by an estimated  percent between  and  and the total number of cases fell by  percent during the same period TB is highly curable when reported and properly treated Unreported cases amount for some  million of the  million estimate Raviglione tells Goats and Soda He calls them the missing cases and says if you understand why they are missing then you understand why they are dying These are people who might live in rural areas far from hospitals or who turn to private or traditional healers who dont always follow international treatment standards This is the most disturbing part of the findings says Raviglione Better reporting methods have led to the diagnosis of an estimated  new MDRTB cases last year but there are not enough health care resources to care for the newly diagnosed So we are left with waiting lists of some  people awaiting treatment he says MDRTB occurs when strains of the disease become resistant to the drugs commonly used to treat TB usually because of improper use of antibiotics or patients interrupting the strict sixmonth drug regimen Drugresistant forms can also be transmitted But those countries are not alone Some Eastern European and central Asian countries have extremely high levels of MDRTB  about  percent of their new TB cases Some  percent of these cases are even more difficult to treat because the patients have developed XDRTB or extensively drug resistant TB XDRTB has been detected in  countries and can arise when the secondline drugs used to treat MDRTB are also misused and become ineffective Treatment options are seriously limited for these individuals Turns out the worlds top two infectious killers are bedmates People living with HIV are  times more likely to develop TB than those who are HIVnegative says the report The HIV epidemic beginning in the s led to a major upsurge in TB cases and TB deaths especially in parts of Africa Last year  percent of TB patients were HIVpositive as were a quarter of those who died of TB Experts are calling for more HIV testing among TB patients and greater access to antiretroviral therapy which the report says is the best intervention to reduce mortality among HIVpositive TB patients
