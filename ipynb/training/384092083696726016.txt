The Affordable Care Act requires nearly every American to have health insurance or pay a penalty beginning Jan  The socalled   has been controversial ever since the law was passed But for people who fall into a few select categories the mandate doesnt apply Like Native Americans who get health coverage through the Indian Health Service or people who are incarcerated Another exception is for members of health care sharing ministries a way for individuals with a common set of ethical or religious beliefs to share medical bills The sharing ministries are not insurance theres no guarantee that a given bill will be covered Instead its like a coop where members decide what procedures to cover and then all pitch in to cover the cost as group Its a group of people in this case Christians who band together and agree that they want to share one anothers burdens says Andrea Miller medical director for the largest Christian healthinsurance alternative MediShare She says members put aside a certain amount of money every month which then goes to other Christians who need help paying their medical bills MediShares monthly fees vary but   that family options average less than  a month There are a few requirements to fulfill before participating Miller says The first is that you have to be Christian Second you need to agree to living a Christian lifestyle including no smoking including not abusing alcohol or drugs she says To constitute as a health care sharing ministry  and therefore be exempt from the Affordable Care Act requirements  the nonprofit has to have been in existence since  MediShare has existed since  The ministries also have an independent accounting firm conduct a publicly available annual audit Tens of thousands of Americans belong to Christian health sharing ministries including Fred Bennett of Chattanooga Tenn Bennett and his wife Beth have belonged to a health care sharing ministry for  years Theyve always been healthy but in the last few years as theyve entered their s they started to have medical trouble In  my wife was rushed to the hospital with   in her kidneys and actually it spread to all of her body he says She recovered but the hospital bill was staggering After six days in the hospital most of which was spent in intensive care the cost came to about  And that bill was just the beginning for the Bennetts She hasnt had many claims but unfortunately I had a stretch of five or six years there that things were pretty rough Bennett says including multiple surgeries and a heart attack The medical bills reached tens of thousands of dollars but for each incident the Bennetts paid only their  deductible The rest was paid by fellow Christians through MediShare Of course the same would have been true if they had normal health insurance But Bennett says he prefers the health sharing ministry because the ministry doesnt pay for procedures he thinks are immoral like abortions The part I liked about it was that I wouldnt have to be having some of my premiums spent to take care of someone who wasnt taking of themself physically or spiritually either one he says While the federal health law includes an exemption for health sharing ministries some states have sued to try to keep them out The concern is that consumers shopping for insurance will be confused about what ministries really guarantee in the way of coverage We do not share in every medical need that a person has Miller of MediShare says Some of the things we dont share in are related to lifestyle issues such as an abortion But others of them are related to things that the members have agreed that they would rather pay for themselves For example she says members tend to pay for their own preventative care with the exception of very young children There are also some restrictions on preexisting conditions At MediShare Miller works with a steering committee of health share members who discuss what kind of care is covered by the guidelines Any significant change in the guidelines is something that has to be passed by all the members she says In August   that members whose claims are rejected have the right to file an appeal In the current fiscal year  percent of the bills submitted to MediShare were considered eligible and all of those were covered MediShare told CNBC Bennett of Tennessee points out that because all the members decide what to share the cost of health ministries often cover things insurance rarely does like adoption fees and funeral costs Plus he says his health sharing ministry gives him a service he could never get from an insurance company The night before my surgery the lady whod helped me locate the right providers and everything called me back and said Would it be OK if I prayed with you for your surgery tomorrow Three days later she called back to ask how the surgery went
