I grew up eating fish My family enjoyed a fish meal at least once a week usually mackerel salmon trout now called steelhead or flounder Lox pickled herring smoked white fish and sable were occasional treats In summer when I caught little sunfish and perch in a local lake my mother dutifully cleaned and panfried them Yum My sons like fish and fishing too They often took sardine sandwiches for lunch at school I knew they would not be traded for PBJ When they pulled a fivepound carp from a Minnesota river I stuffed and baked it to the delight of dinner guests Im thrilled too that all four grandsons like fish So it baffles me that fish remains so unloved in comparison with the other sources of animal protein red meat and poultry I know all the excuses I dont know what to buy I dont know how to prepare it It smells up the kitchen I once ate bad fish and never touched it again There are ways to overcome these objections Two decades ago I produced a seafood cookbook with Richard Flaste to facilitate this And it helps to know how and why to choose certain fish and shellfish over others Lets start with health Fish is good for you better than heartdamaging red meat and even better than lean poultry Oily fish like salmon mackerel bluefish herring and sardines are rich in omega fatty acids These are polyunsaturated fatty acids that may protect against heart attacks and stroke help control blood clotting and build cell membranes in the brain They are also important to an infants visual and neurological development Omegas may also help ameliorate a variety of conditions such as cancer depression inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune disorders like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis The best evidence for the benefits comes from studies of people who have long eaten fish as opposed to taking supplements of omegas Nearly three decades ago Dutch researchers published a groundbreaking study in The New England Journal of Medicine Intrigued by the extremely low death rate from coronary heart disease among Greenland Eskimos the Dutch team followed  men aged  to  for  years and found that those who ate as little as one or two fish meals a week had a  percent lower death rate from heart attacks than those who did not eat fish Other studies linked fish consumption to a reduced risk of strokes although later research concluded that the lifesaving benefit was limited to people at high risk of cardiovascular disease Given that heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death among Americans youd think this research might have drastically lifted our consumption of fish Alas relatively little change has occurred Fish consumption reached a high of  pounds per person a year in  and has declined slightly since according to the Department of Agriculture Asians eat about  pounds of fish a year including bony fish Paul Greenberg the author of two popular books on seafood told me
