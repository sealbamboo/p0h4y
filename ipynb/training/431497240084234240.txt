The White House may be   the  million people whove got a new shot at health care including the  million wholl get Obamacare on the taxpayers dime but critics have a few choice words for the newly insured Put Down The Donut Commentators like Sandy Pukel a nutritionist from Coral Gables Fla have joined a chorus of scolds who say that expanded access to insurance is just another example of an eroding code of personal responsibility in America If youre going to go eat donuts and drink Coke and eat crap youre setting yourself up to be sick said Pukel  who operates a line of healthy food cruises People are not going to have to take care of themselves because they dont have to pay for it Specifically Pukel cant see the point of offering more governmentpaid health insurance to people who smoke drink overeat avoid exercise and otherwise fail to look after their own interests I sometimes get angry that people like me are subsidizing the population at large Pukel wrote in a  blog post If we are indeed in this together it would be nice if more of us tried a bit harder to keep up their end And hes not alone in his criticism More than half of US adults   percent  now say its not the federal governments job to make sure all Americans have health coverage according to a   conducted late last fall Thats up from a low in  when only  percent of adults felt that the government should stay out of health care coverage Of course expanding the ability to buy health care coverage was the goal of the    which seeks to provide insurance to the  percent of Americans who dont already have it The Jan  start of coverage under the health care marketplaces called exchanges has renewed questions about the estimated   on federal subsidies in the next decade  and whether those who get access to care will make the best of it Research suggests that the newly insured do in fact use more care and feel better about their health Thats according to the   a study by researchers at Harvard and MIT that compared  people who were newly enrolled in Medicaid and  who werent With access to subsidized care people do access a range of health services said Katherine Baicker a professor of health economics at the Harvard School of Public Health They go to the hospital more they use the doctors office more they use more prescription drugs The latest run of data   found that they also use the emergency room about  percent more often others The twist All of that increased access didnt result in measurably better health  in the series showed There was no drop in rates of high blood pressure high cholesterol or diabetes People didnt get thinner In fact their body mass index a measure of obesity stayed about the same Insurance alone was not sufficient to produce decreases Baicker said Some critics would lay that problem at the feet of the individual patients Daniel Callahan a medical ethicist at the Hastings Center sparked a firestorm last year with a paper that suggested that a   might actually be the key to driving down obesity rates in a nation where twothirds of adults are too heavy Safe and slow incrementalism that strives never to stigmatize obesity has not and cannot do the necessary work wrote Callahan adding later The individual seems to be left out of this But even Callahan agrees that enforcing some code of personal responsibility is a slippery slope Why people gain weight struggle with smoking or contract certain diseases may be dependent on a range of factors besides individual conduct he said It is very hard to determine how responsible anyone is for his or behavior he said I say treat em all  illegal immoral  and raise taxes on the rich to pay for it Focusing on the expansion of insurance under Obamacare misses the point supporters say People with insurance have always paid for the uninsured whether its through direct subsidies higher premiums or higher costs to cover uncompensated care Critics have been paying for others care all along even if they dont know it or want to admit it experts say Other health and ethics experts while not quite so brash agree with Callahan Certainly theres no shortage of health problems made worse by laziness or inattention One third to one half of patients with chronic ailments such as diabetes and heart disease fail to take their prescribed medications as directed noted Tom Hubbard vice president for policy at the New England Healthcare Institute Sometimes its because of the high cost of drugs but other times theres no good reason They start skipping pills or they dont take the right dose or they stop taking them all together he said That kind of inattention costs the health care system about   NEHI found Thats in addition to the nearly  billion annual price tag for obesity and more than  billion for smoking in medical expenses and lost productivity according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention But cultivating good health habits is a challenge for everyone not just the newly insured added Joan Alker executive director at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University She said she believes the conversation about personal responsibility is a cheap shot and a distraction from the problems caused by a growing economic gap between the rich and the poor People make choices and that affects their health she said Does that mean were going to leave them there to die and to suffer I dont think thats the kind of country we are
