A federal task force is planning to recommend that millions of smokers and former smokers get a CT scan annually to look for early signs of lung cancer The member   gives that lung cancer screening test a grade of B which puts it on the same level as mammography for women between the ages of  and  That grade is important because preventive tests with a grade of A or B oblige Medicare other federal health programs and private insurers to cover the entire cost beginning a year after a guideline is adopted A lung scan   This is the first time weve had science that tells us that we can actually avoid some lung cancer deaths through screening task force vice chairman   tells Shots So this is really a big change Its a change that some wont welcome Some experts warn that its going to cause too much followup testing for many patients with the accompanying anxiety Another concern is that screening will uncover many cancers that would never have caused a problem  a phenomenon called overdiagnosis An explanation of the proposed recommendation   in   Its based on a   of more than  people published two years ago The task force estimates that its   will cut US lung cancer deaths by  a year Thats only about  percent of the nearly   in this country annually Thats a relatively small proportion of those  deaths LeFevre acknowledges The problem is that even with screening many peoples lung cancer will be too advanced for effective treatment But a small proportion of a big number is still a big number adds LeFevre And  lives is a lot of people He says the   screening test  a   or CT scan  is actually more effective than mammography or colonoscopy in saving lives Under the panels proposal screening is expected to save one life for every  people screened By comparison it takes  to  mammograms to save one life from breast cancer depending on whether those screened are older or younger And LeFevre estimates that it takes about  colonoscopies to save a life from colon cancer The task force will consider comments on the proposed guidelines before issuing a final recommendation in three to six months LeFevre says Tom Murphy a yearold Maryland man has no doubt that annual screening prevented him from dying of lung cancer as his father did Murphy who smoked for three decades started getting yearly lung scans in  as part of a study Five years later a scan showed that a spot on his right lung was growing Oh absolutely that scan saved my life Murphy tells Shots This thing started at five millimeters in January of  and at the point they took it out it was  centimeters nine months later So Im very grateful And I believe to this day that it saved my life The proposed recommendation is aimed at people who are at especially high risk of lung cancer Theyre between the ages of  and  and they have smoked the equivalent of a pack of cigarettes a day for  years or more If they have quit smoking it must be within the past  years After that people have gained enough benefit from not smoking that screening isnt useful the panel says Nearly  million Americans are smokers or former smokers About  million of these are in the target age group and have smoked at least a pack a day for  years The Task Force is trying to strike a crucial balance  what LeFevre calls the point at which the screening tests seems to do a significant amount more good than harm A fundamental problem with lung cancer CT screening is that when it finds a suspiciouslooking nodule in a lung it turns out to be noncancerous  percent of the time Thats called a false positive rate and it may be higher than any other approved screening test Most people who have a positive scan would be scheduled for a second scan several months later to see if the nodule has grown If it has the patient may need further scans a biopsy of tissue through a needle inserted into the lung or even lung surgery We are actually going to do some lung surgery on people just to prove that they dont have cancer LeFevre says He says people who have an abnormal lung scan are going to have to be calm patient and deliberate  and their doctors are too This is an anxiety that I have about lung cancer screening says LeFevre who is an associate professor of family medicine at the University of Missouri If somebody hears they have a  percent chance that this is cancer and then you say Well lets wait three months and repeat your CAT scan if the emotional response is No lets do something now then were going to do a lot of harm in the process of doing a little good LeFevre says Dr   of Georgetown University thinks the task force is putting too much faith in lung screening They rank it with those tests that your doctor  if theyre a good doctor  is supposed to bug you about to get done Lin says referring to mammograms colonoscopy and Pap smears And I dont feel that this test necessarily meets that criteria I dont necessarily feel that patients should be pressured into getting this test done He and others worry not only about the high falsepositive rate and the ensuing medical tests but also what doctors call overdiagnosis  the discovery of cancers that would never become a problem Uncovering this reservoir of indolent disease will almost always happen when you start screening Dr   a breast cancer specialist at the University of California San Francisco tells Shots We need to recognize it and understand it Because if you dont youre going to overtreat people Esserman is coauthor of a   on overdiagnosis and overtreatment of cancer published online Monday by   the journal of the American Medical Association
