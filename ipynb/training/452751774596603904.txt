Bad weather and a delayed flight might be a recipe for misery  but in one instance  years ago it led to a discovery that has saved countless thousands of lives  The discovery of the Epstein Barr virus  named after British doctor Anthony Epstein  resulted from his specialist knowledge of viruses which caused tumours in chickens plus his skills gained using one of the first commerciallyavailable electron microscopes  His hunch was assisted by a longer than expected journey of some tumour cells from Uganda which were nearly thrown in the bin  But it would never have happened if Epsteins curiosity hadnt been fired up by a lecture by the Irish doctor turned bush surgeon Denis Burkitt  In the lecture billed as a staff meeting on The Commonest Childrens Cancer in Tropical Africa Burkitt described how he had noticed a number of cases of debilitating tumours which grew around the jawbone of children in specific regions  particularly those with high temperatures and high rainfall  We now know this as Burkitt lymphoma  Sir Anthony Epstein now    recalls I thought there must be some biological agent involved I was working on chicken viruses which cause cancer I had virusinducing tumours at the front of my head I thought it was being carried by some insect vector or some tic Thats why it was temperaturerelated   The Epstein Barr virus belongs to the family of herpes viruses  and is linked to a number of different conditions depending on where you live  Most people are infected with the Epstein Barr virus Its best known in highincome countries for causing glandular fever which causes a sore throat extreme fatigue and swollen glands in the neck  According to Dorothy Crawford emeritus professor of microbiology at Edinburgh University up to  of all adults are infected with the virus  The virus is spread in childhood at different rates  in the saliva so through close contact  In African countries most children have it by the age of two because they share cups in their household  The rate is lower in middleclass areas of England so if you havent already been exposed by your early teens it can cause glandular fever   This has given it the nickname the kissing disease because she explained People kissing in the back row of the cinema exchange more saliva than young children sharing toys  Epstein asked for samples of the tumours from Burkitt and they were sent back on overnight flights from Uganda  For almost three years Epsteins efforts to retrieve virus from the tumour cells failed despite trying several culture methods used successfully for other viruses like influenza and measles   In the end bad weather came to the rescue  Fog delayed one flight which was diverted to Manchester  miles from London So the sample taken from the upper jaw of a nineyearold girl with   didnt get to Epstein until late one Friday afternoon on  December    At that point it looked past its sellby date  The fluid was cloudy This suggested it had been contaminated on the way Epstein said  Was it full of multiplying bacteria Before we threw it away I looked at it under a wet preparation microscope and saw huge numbers of freefloating healthy looking tumour cells which had been shed from the edge of the tumour  Traditionally growing cells successfully in culture had involved sticking them to a glass surface for support but the lymphoma cells seemed to favour growing in a suspension   Once all other conventional tests for identifying the virus from the cultured cells had failed Epstein tried electron microscopy The very first grid square he viewed included a cell filled with herpes virus  Exhilarated by what hed seen Epstein went for a walk in the winter snow and came back feeling calmer  I was extremely frightened in case the electron beam of the microscope burned up the sample I recognised at once the herpes virus  there were five then now nine Any of the thenknown ones would have wiped the culture out when they were replicating but this wasnt happening  I had the feeling that this was something special  Our understanding of this pervasive virus named after Epstein and one of his PhD students Yvonne Barr who helped to prepare the samples has increased over the years since Epstein confirmed his findings with American virologist colleagues  Burkitts data helped to identify that the tumour named after him was seen in children with chronic malaria which reduced their resistance to the Epstein Barr virus allowing it to thrive  But most of us live quite happily with the virus  If you disturb the hostvirus balance in any way then changes take place which lead to very unpleasant consequences says Epstein  Once the link between Epstein Barr virus and Burkitt lymphoma was established other seemingly unrelated conditions followed These include a cancer at the back of the nose which is the commonest cancer seen in men in southern China and the second commonest in women in the same region  There is also a link to Hodgkins lymphoma a cancer of the white blood cells  Each one came out of the blue according to Epstein and weve just heard about another About  of Japanese cancers of the stomach are associated with the virus  Yet another connection was made by Professor Dorothy Crawford while waiting for the lift at the Royal Free hospital in London  Its such a tall building everyone meets outside the lifts I was standing next to a renal kidney transplant surgeon and overheard him say theyd just had their first case of posttransplant lymphoma So I went with him to the pathology department and asked for some sections of the tissue to look at under the microscope Burkitt lymphoma can now often be treated successfully with chemotherapy  At a recent meeting in Oxford of the   future directions for research were explored  Attention is now focusing on a vaccine for the Epstein Barr virus  and some efficacy has already been demonstrated  Epstein hopes that a vaccine will lead to the kind of success seen in other cancers caused by viruses  such as Hepatitis B and the human papillomavirus which cause liver and cervical cancer respectively
