When I was told she had ALS I honestly didnt know what it was But then my sister described it to me over the phone and I had to pull over the car Its a fatal fastmoving neuromuscular disease that would paralyze my mother limb by limb First robbing her of her ability to swallow then speak move and breathe When that reality set in I spent many nights in my home crying on the floor What enabled me to get up was that my mother accepted her fate with a strength and grace Id never seen before In anyone When she began choking on her food losing her ability to swallow she got a feeding tube When she lost her ability to walk she got a motorized wheelchair When she could no longer speak she picked up a word board and started spelling out her conversations still telling my father what to do And finally when she lost her ability to breathe she got a tracheotomy and ventilator to stay alive Which is why the notion of what it means to be alive for me has completely changed Ive met people like former NFL New Orleans Saints player Steve Gleason who now at age  with ALS is completely paralyzed  He uses eyetracking technology to open doors send emails and tweet by blinking his eyes Ive also met Augie Nieto the founder of Life Fitness gym equipment The yearold Californian is running a corporation communicating and raising millions of dollars for ALS research by tapping with his toes So you can see where I might get my inspiration in telling their stories Dont get me wrong I know its a devastating path to travel Someone described it to me as imagining yourself sitting in a chair and being completely ducttaped head to toe with only your eyes left open Thats what its like to have ALS It robs you of your physical abilities but it leaves your mind and spirit strong Being alive looks different It becomes all about your emotional connections to those you love My mother smiles when she sees her grandchildren her eyes light up when you walk in the door she relaxes when the sun shines on her face These days our family is just about hanging out Very little is known about how people get ALS In  of cases it just happens out of the blue Its considered a rare disease in part because patients dont live long enough to be counted Right now there is no cure I hope by sharing my own experience as well as that of others we can learn more together
