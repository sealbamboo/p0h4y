Many seniors who seek care in emergency departments may be malnourished a small study by researchers at the University of North Carolina suggests The study is among the first to attempt to document the extent of this problem Although we dont know if the results extrapolate to all emergency departments my guess is they probably come pretty close said Dr Christopher Carpenter chairman of the geriatric section of the American College of Emergency Physicians who was not involved in the research Malnutrition in older adults can lead to muscle wasting fatigue weakness functional decline an increased risk of infection the exacerbation of chronic illnesses and death Yet this treatable condition is often overlooked or ignored by medical providers In  a large study that pooled research from five continents   ages  and older in hospitals  percent nursing homes  percent rehabilitation facilities  percent and the community  percent Emergency departments were not included Yet older adults account for about  million emergency room visits each year If this studys findings are confirmed we should do nutritional screening for all these patients Dr Carpenter said  In the new study    patients ages  and older none with acute medical problems or dementia were evaluated at a North Carolina hospital last summer with a sixitem questionnaire that asked about food consumption weight loss body mass index and problems such as stress or depression   Scores indicated that  patients were malnourished and an additional  patients were at risk of becoming so  in all  percent of the entire sample That was an eyeopener said Dr Timothy PlattsMills an author of the study and an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Factors linked to poor nutritional status included depression of  seniors with depression  percent were malnourished difficulty eating often    percent and problems affording or having transportation needed to buy groceries  percent    Other studies have suggested   social isolation  who likes to eat alone  cognitive difficulties and medications that interfere with appetite or the absorption of nutrients   Alarmingly none of the patients identified by researchers as being malnourished had notes in their medical charts indicating that doctors or nurses had identified this problem  This is not where our training is Dr PlattsMills said Many families notice when an older relative is not eating well this study along with others suggests that a referral to a doctor for an evaluation may be in order Malnutrition is a really serious common issue and just nagging Grandma to eat more might not be an effective solution Dr PlattsMills said
