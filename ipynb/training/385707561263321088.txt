Abbey Whetzel has a yearold son named Sam who has been at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Maryland for over a month He has leukemia that is no longer treatable And in this difficult time one source of joy has been the therapy dogs that come to visit the sick kids They can only come once a week but its the highlight of Sams week says Whetzel But this week she says her son got some bad news They came and stopped in and told Sam that the therapy dog wouldnt be coming because of the government shutdown He was disappointed Whetzel says He really looks forward to the dogs coming He has a special fondness for the little dogs that can come and just sit on his bed and lie down and curl up with him Going without a therapy dog was hard But Whetzel knows that for some families the shutdown is even harder The   is the nations largest hospital dedicated solely to clinical research and patients often come here seeking options for difficulttotreat illnesses But the NIH has said that with rare exceptions it will not enroll new patients in ongoing studies or clinical trials at the center for the duration of the shutdown In a normal week about  new people would be enrolled in clinical trials that are testing new treatments The clinical center is often called the House of Hope and the House of Hope had to close its doors to new patients because thats what a shutdown does says   the director of the National Institutes of Health How would you feel as a parent of a child with cancer hoping that somehow NIH and its clinical center might provide some rescue from a very difficult situation to hear that frankly you cant come because the government wasnt able to stay open The NIH shutdown is also affecting other medical centers because most of the NIH budget goes out as grants to support researchers and clinicians across the nation  in fact the NIH is the biggest source of funding for medical research in the world Collins says the entire grants program is now closed No new applications can be received he says The government will continue to operate its payment management system for scientists with existing grants so that they can get access to those funds  but if grantees run into any problems no one will be around to help That means universities and hospitals across the country are grappling with what the NIH shutdown might do to their work Any new trial that is awaiting funding any new grant that is going to be reviewed that involves clinical research clinical trials  those things are on hold says   chief academic officer with Partners HealthCare which runs hospitals such as Massachusetts General in Boston
