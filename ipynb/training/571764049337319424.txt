It was supposed to be a girlfriend getaway but a weekend trip to a desert yoga festival transformed my mind body and skepticism about the benefits of the ancient practice of which I knew virtually nothing Naive but limber I joined two yoga teacher college friends at last Septembers Bhakti Fest a unique yoga and music festival at the Joshua Tree Retreat Center Amid the otherworldly Joshua trees open skies and buildings designed by Frank Lloyd Wright the festival was a spiritual Woodstock for the superfit The festival traces its origins to s Woodstock where Sridhar Steven Silberfein brought Sri Swami Satchidananda onstage to lead a mass chant Forty years later he founded Bhakti Fest billed as a celebration of compassion and devotion Coachella its not An extensive variety of yoga classes packed with all ages and abilities helped erase the trendy trappings Id found in Los Angeles studios and instead presented yoga as a holistic physical mental and spiritual experience Through workshops with noted authors and experts sessions with yoga masters and   concerts by worldfamous chanters of the ancient mantras I was beginning to understand yogas history and wider purpose beyond its popularity as a way to keep trim Bhakti Fest prohibits drugs alcohol and smoking and all food is vegetarian When more than  people gather to focus on health and wellness gratitude and peace the result is mass serenity joy and a welcoming vibe that let a cynic like me look past my misconceptions Isnt yoga something those robed guys in the airport do Though Im every bit a practical feetontheground mom the event flipped a switch Buoyed by the festivals energy I began taking beginner yoga classes at neighborhood studios and put   on my playlists A CD with the deeply resonant voice of kirtan master Krishna Das Greatest Hits of the Kali Yuga became a permanent fixture in my car and an elixir to tame traffic tension The musclestretching jointstrengthening and stressreleasing yoga poses not only toned my physique but also alleviated my chronic lower back and neck pain Now lighter in body and spirit I returned earlier this month to Bhakti Fest more college roommates in tow The tough part was choosing among the options which included nearly nonstop live music on three stages Ninetyminute yoga classes stretched from sunup to sundown with notables such as Shiva Rea Saul David Raye or Santa Monicas Govind Das and Radha often accompanied by live music in breezy scenic outdoor settings I could also attend a taped interview with spiritual teacher and Be Here Now author Ram Dass or workshops with Google executive Gopi Kallayil who incorporates yoga practices and principles into a challenging work life start with one minute of yoga or mindfulness a day  and that minute will likely stretch to  I heard the former Richard Slavin of suburban Chicago now Radhanath Swami and the author of The Journey Home tell stories that illustrated how the simple act of showing appreciation can save relationships This I never got from step aerobics or the sanitized yoga at the gym Though I wasnt searching for a spiritual path I gathered bits of wisdom to help maintain my inner and outer peace delivering on yogas promise to connect the intellectual physical and emotional While a baby wailed during an otherwise silent portion of his yoga class San Francisco instructor Brad Brockbank guided students to find peace and quiet even when there isnt peace and quiet Its a focus thing A funny thing happened on the way to my yoga mat I learned that this ancient practice can really deliver on its promise to get your issues out of your tissues But its not automatic it takes practice as the endearingly real Krishna Das told the packed audience for his workshop A little bit every day is the thing that works he said The thing with practice is you have to do it when you want to do it  and when you dont want to Five minutes a day do something  sitting quietly watch your breath do some mantra or just sit there and be stupid It makes no difference but every day do something Youll see its very important My neck shoulders heart and mind agree Why dont you join me and take a moment to relax Close your eyes and repeat after me Om  The annual Bhakti Fest known as the Woodstock of the kirtan movement began in  in Joshua Tree  a spiritual extravaganza of song and dance yoga chanting and meditation supplemented with green juices and vegan food I wanted to create a place where we could rejuvenate come back to the heart and get into the compassion and love that we forget so easily said the founder Sridhar Steven Silberfein Kirtan pronounced keertan means to praise and is a form of call and response devotional singing that is as old as time Its a cross between an oldfashioned

Dewhurst actress writer and a consulting producer for the festival has been coming to it since the beginning It is four days of pure spiritual practice or   she said and I see more and more peoples
