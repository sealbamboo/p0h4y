Youve made a commitment to yoga to improve your health So there you are in class with a teacher youve never had before And while youre flipping your down dog you realize youre not exactly flipping over the teacher Maybe the teacher is a yoga bully OK everybody up for wheel People in the back row whats your problem Maybe the teacher is making absurd claims about yoga Doing an inversion is like having a facelift Or its hot yoga and youre thirsty and the teacher says Dont drink But  you are really thirsty Or maybe the teacher just doesnt seem to know what he or she is doing And is actually reading from a yoga book to describe a pose Ive been in all those situations Ive also been in classes with amazing teachers who make the minutes fly by and who make me feel so much better than when I did my first down dog of the day so dont accuse me of being a yoga basher And I know that staying with a yoga class can be a very good thing Studies show that the ancient practice can   offer   and   But in those classes where everything isnt flowing my way the question lurks Should I pack my mat and go Or is that bad yoga etiquette And is there any benefit to sticking it out I put the question to yoga teachers None of them think you can never leave But some of them definitely leaned toward the idea of staying I think its good to respect the space and maybe come to childs pose says Fanny Oehl who teaches at   Unless you think youre endangering yourself I would relax on the mat I have suffered through some miserable classes says   who teaches at Flow Yoga in Washington DC Somebody would have to be doing something pretty egregious for me to walk out If someone is doing something harmful or going to destroy me I guess I would pack up and go Otherwise its all a learning experience Youre learning what you didnt want If you sit through a class and oh my God that instructor would not shut up youve learned you want to find a class with minimal talking Other instructors say its worth sticking it out I say to people who want to leave take a moment Why are you leaving Are you being a spoiled brat says   who teaches in Council Bluffs Iowa Stay till the end even if you do savasana aka corpse pose Say OK I did it I saw it out to the end and its really not for me Look inward before heading outward says   founder of Georgetown Yoga Therapy in Washington DC If you go to a class where you feel uncomfortable in any way first look at your own biases Am I being a little too judgmental Maybe I can relax a little more be a little more accepting But if it becomes intolerable if you feel youre being abused in some way leave One example Her yearold mother went to a class where the teacher was yelling at her about not being able to get into her position correctly In that situation Parris says Dont stand for any kind of abuse And tell the studio why youre walking out Then again some yoga teachers dont believe you need to experience major abuse to take a hike If youre feeling like you are not into the class just leave says   who teaches in Maryland and Washington DC Ive had people do that to me I dont feel any way about it I know theyre doing whats right for them Next time Im not connecting with a class I may just take her advice If you have a different point of view go ahead and make me eat crow pose
