Stress is part of the human condition unavoidable and even necessary to a degree But too much stress can be toxic  even disabling And theres a lot of toxic stress out there A national poll done by NPR with our partners at the   and the   finds that more than  in every  Americans say they had a great deal of stress in the previous month And half of all adults say they experienced a major stressful event in the past year That works out to more than  million people As big as that number is its just the tip of the stress iceberg says Princeton University psychologist   Everything I know suggests that this is a pretty massive underestimate Shafir tells Shots Thats because our poll captures only the stress that people are conscious of Shafirs work and that of others shows theres a lot of stress people dont even realize they have And this hidden stress can reduce our capacity to juggle all the big and little problems life sends our way Its all about cognitive capacity  the ability of the brain to process many different inputs at the same time judge what to pay attention to and make quick decisions on how to respond Think of it as the bandwidth on your Internet connection We have very limited bandwidth Shafir says Theres only so much you can attend to at any one time When people are juggling complicated situations Shafir says Its like driving on a stormy night Youre focused completely on the thing thats capturing your attention right now and other things get neglected If stress is chronic that neglect can be costly over time compromising your health your financial wellbeing your relationships So its important to understand this big thing we call stress and what its doing to us Our poll is unusual in that it focused on the  percent of people who say theyre currently living with a high level of stress These are not just the people who say they have some stress day to day says   executive director of the Harvard Opinion Research Program at the Harvard School of Public Health which conducted the poll These are the share of Americans for whom it really makes a big difference It affects their ability to sleep and to concentrate It leads them to have more arguments with family members It affects their health The poll asked people to say in their own words what was the biggest cause of their stress over the past year By far the leading reason was poor health Either they or someone in their family was really sick or they were overwhelmed by the death of a loved one When we looked at people reporting a great deal of stress in the past    a measure of current stress  sickness again stood out Sixty percent of people in poor health report having high stress levels Of those with a disability  percent report a lot of current stress Theyre followed by those with chronic illness  percent income under   percent those in hazardous jobs  percent single parents  percent and parents with teenage children  percent Once we saw these results we wanted to know more about the stories behind the numbers So we asked people to respond via NPRs Facebook page Within a couple of days we got  responses People wrote lengthy detailed and heartwrenching narratives of the stress that disturbs their daily lives without relief Their stories tracked the poll results pretty closely verifying the toll that high stress is having on health relationships and work Cara Mengwasser of St Louis for instance represents millions of Americans whose stress interacts with her health Shes a recently divorced yearold mother of three ages   and  who was diagnosed with    years ago when she was in her late s Diabetes has affected every aspect of my life Mengwasser says She has to watch everything she eats She takes her insulin meter and blood sugar test kit everywhere She cant take a walk without checking her blood sugar first and making sure she has something sweet to eat in case her blood sugar plunges dangerously Despite all her care Mengwassers diabetes is more out of control lately than its ever been At the moment its not very well managed she admits Unfortunately I have a lot of stress going on in my life and  typically my blood sugars are the first place I see it Its a vicious circle Having diabetes causes stress And stress makes the diabetes worse That of course is true of many illnesses Most people dont understand what it means to live with a chronic illness she says Theyll look at you and say Well you look healthy Well I am healthy I just live with a chronic illness that has to be taken care of  I do not get a vacation from this And like thousands of others who wrote to us Mengwasser has multiple stressors in her life Im unhappy with the job Im in right now and Im getting frustrated with that she says I have three kids and they keep me active and going in three different directions at all times And my yearolds learning to drive so thats stressful too Money was another big cause of stress in our poll More than a third of people with low incomes suffered major stress in the prior month Thats the case for Shelly Lloyd a yearold mother of two teenagers who lives in Sanford Fla Ten years ago she was waiting tables and decided she wanted to do better so she enrolled in a community college aiming to become a teacher I had a lot of high hopes Lloyd tells NPR I loved being in college I did great  I made straight As But she had the bad luck to graduate in  as the economy collapsed Florida went from hiring teachers to firing them I was putting in applications and sending my resume to every open teaching spot in the surrounding five counties  anything that was within an hours drive Lloyd says And I never got a call back not once Lloyd never did get a teaching job And she says shes not likely to for one thing shes in arrears on her education loans which means her school transcripts are frozen  she cant even prove that she has a degree Today Lloyd is a cashier in a grocery store making  an hour And this past year when her husband was laid off from his job the family really struggled It was months of just sleepless nights  feeling sick to my stomach literally counting the pennies to see if we could make the rent and robbing Peter to pay Paul  terrified Living off ramen noodles when we had been able to  not go crazy in a grocery store but being able to buy food In our poll  percent of those who said they suffer a lot of stress report sleeplessness due to worry and anxiety Thats the case for Bobby Burgess and its not just money he worries about Thirtyyearold Burgess is a single dad with three kids under  They live in Fairbanks Alaska On days that the kids get sick I have little recourse but to take a day off  or at least a halfday Burgess says He works as an environmental specialist for the state earning one day of leave for every two weeks of work Ive been taking more leave than Ive been earning he says And sometimes the daytoday responsibilities  running errands making dinner helping the kids with homework  are just too much In February Burgess had what he thinks was his firstever anxiety attack It was on the day hed organized a lasertag party for his yearolds birthday And I realized kind of at the last minute that morning that I didnt have a cake Burgess says with a rueful laugh So I made one at the last minute But then right before I left for the party I just had an elevated heart rate and I was just uncontrollably emotional you know Basically I just sat down let it pass kind of got hold of myself and then made it to the party  minutes late Our poll suggests that nearly  million Americans could tell similar stories about the stress of single parenting Stress is such a big problem that those in authority  especially employers  need to find ways to make life more manageable says Shafir the Princeton psychologist For instance allowing workers to have   would help them avoid constant stressful juggling of transportation and child care And theres another thing that can help  simply acknowledging that stress can overwhelm peoples ability to cope But Shafir says thats not easy for many Americans The notions of selfreliance selfsufficiency which are so strong in the American culture sort of lead you to say that if you have problems you should take yourself by the bootstraps and start working on it he says In Anniston Ala yearold Trace FlemingSmith has learned the value of asking for help in coping with her stress She directs a domestic violence and sexual abuse program advocating for women whove been victims of violence FlemingSmith says she herself has been threatened by her clients abusers And like  percent of those in hazardous jobs she says she suffers from high stress levels Theres these moments when I think wow I dont know if I can keep doing this she says So she makes time to get support from friends who are also stressed We talk for at least a few minutes every day FlemingSmith says And we hold ourselves accountable for selfcare Like What are you doing to take care of yourself What are you doing today When was the last time youve eaten  Its the best thing shes done to help her deal with those overwhelming moments she says A lot of people agree with her Nearly  percent of those reporting a lot of stress say they find relief from routinely spending time with family or friends
