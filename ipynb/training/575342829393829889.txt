When did eating get so complicated Should you eat like a caveman Detox Go vegan before  Tess Masters offers this simple suggestion Just eat more veggies And fruit We sat down with Masters a Los Angeles blogger who has more than  Twitter followers and author of   who uses her book  as well as    to blend up a muchneeded message of moderation Yes even though its title might suggest otherwise Its the most accessible way to get more fruits and vegetables into your lifestyle Its really an alternative to fast food Thats why I believe the blender is an essential item in any kitchen Blending is a celebration of whole foods and getting the most delicious foods to the table in the least amount of time Its just fun I dont know anyone who doesnt enjoy a smoothie Plus theres very little cleanup Just start with one healthy smoothie a day or a few times a week and see how that goes No one says you need to do this all the time Switch it up mix it up and get the kids involved This is a great way to get imaginative in the kitchen Its a good way to get kids to feed themselves That said children should have adult supervision when operating a blender I like the small steps big changes approach I think adding one green smoothie is something that everybody can do You are talking about the pineapple salsa smoothie Its onion in a fruit smoothie I know it sounds crazy But its an amazing sweet savory and spicy combination The chocolate kale shake is the one that gets the most attention But I swear I get  emails a week about that shake from parents saying I couldnt get my kid to eat something green and he loves it Its great for kids or greenaphobes It literally tastes like ice cream Its really hard to mess this up Theres rarely a point of no return If something needs a bit of sweetness a banana can cure it If something is too sweet add some leafy greens If its too salty avocado or coconut meat will help And they are also great for adding creaminess to blends without the dairy If something is too spicy add another piece of fruit I like to say Experiment with flavors but do so a tiny piece at a time You hear some people say It needs to be made fresh the nutrients start to degrade right away but I say that the simple reality is that we are all busy So sometimes it is just not possible to make something and eat it immediately If you make it in advance you are still getting some nutrients and its still better than not having it at all We dont need to be dogmatic or extreme So make it and put it into a glass jar like a Mason jar and keep it in the fridge Theres room for both With blending  putting all the ingredients into a blender  you get all that fiber Its more satisfying More like a meal I like to feel like Im chewing on something when I eat a meal So blending for a meal does that But I turn to juicing when I need to give my body a break I juicecleanse one day of every week to give my system a break and then I juicefast for three days at the start of every season
