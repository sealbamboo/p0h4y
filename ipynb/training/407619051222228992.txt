I didnt want to end up sick he said  My mom died at the age of  after struggling with obesity and high blood pressure  I knew she wouldnt want me to go down this path As a gay man Mullins said being overweight also made it hard to meet people   show gay men struggle more with   than straight men and are more likely to end up with eating disorders to meet an ideal standard that is hard for many to achieve If you are overweight in our community you become invisible and I just hate that about us Mullins said Out at a bar or party guys would talk to me sometimes but when I lost the weight the conversation took on a really different tone  Its not right to exclude people because they are overweight but thats the reality His doctor did put him on a high blood pressure drug but Mullins said he didnt like the way it made him feel  Instead he decided to make a radical change to the way he lived   He started by downloading an app called   an interactive calorie counter program   Its awesome  you can scan any bar code you have on food in the house and it helps you keep track of what you are eating Mullins said  Tracking calories and fat became a game He tried to see how much sugar he could eliminate from his diet  Advice from a professor to diversify the food he ate made him put more color on his plate My family was very Irish and we were more into potatoes and bread and meat Mullins said Now I try to avoid all that white He eliminated fast food He cooked more at home Desserts were gone green vegetables were in Breakfast was yogurt or  rice pudding because he found the carbohydrates helped with energy Lunch was soup that was heavy on vegetables or a sandwich with lean meat Dinner was a chicken breast and rice that he cooked himself  Keeping a strict diet helped him quickly see a difference He lost about two pounds a week When he was down  pounds he decided it was time to start running He started small and gradually built up his run over time going from one mile to seven It really was not fun at first Mullins said It was hilarious how hard it was running just a mile I felt like it was  But gradually it got easier He also joined an exercise boot camp offered on campus He kept up with yoga and then added regular exercise to his everyday activities  He couldnt afford to join a gym but that was OK   If Im watching TV I push the table aside and pull out my exercise ball or lift weights Mullins said He knows many people complain that they dont have time to exercise He does get busy working and going to school but he said that is no excuse I can do  miles in  minutes now running Mullins said Anyone could find  minutes in their day to exercise He also enlisted his friends to hold him accountable Together they downloaded a Nike app that lets you monitor how much friends work out  That kind of friendly competition keeps him motivated he said  Plus friends will call him with words of encouragement if he ever slacks off   He and his friends got so into exercise they created a group called Hashtag Run Together they have tackled local Ks to raise money for a variety of charities including autism One day they hope to do a long AIDS fundraising bike ride that stretches over hundreds of miles  A photographer Mullins also started taking photos of himself so he could watch his progress Those photos certainly keep me honest and motivated he said Now at  pounds and still losing Mullins walks around shirtless so much he says his friends teasingly ask when hell put his shirt back on And yes he gets hit on when he goes out Ive got so much more confidence and energy and the best part is Im so much more comfortable with myself Mullins said Im  years old and now I feel like I could live for at least  more I didnt really feel like that before   What Ive learned from all of this is youve got to figure out what will make you go out and do it Mullins said Trust me I didnt want to run when it was freezing in December But having friends invested in your success and maybe even more important doing it for yourself  it all really does help
