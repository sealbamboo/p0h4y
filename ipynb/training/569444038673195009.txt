s the implementation phase of the   begins the whole programme risks falling victim to its own early success It has been so well received that too little attention has been paid to selling the message to clinical staff At the Kings Fund on Wednesday NHS England chief executive   revealed that there have been  applications to become vanguard areas developing new models of care such as multispecialty community providers MCPs and integrated primary and acute care systems Fifty hospital systems want to form integrated organisations funded with a capitation budget while  GPled consortia want to expand into secondary and community care services some in collaboration with hospital consultants Intriguingly applicants will get a chance to comment on each others bids in what Stevens likened to a Eurovisionstyle process to maximise the chances of selecting sites which are going to provide the most useful models for the rest of the country Backed up by a m fund the vanguard areas offer the exciting prospect of rapidly developing new models of care that improve health and are financially sustainable   England is not interested in schemes with elegant governance the message is to get the change working at the clinical frontline and backfill the paperwork later But at the end of the vanguard process the vast majority of the NHS will be unchanged As the Audit Commission found with local government in the s the difficulty is not encouraging the best or tackling the worst it is galvanising the bulk of the system which is already performing adequately to make a step change At the same debate Kings Fund chief executive Chris Ham highlighted the immense difficulties in changing the system to permit and promote service redesign on a massive scale Its prosaically titled report   stresses the need for national and local NHS bodies to stop thinking as organisations and start thinking as systems  sharing sovereignty locally to reform entire health economies and nationally to provide a coherent strategy for change There need to be big changes in the way the national bodies think and work The Care Quality Commission needs to look at the experiences of people receiving services from several providers The NHS Trust Development Authority must get a lot better at supporting solutions for whole systems rather than propping up individual organisations There will have to be reforms to the operation of competition to ensure that collaboration and integration are not impeded by dogma Ham provided a timely reality check to assumptions that the Forward View has wide support On the contrary he suggested those who are motivated by its philosophy and creativity are deviants the overwhelming majority of clinical staff are simply not interested  at least so far The Forward View and its primary author Simon Stevens have been so well received by the senior ranks of the NHS that there has seemed little need to sell the message In the absence of the row that traditionally accompanies any move to reform the NHS there has been too little emphasis on proselytising among the unbelievers This weakness now has to be addressed Part of the problem has been the focus on money With the three main parties falling over each other to offer the NHS more billions of pounds even as they condemn social services to more devastation the impression is too easily given that relief is at hand Whatever the downsides of a funding shortage it certainly focuses minds on efficiency and effectiveness The debate over the NHS now needs to shift from funding to service models Unless clinical leaders take ownership of the Forward View recognise the need to think and work differently and see its potential for improving care and securing sustainability it will fail
