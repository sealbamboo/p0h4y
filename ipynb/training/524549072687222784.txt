Rise and shine, another busy day is on the way. In fact, the hectic pace began quite awhile ago here on the Pharmalot campus, where the shortest of short people was hurried off to the local school house and our daily foraging for interesting items began earlier than usual.

Valeant Pharmaceuticals may boost its hostile takeover bid for Allergan and will not walk away from its pursuit ahead of a Dec. 18 special Allergan shareholder meeting; The FDA is likely to approve Novo Nordisk’s new drug to treat obesity this year, analysts said after wide expectations of an FDA decision late on Monday were not met; and the Actelion ceo says the U.S. government move to hamper tax-inversion deals is good for the pharmaceutical industry because it forces companies to focus on intrinsic business reasons for transactions.
