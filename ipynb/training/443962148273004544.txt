The elderly man lived alone in an apartment complex not far from the hospital A younger neighbor whod watched him hobble down the buildings stairwell for nearly a week insisted on taking him to the emergency room Doctors there immediately diagnosed an infection in his painful toe and prescribed antibiotics for him to take at home But they also advised the man to be sure to take his diabetes medicine since the infection could elevate his blood sugar to dangerous levels And as the surgical consultant I urged him to keep his foot up check the toe once a day and come to our vascular surgery clinic in a week to make sure the infection was clearing up He needed close followup to prevent serious complications even the loss of his foot Of course if things get worse before the weeks up I said raising my voice to be heard over the clatter beyond the makeshift curtain walls of the ER examining room come back here right away Under the glaring fluorescent lights there was no mistaking the blank look that passed over the mans face He was overwhelmed But so was the emergency room None of the staff members had been trained in coordinating the complex outpatient care this elderly patient needed None knew of a way for the emergency department to check on him a day or so after discharge to ensure his care was proceeding as planned And when a social worker from another department agreed to pitch in with outpatient care the emergency room doctors and nurses became alarmed rather than relieved because arranging such followup could take several hours With patients spilling out of the waiting room and into the hallways they were under pressure to either admit or discharge patients as quickly as possible An older nurse finally pulled me aside Just admit him she whispered Itll cost more but its the only way youll be sure hes getting the right care I remembered the nurses advice and the patient I ended up admitting when I came upon a recent paper and report on the care of elderly patients in American emergency rooms The number of older people seeking health care is expected to increase significantly over the next  years doubling in the case of those older than    In a health care system already   many of these older patients will likely end up in emergency rooms But given longstanding trends in American medicine its hard to imagine a health care setting more ill suited for the elderly than todays emergency rooms  quality emergency care has become synonymous with speed Survival rates for patients in the     or   depend on the number of minutes needed to triage diagnose and treat Even the   where emergency care takes place has become a paragon of medical efficiency  large echoing spaces that can be divided at a moments notice with panels of curtains slick linoleum floors that can be mopped up in minutes and bright fluorescent lights More recently as   the drive for efficiency has become more pronounced with  doctors and nurses having to work as quickly as possible simply to see all the patients But when it comes to elderly patients it is nearly impossible to work quickly Many are plagued by multiple chronic diseases like diabetes high blood pressure and heart disease take numerous prescription drugs that can crossreact in potentially dangerous ways and suffer from ills like dementia that can make the answer to even the simplest of questions  What brought you to the emergency room today  difficult to understand For several years now a small but dedicated group of emergency medicine and geriatrics specialists has been working to improve this situation And over the last three months first in an   then in an impressive set of   supported by several national professional medical and nursing organizations they have issued a call to arms to the rest of the medical profession To meet the needs of the rapidly growing elderly population these specialists assert medical centers must geriatricize their emergency departments And they offer a plethora of practical advice for doing so Among their suggestions Hire providers trained in caring for older patients Routinely administer quick but effective screening tests for dementia and other cognitive impairments Install nonslip flooring and more soundabsorbing materials to decrease the risk of falls and dampen noise levels And train all staff members to be more attuned to social factors that can affect care for the elderly like the necessity of arranging for transportation to get to followup medical visits the need for walkers canes and other medical equipment to get around the home and for extra help to get prescriptions filled and taken correctly Similar changes have already been put in place to improve pediatric trauma and cardiac emergency care But a larger stumbling block remains getting a greater proportion of hospital administrators health care providers and the public at large to become interested in care for the elderly Older adults arent the kind of patients people gravitate toward said Dr Ula Hwang lead author of the paper in Health Affairs a member of the task force that compiled the guidelines and an associate professor of emergency medicine and geriatrics and palliative care at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Theres a reason you dont see the frail cognitively and functionally impaired older patient on television medical shows Nonetheless Dr Hwang and her colleagues remain optimistic About  medical centers have incorporated such changes into their emergency departments a notable improvement from a decade ago when none existed And by emphasizing close attention to the individuals experience many of these redesigned departments are not only improving care but also redefining what is possible for doctors and patients even in one of the most critical of care settings We can really become partners in improving care instead of just putting a BandAid on the problem Dr Hwang said We can give our elderly patients our parents and our grandparents the kind of respect and understanding that we owe them
