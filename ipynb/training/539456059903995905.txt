Experts say they have achieved a scientific milestone  creating enzymes out of artificial genetic material that they made in their lab  The synthetic enzymes functioned just as well as real ones The work in   journal not only provides clues to the building blocks of life but also points to a new way to make therapeutic drugs for humans  The UK Medical Research Council team now hopes to make more complex structures that rival nature  The ground work for the pioneering project started a couple of years ago when Dr Philipp Holliger and his team created    the molecules that carry the basic genetic code of life Using these artificial XNAs as building blocks the researchers set out to see if they could make synthetic    substances that drive a wide range of bodily functions such as how we digest our food  Dr Holliger explained Until recently it was thought that DNA and RNA were the only molecules that could store genetic information and together with proteins the only biomolecules able to form enzymes His team found it was possible to create enzymes from scratch using material that does not exist in nature  Although entirely manmade the synthetic enzymes are capable of building and breaking down molecules  just like naturally occurring ones  The XNAzymes as the researchers call them could jumpstart simple reactions such as cutting and joining RNA strands in a test tube  One of the XNAzymes joined XNA strands together  something that represents one of the first steps to creating a living system say scientists  Dr Holliger said Our work suggests that in principle there are a number of possible alternatives to natures molecules that will support the catalytic processes required for life Lifes choice of RNA and DNA may just be an accident of prehistoric chemistry He said it was possible that life could be found on other planets born from a molecular backbone other than DNA Back here on Earth synthetic enzymes might be useful for treating human diseases such as cancer Dr Holliger explained that XNAs are ideally suited as a therapy  Chemically they are extremely hardy and because they do not occur in nature they can evade the bodys natural degrading enzymes  This might make them an attractive candidate for longlasting treatments that can disrupt diseaserelated RNAs he said  And because we can modify chemistry at least to some extent to our hearts content we can make tailormade enzymes for particular purposes Prof Paul Freemont an expert in structural biology at Imperial College London said I can see how there could be therapeutic strategies downstream if we can start to mimic nature and develop synthetic variants What excites me more is the questions it raises about the origins of life It provokes people to think that what we see on our planet is just one chemical possibility Its the pure challenge of the chemistry of life
