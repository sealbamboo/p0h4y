My winning streak as our familys champion pie king ended six years ago  and thats when all the trouble started Since going to college down South I had sat on the holiday pie throne without fear of challenge learning early what my Tar Heel neighbor Frances Mayes wrote in   Pecan pie is a necessary ingredient of Christmas Remaining the king was a result of the time Id invested refining my pecan pie recipe  which if I may  had two outstanding attributes a generous helping of Kentucky bourbon to cut the treacly sweetness of the Karo syrup and a top secret mixing technique that prevented the pie from becoming gelatinous  Perfection And no one dared bring another pecan pie to our familys Christmas table Until  that is which just happened to be the year I turned  That year my sisters wife Maddy invited a new and much younger sisterinlaw of hers to our family table Just married and eight months pregnant how could we not embrace her It was all air kisses and mwahs until Megan murmured I brought a pecan pie  At that very moment I knew Maddy had sold me out I mean how could she have failed to disclose to Megan Oh only Steven makes the pecan pie in this family She might also have added that my pies had seen us through our familys ups and downs  from the death of my grandmother who was known to stick her fork right into the uncut pie and start eating to the birth of three nieces and a nephew each celebrated with a pie Every holiday season we consumed a delicious slice of our family history along with our calories Soon enough came dessert and for the first time in our family we faced two pecan pies on the sideboard  mine crafted with the aforementioned bourbon and a dollop of entitlement and Megans with a dash of bravado and another of comeuppance  As we ate Megan launched into a long yarn about how her heirloom pecans came from her great godmother in Lamar Mo Every year she hand picked them hand shelled them and then sent them to me The magic of her   is part of what makes this pie so delicious showing absolutely no consideration for her treasonous status By the time she was finished I knew I was finished No matter how delicious my pie Megans family history was about to trump ours with my very own flesh and blood ready to dethrone me  And yes nearly every one of them voted against me their forks enthusiastically awarding Megan the outsider our familys  pecan pie accolade  The following Christmas I joined a new family myself my nowhusbands big boisterous clan in WinstonSalem NC His family which came readymade with several sistersinlaws naturally had its own history and traditions And it was Sister Lisa at least a bakers dozen years younger than me who owned the pecan pie trophy Honestly I didnt know about that when I offered to bring one of my own prizewinners to Christmas dinner nor did my new motherinlaw warn me away from pecan to say pumpkin Still I had learned a thing or two from Megan and her storytelling And soon enough Sister Lisas pie and my own sat sidebyside on my motherinlaws marble countertop awaiting their comers To be fair Lisas was a handsome pie if not a tad untraditional  made with maple syrup horrors  instead of Karo But it came sans storyline without history By contrast let me just say that the gathering of the pecans in my pie from a mom and pop farm in Goldsboro NC had a tale of woe like youve never imagined It was Rabelaiss Gargantua and Pantagruel all over again and I told the farmers story slowly and carefully Famine floods and pestilence Not to mention I mixed in my own family story as a way of introducing myself to the new inlaws By desserts end the voting was in My pie pan was empty and poor Lisa went home with a good third of her humble pie Fastforward to this yuletide season where pecan pie is already a trending topic in our family As the Karo syrup binds the nuts so too the pie now does for my clan Just a couple of weeks ago Lisa sent me a hugs and kisses Facebook message ostensibly lamenting our missed visit at Thanksgiving but no doubt trying to decipher whether she or I will bring our prized pies to Mother Helens our shared motherinlaw on Christmas Day Weve learned our lesson Lisa and I dont ever bring our pies to the same gathering In fact shes warned me I will start a whole new tradition this year and make my Mamas nine layer chocolate cake That has a great story and no pecans As for the larger lesson well thats pretty clear now Its not about the bourbon my secret mixing technique  not even the pedigree of the nuts Its about the life of the pie  the traditions we mix up year after year that with any luck bind us together as family For those of us in middle age not only do we get to share our recipes but our family history and stories too which seem only to get better with age To paraphrase the yuletide story Happy Christmas to all and to all a good bite
