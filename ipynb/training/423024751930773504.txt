Angela Felan is sitting in the ER waiting room at OConnor Hospital in San Jose Calif A blue surgical mask covers her nose and mouth and a sweatshirt is pulled snug over her head She first came into the emergency room a few days ago with what she thought was bronchitis The doctor prescribed an inhaler that cost her  Felan  works part time in retail and hasnt had insurance for at least a decade because she hasnt been able to afford it Unfortunately even not having insurance is just as expensive she says Felan has heard of the states insurance exchange called Covered California but she worries that coverage will still be pricey Shes unsure whether she will qualify for subsidies for private insurance because of her low income or even Medicaid As far as today goes Im expecting another large bill from the hospital Felan says Previously when I would come in uninsured I would get like a  or  bill for just one visit Some  uninsured people come into OConnor Hospitals emergency department each year and now it is Araceli Martinezs job to help them find coverage She runs the Health Benefits Resource Center just down the hall from the ER The center has beefed up staffing and hours in response to the Affordable Care Act Martinez says uninsured patients had few options before  to pay off hefty hospital bills or enroll in health coverage Now when they come in through the emergency room and are faced with a bill theyre saying they might be able to afford coverage Still patients remain confused about the law Half of uninsured adults who could get policies now through the health insurance marketplaces have   before and in California nearly half of poor adults dont know they would   Martinez estimates that  percent of the uninsured patients she sees can now get coverage if they follow up and apply Hospitals have extra motivation to sign up patients for insurance because they also face Medicare cuts As for Medicaid  states and the District of Columbia have   up to most poor adults That means if an uninsured patient is found eligible hospitals can get paid retroactively for medical treatments going as far back as three months I think the emergency department waiting room is one of those places where you have lowhanging fruit says   an associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of California San Francisco Theyre not the sickest of the sick because at least someone the triage nurse has deemed them stable enough to wait And if theyre waiting they might as well be filling out some application form or at least learning about the process OConnor Hospital CEO   doesnt expect to get a whole lot more money if more people are signed up for Medicaid California has one of the   in the nation Even so he sees it as a worthy goal Dover says he wants to get patients insured so they dont have to come to the ER for common problems Let me use this metaphor A person is coming down the river and theyre drowning and you jump in and pull them out And then they come down again and you pull them out Next Two Three Four Five At some point you have to go up the river and take care of the spot where theyre all falling in Angela Felan emerges from seeing the doctor clutching a stack of papers The doctor told her she had a worrisome ear infection and needs antibiotics When she came to the emergency department a few days ago the discharge nurse didnt mention anything about new insurance options But at the end of this visit she says someone said they would give me a financial packet and I could call the number on that and someone would go over financial options with me Calling later sounds good to Felan She has spent enough time in the ER and is ready to rest You just want to go home and just relax and not deal with anything because your head is pounding and you just dont feel good she says
