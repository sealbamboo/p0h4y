Many people with diabetes have switched to newer forms of insulin called analogs because they can make the disease easier to manage But that switch can be expensive a study finds Researchers at the Yale University School of Medicine looked at insurance claim data to see how people with Type  diabetes were using insulin and how much it cost From  to  the number of people with Type  diabetes who filled at least one prescription for insulin rose from  to  percent At the same time there was a radical shift in the kind of insulin used In   percent of people with   using insulin chose human insulin forms By   percent of people chose synthetic or analog forms And that switch can be expensive since analogs are more expensive than regular insulin Out of pocket costs for people using insulin for Type  rose  per prescription in  to  in  according to a study published Tuesday in   the journal of the American Medical Association That means that with insulin use increasing along with patients costs outofpocket spending on insulin more than tripled from  million in  to  million in  for every  patients with Type  diabetes according to   an instructor in medicine at Yale University Medical School who led the study The number of severe hypoglycemic events those people declined slightly over that time period but not enough that it was statistically significant What worries me about these findings is that the shift has been so dramatic and so nearly universal Lipska told Shots Its hard to imagine that all these patients are informed about the choice theyre making and that for them in particular that its worth it This study only looked at people who had private insurance so it doesnt include what people might be paying through other forms of insurance or without insurance coverage Some forms of   act quickly making it possible to inject just before or right after a meal They include aspart glulisine and lispro Others including detemir and glargine provide relatively constant levels of the drug for hours and may help people avoid the risk of low blood sugar at night Patents for analog forms of insulin are expiring in the next few years and manufacturers are interested in making biosimilar products the equivalent of generics for prescription drugs Its not hard to see why   reached  billion in  up  percent since  But biosimilars might not offer people the big price savings weve seen with generic drugs Lipska says There are high costs of approval and development and only a few companies that have the expertise
