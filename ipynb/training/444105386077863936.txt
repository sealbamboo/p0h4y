A widows legal battle to keep her dead husbands frozen sperm is finally over after the fertility regulator said it would not take the case back to the courts  Last week the High Court backed Beth Warrens case to stop the sperm being destroyed by April  The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority kept the door open to appeal but now says it accepts the verdict  Her husband had the sperm frozen before starting cancer treatment But yearold Warren Brewer a ski instructor died of a brain tumour in February   The couple who were together for eight years married in a hospice six weeks before his death and she subsequently changed her surname to Warren Mr Brewer had repeatedly made clear that his partner now  should be allowed to use his sperm in the event of his death  But he had not been given the opportunity by the fertility clinic to store the sperm for a prolonged period   The case went to the courts but   Mrs Justice Hogg said The evidence indicates that both Mr Brewer and his wife were in agreement He wanted her to have the opportunity to have his child if she wanted after his death She ruled that it was right and proper and proportionate to allow the sperm to be kept until at least April  Mrs Warren from Birmingham said she was over the moon and elated with the decision But the HFEA immediately said it was seeking leave to appeal against the decision Sally Cheshire from the HFEA said Seeking leave to appeal may have appeared unsympathetic to Mrs Warrens very regrettable situation but we owed it to future patients to think carefully about the implications of a complex legal judgement  We didnt want Mrs Warrens deserving and highly unusual case to pave the way for other cases where the wishes of the deceased patient are much less clear  Fortunately we think we can guard against any such cases without having to appeal The organisation said it would write to fertility clinics to ensure they kept clear records of patients wishes  Mrs Warrens lawyer James Lawford Davies said It is unfortunate that it was ever necessary for Beth to go to court in circumstances where Warrens wishes were so clear   Along with the rest of the legal team I am delighted for Beth and very pleased that her two year struggle has at last come to an end
