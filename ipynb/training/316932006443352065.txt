Allergy shots have long been one of the best available treatments for hay fever other allergies and asthma but theyre a pain In Europe people have a more pleasant alternative drops put under the tongue That treatment called   hasnt been approved by the Food and Drug Administration but more and more patients in the US are asking for it I have a bunch of patients who request it says   an otolaryngologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore Because the drops arent FDAapproved Lin and other doctors are prescribing them offlabel which is legal She prescribes extracts of things like ragweed dust mites and pollen that are FDAapproved for shots and has her patients put the drops under the tongue while at home A new   by Lin and colleagues published in the   says the drops are moderately effective in reducing asthma symptoms with  out of  studies reporting more than  percent improvement in symptoms The evidence was stronger in studies with children The drops were also moderately effective in reducing the stuffy noses and itchy eyes of seasonal allergies with  out of  studies showing a greater than  percent improvement Thats not a slamdunk But earlier studies including two   by the Cochrane Collaboration an independent organization that evaluates medical treatments also found that the drops worked pretty well with no big safety issues A similar technique is being tested for treating   which have not been tamed by shots Still the drops are extracts of the allergic substance just like allergy shots And they can spark allergic reactions themselves Problems listed in the   report include swelling of the lips and cheeks and more rarely systemic reactions like hives There were no reports of lifethreatening reactions or deaths reported but the researchers excluded a lot of safety studies from their review Its easy to see why drops at home would be more appealing than allergy shots which require weekly visits to the doctor for months if not years But that can be risky too The American College of Asthma Allergy and Immunology   that people using the drops at home should be carefully briefed on what to do if they have a systemic reaction There are other issues too Because the drops arent approved in the US doctors using it here have to make educated guesses on the correct dose They also have to guess at how long patients should take the drops to build longterm tolerance Some studies have recommended taking them daily for five years And allergy drops can be pricey Since theyre not FDAapproved they arent covered by insurance Lin estimates the cost at  a day in the first year and  a day after that Thats cheaper than inoffice allergy shots but those are often covered by insurance We contacted the FDA to find out if any companies had applications pending for sublingual immunotherapy The email we got back said The FDA cannot confirm the existence of or comment on any currentpending product applicatiions Most of the studies on drops have tested only one allergen but people who get allergy shots typically are treated for eight or more unrelated allergies at the same time according to   a professor at National Jewish Health in Denver who wrote an editorial accompanying the   study His bottom line Many unanswered questions remain
