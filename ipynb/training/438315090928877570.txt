A private care home in Edinburgh has been criticised for failing to make sufficient improvements to the quality of its services Some improvements were found in BUPAs Pentland Hill care home However the Care Inspectorate said the improvements had not been consistent or sustained and more were needed Police have submitted an investigation into four deaths at the home to the procurator fiscal Admissions remain suspended pending a further inspection The report concludes Evidence from this inspection is that BUPA has made changes to how Pentland Hill is run and managed We have seen some improvements but these have not been consistent or sustained and more improvements are needed to ensure all residents receive better care As a result the improvement notice dated  November  has not been met However in recognition that the provider is taking steps to make the required improvements we have extended the original timescales of the improvement notice to  February  in relation to those areas of improvements where the timescales have now passed Dr Robert Peat Care Inspectorates director of inspection said We have seen evidence of changes in how Pentland Hill is run including a new manager which is welcome Overall the home has made some progress but we need to see greater and faster improvements so the changes are sustained and consistent Every person is entitled to highquality safe care that is compassionate                            We seriously considered whether to use our powers to request that a sheriff closes this home but determined on balance that the best outcome for residents is to continue to drive improvements providing they can be made quickly A Pentland Hill care home spokeswoman said Were pleased that the Care Inspectorates inspection which was carried out in December found that there were improvements within the home These have also been recognised by our residents and their families  We continue to work hard to ensure all improvements are sustained and that were delivering a consistently high standard of care to our residents
