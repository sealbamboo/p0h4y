One recent night I was asked to declare the death of a woman I had never met   Ms L passed the nurse said  Could you pronounce her  The online medical record told me that she was  years old one year younger than me She had been in the hospital for months with leukemia that had progressed despite every possible chemotherapy regimen and a failed bone marrow transplant And now someone needed to perform a death exam   Declaring death is not technically hard but it is weird and sad and requires reams of paperwork It is usually done by an intern but my intern was busy so I said I would do it  The first time I declared a patient dead was nearly six years earlier I had been a doctor for a few months when I was summoned overnight with a page that told me that my patients heart had stopped When I got to his room I was out of breath and his nurse smiled at me and told me that there really wasnt urgency he wasnt going anywhere   It was only when I walked into the room and saw my patient still and utterly silent his tired family sitting around the bed that I realized no one had ever told me precisely how to declare death I wished I could come back later but it didnt seem right to leave him there so I thumbed through my pocketsized intern survival guide The manual was alphabetized and the discussion about declaring death came somewhere before a section on diabetes management  The instructions were clear and began with the directive to express sympathy I turned to the family to tell them how sorry I was   I placed my stethoscope on the patients still chest and waited watching for him to take a breath and wondering what I would do if I heard something But there was nothing   I placed my hand on his neck and there was not even a quiver And that was that He was dead  I looked at the clock and spoke the time out loud and said I was sorry again And then I left the room Later I would face the inevitable pile of paperwork which one hospital I worked at labeled the Final Discharge Packet and another in bold letters on a red binder the Death Binder That was followed by calls to admitting to report the death minutes that felt like hours on hold with the medical examiner death certificates returned to me because I had signed on the wrong dotted line By the end of my intern year one of the worst parts of having a patient die was those bureaucratic forms and phone calls  Now years later I paused outside the room of Ms L before pulling back the curtain Until then most of the patients I had been called to declare looked much as they did in life only vacant But this woman had been destroyed by illness She was bald and yellow and bloated She must have suffered I took out my stethoscope as I had learned to do rested it on her chest and listened to the silence that had taken the place of her heartbeat I laid my fingers on her neck and there was no pulse I looked up at the clock and said the time out loud As I turned to leave I couldnt help but note the wall of cards and photographs next to her hospital bed She must have run a marathon to raise money for cancer research for one photo captured her healthy and smiling arms lifted victoriously as she crossed the finish line Someone who loved her must have been there waiting to take that photo  She must have been cool I said to her nurse I bet I would have liked her She was awesome  No one spoke Two nurses gently pulled out the intravenous lines that had once run antibiotics and fluids into her veins and one by one removed the stickers on her chest that had recorded her heartbeat One of the nurses paused and caught my eye   Its so humid out she said How do you keep your hair from getting frizzy in this humidity I had showered just before my shift I told her and then I had come right to work so I hadnt been outside much When I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror my hair didnt even look that good  And then because I didnt know what else to say in front of this yearold woman I would never meet I offered only You know Ive always wanted to run a marathon  I left the room to begin the paperwork
