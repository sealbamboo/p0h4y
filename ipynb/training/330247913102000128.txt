If youre a smoothie lover take note Eight spots in your kitchen  including the indispensable blender and a few other unexpected areas  may be alive with foodborne pathogens potent enough to sicken you and your family a new study from a leading safety organization has found Blenders and can openers were tainted with traces of Ecoli and salmonella according to  tested by NFS International a global health and safety organization originally known as the National Sanitation Foundation Rubber spatulas were covered with E coli yeast and mold Nasty bugs were even found inside the refrigerator vegetable drawers  The top germiest spot was the innocentlooking refrigerator water dispenser  That dispenser lever was just one of the  percent of kitchen surfaces on which concerning levels yeast or mold were found to be coating the surface said Lisa Yakas a microbiologist at NSF International Mold and yeast can cause allergic reactions and respiratory ailments in some people The blender was one of the most surprising germ factories Most people may think theyre fine if they wash out the glass container but thats not the problem  Smoothies are popular these days Yakas said We found people dont take their blenders apart when they wash them They just take the lid off and put the whole jar and blade assembly together in the dishwasher Some people cant get that blade unscrewed any more because its so caked together Another dirty area the freezer ice maker  Its a case of what most people perceive to be clean said Yakas Most people think theyre putting a clean glass or clean cup up there But its a place people can touch Its a place people dont wash frequently so there can be germ buildup over time  Salmonella which can cause   and even death for atrisk populations  was detected in  percent of the kitchen crannies swabbed including foodstorage containers with rubber seals  While some of these microorganisms are harmless to physically robust people some strains are very virulent and can cause serious illness in otherwise healthy adults and children said Allison Aiello associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigans School of Public Health Children pregnant women seniors and people with compromised immune systems are most at risk In rare cases pathogens such as listeria can be fatal Once those bugs take root in a drawer or on an appliance their life spans can vary widely depending on the temperature humidity and surface type Aiello added For example Ecoli  could survive for more than  days at both fridge temp and room temp on stainless steel but on copper that same germ type dies in  to  minutes Ecoli  strains of which can cause diarrhea urinary tract infections and pneumonia  also was found by the NSF swabs on one quarter of the spots checked  Blenders and twopiece spatulas should be disassembled before heading into power dishwashers or in sudsfilled sinks Simple soapandwater rubdowns   kitchen surfaces of germs Many refrigerator manufacturers recommend using a vinegarwater mix to clean water dispensers and ice makers The thing to remember is You cant sterilize a dirty surface Yakas said Just make sure you get a cleaning routine in place so they dont get a biofilm buildup where these germs have a place to stick and grab onto
