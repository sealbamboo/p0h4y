In  my husband and I bought a vacation home in the foothills of the Catskills The inspector who checked out the property failed to note three critical facts The house had three flat roofs in snow country no drainage from the muddy crawl space and no insulation under the floors In a few years ours had become a sick house with minilakes on sagging roofs wet insulation underneath and a small pond in the crawl space All of it contributed to rampant mold inside the house My husband was especially sensitive to mold and he reacted with extreme fatigue whenever we visited My sisterinlaw who lived in the house year round complained of chronic headaches and sinus problems I could smell the mustiness and found mold growing on the wood cabinets and a leather love seat The moisture problem had to be fixed Slanted roofs were constructed wet insulation was replaced downspouts were directed away from the house We fitted the crawl space with a drain and a heavy plastic vapor barrier and the floors above it were insulated Mold had to be removed from furniture and cupboards and their contents Clothing was dry cleaned or washed and heatdried to get rid of the odor Natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy left hundreds of thousands of people with flooded homes that quickly became infested with mold unlivable and sometimes unfixable Given moisture mold will grow and reproduce behind wallboard paneling wallpaper and furniture in ceiling tiles and insulation on wood floors around appliances like refrigerators and dishwashers and under carpets and pads if not quickly dried But as my experience demonstrated you dont need a flood to develop a mold problem It can happen anywhere moisture is present  a hidden leak for example or condensation around windows or pipes You may not even be aware of the problem only the distress it causes Typical symptoms resemble those of an allergy like   a     red or itchy eyes throat irritation and coughing Some people develop a skin rash those with   may have an attack According to research by the Mayo Clinic an immunological response to mold   Mold can even infect the central nervous system often fatally as occurred in a  outbreak of   from epidural injections contaminated by   Of the    died The types of mold usually found in homes do not produce dangerous toxins But they can bring misery and are best controlled by preventing their growth Molds are a type of fungus and they grow by releasing spores into the air The spores are not visible to the naked eye but when they land on a moist surface or when the surface they are on becomes moist they begin to grow Outdoors molds play an important role in the decomposition of organic matter like leaves and fallen trees Even the driest buildings contain mold spores and those with indoor moisture may have thousands in every cubic foot of air The spores are ubiquitous and can survive extreme dryness and cold remaining dormant until moisture and oxygen provide a chance to grow These measures can reduce the buildup of indoor mold   Fix leaks immediately and thoroughly dry the affected area   Regularly clear debris from roof gutters   Keep air conditioner and refrigerator drip pans clean   Insulate coldwater pipes   Use an air conditioner or a dehumidifier or both and change the filters regularly to maintain a relative humidity below  percent The lower the better   Vent appliances like clothes dryers that generate moisture to the outside   Use an exhaust fan or open a window when washing dishes cooking or showering   Keep crawl space vents clear Do not use carpets in potentially moist areas like a laundry room bathroom and basement Replace sponges and dishcloths often or wash and dry them with the regular laundry Roof leaks can be especially challenging leaving wet insulation and moisture behind walls Roofing is best restored or replaced on a schedule before a leak occurs Keeping a house warm suppresses mold growth Alas my house still gets musty in winter to save oil and money I set the thermostat at  degrees when Im not there Some people especially those with severe   chronic lung disease or suppressed immunity are affected by outdoor mold in compost piles cut grass and wooded areas When cleaning the yard and raking or sweeping dead leaves they should consider wearing a face mask or an N respirator a fancy dust mask that costs  to  Cleaning up mold requires care Limit your exposure by wearing goggles a face mask and long rubber neoprene or PVC gloves You need not use chlorine   soap and water or a nontoxic commercial cleaner and a scrubbing sponge or brush will work well on hard surfaces Dry the area thoroughly after cleaning If you do use a bleach solution no stronger than one cup of bleach to one gallon of water never mix it with ammonia or a product that contains ammonia Do not paint over or caulk moldy surfaces Clean away the mold first and then use paint with a mold inhibitor Porous materials like ceiling tiles and carpets that have become moldy can be difficult to clean adequately and usually must be replaced You may need a professional contractor skilled in mold cleanup if the affected area is larger than  square feet The Environmental Protection Agency recommends checking references and making sure the contractor consults its guide   available at   The agency also provides a guide to cleaning contaminated heating and air conditioning systems
