The truth is were right in the middle of an epidemic but we as a nation are in denial An Oscar for Still Alice is shining the brightest light yet on Alzheimers but light isnt enough anymore Attention isnt enough Its time to get serious Alzheimers is exerting a powerful impact on American families  on our health our finances and our futures And women are disproportionately affected Why women Back in  when we published   we reported that women were more than half the individuals diagnosed with Alzheimers and nearly twothirds of the unpaid caregivers of those who had it Now those numbers are far worse Today nearly twothirds of those with Alzheimers are women  thats more than  million women And   with many having to reduce their own workload or even drop out of the workforce altogether to care for loved ones  Women are the epicenter of this crisis which is why I believe they also have to be the solution So in partnership with the and so many inspiring women already working on the front lines to fight this disease we have launched the  a multipronged campaign powered by womens brains   Our mission is to enlist women of all ages to get educated engaged and empowered to instigate change   Women around the country will go out and raise the alarm raise awareness raise the stakes and raise millions of dollars to fund serious research into womens brains And theres so much research to do and so many questions to answer Why is the incidence of Alzheimers higher for women Nobody knows And why is it that women in their s are so much more likely to get Alzheimers than breast cancer Nobody knows Whats the exact role of estrogen We dont know Is there an Alzheimers connection with depression or with diabetes What about genetics What can be done during the  or so years when the disease develops before a woman even becomes symptomatic Whats the impact of diet stress level exercise sleep and cardiovascular condition Its time to find out We have to fund this research because for some reason its not a priority for the government In  Washington  an estimated  billion on cancer research and  billion on HIVAIDS research but only  million on Alzheimers Yet as the Alzheimers Association  the costs to all payers for the care of people living with Alzheimers disease and other dementias will total an estimated  billion with Medicare and Medicaid paying  percent of the costs  I dont get it but Im not going to wait anymore    So Wipe Out Alzheimers is stepping in Were asking women to put together their own brain trusts in their communities  groups that will go out and do some muscular fundraising But equally important these brain trusts will gather to discuss and disseminate information about what the disease is and isnt What are the warning signs we should look for in ourselves and our parents Whats the difference between normal forgetfulness dementia and Alzheimers disease Can brain games or meditation slow cognitive decline Do dietary supplements help  Local brain trust groups will also learn about the devastatingly high cost of Alzheimers  how neither Medicare nor the Affordable Care Act covers longterm care and   a semiprivate nursing home room averages more than  a year Theyll reach out to help and encourage women whose loved ones have Alzheimers They will be politically engaged and encourage political candidates who support increased funding for Alzheimers research Theyll push their own doctors to get bettereducated about cognitive health   Its time for the narrative around Alzheimers to change I remember when an HIVAIDS diagnosis was a death sentence I remember when cancer was a dirty word and the prognosis was always grim But AIDS and cancer activists are helping to take these diseases from terrifying to treatable from hopeless to hopeful We want to do the same with Alzheimers We want to understand it prevent it treat it and beat it  Wipe Out Alzheimers is creating a global community of women activists agitators and agents of change to do just that   We used to think that the mysterious condition called Alzheimers disease happened only to folks in their s and s Still Alice shows us thats just not true         The race for the Oscar may be over but the race to wipe out Alzheimers is on
