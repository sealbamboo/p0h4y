In the Silicon Valley arms race to lure the top talent with the best benefits Facebook and Apple are adding egg freezing for female employees The two companies may be the first to pay for the procedure for women who choose it to delay childbearing The addition of eggfreezing to the benefits plan comes as tech companies face mounting pressure to hire more women And its a perk that some women may find attractive Brigitte Adams started   where women can share information about the procedure Adams paid for the procedure herself I froze my eggs at  she says and there was nothing out there that was specific to eggfreezing The American Society of Reproductive Medicine   Adams a marketing executive at a tech startup says the addition of coverage for the procedure definitely would give extra weight to a job offer I would equate it to reimbursement for an MBA program she says or adoption assistance or you know  its not the beall and endall but its definitely a nice perk And an expensive one  the benefit covers  worth of procedures typically two rounds of egg retrieval Then again rich Silicon Valley companies are notorious for highend benefits that can include gourmet food dry cleaning and massages Cali Williams Yost who consults with companies about worklife balance says covering the cost of eggfreezing as an elective procedure could help keep some good female employees The benefit also is available to employees spouses By offering to pay for women to freeze their eggs I think Silicon Valley is responding to what some of the young talented women in their workforce want she says But Williams Yost says enabling female employees in particular to delay having children isnt all thats needed At some point those workers will have children and also will need the right benefits then They are going to need the direct supports the flexibility the caregiving she says leaves and benefits that actually help them combine work and life Eggfreezing is a great small piece of a much bigger puzzle Facebook told NPR that its offering this benefit because employees were asking for it In a statement Apple also said it wanted to make certain its female employees could do the best work of their lives Both companies have paid parental leave policies and onsite health care Facebook also subsidizes day care costs But Marcy Darnovsky executive director at the Center for Genetics and Society says that expanding benefits to cover eggfreezing could put pressure on women to delay childbearing so that their employer can get more hours out of them Darnovsky is an advocate for the responsible use of reproductive technologies When youre in a situation of your employer offering you a choice she says you really have to be careful that youre distinguishing between something thats an expanded option and something thats actually subtle or even explicit pressure to do what your employer wants you to do But Darnovsky says there is also a virtue in eggfreezing because it does give women more choices and control over their lives Eggfreezing is no guarantee of having a child though  that women who have three rounds of egg retrieval at around  per round have a slightly more than  percent chance of giving birth if they are  or younger when the eggs are frozen The closer women get to age  the lower the likelihood of success If women limit themselves to the two rounds of egg retrieval covered by the new benefits that also will reduce the odds Eggsurance forum founder Brigitte Adams froze her eggs when she was  She says she didnt do it for career reasons but to give herself as many options as she could given the circumstances of her life and that thats why many women she knows did the procedure Were doing it maybe because our life didnt take the course we expected it to she says and were older and we want to have children and hey theres this new technology that may help us do that Adams is currently single and she says freezing her eggs has made it easier for her to look for the right partner without feeling as much pressure from her biological clock
