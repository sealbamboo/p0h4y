With the dust settling over the chancellors bn down payment on NHS Englands Five Year Forward View its becoming clear that its implementation will impact on all   and social care providers Applications are due by the end of January to become one of the new care models envisioned NHS chief executive Simon Stevens has emphasised that radical change is both required and expected a view reinforced by last weeks Dalton Report to NHS England on future care models This implementation challenge requires that health and care economies change how they listen engage and communicate If integrated properly with listening and engagement social media can play a huge role in rising to this challenge Social media allows local NHS and care providers to connect and engage directly with thousands of people and organisations be seen to understand and take on board their viewpoints and involve them in local solutions It also allows them to reply to questions and objections and in some cases challenge misinformation from sectional interests or campaign groups This creates a much more transparent and healthy environment for debate and discussion Ultimately it can lead to more robust longterm solutions On the downside there are also examples of where NHS organisations have failed to develop and own their space in social media leaving it to opponents to define them in highly negative terms to their reputational and operational damage Social media is no longer a nice to have option for the NHS It is moving to become missioncritical Earlier this month with support from NHS Providers we published   Four in five NHS organisations now use at least one social media channel for corporate communication and engagement although almost one in three use only Twitter NHS corporate social media use is almost entirely dominated by Twitter Facebook YouTube and LinkedIn Just under  of NHS organisations were found to be using social media channels outside this big four  mainly Pinterest Vimeo or Flickr Our report also revealed some of the most pioneering and effective uses of NHS social media take place well away from the official channels of NHS bodies in myriad tweet chats campaigns conversations blogs and interactions This stealth revolution may not have been televised but it has been tweeted retweeted favourited liked followed tagged poked shared webcast thunderclapped and crowdsourced There are an estimated m Twitter users in the UK We used a pioneering NHS social media analysis tool  Find SoMeone in    to cut through those millions of Twitter accounts drill down identify and analyse the followers and activity of the  individuals or organisations with the highest concentration of interest and engagement with the main national UK NHS and healthrelated social media accounts including the top  NHS organisations The top performers include the comms team for        director of Patients First    NHS trust    the London Ambulance Service    Norfolk and Norwich University hospitals NHS trust    chief transformation officer NHS Horizons Group    a community mental health nurse    the Joseph Rowntree Foundation    occupational therapist    GP lead    midwife for more than three decades    recovery nurse whose dad died of Alzheimers in  Just as important as the where its being used is how well To answer this question we used a second unique tool the Social Media Capability Analysis completed by more than  individuals working at all levels over more than  NHS organisations including national leadership organisations and agencies acute trusts and community trusts This showed that overall the NHS is at a state of low maturity in its use of social media It is at a reasonable state in  The degree to which it is beginning to use social media beyond mere broadcasting activities  The degree to which it reviews its content  The degree to which boards are beginning to get engaged But it is no more than adequate in  Its involvement in others channels and communities  Its understanding of the views of its stakeholders  The degree to which it cocreates content across social media  The degree to which social media is integrated with improvement listening and engagement  The degree to which social media is consciously and actively planned  The degree to which social media actively contributes to service improvement If youre an NHS organisation looking to move beyond Low Maturity or even simply start out on your social media journey here are ten top tips  Benchmark your current activity and performance and agree a conscious Implementation Plan to improve  dont leave it to chance  Fully map your local stakeholders and proactively engage with their own social media presences  follow them and theyre likely to follow you  Make sure your social media activity is closely integrated with your listening engagement and improvement activities across your organisation  avoid silo behaviour or activity  Get your story and purpose straight and keep to it  dont simply do social media for its own sake  Collate existing material across the organisation that can be reused  there will be loads of it  Maintain momentum constantly review and refine  If possible add a picture video or link to your messages  text on its own gets a fraction of interest or engagement  Dont worry about getting things wrong at first on the whole its a forgiving place  Do it with personality  corporate speak is quickly shunned  Never ever ghostwrite a Twitter or other account on behalf of your chief executive  it is spotted in minutes If you are an individual looking to get involved with social media on your own or your organisations behalf keep the following list at hand and check regularly if you adhere to it  Its all about following and being followed  Engagement brings recognition and response  Tell it small tell it often  Recognise and reward others contributions and opinions  Get involved in conversations with personality  Ask questions  offer advice  Provide content links and signposts  Dip in and out  but with regularity   Invest time and show effort  Have opinions but never berate The mantra for the future delivery of health and care services is to be more personalised centred on individuals needs and preferences and delivered through a plurality of sources Shouldnt that also apply to the way we listen engage and improve
