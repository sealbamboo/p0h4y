Cans of the popular flavored malt beverage Four Loko will soon sport an Alcohol Facts label to make it plain they pack a potent punch The changes are part of a final settlement   Tuesday between the Federal Trade Commission and Phusion Projects whose products have been blamed for   among young people The company   with the commissions allegations but said in a statement that the agreement provides a practical way for the company to move ahead We share a common interest with the FTC in providing consumers with information and packaging options to help them make informed responsible decisions said the statement by Jaisen Freeman a cofounder of Phusion Projects The new labels which will appear on the back of all cans containing more than two servings will make it clear what a serving size is and note that each serving contains  ounces of alcohol All cans containing more than twoandahalf servings will also have to be resealable That change may help consumers realize that they really dont need to guzzle it all down in one sitting The label changes which will go into effect after theyre approved by the Department of Treasurys Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau settle the FTCs deceptive marketing charges against Phusion Projects The FTC had alleged that ads for Four Loko falsely claimed that a ounce can contained the equivalent of one to two cans of beer In fact the FTC says its more like four to five beers The agency had   changing Four Loko labels to express the alcohol content in terms of the equivalent number of regular beers As boozy as Four Loko is now it used to be even more potent thanks to an original formula that included caffeine In November  Phusion Projects decided to   the caffeine along with guarana and taurine from the formula as the FTC was preparing a   on drinks that blend stimulants and alcohol As our friends at Shots have   psychologists have found that mixing alcohol and caffeine may impair judgment more than booze alone  After we published this post we received an email from Phusion Projects noting that the FDA commended us on November   for our decision to voluntarily reformulate our products
