The first rapid blood test for Ebola has been approved for use by the World Health Organization It should allow patients to be identified isolated and cared for as quickly as possible in an attempt to bring an end to the outbreak that has killed more than  people  It is less accurate than conventional tests but takes minutes rather than hours to get a result  The test also works without electricity so it can be used in remote regions  Current Ebola testing requires a laboratory to analyse the blood for fragments of the viruss genetic material It can take between  and  hours to get a definitive answer  The ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test developed by US company Corgenix searches the blood for a different part of the virus Trials in West Africa suggest it correctly identifies about  of people who have Ebola   The World Health Organization said While less accurate the antigen test is rapid easy to perform and does not require electricity It can therefore be used at lower health care facilities or in mobile units for patients in remote settings It added that where possible the results from the rapid test should be confirmed by the more precise conventional testing  There were  new cases of Ebola in the three affected countries  Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea  last week More than  people have been infected in the outbreak and  have died Dr Ben Neuman a lecturer in virology at the University of Reading said The new test could help to quickly confirm outbreaks in remote areas without the need to send samples to a testing clinic and wait for results   The new test isnt about saving the lives of infected people but it can help in the long run by making it easier and quicker to detect Ebola outbreaks
