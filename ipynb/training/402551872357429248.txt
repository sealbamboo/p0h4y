Taking birth control pills may increase a womans risk of eye disease later in life a study finds because they may reduce protective levels of estrogen Doctors have long known that cells in the eye have estrogen receptors But in the past few years theyve started looking into whether the changes in a womans estrogen levels as she goes through life could affect her risk of   The eye disease slowly damages the optic nerve and is most common in people over  There are treatments that can slow its progression but there is no cure In this study researchers looked at data on  women over  who participated in a big   administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The women who had taken oral contraceptives for more than three years were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with glaucoma But the   of getting glaucoma after age  is small about  percent according to the CDC So doubling that risk would bring it up to a bit under  percent And theres no proof that taking   which contain hormones that keep estrogen levels from peaking midway through a womans monthly cycle cause the apparent increased risk There could be a relationship between eyesight and estrogen though Scientists have long thought that the hormone could have a protective effect on the eyes retina So it makes sense that the pill which lowers a womans total exposure to estrogen over a month could affect her eyes says   a professor of clinical ophthalmology at the University of California San Francisco and senior author of the study Birth control pills suppress cyclical spikes in womens estrogen levels Lin told Shots and over time that dampening may contribute to retinal damage Women shouldnt stop using birth control pills based on this study Lin says A lot more work needs to be done to find out if this apparent connection is real or just a coincidence But women with higher risk factors for glaucoma including AfricanAmericans and those with a family history of glaucoma should be aware Lin says If youve been using oral contraceptives for a long time that may be enough indication for you to get screened for glaucoma Glaucoma tests which measure   are fast painless and inexpensive and typically performed as part of routine adult eye exams Lins research was presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology conference Monday in New Orleans The only other large study looking into the estrogenglaucoma connection is a  publication from the Nurses Health Study It found that women who had used birth control pills for more than five years had a  percent increase in their glaucoma risk what the study authors called a modest increase The   followed almost  women over age  from  to  Though theres no way to tell if taking the pill caused the increase the authors concluded These data add further support for a role of circulating estrogen in the pathogenesis of glaucoma
