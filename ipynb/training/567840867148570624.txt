At the risk of inspiring offensive commentary from misogynists and fat haters I bring you this intriguing finding about obese women from researchers at Yale University Compared to their normalweight peers obese women  but not men  appear to have a highly specific learning deficit around the issue of food When a tasty reward is dangled before them obese womens powers of learning and decisionmaking appear to get shortcircuited in a way not seen in women of normal healthy weight or in men of any weight a   shows When it comes to maximizing a monetary payout however these same women are every bit as sharp as their thinner peers or any male peer The research published this week in the journal Current Biology may be taken by some as evidence to support the broad of the obese  and especially obese women  as stupid sad and selfdefeating a view widely held even by   who treat such patients But the studys senior author suggests instead that the perceptual impairment identified by the study is narrow indeed Take tasty food out of the equation and these obese women are as cognitively nimble as anyone else says Yale Universitys Ifat Levy Moreover adds Levy it may be possible to correct the specific cognitive weakness seen in obese women with some behavioral intervention starting with training to compensate for this specific cognitive weakness But first she notes it must be seen for what it is This finding emerged from a test of associative learning in which  subjects were shown a sequence of blue squares and purple squares and essentially asked to guess which square was more likely to yield a reward The pattern of rewards was not random On any given sequence a square of one color had a moderate likelihood of a payout while the other paid none As players discerned that pattern they could accumulate winnings Midway through the exercise researchers reversed the reward scheme and players smart enough to detect that the rules had changed could maximize their earnings When the promised stakes were monetary with dollar signs superimposed on the blue and purple squares obese women had no difficulty in accurately discerning a fixed pattern of rewards and of responding appropriately when that pattern changed They were no less mentally nimble than men were or than svelte women were And they accumulated on average equal winnings But when researchers superimposed pictures of pretzels or peanut MM candies on the squares and held out those treats as rewards for deducing the reward system the cognitive powers of women whose body mass index averaged roughly  for instance a foot woman weighing about  pounds crumbled When induced by edible treats in this game of pattern recognition normalweight women had no problem figuring out the reward system Men too  regardless of weight  quickly perceived the pattern When the researchers switched up the pattern in the middle of the game the men and the normalweight women responded nimbly When they discerned that the reward patterns had reversed they quickly shifted too But the obese women were so flummoxed when the promise of treats was dangled over them that not one of  such subjects recognized the pattern of rewards so evident to everyone else in all  subjects  men women obese and not obese  participated When the pattern of rewards was reversed these women were just as flummoxed and did not discern a change Whether the square they were shown was blue or purple if it had a little picture of MMs or pretzels on it the obese women tended to judge them all as equally likely to yield a reward Levy and her coauthors Zhihao Zhang Kirk F Manson and Daniela Schiller note that the same learning impairment is evident in nonhuman animals who are obese They caution that its not at all clear whether this distorted judgment causes obesity or whether a diet high in fat and sugar causes this distorted judgment Another possibility Obesity and a diet that constantly lights up the brains reward circuits reinforce each other causing a cycle thats hard to break Levy says it will take more research to discern that pattern and to explore what types of training or cognitive therapy might be helpful to obese women who want to overcome this learning impairment and lose weight With training would they have been different Its certainly something Id love to try said Levy an assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine
