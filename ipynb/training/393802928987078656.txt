Americans are living and working longer than ever And Medicare the health plan thats supposed to help senior citizens is facing budget problems   By  about  million people will get health care paid for by Medicare and their tab   in that year So its no surprise that the idea of raising the eligibility age for Medicare to  from  keeps getting floated as a way to trim federal spending I dont think you can look at entitlement reform without adjusting the age for retirement Republican Sen Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said late last year on   Let it float up another year or so over the next  years adjust Medicare from  to  And the Congressional Budget Office the scorekeeper for federal finances had   that raising the eligibility age to  would trim about  percent from Medicare spending over the long haul Well there is a problem it turns out Thursday the CBO said the overall savings wouldnt amount to as much as it had previously estimated Instead of saving the federal government about  billion over a decade CBO now figures its more like  billion over eight years starting in  What changed Mostly it reflects a new analysis of how much  and year olds cost Medicare To a lesser extent CBO said the federal government could be liable for more costs for those nearretirees under the federal health law The estimate is an important one according to NPRs Julie Rovner because Republicans and some Democrats have long eyed the Medicare age change as a way to pay for deficit reduction Now its a much less attractive target Thats an understatement according to health economists Aaron Carroll and Austin Frakt who blasted the idea    Writing on The Incidental Economist blog they called the change to save what amounts to less  billion a year insane Why is it so little Well once again the more people you kick out of Medicare the more you get on Medicaid they wrote That increases federal expenditures More people will also need exchange insurance too which means more people needing subsidies That will also increase federal expenditures In case you werent sure where Carroll and Frakt come out on this the title of their post bears mentioning Raising the Medicare eligibility age is now a REALLY bad idea
