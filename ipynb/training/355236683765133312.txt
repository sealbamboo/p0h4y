Researchers studied  patients hospitalized for appendicitis in  Canadian cities between  and  They used air pollution data from monitors in each city to calculate daily maximum concentrations of ozone a normal component of the earths upper atmosphere that becomes a danger when concentrated at ground level  High ozone levels were associated with an increased number of hospitalizations for appendicitis and were even more strongly associated with cases of burst appendix For each  parts per billion increase in ozone concentration the scientists found an  to  percent increase in ruptured appendix cases The study was   The associations persisted after controlling for age sex season of the year and the presence of other air pollutants like nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter The reason for the association is unclear but studies in mice have shown that air pollution can alter the animals abdominal bacteria Air pollution may increase the risk for the most dangerous type of appendicitis said the lead author Dr Gilaad G Kaplan an associate professor of medicine at the University of Calgary Perforated appendicitis is potentially fatal and that air pollution might accelerate it is information we can use in protecting our populations
