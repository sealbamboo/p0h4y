You might wonder why  million Americans get food poisoning every year yet there are some animals that seem to be immune from even the nastiest germs Were talking here about vultures which feast on rotting flesh that is chockablock with bacteria that would be deadly to human beings In fact vultures have a strong preference for that kind of food The real question is how can they actually stand eating things like this says   a professor of molecular microbial ecology at Aarhus University in Denmark Hansen started chewing over this question in a conversation with colleagues who study bacteria that form ecosystems within animal intestines Maybe they thought vultures have some helpful bacteria in their guts to help them tolerate these otherwise deadly germs They turned to   at the University of Copenhagen because he studies communities of intestinal bacteria When Lars told me about this study I was very very interested in that one Roggenbuck tells NPR I thought wow a vulture That would be very exciting Roggenbuck was working on his PhD at the time He set to work examining the guts of  turkey vultures and black vultures that had been trapped and killed near Nashville He expected to see a huge variety of bacteria in the gut as youd find inside human intestines Instead he found an ecosystem dominated by two species of bacteria both wellknown poisons fusobacteria which can cause blood infections and   which produces deadly   toxins So why didnt the vultures get sick from a gut full of nasty germs There are several possibilities Roggenbuck says They could have developed immunity to these toxins as they evolved to eat their everyday diet Also other diseasecausing germs are likely killed in the stomach before they even get into the intestine Hansen suggests He says vulture stomach acid is  to  times stronger than human stomach acid so it seems like the stomach itself is a very harsh environment Another hypothesis could be that theyre actually using the bacteria in the stomach as some sort of probiotics Hansen says By having a gut full of a few tolerable species of bacteria its possible that those would crowd out other deadly microbes Hansen Roggenbuck and their colleagues   their results Tuesday in the journal   Hansen is looking for larger lessons from this trip into the secret lives of vultures I think its mindboggling that organisms that are perceived as very bad for you seem to be very useful for other biological creatures such as the vultures he says So I think thats amazing Wildlife biologists say vultures arent alone in being resistant to botulism toxins   at the USGSs National Wildlife Health Center in Madison Wis says lots of birds seem to handle botulism spores just fine But vultures have to cope with massive amounts of deadly germs Theyre very hardy beasts I would say so Rocke says But given that theyve also suffered their share of mortality Vultures can be poisoned for example by lead or by ibuprofenlike drugs given to cattle in Asia Curiously those drugs while deadly to vultures are safe for human consumption
