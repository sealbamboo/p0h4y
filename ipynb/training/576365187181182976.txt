 tend to get up between am and am at the same time as my wife Erica a cardiac specialist respiratory physiotherapist We married in August  and now Im suddently  years old working as a Nutricia nurse in Wales Erica is a massive support and generally sends me off with a packed lunch which I have during my strategic admin stops which are also a good opportunity to absorb the breathtaking views along the arterial routes of central   I start the day just south of Chester and work through north Powys My first call is to support an older gentleman and his wife He has been recently diagnosed with motor neurone disease and has been fitted with a feeding tube Previously he was struggling with swallowing food and medicines meaning he had repeated chest infections and was losing weight rapidly Within Powys patient visits are challenging as clients often live long distances from each other in beautiful but hostile environments  x cars are a necessity not a luxury Given the rural geography its important to plan stops to remotely document clinical visits Answering phone and email messages is also high on the agenda as it is important to balance the administrative workload and provide clear and timely patient notes which are immediately uploaded to support NHS dieticians My second call of the day some  miles from the first is to attend a school where a child with enteral feeding needs is to be supported by teaching assistants and teaching staff A bespoke education package around care of enteral feeding tubes and the feeding pump is needed to allow the child to enter mainstream education Providing qualified nursing care services and continuing education to patients families and other care teams allows the patients to be cared for at home and not need to visit hospitals for clinic appointments This also reduces the burden on NHS teams My next call is to undertake a gastrostomy tube change I meet with the district nursing team who are keen to learn the skills required to safely undertake this procedure in the community Outside of work weve bought a new house so we Erica are busy deciding how we myself are going to decorate This weekend we chose tiles for the kitchen and I called on my tiling skills to try and fit them Its a clich but no two days are alike at work Similarly no two cases or sets of needs are the same which leads to individual care  and more importantly care of the individual On reflection I feel that my role supports mainstream NHS needs going above and beyond the capacity of core community nursing teams while supporting ongoing education and providing the best care to patients and carers Some weekends I also work for the Nutricia outofhours telephone support advice line and have been a GP out of hours triage nurse for the last  years I work closely with GPs and either provide telephone advice sort out home visits and GP appointments and if needed I arrange ambulances to deal with lifethreatening emergencies In my spare time I like going to the gym  the spin room is my favourite place to be My closest friend has a twoyearold girl who I adore spending time with I can probably recite the script of Frozen as I watch it with her so often My best friend and I also own a yacht moored in Penarth Marina which is a longterm restoration project And Im a bit of a tech geek so like reading up on new technology and how it supports modern life When I get home in the evening around pm I check and send emails and do any lastminute calls Bed time is usually about pm dare I say  and we like watching Criminal Minds and other whodunnits
