Every day in hospitals all over America thousands of patients die of infections that   to be curable But the antibiotics used to treat them   anymore Its called   and its largely a consequence of antibiotics overuse The more germs are exposed to antibiotics the faster they mutate to evade being vanquished To counter the growing trend the Obama administration is moving on many fronts to speed the development of new antibiotics Its   tens of millions in private drug companies to foster new germkilling drugs Its setting up a   to develop new antibiotics And most controversially federal health officials are   for new antibiotics targeted at patients with lifethreatening infections and dwindling treatment options Where were talking about lifethreatening illnesses you can do much less study and get those drugs out there  if in fact theyll be limited to those kinds of uses   the chief drug official at the Food and Drug Administration tells Shots Woodcock says the basic problem is that many large drug companies have abandoned antibiotics research and development in recent years for more profitable lines of business such as drugs for diabetes cancer and obesity The pipeline  those new drugs coming along  is drying up Woodcock says and were really worried well have resistant organisms and no medicines to treat them If drug companies could do smaller studies without necessarily having to compare patients treated with experimental drugs to others who got standard treatments Woodcock thinks that would entice companies back into the market because it would be much cheaper to gain approval Since the drugs would be intended only for certain patients  not just anybody with an infection  companies wouldnt have to study them in thousands of patients Woodcock acknowledges that some are concerned about the lower level of evidence that would be used We would still find the drugs to be safe and effective she says but we wouldnt have these massive studies that you would do when youre exposing huge numbers of people The plan has the support of the  We are potentially alarmed says   a Tufts Medical Center specialist whos on the societys board and certainly we want to get the message out that the time to act is now Boucher says major change has to come in the near term  not five years but shorter term Otherwise she says surgeons might become reluctant for instance to perform operations that inevitably carry a risk of infection We might be to the point where we have to worry about doing the procedures that all of our patients have come to expect they can have safely in America Boucher says But   of George Washington University says he thinks lowering approval standards for antibiotics would be a tragedy of monumental proportions He says if drug companies didnt have to show that candidate drugs were better and safer than existing therapies it would be like getting half the score of a football game Its like saying the Washington Redskins scored  points this week he tells Shots I dont know if they won or lost unless you tell me what the other team did too He also argues that people in desperate straits because theyre running out of antibiotic options tend to be older and sicker Those are the people that need our help the most Powers says Until  Powers was the FDAs lead medical officer for antimicrobial drug development and resistance initiatives He says the drug industry has long lobbied for loosening of drug approval standards A lot of the discussion around this has been about how to cut corners and decrease the standard by which these drugs should be approved he says If we say that were developing lifesaving new drugs then we ought to be able to show that they actually save lives Powers acknowledges that it should be possible to design smaller comparison studies to demonstrate safety and efficacy for selected groups of patients suffering from drugresistant infections But how to make sure only those patients get such drugs after approval is a problem that hasnt been solved Meanwhile Woodcock says she hopes Congress will pass legislation soon to make it easier for the FDA to approve new antibiotics
