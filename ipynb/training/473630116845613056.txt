The results of two international trials against advanced skin cancer have been hailed as exciting and striking Both treatments for advanced melanoma are designed to enable the immune system to recognise and target tumours The findings were released at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago   The experimental drugs pembrolizumab and nivolumab block the biological pathway cancers use to disguise themselves from the immune system   Advanced melanoma  skin cancer which has spread to other organs  has proved very hard to treat   Until a few years ago average survival was around six months In a trial of  patients evaluating pembrolizumab    of patients survived at least a year   The drug which used to be known as MK is also being tested against other tumour types which use the same mechanism to block attack from the immune system Dr David Chao consultant oncologist at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust is conducting trials in both melanoma and lung cancer patients  He said Pembrolizumab looks like it has potential to be a paradigm shift for cancer therapy One of his patients Warwick Steele aged  has been receiving infusions of pembrolizumab every three weeks since October Before the treatment started he could barely walk because the melanoma had spread to one of his lungs and he found it hard to breathe I got tired simply standing up and was literally too exhausted to shave  But now I feel back to normal and can do gardening and go shopping Scans of his lungs  shown above   reveal that after just three infusions the drug appears to have completely cleared the cancer from his lung The other drug nivolumab was tested in combination with an existing licensed immunotherapy ipilimumab   In a trial of  patients survival was  after one year and  after two years   John Wagstaff Prof of medical oncology at Swansea College of Medicine is part of a larger trial of these two drugs He said I am convinced that this is a breakthrough in treating melanoma   The trial is still blinded so we dont know what treatments the patients are getting but we have seen some spectacular responses Professor Peter Johnson Cancer Research UKs chief clinician said Its exciting to see the range of new treatments that are emerging for people with advanced melanoma    But doctors are urging caution  The results which have been published are of Phase I early stage trials   Much larger Phase III trials are underway involving many UK hospitals   Only when they report in about a years time can clinicians be sure what the likely benefits will be Like all drugs the experimental treatments have side effects Warwick Steele said he experienced night sweats and even had two brief blackouts when on the new drug But he said it was well worth it and doctors were now treating these symptoms
