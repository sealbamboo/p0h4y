Texting has become such a normal way to communicate that its hard to imagine that we ever used our voices to tell our better halves Hey I got the milk But when it comes to a committed relationship researchers say its better not to lean too heavily on the texts for the tough stuff Stick to I  U rather than I M sooo disappointed in you Texting terms of endearment really seems to help Affirmations like that are associated not just with a more stable and satisfying relationship but with mitigating hurts and frustrations But texting more isnt always better Women who texted their partner a lot considered the relationship more stable while men who received those texts or texted a lot themselves said they were less satisfied with the relationship That surprised us says Lori Schade a marriage and family therapist at Brigham Young University who led the study Sending more texts may be a sign of a failing relationship That might sound counterintuitive she says but it may be a way for men to back out of the relationship or at least stay out of the line of fire Maybe it was a way for then to check out or not have to show up by using their cellphone instead Schade and her colleagues surveyed  young adults from  to  All were in committed relationships more than half were either engaged or married Almost all texted their partner multiple times a day That didnt surprise Schade She sees couples in therapy and has gotten used to having one person whip out their phone to prove their partners awfulness Theyll come in and want to show me the hurtful messages A lot of time those nasty texts are sent to get the partners attention Schade thinks But it can backfire Face to face you can raise your voice she tells Shots The way to do that with texting is to be more aggressive in the language They do it quickly without a lot of thought But there may be unintended consequences Indeed real life has a lot going for it when it comes to negotiating the intricacies of a longterm relationship In texting people tend to keep responding Schade says They have time to think about it and stew about it and then respond again Its almost harder to disconnect And texts dont fade with time Its easy to create an archive of slights and scroll through them reviving the hurt So moving the discussion offline can be a good strategy Schade says especially when tackling tough issues Just slowing down is good she says You may need ways to say This is getting too heated for me I need to talk with you later about this in person  Women were more likely than men to use texting to try to manage the relationship whether to apologize work out differences or make decisions the study found But that approach was associated with poorer relationship quality too Schade says thats probably another example of work best left done face to face The   which were published online Wednesday in the  are exploratory They dont prove that the texting behavior caused relationship issues but give a first glimpse One other interesting finding Couples almost never communicate with each other on Facebook Sending lots of love or lighthearted comments tended to buffer the negatives the researchers found That warm fuzzy glow can spread far beyond the tiny screen too So for connubial bliss go for an electronic update of an old saw If you cant think of something nice to say dont text it at all
