Texas has imposed strict   on the insurance helpers or navigators who work in the community to enroll people in health plans under the Affordable Care Act The navigators must register with the state undergo a background check and fingerprinting and complete  hours of additional training  beyond the  to  hours of federal training theyve already received There are more than  navigators working across Texas and they have become a symbol of Obamacare as they fan out across neighborhoods armed with laptops and brochures Texas Republicans pushed for the requirements citing security concerns Navigators help uninsured people shop for plans and subsidies at HealthCaregov By its nature the work involves entering sensitive personal information like Social Security numbers and income information Still the final regulations are less stringent than originally proposed After pushback from Democrats and community groups that employ navigators the Texas Department of Insurance reduced the training requirement from  to  hours and dropped a  registration fee Navigators will also have until May  to complete their training That means coursework wont interfere with an expected enrollment rush before the March  deadline Texas Sen John Cornyn a Republican praised the work of the Texas Department of Insurance which released the final rules Tuesday Obamacare presents enough problems for Texans without the risk of a convicted felon handling their personal information   in a statement These are basic requirements for screening individuals hired with taxpayer money to handle sensitive consumer information and there is no excuse for the Obama Administrations failure to implement them from day one But others criticized the regulations as an attempt to block the law Its a federal program said   a Houston Democrat The state has no right to interfere with burdensome regulations Its almost similar to blocking someone from the right to vote because of the color of their skin Now youre blocking a sick person or a person that is uninsured from getting access to information Some navigators questioned the necessity of the rules and the associated image of navigators as potentially untrustworthy or unqualified Its misinformation thats being put out to the public Sometimes hysteria can be created its not legitimate says Alysia Greer a Houstonbased navigator with United Labor Unions Local  The union employs  navigators in Texas most of them around Houston and Dallas All of those navigators and many employed by other groups have already undergone background checks Cedric Anthony another navigator with the union said the rhetoric around navigators is giving a bad name to actually good people He says the additional training will be redundant and distract from the mission Were getting out in the community were outreaching and I just feel its just going to be more hours in the classroom actually learning instead of the hours we could be putting manpower on the streets getting people signed up he said The department estimated that the additional training could cost up to  per navigator The community groups will also have to obtain liability protection for their navigators such as an insurance policy or surety bond The regulations also prohibit navigators from Orell Fitzsimmons field director for United Labor Unions Local  says his navigators would never have engaged in those activities anyway If they want to challenge us thats fine he said defiantly If they want fingerprints they can have them Were not hiding anything But Fitzsimmons says he believes the regulations are a blatant and partisan attempt to hinder enrollment Its pretty clear to me that the governor wants sick people to stay sick and he doesnt want to have well care and he doesnt believe in Obamacare he says And thats fine but we do live in a democracy And the democracy back in  voted for the law Seventeen states have   regulating navigators Two states Tennessee and Missouri have already faced lawsuits over the restrictions A f  saying that states that opted to have the federal government run their exchange could not actually impose state regulations on top of the federal ones
