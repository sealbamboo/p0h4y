In addition around  million people who fall ill from TB are still being missed by health systems each year either because they are not diagnosed or because they are diagnosed but not reported the WHO said in a statement  commonly called TB is a bacterial infection that can be spread through the air The bacteria usually attack patients lungs but can also hit the kidney spine and brain Tuberculosis can be fatal according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention but it doesnt have to be  are approved to treat TB the bacteria can usually be conquered by taking a mix of medications for six to nine months  The prevalence rate of TB has fallen  since  But given the fact that most deaths from TB are preventable the death toll from the disease is still unacceptably high and efforts to combat it must be accelerated the WHO report authors write Part of the reason so many are dying from tuberculosis is that a strain of the bacteria has become resistant to treatment About  of the people who were diagnosed with TB in  had this form of the disease according to the WHO But thats only   Another reason is lack of funding the WHO says About  billion is needed each year for a full response the agency says but just over  billion is allocated  This money shortage plays into what is probably the top reason many people with tuberculosis are not being treated The majority of cases are found in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific Another quarter are found in Africa which has the highest prevalence and death rate Many people in these regions simply dont have access to quality health care  Pharmaceutical industries are less interested in diseases in developing countries where potential gains are limited said Dr Mario Raviglione director of WHOs Global Tuberculosis Programme As a result we have a problem with tuberculosis because people know that  of cases are in developing countries There are  tuberculosis vaccines being tested in clinical trials around the world according to the WHO report An effective vaccine could be a way to stop the epidemic for good
