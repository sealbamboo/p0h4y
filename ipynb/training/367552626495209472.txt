Two years after cantaloupe were linked to one of the worst foodborne  in US history lawyers have filed a fresh round of lawsuits Meanwhile farmers are trying to win back customers after their signature crop was tarred by a broad brush Only   supplied cantaloupes contaminated with the listeria bacteria that killed  people and sickened at least  more in  states in  But that farmer sold his fruit as coming from Rocky Ford Colo and the longtime family farmers there and the whole town took a huge hit The whole community is very proud of the cantaloupe The Rocky Ford high school mascot is   says   a fourth generation melon grower here very proud to be Meloneers The tainted fruit   but Rocky Ford farmers had never trademarked their local name and couldnt keep others from using it That had never been a problem until  The areas farmers have now   and theyre taking other measures to convince the public that the cantaloupe theyve built a year reputation on are safe If we wanted to keep going we figured we needed to make changes that were for the better for our industry and for the customers Hirakata says on a tour of his packing shed newly refurbished with hundreds of thousands of dollars in new equipment He shows off the melon washing station that sprays his cantaloupes with clean water and sanitizer before the fruit are sent to an enormous cooling room There the melons are rapidly chilled to further inhibit the growth of any bacteria that might have survived the bath Farmers and the state of Colorado also invested in research that found that consumers play an important role in preventing cantalouperelated outbreaks Their survey found that more than half of consumers werent washing cantaloupe at all before consuming them says Marisa Bunning a food safety researcher at Colorado State University It already looked clean and they werent going to be eating the rind It didnt occur to them to wash it she says But researchers now believe that the deadly bacteria that caused the outbreak didnt penetrate the fruit until consumers cut into it pushing listeria from the outer rind into the flesh they would eat with each pass of a knife The knife needs to be washed between cuts Bunning says just to be assured youre not causing any crosscontamination from the rind to the flesh Rocky Ford cantaloupe growers hired a public relations firm to help get that word out and to tell people about the new safety measures theyre taking to make sure that what happened at the one bad farm in  will never happen at their facilities Farmer Hirakata says he never wants to go through something like that again and not just because of the financial losses his family suffered For over a week after the outbreak was first identified he wasnt sure whether melons from his farm were making people sick It was just kind of a sicktoyourstomach feeling for that whole time a lot of sleepless nights he recalls Consumers appear to be forgiving so far Last year Rocky Ford growers sold every cantaloupe they harvested but they only planted  percent of a normal crop This year theyre planting more but still not enough to send any out of state At an urban farmers market recently several native Coloradans echoed shopper Bob Purvines sentiment about the outbreak It had us all a little paranoid he said but probably wouldnt prevent me from buying the cantaloupe when it comes time again Why Rocky Ford melons he says are the best cantaloupe ever
