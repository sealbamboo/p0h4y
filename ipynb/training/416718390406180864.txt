For decades older adults with depression anxiety and other psychological conditions have received unequal treatment under Medicare The program paid a smaller share of the bill for therapy from psychiatrists psychologists or clinical social workers than it did for medical services And Medicare imposed strict lifetime limits on stays in psychiatric hospitals although no such limits applied to medical care received in inpatient facilities There was never a good rationale for this disparity and in  Congress passed the   The law required Medicare to begin covering a larger share of the cost of outpatient mental health services in  and to phase in additional increases over time On Jan  that process will be complete and for the first time since Medicares creation seniors who seek psychological therapy will be responsible for  percent of the bill while Medicare will pay  percent the same percentage it covers for most medical services Payment kicks in once someone exhausts an annual deductible   next year  In  Medicare covered  percent of the cost of psychological treatment Last year it covered  percent The Medicare change follows   for the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act which expanded the principle of equal treatment for psychological illnesses to all forms health insurance But that law does not apply to Medicare Hopefully older adults who previously were unable to afford to see a therapist will now be more likely to do so said Andrea Callow a policy lawyer with the Center for Medicare Advocacy   But parity under Medicare remains incomplete and hurdles still stand in the way of older adults receiving services A day lifetime limit on inpatient services at psychiatric hospitals is the most notable example There is no similar cap on any other inpatient medical services provided through Medicare Its just an arbitrary cap that targets people with serious mental illnesses who need care Ms Callow said    Are mental health services covered under Medicare otherwise on equal footing with medical and surgical services And do Medicare Advantage plans  private managedcarestyle arrangements that serve more than  million elderly people  apply the same sort of controls to mental health that they do to medical and surgical services Sadly no one knows There are no analyses of this issue that Im aware of said Ron Manderscheid a leading expert on mental health care and the executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors By far the largest group of Medicare beneficiaries needing mental care have psychological conditions such as minor depression that while painful can be treated successfully and are not permanently disabling But the move toward parity may not help many of them because the law does little to remedy a lack of access to appropriately trained professionals There are a lot of mental health providers out there but very few have training to work with older adults said Dr Gary Kennedy director of the division of geriatric psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City And there is little incentive for that to change because Medicare reimbursement rates are relatively low given the amount of time providers spend with patients   A study published this month in JAMA Psychiatry reported an alarming trend a nearly  percent decline in the number of psychiatrists   between  and  Just over half of psychiatrists  percent reported being willing to take payments from Medicare in  potentially compromising care for the elderly    What is needed to bring adequate mental health care to more older adults Kimberly Williams director of the   in New York City suggests that Medicare should pay more to providers who care for psychologically troubled homebound seniors A wider range of therapists with varying levels of training should be approved to deliver services she said   And Medicare should pay for muchneeded coordination between primary care doctors and psychiatrists psychologists or social workers  something that rarely happens at present What problems have you observed with Medicares coverage of mental health And what kinds of changes do you think are necessary
