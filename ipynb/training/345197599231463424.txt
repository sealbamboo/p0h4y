During the recent   over whether to let to local competing hospital systems build rival proton beam therapy centers an obvious question was raised Why not team up I get asked one question that Ive not been able to answer and that is why dont the hospitals work together and invest together and have these types of services that would serve a lot of the hospitals said Amha Selassie the director of Washingtons health planning and development agency during a hearings on proton therapy centers Especially the District of Columbia where the distances between the facilities are not that much and that the patient population is smaller than it is in many states and the physicians know each other and the administrators know each other Neither hospital system responded to Shots requests for a comment on that option In the hearing though Medstar officials said they were competing rather than collaborating because the systems had different visions for the centers Georgetown University Hospital Medstars flagship is looking to serve the DC community Johns Hopkins aims to be an international treatment and research center the Medstar officials said Hopkins didnt comment But there are instances where hospitals do cooperate Take New York City Back in  the   which grants hospitals the right to build new buildings and services received inquiries about building proton therapy centers in the Big Apple at a cost of  million to  million each The council was aware that the science on proton therapy a hightech radiation treatment for cancer wasnt definitive It   as standard radiation treatment yet   for most patients But in the fiercely competitive hospital market of New York City that wasnt likely to dissuade major hospitals from wanting to build One hospital would get a proton center and then there would a big freefor all says Jeff Kraut chairman of the council and a senior executive at the North ShoreLIJ Health System Theres a lemming approach to the acquisition of bigticket equipment in health care he explains Once one hospital has a fancy new piece of equipment their competitors pile in too At the same time Kraut says the council asked How can you not have this capability in New York So instead of waiting for individual hospitals to apply to build proton centers the council   promising to favor collaborative approaches They ended up with just   each from a consortium of the largest health care systems in the region The winner was the New York Proton Center made up of Mount Sinai Medical Center Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center Continuum Health Partners NYU Langone Medical Center and Montefiore Medical Center and forprofit developer st Century Oncology Construction of the New York Proton Center which is expected to cost  million hasnt begun yet But Kraut says hes proud of the approach the council took As for the situation in Washington DC two centers got approval last month from Selassie and his committee to build One will be owned by  and the other by   They will be built just three miles apart in affluent neighborhoods where they will compete for patients who have private insurance They will also compete with a third facility currently under construction  miles away in downtown Baltimore which is owned by forprofit developer Advanced Particle Therapy and will be staffed with doctors from the University of Maryland next door Because it is privately owned the facility did not need the states permission to build Barbara Ormond a member of the project review committee in DC who ultimately recommended the Hopkins and MedStar proton projects both be approved expressed reservations throughout the hearing process Upon hearing of the New York City decision she says a similar approach would be a really good outcome in Washington as well Thats something that in the future the committee might want to look at Doctors at the University of Maryland say they reached out to physicians at the other hospitals to discuss a possible collaboration We have actually had discussion with physician leaderships both at MedStar and Hopkins of why not work together given the size of this facility to do this said Dr William Regine a radiation oncologist at the university And the truth is if you left it at the physician leadership level we could probably figure it out Its more the administrative leadership at MedStar and Hopkins that are positioning themselves as wanting to have these A spokesperson from Hopkins said the health system will not comment on the proton therapy center until the details of the Districts decision have been analyzed MedStar didnt respond to several requests for comment Kraut with the New York planning council says it may not be too late for DC to change course He says maybe Hopkins and Medstar will still come together and say This is crazy Lets do it together
