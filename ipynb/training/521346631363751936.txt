A carnivorous plant has inspired an invention that may turn out to be a medical lifesaver Nepenthes also known as tropical pitcher plants or monkey cups produce a   that causes unfortunate insects that climb into the plant to slide to their doom Scientists at Harvards   wondered if they could find a way to mimic that surface to solve a problem in medicine The medical problem is blood clots Whenever blood flows over an artificial surface whether its an implanted pacemaker or the tubing that blood flows through on the way to a dialysis machine theres an increased risk that a dangerous clot will form To prevent this doctors often turn to blood thinning medicines such as Coumadin But these medicines can also cause their own problems such as brain bleeds The Harvard scientists wondered if they could find a coating that would have the same properties as the nepenthes slippery surface something that could be applied to tubing or devices that come in contact with blood As they report in the journal   they tested manmade materials known as perfluorocarbons searching for one that would have the same characteristics as the nepenthes coating As luck would have it they found one called  which was already being used in medical applications The researchers tested the coating in pigs They diverted blood coming from a pigs heart through a loop of tubing before returning it the pigs blood supply They compared tubes with the new coating and without Blood flow through the coated tubes remained virtually constant over the  hours of the experiment whereas clots formed in tubing without the coating substantially slowing blood flow with time The Harvard group isnt the only one tackling the clotting problem   and   are also testing coatings that keep blood from clotting   founding director of the Wyss Institute and senior author on the   paper says he is looking for an investor or partner to further develop the substance
