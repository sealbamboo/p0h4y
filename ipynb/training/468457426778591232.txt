In heart surgery a patients own red blood cells may be a better choice than blood transfusion Transfusions of donated blood can be lifesaving but a number of studies have found it can also increase the risk of infections and other problems An alternative is collecting and reusing a patients own blood during the operation For   published online in Anesthesia  Analgesia  heart surgery patients were given only their own salvaged red blood cells while  other patients were given their own cells plus varying amounts of stored donated blood Over the next three days the researchers measured the flexibility of the cells membranes an indicator of blood cell health Those who got their own fresh red blood cells had no changes in flexibility But getting stored blood was associated with cell membrane stiffening The more donated blood patients received the longer it took for their cells to return to normal Most surgeries dont require transfusion said the senior author Dr   an associate professor of anesthesiology at Johns Hopkins University But for specific types of surgery it appears that salvaging your own blood results in a higher quality transfusion The cell salvage device costs about  but a single use costs about  compared with  for a transfusion
