The more physically active you are at age  the better your thinking tends to be when you reach middle age according to a largescale new study Encouragingly the findings also suggest that if you negligently neglected to exercise when young you can start now and still improve the health of your brain Those of us past age  are generally familiar with those first glimmerings of forgetfulness and muddled thinking We cant easily recall peoples names certain words or where we left the car keys Its what we scientists call having a CRS problem said David R Jacobs a professor of public health at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis and a coauthor of   You cant remember stuff But these slight midlife declines in thinking skills strike  some people later or less severely than others and scientists have not known why Genetics almost certainly play a role most researchers agree Yet the contribution of lifestyle and in particular of exercise habits has been unclear So recently Dr Jacobs and colleagues from universities in the United States and overseas turned to a large trove of data collected over several decades for the Cardia study The study whose name is short for Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults  began in the mids with the recruitment of thousands of men and women then ages  to   who underwent health testing to determine their cholesterol levels blood pressure and other measures Many of the volunteers also completed a treadmill run to exhaustion during which they strode at an increasingly brisk pace until they could go no farther The average time to exhaustion among these young adults was  minutes meaning that most were moderately but not tremendously fit Twentyfive years later several thousand of the original volunteers now ages  to  were asked to repeat their treadmill run Most quit much sooner now with their running times generally lasting seven minutes or less although a few ran longer in middle age than they had as relative youngsters Then the volunteers completed a battery of cognitive tests intended to measure their memory and executive function which is the ability to make speedy accurate judgments and decisions The volunteers had to remember lists of words and distinguish colors from texts so that when for example  the word yellow flashed onto a screen in green ink they would note the color not the word The participants did not undergo similar memory tests in their s The results   are both notable and sobering Those volunteers who had been the most fit as young adults who had managed to run for more than  minutes before quitting generally performed best on the cognitive tests in middle age For every additional minute that someone had been able to run as a young adult he or she could usually remember about one additional word from the lists and make one fewer mistake in distinguishing colors and texts That difference in performance obviously is slight but represents about a years worth of difference in what most scientists would consider normal brain aging Dr Jacobs said So the yearold who could remember one word more than his agematched fellows would be presumed to have the brain of a yearold a bonus that potentially could be magnified later Dr Jacobs added In other studies every additional word that someone remembered on the memory test in middle age was associated with nearly a  percent decrease in the risk of developing dementia in old age he said In essence the findings suggest that the ability to think well in middle age depends to a surprisingly large degree on your lifestyle as a young adult It looks like the roots of cognitive decline go back decades Dr Jacobs said Which would be a bummer for anyone who spent his or her early adulthood in happy heedless physical sloth if the scientists hadnt also found that those few of their volunteers who had improved their aerobic fitness in the intervening years now performed better on the cognitive tests than those whose fitness had remained about the same or declined Its a clich but it really is never too late to start exercising Dr Jacobs said if you wish to sharpen your thinking skills This study did not examine why exercise may increase brainpower But Dr Jacobs said other studies including   suggest that outofshape young people have poor cholesterol profiles and other markers of cardiovascular health that over time may contribute to the development of plaques in the blood vessels leading to the brain eventually impeding blood flow to the brain and impairing its ability to function The lesson is that people need to be moving throughout their lives Dr Jacobs said Â
