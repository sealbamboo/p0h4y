The annual headlines on AE pressures are becoming almost a winter tradition Solving this deeprooted problem extends far beyond the front door of local emergency departments AE and ambulance services are the hour frontline part of this system  and get this scrutiny as the most recognisable brand but we ignore at our peril the role that community nurses pharmacists walkin centres and   can play in delivering a sustainable and consistent urgent care service I chaired a recent   funded by Care UK and featuring contributions from clinicians policymakers and both private and notforprofit providers Our objective was to make practical recommendations for how this single and currently undervalued service might work better and more efficiently with and for the good of the whole urgent care system Outofhours care services have been subject to a series of wellintended policy false starts over the past  years New services offered patients little clarity as to where best to access urgent care outofhours The introduction of the NHS  triaging service was designed to signpost patients ensuring a seamless pathway of care In reality only  of outofhours services currently use    as their frontend and the strength of the AE brand means patients are still drawn to its doors in an emergency Recently however numbers of patients attending AE have fallen slightly and since the advent of the  service there has been a significant drop in numbers contacting GP outofhours services Through our deliberations it became clear that the NHS GP outofhours service has plenty of scope for improvement It is measured by different standards often commissioned as addon services disconnected in many respects from the medical education system facing a recruitment crisis and with poor referral links How then do we enable the system to work better together Current quality measurements and payments incentives are poorly aligned across the organisations involved in urgent and emergency care  helping create poor integration and patient experience For example in many places it is impossible to refer from outofhours directly to hospital departments  sending patients through an unnecessary spell in AE to explain their problem from scratch Those commissioning outofhours services can have a limited understanding of how the service needs to work as part of a whole system of care with growing financial pressures resulting in a race to the bottom to the detriment of quality and patient experience A possible mechanism for achieving greater consistency across the urgent care pathway would be to establish the role of a system integrator  providing strong clinical leadership ensuring that the patient journey through the system is seamless and that the system itself is held to account for the care it delivers The urgent care sector is perhaps where the prospect of realtime data sharing within the NHS could demonstrate once and for all its value to patients It has never been more technically within our grasp National IT solutions would be doomed to technical failure and would never deliver a system that worked for everyone on the ground However an agreed national standard of data collected and shared between NHS services would be desirable The NHS has started planning for sevenday services in hospitals  it is time to look at delivering hour healthcare in the community With imaginative workforce planning integrated systems and removal of perverse financial incentives and contracts many more people could get costeffective high quality medical help in or close to their homes The   calls for ideas for new locallyled NHS organisations that are more flexible There has never been a more important and opportune moment to make progress
