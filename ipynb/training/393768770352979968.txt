Strokes strike with stealth but for me it was not entirely a surprise During a physical in Milan in  the doctor listened to my heart then ordered an electrocardiogram Fair enough I reassured myself Im  years old and its no use taking anything for granted The nurse furrowed her brow as she studied the first readout then conducted a second longer EKG I put my shirt back on and returned to the doctors office I have some news for you he said You have atrial fibrillation AF for short He wrote down the two words and explained they meant an irregular beating of the hearts upper chambers Its not life threatening But it increases the risk of stroke sixfold  I was too young to have a stroke I work hour days play squash three times a week and havent missed a day of work in  years I said My family and I were days away from moving to Japan where I was to assume a big job This was no time to pause and reflect The Milan doctor prescribed  a daily dose of ascriptin to cut the risk of clotting once in Tokyo I tried an antiarrhythmia medicine to no avail My attention piqued I could now hear my hearts irregular beat as I lay my head on my pillow That must explain the dizziness when I get up at night to go to the bathroom Or the fatigue at the end of a squash match So when on a September afternoon in Tokyo my head began to spin wildly and I could hardly speak I knew what was happening After an ambulance ride to the hospital and an MRI I heard the doctor say Youve had a cerebral embolism  That would be a stroke It was a day before I could sit up in bed without vomiting Two days before I could lift myself to go to the bathroom A week before I could walk to the end of the hospital corridor pulling the IV bag with blood thinner medication behind me I added to my rudimentary Japanese Atama ga itai desu My head aches By then a nurse was wheeling me to the minitrack in physical therapy where recovering patients shuffled laps Every time I set out on the loop my quivering heart generated gyrating lines on the monitor screen that triggered an alarm It took  days before my blood was thin enough and the alarm at PT did not sound I returned to work four days after leaving the hospital and was quickly back into the swing I could thank my decent physical condition before the stroke but also the hospital care and the anticoagulant warfarin  originally rat poison  that for six years has kept my blood thin  Within weeks the numbness on the right side of my face and the difficulty swallowing dissipated I might have been normal except when I lay my head on my pillow my heart still played jazz instead of a waltz We tried a new antiarrhythmia drug Nothing We considered cardioversion  a rebooting of the heart through an electric shock Too low a rate of success I settled on an ablation a procedure in which a doctor uses a laser inserted into the heart via catheters to destroy superfluous electrical pathways  the surgical equivalent of removing extraneous spark plugs from a cars engine While there are doctors in Tokyo who perform ablations my cardiologist told me the procedure was far more common in the United States I settled on the Cleveland Clinic a pioneer in cardiac care Nineteen months after my stroke as I lay comfortably numb on an operating table in Cleveland with four catheters running from my groin into my heart I heard the sound of my pulse on the monitor shift from Miles Davis to Johann Strauss Sinus rhythm proclaimed the surgeon Not all ablations are a success But mine was  can I thank my doctor enough This procedure considered experimental only years ago could soon be the cardiac equivalent of a root canal as many millions of older people in our aging societies discover they too have atrial fibrillation My doctor advised I should continue taking warfarin as a precaution against clotting And like millions of other AF patients around the world once a month I have blood drawn from my arm to make sure it is thin enough With my heart in a healthy sinus rhythm I was able to resume my previous activities including competitive squash And after we moved back to Italy I took up running Any anxiety I might have had about long runs was assuaged by the thought  however medically unjustified  that each of my footsteps and breaths were acting as a kind of cardiac metronome synchronizing my heartbeat Reluctant to dwell on the past I latched on to the idea of a half marathon as a means to dispel any lingering doubts Many who know me  and untold others who thanks to Google had discovered an article I had written about my stroke  had relegated me to the category of survivor which begs an awkward question For how long Completing a mile race is a test of endurance for anyone I enjoyed an extra dose of motivation knowing that with every step I was putting distance between myself and that September day six years ago when a condition I had tried to ignore caught up with me
