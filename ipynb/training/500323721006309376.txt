Despite a disruptive tech glitch this past week, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is sticking with Sept. 30 as the date it will publish detailed information about how much money drug and medical-device makers pay physicians and teaching hospitals.. CMS announced today it would extend to Sept. 8 from Aug. 27 a review period for doctors and teaching hospitals to get an online preview the payment data before it goes public, in order to compensate for the 11 days the system was offline while CMS investigated a data mix-up.
