The important thing is that Meghan knew something was wrong When I met her she was  a smart wry young woman living with her mother and stepdad in Simi Valley about an hour north of Los Angeles Meghan had just started a training program to become a respiratory therapist Concerned about future job prospects she asked NPR not to use her full name Five years ago Meghans prospects werent nearly so bright At  she had been severely depressed on and off for years During the bad times shed hide out in her room making thin neat cuts with a razor on her upper arm I didnt do much of anything Meghan recalls It required too much brain power Her depression just sucked the life out of you Kathy Meghans mother recalls I had no idea what to do or where to go with it One night in  Meghans mental state took an ominous turn Driving home from her job at McDonalds she found herself fascinated by the headlights of an oncoming car I had the weird thought of you know Ive never noticed this but their headlights really look like eyes To Meghan the car seemed malicious It wanted to hurt her Kathy tried to reason with her Honey you know its a car right You know those are headlights she recalls pressing her daughter You understand that this makes no sense right I know Meghan answered But this is what I see and its scaring me In other words Meghan had insight defined in psychiatry as the ability to understand that ones unusual experiences are attributable to a mental illness What Meghan saw did not fit with what she believed She knew she was hallucinating Its the loss of insight that signals a psychotic break This can lead to several different diagnoses but in people ultimately diagnosed with schizophrenia the break signals the formal onset of the disease Typically a first psychotic break occurs in a persons late teens or early s In men the range is  to  in women  to  That first psychotic break can lead to a series of disasters social isolation hospitalization medications with sometimes disabling side effects and future psychotic episodes So what if you could intervene earlier before any of that Could you stop the process from snowballing At  Meghan hadnt had a psychotic break She still had insight That made her eligible for a new type of program taking shape in California that aims to prevent schizophrenia before it officially begins The program draws on research suggesting that schizophrenia unfolds much more slowly than might be obvious even to families You start to see a decline in their functioning says Dr Daniel Mathalon who studies brain development in the early stages of psychosis at the University of California San Francisco They were doing better in school now theyre doing worse he says Maybe they had friends but theyre starting to be more isolated Eventually these subtle behavioral shifts may take on a surreal quality A young person may hear faint whispers or hissing or see flashes of light or shadows on the periphery They lack delusional conviction explains Mathalon Theyre experiencing these things maybe theyre suspicious But theyre not sure Psychiatrists have a word for this early stage prodromal Meghan took a   developed at Yale University Medical School that identified her as possibly within the prodromal stage of psychosis That is her symptoms   be indicative of early psychosis but werent predictive She was referred to a clinic in an office park about an hour from her house called   or VIPS operated by Alamedabased   VIPS is one of a handful of programs that have sprung up in California in recent years based on a model developed in Maine by psychiatrist  McFarlane believes that psychosis can be prevented with a range of surprisingly lowtech interventions almost all of which are designed to reduce stress in the family of the young person who is starting to show symptoms McFarlane cites   done at UCLA suggesting that certain kinds of family dynamics  families that dont communicate well or are overly critical  can make things worse for a young person at risk of schizophrenia Our theory says McFarlane was that if you could identify these young people early enough you could alter some of those family patterns Then you could work with the family to start behaving not just normally but in a way that was smarter McFarlanes programs bring families in for twicemonthly multifamily group therapy sessions where participants take a nutsandbolts approach to resolving disputes at home and softening their responses to what the young person is going through We assume parents cant figure this out alone says McFarlane In some cases participants are also prescribed antipsychotic drugs especially one called   which McFarlane and others believe can stem hallucinations McFarlane himself is careful about recommending antipsychotic medications The drugs he says should be used cautiously at lower doses than would be prescribed for full psychosis and even then only in young people who arent responding to other treatments But in programs inspired by his model the drugs appear to be widely prescribed including in clients as young as  or  This fact has become a flashpoint in the conversation around schizophrenia prevention No one is harder to diagnose than a child or a teenager says Dr Allen Frances a former chair of the psychiatry department at Duke University and chair of the task force that produced the fourth revision of the  or  the standard reference for psychiatric diagnoses There are rapid developmental changes from visit to visit he says The tendency to overdiagnose is particularly problematic in teenagers Frances points to studies showing that if you take three kids all experiencing those surreal early symptoms only one will get schizophrenia So what about the other two Frances says these kids are wrongly labeled and stigmatized Their parents are terrified And in many cases they will be prescribed antipsychotic drugs which can have serious side effects and havent been studied well in children We have to be careful of any new fad in psychiatry says Frances The field has been filled with fads in the past and often we learn in retrospect that theyve done much more harm than good But what Frances calls a fad is to others a model for mental health care To see these programs in action the best place to go is California where over the past few years a handful of programs have sprung up based on McFarlanes PIER model One in San Diego is called Kickstart Like the others its paid for by a state tax on millionaires passed by voters in  that funds mental health Services  everything from homework help to family therapy and outings such as kiteflying expeditions  are offered for free Joseph Edwards Kickstarts assistant program director says for teenagers who might be developing schizophrenia just being outside with friends is a kind of therapy Theyll want to isolate says Edwards Theres sensitivity to a lot of stimulation And a lot times well see what we call daynight reversal where theyll stay up all night and go to sleep in the daytime Edwards says if a teenager is really isolating a Kickstart worker will drive to his or her house and cajole the person out Anything he says to keep them engaged with friends in school or at work At an arcade in a strip mall we meet Ashley Wood one of Kickstarts occupational therapists Wood brought her client yearold Tony here as a reward for being cooperative in therapy We arent using Tonys full name because hes a minor at the request of his parents Wood has an easy laugh and teases Tony gently to pull him out of his shell When we first met he was so quiet she says laughing Hes like Who is this chick  Nah says Tony smiling shyly I was being a jerk Tony had been getting in fights He was angry at his mom angry in school And there was something else I used to see stuff and hear stuff he tells me Like what I ask him Like  weird objects he responds When I press him for more details he shakes his head Are Tonys symptoms the beginning of schizophrenia Or just the routine weirdness of a teenage brain taking shape No one  not Wood not his therapists  can say for sure Wood says what shes teaching him will be helpful either way When hes frustrated at school or at home instead of immediately responding kind of finding a way to communicate So were trying to work on the impulse control as well Impulsive unruly prone to angry outbursts Tony sounds like a lot of yearold kids Thats one reason that last year the American Psychiatric Association   the idea of psychosis risk syndrome from the   the latest version of the manual of mental disorders The screening test is generally considered to be only  percent accurate In  a   of prodrome intervention programs called the idea of intervention in preschizophrenia inconclusive This is an experiment far before its time says Allen Frances McFarlane believes the benefits of these programs are borne out in the work done at his clinic and others based on his model In July he   the results of a twoyear study of two groups of young people at risk for or in the early stage of schizophrenia which showed better functional outcomes for those who went through treatment He and other proponents say schizophrenias early window may be too precious to miss Were running up against the limits of what we can do for patients who develop schizophrenia once it goes to chronic stages UCSFs Mathalon says I think this is a direction we have to go in but we have to do it carefully When you talk to people who have been through these programs and ask them what helped them it is not the drugs not the diagnosis Its the lasting oneonone relationships with adults who listen like Ashley Wood Tiffany Martinez an early client of Bill McFarlanes in Maine chokes up when asked to describe what she thinks helped her climb out of an incipient mental health crisis that began when she was in college To share such personal intimate details you know To have these people working so hard on it and so devoted and invested in the work Martinez now age  says its like getting a chance Just the program what the program stands for alone is hope That same relief is palpable when you talk to Meghans mom Kathy and stepfather Charlie I thought we were going to have to take care of her for the rest of her life says Kathy I thought shed forever be marginal forever be medicated I thought wed just have to get used to it Today Meghan is off all her medications Shes animated playing board games with her family excited about being back in school Her family credits the VIPS program We were blessed to have this for her Charlie says We really were It saved her life
