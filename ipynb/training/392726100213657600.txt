Of course weve been down this road before During alcohol prohibition in the s federal agents raided speakeasies and busted barrels of illegally produced and imported booze Meanwhile bootleggers made money hand over fist empowering criminals like Al Capone to turn Chicago into an urban war zone And much like with marijuana today even under alcohol prohibition most Americans who wanted a drink had no problem finding one  Today marijuana prohibition has proven itself just as disastrous a public policy failure as alcohol prohibition before it Yet despite all the obvious similarities between the two theres one key difference Marijuana is dramatically safer than alcohol   According to the Centers for Disease Control excessive alcohol use is the   In a typical year there are   in the United States most from longterm consequences like liver disease and some from acute alcohol poisoning brought on by binge drinking   Marijuana on the other hand does not cause overdose deaths and comes with far fewer longterm health consequences A   determined the annual healthrelated costs associated with alcohol are more than eight times greater per user than with marijuana And according to the   people who use marijuana are far less likely to become dependent than those who drink alcohol    Even if you dont drink alcohol can kill you Federal agencies report that    whereas those same agencies report that marijuana users   Alcohol plays a role in   As a prosecuting attorney I often had police confess to me how much they loathed arresting drunks given how often the situation escalated to violence I never fielded similar complaints about marijuana consumers  The irony is that these perverse policies are cheered on by organizations with names like Save Our Society that seem to believe chaos will somehow ensue if adults are no longer punished for using marijuana The reality is that by punishing adults who would rather use marijuana were    a more dangerous and harmful but legal drug Public policy should be geared toward reducing violence and disease not maximizing them   There is a better way Polling shows a   A growing number of states are bucking our federal governments policy of absolute marijuana prohibition and the Department of Justice recently signaled it will not challenge state laws that regulate the cultivation and sale of marijuana   By doing so we can take marijuana away from criminals and cartels and put it in the hands of licensed businesses Obviously those businesses should be subject to sensible rules ranging from where and when they can operate and who is able to invest in them to restrictions on advertising  Dont believe it could work In  Colorados medical marijuana industry exploded prompting the state to put in place the kinds of regulations Ive just outlined According to CDC data on youth drug use from  to   a time when youth marijuana use increased nationally  the     Marijuana is safer than alcohol lets treat it that way Adults who would prefer to use marijuana instead of alcohol should be free to do so Just as significant the law enforcement resources spent making those threequarters of a million arrests could instead be devoted to preventing and solving real crimes   In other words regulating marijuana would make America a safer healthier nation
