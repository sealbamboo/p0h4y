Not children anymore  but not teenagers either  yearolds are on the cusp of adolescence That gives them a unique perspective Age  is when youre most passionate and optimistic says Australian filmmaker Genevieve Bailey It was her favorite age She was the happiest then So in  Bailey set out to document the lives of yearold girls and boys around the world The project took her six years She traveled to  countries from India to Morocco to the US And she worked several jobs to pay for it all The result   a minute documentary that offers people a look at the world through the eyes of dozens of yearolds The film has been screened around the world since its debut in  It began   in US theaters this month And each childs story is different In Thailand Goh grew up near an elephant sanctuary That has made the yearold boy very compassionate toward animals Thousands of miles away in Bulgaria Giorgi wont walk past a certain point in his neighborhood because thats where children get hit by cars And in India the yearold kids at the orphanage take on adult responsibilities They look after the younger kids waking them up for school and preparing their meals Contrary to what some might think Bailey says the boys and girls at the orphanage are among the happiest kids she met I think a lot of people who live in the developed world would not think that children in orphanages were having fun she says But the kids in India were very mature in their ability to have perspective and resilience A lot of them had had very difficult early childhood experiences but I found that their sense of humility was very very strong Across the board she says maturity is measured quite differently Take Remy in France The yearold boy has profound insights on love There are three kinds he tells Bailey love for your family love for those who are always with you and finally love for people you dont know In India the kids in orphanages have largely been sheltered from global and political issues Their maturity Bailey says shines through the care they give to the younger children The children who were  were getting up early to make sure that the children who were  had their dresses on in time And the children who were  were getting up early to make sure that the yearolds had their breakfast before going to kindergarten Bailey recalls But the yearold kids all have a few things in common They all had this sense of hope and the belief that things are possible Bailey says At one point in the film she has the kids list their aspirations In the West many wanted to become actors singers or dancers For instance Osama and his friend Sahin in Sweden both want to become successful rappers I am Muslim Osama says to the camera But that makes no difference Even if I wasnt I would still rap But in poorer places kids goals were more about giving back to their communities What I found was that across the world Bailey says the kids in more developing parts of the world were interested in being nurses or teachers  It is interesting to see how influential our community and our sense of community is on these young people For the most part adults are out of the frame in   I never wanted an adult telling the kids what was right and what was wrong Bailey says When she met Siham in Morocco every man woman and donkey came out to see what was going on she says Everyone was yelling at Siham what to say to the camera Tell her your family is poor one woman yelled Tell her we dont have electricity another suggested In the end Bailey and Siham outran the adults toward the top of a mountain the filmmaker says Thats when Siham really came to life on screen singing and dancing with her friends
