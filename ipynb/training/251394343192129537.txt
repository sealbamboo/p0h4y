Most engineers build things to last But a group of mechanical and electrical engineers are working on electronics that will break down in as little as a couple of days On purpose The electronic circuits theyre developing dont crash Its more dramatic than that They dissolve in liquid Sounds a little bit crazy but circuits that work for a while then disappear could be pretty useful in medical devices implanted in the human body In a paper published in the journal   the engineers describe how they used silicon magnesium and a special type of   to create a microchip that can last for as long as needed then fade away when its job is done It will have a finite lifetime while in a wet environment says   an electrical engineer at Tufts University who coauthored the article Right now some medical implants have to be surgically removed when theyve overstayed their welcome inside the body But if these devices could instead dissolve and get flushed out through the bodys natural processes surgery could be avoided Thats one of the potential benefits for dissolvable electronics but definitely not the only one Omenetto says they says might also be used to create more environmentally friendly consumer devices like iPhones or televisions   is not a pretty waste Omenetto tells Shots Anything that could be done to use more benign materials in electronics could help At this point you might be wondering how these electronic devices could possibly function while submerged liquid and not experience catastrophic short circuiting It all boils down to   Omenetto and his colleague at Tufts   have been   for years and have used it to develop a biodegradable plasticlike material The silkbased material can be programmed to dissolve over a predetermined time period  six hours six days six months you name it Omenetto teamed up with mechanical engineer   at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign to design a magnesium and silicon circuit encased in this silkbased material The silk is watersoluble but its dissolution rate can be controlled Rogers says We used that as a protecting layer to go on top of our watersoluble electronics Once the electronics no longer need to be protected the silk starts dissolving and then the circuit goes along with it Everything dissolves Rogers says Dont expect to see dissolvable electronics in the doctors office anytime soon Omenetto estimates it could be a decade before theyre in widespread use Not only would these devices need to be tested and pass muster with the Food and Drug Administration but Omenetto says someone would also need to figure out how to mass produce these circuits in a factory People can make very nice electronic gadgets in a lab he says but thats a long way from Intel Todays   article has people in the engineering world buzzing This is a small but growing field for sure says   a professor at Carnegie Mellon University The key to taking this technology out of the lab and into the marketplace will be identifying an application first  a disease or a treatment that can benefit from this he says There are definitely applications that could benefit from this
