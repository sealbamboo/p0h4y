A former NHS boss who says he was sacked for raising patient safety concerns has asked the health secretary for an apology and a comparable job In a letter to Jeremy Hunt exUnited Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust boss Gary Walker argues he is a whistleblower whose actions have been vindicated But he says he has been blacklisted from working for the health service The Department of Health in England says it will be looking carefully at the issues raised in the letter  Gary Walkers letter says that as chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust he warned senior health officials that patients would come to harm if it was forced to comply with NHS targets  The letter sets out pointbypoint why he believes he is a whistleblower and how  in his view  this led to his dismissal and being blacklisted by the NHS  He goes on to argue that his actions were vindicated by events as evidence grew of rising death rates and a high number of safety incidents but says he was gagged by a compromise agreement which he broke two years ago Mr Walker cites  that looked into whistleblowing from the health select committee of MPs and Sir Robert Francis QC as supporting his call for an apology and practical redress He writes The practical redress you offer will need to be individual to those who raised concerns and the harm they suffered but I would expect that whistleblowers simply want an apology and a job that is comparable to the one they were forced from The letter is copied to the chief executive of NHS England Simon Stevens and shadow health secretary Andy Burnham  It also includes a full CV which he says represents a highly successful career which was ended as a result of raising concerns about patient safety and misconduct He says I continue to be blacklisted by the NHS despite a highachieving career prior to raising concerns about patient safety In response to the letter a department of health spokesperson said We want to make the NHS the safest health system in the world and creating an open and honest culture where patients and staff are listened to is vital to improving care   This government has made important changes to protect whistleblowers by outlawing gagging clauses in contracts and introducing new laws in this parliament to protect those who speak up  The department says every NHS manager and leader is to have training on how to raise concerns
