If you want a nicotine fix but you dont like the taste of tobacco youve got options  thousands of them According to a new survey of the ecigarette landscape there are more than  ecigarette brands online offering nicotine products in  flavors including graham cracker Swedish fish and absinthe That comes out to an average of  new brands and  new flavors of ejuice per month since a similar survey was done  months ago The numbers were pretty startling said Sharon Cummins of UC San Diego one of the authors of the   published this week in the journal Tobacco Control How can you even come up with  flavors Ecigarettes are batterypowered nicotine delivery systems They are not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration although thats likely to change soon The FDA has proposed rules that would ban the sale of ecigarettes to minors and require ecigarette companies to list ingredients and nicotine strength In the meantime the ecigarette market is projected to reach  billion this year The new study looked at data collected in December and January Fourteen research assistants were asked to spend several days scouring the Internet for websites that sell ecigarette products directly to consumers The names of flavors were tallied and also grouped into flavor profiles such as tobacco menthol fruit dessertcandy alcoholdrinks and snacksmeals The researchers also looked at the websites claims about ecigarettes noting whether they suggested that ecigarettes were less harmful than conventional cigarettes or cheaper than regular cigarettes or a good way to quit smoking The findings suggest a sea change in the way ecigarette companies are marketing their products Newer brands were more likely to offer a wider variety of flavors than brands that were around in  The newer companies were also less likely to make claims that ecigarettes were healthier or cheaper than traditional cigarettes It almost seems that newer brands dont want to be compared to cigarettes which are associated with the image of cancer ShuHong Zhu lead author of the study and director of the Center for Research and Interventions in Tobacco Control at UC San Diego said in a statement Though the study tells us a lot about the ecigarette market it doesnt tell us whether ecigarettes are helping smokers quit smoking or if all those flavor options will entice nonsmokers to start smoking We dont have the data to know the longterm trajectory of ecigarettes being good or bad said Cummins But she and her colleagues dont necessarily think this bevy of flavors is a bad thing for now especially if its luring smokers away from regular cigarettes with their poisonous tars and carbon monoxide If regulators clamp down on ecigarette flavors and everyone goes back to regular cigarettes that is a bad thing Cummins said
