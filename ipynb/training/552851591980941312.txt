The Food  Drug Administration citing concerns about the expanding scope of genetic tests and their marketing has told the genomic testing company andMe it must stop marketing its inhome saliva collection kit and related genomic analysis service to consumers In a letter sent Friday to andMe Alberto Gutierrez director of the FDAs office of in vitro diagnostics and radiological health asserted that andMes spit test is a medical device that is used in the diagnosis of diseases or other conditions or in curing treating mitigating or preventing disease But despite having applied in  for FDA clearance of its test the firm has failed to satisfy repeated FDA requests for data to support its submission Gutierrez wrote in a letter sent Friday to andMe We still do not have any assurance that the firm has analytically or clinically validated the Personal Genome Service for its intended uses which have expanded from the uses that the firm identified in its submissions to the FDA Gutierrez wrote andMe offers genomic analysis for some  healthrelated conditions and has said it aims to reach a million customers eager to learn about everything from ancestry to genetic variations that would blunt the effectiveness of certain drugs In recent months it has stepped up its marketing of genomic analysis services launching an advertising campaign on television The FDA has expressed particular concern over the companys marketing of services to detect the BRCA gene mutation which confers a greatly heightened risk for ovarian and breast cancers as well as tests of gene variants that affect the metabolism of certain drugs such as the bloodthinner warfarin and the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel False positives or false negatives on tests of such conditions could have consequences for the health of customers the FDA has said The FDAs concerns echo those of genetic counselors who have warned for years that unleashing commercial genomic tests on unwary consumers can lead to unwarranted anxiety as well as complacency and poor health choices as a result Its a situation of not knowing what you dont know says Rebecca Nagy current president of National Society of Genetic Counselors Youre mixing together information on things that could be lifealtering with things that could be fun to talk about around the dinner table Consumers are just not aware of some the limitations of these tests as well as some of the risks said Nagy Nagy said that genetic findings that suggest a propensity to certain complex diseases such as heart disease and diabetes can be the most fraught with possibilities for misunderstanding and incomplete answers Theyre really testing the tip of the iceberg If you get a normal result on one of these tests it doesnt mean your risk is normal said Nagy In the clinic we find people come with their test results and say they dont need to worry about conditions such as heart disease when a family history or a look at other risk factors would suggest otherwise said Nagy They may get a false sense of reassurance about a test result when in fact they need to take specific steps to lower their risk she added In a statement issued Monday the Mountain View Califbased company suggested it would comply with the FDAs demand for more information We recognize that we have not met the FDAs expectations regarding timeline and communication regarding our submission the andMe statement said Our relationship with the FDA is extremely important to us and we are committed to fully engaging with them to address their concerns
