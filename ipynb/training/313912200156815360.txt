Alzheimers disease doesnt just steal memories It takes lives The disease is now the sixth leading cause of death in the US and figures released Tuesday by the   show that deaths from the disease increased by  percent between  and  Its an epidemic its on the rise and currently there is no way to delay it prevent it or cure it says   a neuroscientist with the Alzheimers Association More than  million people in the US have the disease she says and that number could reach nearly  million by  One reason Alzheimers deaths are going up is that deaths from other causes like heart disease and prostate cancer are going down Carrillo says Were living longer she says and unfortunately age is still the greatest risk factor for Alzheimers disease There are still no effective treatments for Alzheimers and people who have the disease face a greatly increased risk of dying within  years according to an analysis by the Alzheimers Association of   If a person is living with Alzheimers disease in their s it actually doubles their mortality risk Carrillo says Its still tricky to decide when to blame Alzheimers for the death of a particular person though says   a professor of medicine at Harvard and a scientist at Hebrew Senior Life Institute for Aging Research Thats because Alzheimers patients tend to have other health problems as well she says As a result Mitchell says many death certificates still list pneumonia or some other disease as the cause of death even when the underlying problem is Alzheimers So even the statistics that show dementia increasing as a cause of death are a gross underestimate she says Because Alzheimers damages cells in the brain it often kills in ways that are indirect says Mitchell an author of   of more than  nursing home residents with advanced dementia In the early and middle stages the changes to those nerve cells mostly affect memory and behavior problems she says But as the disease progresses toward the end stage the brain changes eventually affect basic bodily functions including swallowing This seemingly simple act requires the brain to orchestrate a complex sequence of muscular contractions and that sequence often goes awry in people in the later stages of Alzheimers Mitchell says That can often lead to a lung infection if the food goes down the wrong way and that is a common cause of pneumonia she says Alzheimers and other dementias also can affect a persons balance and ability to walk which can lead to falls and injury Mitchell says And she says damage to the brain itself can cause fatal seizures But the most common causes of death in people with latestage Alzheimers are fevers and infections Mitchell says She says this is because the disease has gradually eroded the bodys defenses The body is so debilitated frail and weak at the end of dementia that some of the usual immunological and metabolic factors that can protect a healthy body from infections and fevers really become susceptible Mitchell says Yet many families of people with Alzheimers dont realize that the disease goes after the body as well as the mind Mitchell says So its important that health care professionals explain this aspect of the disease she says By understanding dementia as a terminal illness we can much better prepare and counsel families about what to expect at the end stage Mitchell says And research shows that when they fully understand what is happening she says they are less likely to request extreme measures to keep a family member alive
