The number of overweight and obese adults in the developing world has almost quadrupled to around one billion since  says a report from a UK think tank  The Overseas Development Institute said one in three people worldwide was now overweight and urged governments to do more to influence diets In the UK  of adults are classed as being overweight or obese The report predicts a huge increase in heart attacks strokes and diabetes Globally the percentage of adults who were overweight or obese  classed as having a    grew from  to  between  and   The majority of this increase was seen in the developing world particularly in countries where incomes were rising such as Egypt and Mexico The ODIs   report says this is due to changing diets and a shift from eating cereals and grains to the consumption of more fats sugar oils and animal products A total of  million people in developing countries are now classed as overweight or above with a BMI of more than  up from  million in  This compares to  million in highincome countries Over the same period the global population nearly doubled At the same time however undernourishment is still recognised to be a problem for hundreds of millions of people in the developing world particularly children Using data published in   last year the researchers looked at changing overweight and obesity rates across the regions of the world and by individual country The regions of North Africa the Middle East and Latin America saw large increases in overweight and obesity rates to a level on a par with Europe around  While North America still has the highest percentage of overweight adults at  regions such as Australasia and southern Latin America are now not far behind with  The greatest growth in overweight people occurred in south east Asia where the percentage tripled from a lower starting point of  to  Among individual countries the report found that overweight and obesity rates had almost doubled in China and Mexico and risen by a third in South Africa since  Many countries in the Middle East also had a high percentage of overweight adults One of the report authors Steve Wiggins said there were likely to be multiple reasons for the increases People with higher incomes have the ability to choose the kind of foods they want Changes in lifestyle the increasing availability of processed foods advertising media influences have all led to dietary changes He said this was particularly the case in emerging economies where a large middle class of people with rising incomes was living in urban centres and not taking much physical exercise The result he says is an explosion in overweight and obesity in the past  years which could lead to serious health implications This is because consumption of fat salt and sugar which has increased globally according to the United Nations is a significant factor in cardiovascular disease diabetes and some cancers The worlds top sugar consumers include the United States Belgium the Netherlands New Zealand Costa Rica and Mexico  To combat the rising tide of obesity Mr Wiggins recommends more concerted public health measures from governments similar to those taken to limit smoking in developed countries  He said Politicians need to be less shy about trying to influence what food ends up on our plates  The challenge is to make healthy diets viable whilst reducing the appeal of foods which carry a less certain nutritional value  The report cites the example of South Korea where efforts to preserve the countrys traditional diet have included public campaigns and largescale meal preparation training for women  Alan Dangour a reader in food and nutritional global health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said urbanisation in many parts of the world had changed peoples eating habits away from traditional healthy diets But he said obesity and undernutrition often existed side by side sometimes in the same household We need to act urgently to deal with the scandal of millions of cases of extreme hunger and undernutrition in children but we also need to think what happens if we provide lots of extra calories containing few vitamins and encourage excess consumption Clever joinedup policies are needed A spokesperson from the Department of Health said they recognised that high rates of obesity caused dangerous health conditions and were taking action We are already taking the lead in helping tackle and prevent this challenge including through the governments Responsibility Deal with industry NHS Health Checks the National Child Measurement Programme in schools and through ChangeLife  For the first time ever weve given local authorities ringfenced budgets to tackle public health issues in their local area including obesity The Department of Health also said that industry and health professionals had a role to play in helping people improve their diet and lifestyles
