For most of us smartphones can seem more a constant source of stress than a path to serenity But more and more people are using their Androids and iPhones to find inner peace Dozens of apps have sprung up in recent years promising to train users in various forms of stressmelting meditation Many promote a popular approach adapted from Buddhist meditation that is known as mindfulness  or mindfulness meditation  the nonjudgmental observation of ones breath presence and thoughts That is what Kat McKerrow of Baltimore was seeking last summer when she downloaded an iPhone app called   For about  a year it offers dozens of guided meditation modules set to soothing music and nature sounds to help with such things as anxiety creativity and sleep Users can select from an array of recorded modules and the length of time they want to meditate One minute module features the sound of ocean waves breaking on a shoreline as a narrator her voice warm and comforting instructs you to close your eyes let go of your thoughts and feel any tension melt away Understand that theres nothing to do right now  youre just being she says Whenever you catch yourself having other thoughts let them pass like clouds in the sky and simply bring your attention back to your body This is you alive and present For Ms McKerrow  the meditation app was a way of easing the stress of juggling two careers editorial director for a financial newsletter and parttime actress while raising three children Its a very deadlinedriven work life she said Im not a naturalborn relaxer It doesnt come easy to me I have a lot of nervous energy and I have a lot of neck and back tension issues Now she uses the meditation program several times a day  during lunch breaks and her daily stretching routine and before she goes onstage The app introduced about a year ago by   a San Franciscobased startup has had more than half a million downloads another   founded by a former Buddhist monk claims more than a million users  a company in Ann Arbor Mich offers two pranayama apps intended to guide users through breathing techniques Pranayama is a Sanskrit word that refers to the regulation of breathing But while meditation apps have large followings their effect on mental and physical health is hard to measure Studies on meditation in general have found that it can produce modest improvements in anxiety   and pain But that does not necessarily translate to smartphone and Internetbased meditation programs experts say Dr   an assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University and an expert on meditation says it is a skill that should be learned from an experienced teacher and apps and online programs should be seen only as ancillary tools Meditation is not something thats easy to learn he said My own view is that if you want to learn it then you should go to someone with a lot of experience who can guide you through the nuances and difficulties that a person faces when theyre trying to master their mind And then once youve learned the skill he added thats where these apps and technologies would be really helpful Much of the research on meditation has been carried out in small poorly controlled trials But in an  in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine this month Dr Goyal and colleagues sifted through thousands of studies and selected  randomized clinical trials  the gold standard in scientific research  that included  participants Many of the subjects were taught mindfulness meditation in eightweek programs which involved about two hours of weekly training and roughly  minutes of daily homework sessions The researchers found little or no evidence that meditation had any impact on things like weight gain   eating habits and sleep But they did conclude that the average person undergoing a mindfulness program could expect small to moderate improvements in symptoms of anxiety depression and pain Dr Goyal said that meditation might produce benefits by training people to recognize negative thoughts without getting flustered by them A typical person with anxiety for example might think of something stressful fixate on that thought and become increasingly anxious about it In meditation however youre taught to be able to observe that thought but to do it in a detached way so youre not reacting to it Dr Goyal said That process can reduce the chances of getting caught up in anxiety The same would go for depression and the same would go for pain For the last  years Dr Goyal has practiced   which requires a rigorous day immersion program with  hours of training with followup courses over the years An app or an online course could hardly be expected to substitute for that kind of training he said Still a few small trials suggest that users might benefit from such less ambitious programs In a   published in the journal BMJ Open in January Swedish researchers found that downloading and using a mindfulness app for eight weeks made little or no difference for people with   and anxiety But for a subgroup of people with mild or subclinical levels of depression they found surprising improvements in symptoms On average they went from roughly minimal depression to no depression at all said the lead author of the study Kien Hoa Ly of Linkoping University in Sweden For people who are not severely depressed using a mindfulness app could be a very good exercise Smartphones contribute to stress in many ways driving us to compulsively check email fire off texts and furiously tap at our screens playing Candy Crush and Angry Birds Meditation apps can at least encourage us to use our phones for something more soothing said   a researcher at Oxford and a coauthor of a   published in November suggesting that online mindfulness programs can reduce   Ms Krusche said the point of mindfulness meditation was not to empty your mind or slip into deep relaxation but to pause for a moment and pay attention to the various thoughts floating through your mind So often were so busy that we dont give ourselves a moment to stop and take stock she said The beauty of an app is that it allows people to do this wherever they happen to be  at home on a train at the office Ms Krusche uses a mindfulness app while commuting to work on the bus Smartphones are such a huge part of our lives now she said and I think to be able to use the technology in that way is quite a nice thing
