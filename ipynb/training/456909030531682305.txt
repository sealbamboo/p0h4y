Exercise not only appears to keep skin younger it may also even reverse skin aging in people who start exercising late in life according to surprising new research As many of us know from woeful experience our skin changes as the years advance resulting in wrinkles crows feet and sagging This occurs because of changes within our layers of skin After about age  most of us begin to experience a thickening of our stratum corneum the final protective outer layer of the epidermis itself the top layer of your skin The stratum corneum is the portion of the skin that you see and feel Composed mostly of dead skin cells and some collagen it gets drier flakier and denser with age At the same time the layer of skin beneath the epidermis the dermis begins to thin It loses cells and elasticity giving the skin a more translucent and often saggier appearance  These changes are independent of any skin damage from the sun They are solely the result of the passage of time  But recently researchers at McMaster University in Ontario began to wonder if such alterations were inevitable    that were bred to age prematurely had shown that a steady regimen of exercise could stave off or even undo the signs of early aging in these animals When members of this breed of mice remained sedentary they rapidly grew wizened frail ill demented and graying or bald But if they were given access to running wheels they maintained healthy brains hearts muscles reproductive organs and fur far longer than their sedentary labmates Their fur never even turned gray Of course we humans long ago swapped our fur for naked skin But if exercise could keep animals outer layer from changing with age it might the researchers speculated do the same for our skin   To test that possibility the scientists first gathered  local male and female volunteers ages  to  About half of the participants were active performing at least three hours of moderate or vigorous physical activity every week while the others were resolutely sedentary exercising for less than an hour per week Then the researchers asked each volunteer to uncover a buttock  We wanted to examine skin that had not been frequently exposed to the sun said Dr Mark Tarnopolsky a professor of pediatrics and exercise science at McMaster who oversaw the study which was presented this month at the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine annual meeting in New Orleans  The scientists biopsied skin samples from each volunteer and examined them microscopically When compared strictly by age the skin samples overall aligned with what would be expected Older volunteers generally had thicker outer layers of skin and significantly thinner inner layers  But those results shifted noticeably when the researchers further subdivided their samples by exercise habits They found that after age  the men and women who exercised frequently had markedly thinner healthier stratum corneums and thicker dermis layers in their skin Their skin was much closer in composition to that of the  and yearolds than to that of others of their age even if they were past age   But as the researchers realized other factors including diet genes and lifestyles might have influenced the differences in skin condition between the exercising and sedentary groups It was impossible to know whether exercise by itself had affected peoples skin or been incidental to lucky genetics and healthy lives So the researchers next set a group of sedentary volunteers to exercising after first obtaining skin samples from their buttocks The volunteers were aged at  or older and at the studys start had normal skin for their age They began a fairly straightforward endurance training program working out twice a week by jogging or cycling at a moderately strenuous pace equivalent to at least  percent of their maximum aerobic capacity for  minutes This continued for three months At the end of that time the researchers again biopsied the volunteers skin  But now the samples looked quite different with outer and inner layers that looked very similar to those of  to yearolds I dont want to overhype the results but really it was pretty remarkable to see said Dr Tarnopolsky himself a middleaged exerciser Under a microscope the volunteers skin looked like that of a much younger person and all that they had done differently was exercise  How exercise changes skin composition is not completely clear but in a separate portion of the study the researchers checked for alterations in the levels of certain substances created by working muscles Called myokines these substances are known to enter the bloodstream and jumpstart changes in cells far from the muscles themselves In this case the scientists found greatly augmented levels of a myokine called IL in the skin samples of volunteers after exercise Their skin samples contained almost  percent more IL after they had been exercising than at the start of the study  The researchers suspect that additional myokines and substances are also involved in the skin changes related to exercise Dr Tarnopolsky said making it unlikely that any IL pill salve or injection will ever replicate the skin benefits of a workout  Nor is there evidence that exercise reverses wrinkling and other damage from the sun some of which many of us accumulate during outdoor exercise Still Dr Tarnopolsky said it is astonishing to consider all of the intricate ways in which exercise changes our bodies including the skin beneath our shorts
