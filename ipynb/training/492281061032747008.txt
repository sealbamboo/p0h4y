An irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation is a big cause of stroke especially for people who have recently had a stroke But its not something that most people can feel Doctors test for   by hooking people up to an   machine at the office or having them wear a Holter monitor for a day or a week There are also implantable monitors to check for afib but they arent widely used Learning to take your own pulse may be as effective and a lot simpler according to German researchers They trained  older people who had had a stroke to tell the difference between a normal pulse and the fluttery abnormal rhythm of afib The training was considered a success if the people were able to correctly measure their pulse twice in a row  people aced the test for an  percent success rate To find out if the amateurs measurements actually detected afib the patients also were being continuously monitored on an electrocardiogram But they werent able to see the ECG monitor while doing the selftest It found that  of the patients had irregular heartbeats The patients who checked their own pulse rate provided reliable results  percent of the time They identified irregular rhythms  percent of the time and normal rhythms  percent of the time They incorrectly thought they had afib just  percent of the time False positives are one downside of having people selftest says Dr Bernd Kallmunzer a neurologist at Universitatsklinikum Erlangen in Germany who led the study They typically would be told to go get an ECG test But because there were only  people who thought they had afib when they didnt the number of unnecessary ECG recordings are expect to be rather low Kallmunzer said in an email Relatives also were trained to take the patients pulses and they did even better identifying irregular rhythms  percent of the time The  were published online Wednesday in the journal   Many times people dont know theyre in afib says Dr Ralph Sacco chairman of the department of neurology at the University of Miami This group is trying to propose a more simple cheap method that may work having stroke patients and their caregivers monitor pulse Theres very little downsides other than maybe the extra anxiety if you thought there was something wrong if it wasnt Sacco told Shots He can forsee the day when people would check their pulse rates the way they check their blood pressure but notes that the test will be less useful in younger people and older people not at risk of stroke People with atrial fibrillation can be given medications that substantially reduce their risk of a blood clot and stroke Want to try it yourself The American Heart Association has   Or check out this nifty  from the British Heart Foundation that also lets you hear the difference between regular and irregular heartbeats Thanks to our perspicacious readers for flagging it
