I've been curious for a while now about TRX exercises, using the straps that are suspended from above. It seems like a good workout for everyone, because it uses a person's body weight and gravity to challenge various muscles. By adjusting your position, you control the resistance for each move. And with just two straps, it seems simple. But I'll add: Simple is not necessarily easy..  Body Blast TRX class, 621 S. Spring St., .  Serious gym, lots of equipment and buff men and women showing lots of muscle. Various classes, plus nutritional guidance and a wellness spa. Music from hip-hop to Talking Heads..  Big. I was drenched by the end of the class, and climbing the stairs back to the street from the basement gym was just an early sign that my thighs had been put through their paces..  The teacher, Jennifer Wyatt, made it clear she meant business, but everyone worked at their own pace because the exercises were timed so that each person did what she could. Wyatt repeatedly stressed that form mattered more than repetitions, and she helped me when I couldn't figure out how to get into one of the positions. We switched from the straps to kettle bells..  $15; unlimited group classes with $100 monthly membership and other packages available..
