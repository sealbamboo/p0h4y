 TED Radio Hour . As the head of the MIT Media Lab Biomechatronics group, .  is building the next generation of bionic limbs, including ones that will help end disability and also extend our physical potential.. Hugh Herr is a professor at the MIT Media Lab, where he heads the Biomechatronics research group at the MIT Media Lab and co-directs the MIT Center for Extreme Bionics. He focuses on creating bionic limbs that emulate natural limbs, as well as wearable robotic devices that can augment human physicality.. In 2011, .  magazine coined Herr the "Leader of the Bionic Age" due to his work in the field of biomechatronics–technology that marries human physiology with electromechanics.. Herr's research group has developed gait-adaptive knee prostheses for amputees and ankle-foot exoskeletons. He also designed his own bionic legs, the world's first bionic foot-and-calf system, called the . .
