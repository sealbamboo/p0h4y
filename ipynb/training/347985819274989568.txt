This weekend marks  days until people can begin signing up for new health insurance coverage under the federal health care law It also marks another milestone the launch of an enormous public relations effort to find people eligible for new coverage and urge them to sign up when the time comes But like everything else about the health law even this seemingly innocuous effort has been touched by controversy Somewhere around  million Americans will be eligible to enroll in state health insurance exchanges beginning Oct  But lots of those people dont know it Earlier this spring one poll found that   werent sure whether the Affordable Care Act was still a law or not Among just those without insurance  who have the most to gain  the numbers are even more striking Our research showed  about  percent of the uninsured in the county are unaware of these opportunities says Anne Filipic president of   The nonpartisan nonprofits goal is to help educate the public about the health laws insurance opportunities  and how people can take advantage of them The group is taking a twopronged approach Filipic says On the one hand its seeking out people who are already interacting with the health care system We want to be thinking about how do we have a presence at community health centers or working with organizations that represent doctors to make sure that the word gets out she says so folks can get the information that they need But Enroll America in partnership with dozens of other groups also plans to go to community settings that dont necessarily revolve around health like churches small businesses and fairs The outreach is already paying off Filipic says she got positive feedback just this week from a farmers market in Austin Texas There were some farmers there who were really interested in the information that we had to give them she says One of the key demographics Enroll America will be reaching out to is young adults That group is considered   But its also considered the most difficult to connect with Filipic says her group plans to use social media celebrity endorsements and other triedandtrue methods to round up the under crowd But its research has also uncovered a secret weapon For young men it turns out their most trusted messenger is Mom So part of what were doing is building a program that is working to get those moms across the country the info that they need she says so that when theyre sitting at the dinner table at night they can be talking about this So far Enroll America has raised tens of millions of dollars A lot of that money has come from healthindustry backers that dont necessary love the Affordable Care Act But those groups   have a financial interest in getting more people insured says Ron Pollack executive director of the health consumer group   Insurers obviously want to have more clients and more people have health coverage thats good business for the insurance industry he says Pollack says having more people sign up for health insurance is also a good deal for hospitals They provide a lot of care for people who are uninsured and that means that the hospital does not get paid for those services he says Similarly pharmaceutical firms and drugstores also stand to benefit by having more people covered and theyre helping too As are tax preparation groups like   That might not make sense Pollack says until you think about the fact that a lot of people are going to get this help through taxcredit subsidies Aside from getting financial support Enroll America is also getting more attention  and more scrutiny with   any more money to implement the law Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius   from Republicans in Congress earlier this spring for urging companies to donate to the group Congress has said We refuse to give you more money to implement Obamacare and shes saying Well then if you wont do it Ill go outside and I will raise private money use a private organization and do it anyway  Sen Lamar Alexander RTenn said on   in May But Pollack chairman of Enroll Americas board says Sebeliuss actions were hardly scandalous This is astounding that this is a controversy he says If you look through all the different precedents of what has occurred in the past youll see that this is a common thing In particular he cited the Bush administrations   which was  and is  run by private insurers It was a publicprivate partnership that involved the Department of Health and Human Services he says The secretary played a very active role  Republican secretary of course  and the pharmaceutical industry Starting this weekend you can expect to hear not just the ongoing debate about the health law but if Enroll America has its way a lot more about how its all going to work
