Theres increasing evidence that interval training which involves alternating short bursts of harder exercise with easier recovery periods delivers more health benefits than exercising at a steady rate But if youve tried it you may have decided that exercising quite hard even for short periods of time is about as much fun as peeling off your toenails one by one At its most intense people may say its pretty aversive said   a PhD student in kinesiology at McMaster University in Hamilton Ontario While highintensity interval training is never going to feel like a stroll in the park doing intervals while listening to some favorite tunes made participants work out harder and increased their reported enjoyment according to a   by Stork and his colleagues The study published online in   took  healthy moderately active adults and taught them to do a particularly tough form of interval training  four second allout sprints on a stationary bicycle with four minutes of rest in between  both with and without a personalized playlist of selfselected songs The exercisers had higher peak and average power outputs while listening to music than when not They also reported more enjoyment with the music and that enjoyment increased over time Differences in participants feelings from very good to very bad and motivation werent statistically significant They might have been if the study had included more participants said Stork All of the participants said theyd listen to music again if they were doing this type of interval training The study is generally in line with other research in this area says   a sport and exercise psychologist at Brunel University London who studies the role of music in improving athletic performance In general   that in endurance activities like running or cycling music can make exercisers produce more power improve energy efficiency and increase enjoyment In lowerintensity exercise like walking or a Zumba class it also seems to block some of the neural messages from muscles to the brain which makes us feel like were working less hard says Karageorghis At high intensities music doesnt make the task feel easier but it can boost enjoyment nonetheless It cant influence what we feel but how we feel it he says The goal is to make an exercise bout feel more enjoyable toward the end of the session so youre more likely to do it again another day And that may be especially useful when the form of exercise is not so enjoyable Karageorghis said there might have been a larger effect seen in this study if music had been selected for exercisers based on tempo lyrics personal tastes and other factors rather than allowing exercisers to pick their own tracks Stork said future research in this vein might evaluate the influence of music on milder versions of interval training that dont require an allout effort Indeed Karageorghis warned that the type of highintensity interval training used in the study is tough by design and is unlikely to appeal to beginners or keep them engaged for the long term  even if Kelly Clarkson is singing in your ear Its more likely to attract people who already exercise and enjoy pushing themselves he said My own running playlists include plenty of  esque tunes that Id rather not admit to Okay Ill cop to EMFs   If you need some new tunes in your rotation check out NPRs
