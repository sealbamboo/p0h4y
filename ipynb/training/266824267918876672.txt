Malaria remains a huge problem in much of the world but over the past decade the number of people getting sick and dying from the disease has gone down dramatically Health workers attribute much of this progress to the widespread use of   The problem now is that resistance to these drugs is   in Southeast Asia One place where this resistance was first found is along the border between Thailand and Myanmar also known as Burma At the small Whampa health clinic on the Thai side of the Moi River Dr Aun Pyae Phyo is treating a yearold Burmese boy with severe malaria The boy had been carried to the clinic three days earlier On that day he couldnt even move his limbs the doctor says of the boy So we need to start intravenous antimalarial drugs and we also need to transfuse him with blood If the boys mother had waited even a day longer to come to the clinic the doctor says the child probably would have died But the boy responded well to an initial dose of intravenous artemisinin drugs The staff followed that with a threeday regimen of pills including artemisinin This is what these drugs have done so well around the world  a child is on the verge of death and a quick course of artemisinin brings him back to health But over the past couple of years doctors have started to see that some cases of malaria dont respond in the same way to these powerful antimalarial medications If the parasite strain inside that kid turned out to be resistant Dr Aun Pyae Phyo says shaking his head the scenario would turn out to be quite disastrous He says the boys first day at the clinic was critical If the parasite hadnt responded to the initial treatment and had continued to multiply in the boys body the infection could have been fatal So far the cracks in artemisinins armor are minor Sometimes the drugs just take longer to work But its clear that the malaria parasite is evolving shifting learning how to outwit the drugs that were designed to kill it  the head of the   which runs this clinic on the ThaiBurma border says drugresistant malaria is still the exception rather than the rule here but its a major concern Clearly its very worrying Nosten says These drugs have been very effective If artemisinins arent part of the medical staffs arsenal at this clinic there are few other options Malaria has developed resistance to most of the other major drugs thrown at it Chloroquine and Fansidar which were once leading malaria treatments are now useless against the parasite in many parts of the world The expectation among researchers is that this will also happen eventually with artemisinins Some new drugs are being developed but they probably wont be available for at least five years Nosten says public health officials should use this moment while artemisinins are still mostly effective to launch an allout war against malaria We are in a race he says Either we eliminate malaria or if we dont then we think the parasite will become more and more resistant and we wont be able to use these drugs any more  And well have almost no drug to treat it
