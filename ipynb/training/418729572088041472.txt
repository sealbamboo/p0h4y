Talking therapies have little impact on the symptoms of people with schizophrenia a study suggests on the use of cognitive behavioural therapy CBT from around the world They found CBT only had a small therapeutic effect on schizophrenic symptoms However CBT is one of the treatment options recommended in many countries including the UK The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE argues CBT is effective and recommend it for all people with the disorder  Schizophrenia is a serious mental health condition affecting around one in  people Characteristic symptoms include hallucinations and delusions as well as a lack of motivation and becoming withdrawn  NICE recommends using a combination of talking therapies  including CBT  and antipsychotic medications The study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry looked at  studies carried out over the last  years It found that CBT did have a small benefit in treating delusions and hallucinations  which is what the therapy was was originally developed to target   But the researchers said even this small effect disappeared when only studies using blind testing were taken into account  this is where researchers do not know which group of patients are receiving the therapy  Keith Laws professor of cognitive neuropsychology at the University of Hertfordshire who led the study questioned the use of CBT He said With this evidence the current government policy which mandates this treatment for all patients with schizophrenia in England and Wales needs to be reconsidered But Paul Jenkins chief executive of the charity Rethink Mental Illness said Theres a significant amount of anecdotal evidence from our members who have schizophrenia that talking therapies like CBT are an invaluable tool for helping them manage their illness and improve their quality of life We have found that CBT can help people understand and respond better to voices in their head and to hallucinations tackle the underlying causes of their condition and give them a more optimistic outlook
