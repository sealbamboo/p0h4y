Latinos who die at Los Angeles CountyUSC Medical Center are donating organs for transplantation at increasing rates according to a new study Minorities have long been less willing than whites to donate their organs a disparity widely attributed to mistrust of the medical system But among Latino patients at CountyUSC who met the medical criteria for organ donation the share who consented  either through their families or in advance through the state    climbed steadily from  in  to  in  In all  people donated organs according to the   published this week in JAMA Surgery In each year except  the consent rate among Latinos exceeded that of nonLatinos whose donation rate went up and down yeartoyear The study suggested that the trends could be related to education programs the researchers set up at churches schools and clinics in Latino neighborhoods near the medical center But it was impossible to know with any certainty because the researchers did not track where the donors lived The lead author Dr Ali Salim a trauma surgeon at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston said his team is currently collecting data from the California organ donor registry that will provide a clearer picture of whether the education campaign is responsible for the rise in Latino donation Researchers will be able to look at the number of people who have joined the organ registry over time and compare the three ZIP codes where the education campaign was implemented with a fourth ZIP code that did not get the programs Latinos make up  of the US population and as of last week  of the  people on US transplant waiting lists Last year they accounted for  of the  organ donors nationwide according to Department of Health and Human Services Twitter
