A few years ago the cartoonist Matt Freedman started having nagging pain around his ear He bought mouth guards and tried pain relievers but nothing seemed to work Slowly the pain got worse In  a bump appeared on his neck It was a slowgrowing dangerous cancer that had already spread to his lungs As Freedman entered treatment for the   he began to keep a daily journal in words and pictures Its part cartoon part personal history Each page is filled with drawings diagrams and explanations of everything from the technical details of proton therapy to the interior thoughts of the author That journal kept over  days of harrowing radiation and chemotherapy became his new book   The title comes from a phrase doctors used to describe his slow destructive cancer I think a lot of people who have this particular type of cancer  which is as I say indolent and yet relentless  live with it for a long time because it creeps up on them slowly Freedman tells NPRs Arun Rath like a slowly boiling frog You dont jump out until its a little too late Im an artist and a writer and Ive used a kind of incremental writing process and drawing process over the years to sort of accumulate material  Since Im too indolent to create in a spurt I have to be relentless and produce them over time I didnt think of it as a book or a journal to share but simply as a kind of experience  a sort of souvenir of some sort I suppose Part of what I thought was important about the book  once I started to think about it as a way to communicate experience and talk in a larger sense about what it means to go through a treatment like this  is that its not just the pictures  It was important to me that the writing be part of the page You have to actually sort of look at the letters and how they change Part of the process of  descending into the experience of being sort of deeply enmeshed in the treatment is that  I felt a sort of weird disconnect from the world in a way I didnt expect in a way I wasnt particularly proud of Things were happening big things were happening around the world and part of me just sort of almost reflexively thought Well thats not my problem now My problem is that Im sick  Everybody else is wrecking the world but Im doing my job by just growing tumors and being treated for tumors And that the healthies have just screwed everything up and Im not responsible Im doing fine I mean as one of the first doctors said this is a noncurative disease So you want to treat it like a chronic disease as much as you can The treatment for my head and neck were wonderfully effective so far nothings come back The tumors in my lungs didnt grow quite as slowly as we hoped But you know they are indolent even if they are relentless  The trick is to stay alive as long as possible and hope somebody invents something So far Im doing my end of the bargain
