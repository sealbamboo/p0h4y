Hundreds of terminally ill cancer patients face waiting weeks and months for their income support because of a new payments system a leading charity has warned Macmillan Cancer Support described the situation as appalling Government attempts to simplify the system mean payments that previously took eight to  days are now taking eight to  weeks the charity said The Department for Work and Pensions DWP questioned Macmillans figures A new system for disability benefit claimants was introduced in April For the majority of claimants Personal Independence Payments PIPs are replacing the Disability Living Allowance DLA  claimed by m people  in what ministers say is a simplification of the system But Macmillan say early indications from their advisers working in hospitals and citizens advice bureaux are that the changes have left hundreds without support Keith Boyd who was diagnosed with terminal cancer in May told the BBC the delay made him feel like a secondclass citizen Mr Boyd said he waited three months without income after applying for support  despite his doctor saying he should be a priority People were telling me I was entitled to this benefit but nobody was paying it If you had children and you were trying to survive on nothing I dont know how you would do it But a spokeswoman for the DWP said under the new PIPs terminally ill cancer patients were fasttracked and that under the previous system claimants had to fill in a page form She said there were no robust statistics to backup Macmillans claim that the change had caused delays for hundreds Macmillan arent comparing like with like as DLA and PIP are completely different benefits with different claim processes The charity has acknowledged that improvements in the system have been made since the new benefit was introduced in April and we continue to work with them to further streamline the process Macmillans director of policy and research Mike Hobday told BBC Radio s Today programme The principle of a fasttrack process for terminally ill patients is still there but the fact that the processing time has gone from eightto days to eightto weeks really is appalling He said the charity was talking to DWP officials about the delays but added there was no sign of a commitment to what the timescale should be Claims from other terminally ill patients without cancer who qualify for the enhanced PIP rate are also fasttracked and do not require a facetoface consultation the DWP says Over the next few years the government is replacing DLA for  year olds with the new PIP system
