There are evangelical Christians who believe that medical miracles are a reality writes Jolyon Jenkins  Can I put my hand on your face asks Alun Leppitt Alun is the pastor of a Pentecostal church in Southampton Hes a burly man who works as a video editor to pay the bills but his passion is curing people through the power of prayer I dont have much wrong with me apart from a nagging mouth ulcer but hes willing to give it a go  We command this mouth ulcer to go in the name of Jesus he says palm on my cheek We command any pain infection or trauma to go I dont like to disappoint Alun but I cant feel any difference He has two more attempts but theres no change  But mouth ulcers are small beer for him and hes not interested in small psychosomatic effects He and his wife Donna tell me of a woman who had a child despite having had a hysterectomy  of people with advanced cancer who suddenly become well after prayer From another healer Ian Andrew in Somerset I heard of a woman who got a new heart as a result of prayer  Literally a new heart  Yes What happened to the old one It was replaced These claims are by any standards implausible But in the world of Pentecostal healing noone worries about that In fact the more impossible the miracle and they use the term without embarrassment the better because its more effective for spreading their message  Alun and Donna Leppitt are the UK end of a worldwide fellowship of evangelical Christians called Global Awakening In countries like Mozambique and Brazil Global Awakening missionaries are converting people to Christianity with spectacular displays that claim to heal through prayer They say they cure blindness and deafness in big open air meetings  There have been attempts to measure the effect of prayer An American professor of religious studies Candy Gunther Brown did research in Mozambique Using portable audiometer equipment she found a difference between the ability to hear before and after the prayers The results were published in the peerreviewed Southern Medical Journal Whether the improvements lasted is unclear because the villagers mostly disappeared into night after the prayer session It could all just be a placebo effect  the power of suggestion rather than prayer   If you wanted to test whether prayer on its own can cure without the power of suggestion you need to ensure that the people being prayed for dont know it In  Randolph Byrd did an experiment with heart patients in San Francisco General Hospital One group was prayed for and the other wasnt The prayedfor group did better But critics suggested the results could have been achieved by chance and were sceptical about the methodology  When in another study a group of heart patients were told they were being prayed for they did worse  presumably because they worried that if God was being enlisted things must be really bad  Another study in the Journal of Reproductive Medicine seemed to show that women receiving fertility treatment were more likely to conceive if they were prayed for It was a remarkable result but then it turned out that one of the three authors of the paper denied having had anything to do with the experiment and another one was revealed as a parapsychologist who was jailed for financial fraud The paper was taken off the journals website  When you get contradictory studies like this researchers often do a metaanalysis in which they combine all the studies in an attempt to get a clearer picture The Cochrane Collaboration is a group of academics specialising in metaanalysis and a few years ago some of their people took a look at prayer studies The lead author was Leanne Roberts who was at the time an administrator with the Cochrane group but was planning to become a vicar and is now canon treasurer of Southwark Cathedral Roberts found no clear effect of prayer but was not prepared to say it was medically useless  To believers all this is by the way They are not interested in little effects that are on the border of statistical significance  they want big flashy miracles And healing isnt the half of it Global Awakening members also claim to have had gold teeth miraculously appear in their mouths to have had enormous and unaccountable gems materialise during prayer sessions and even to have raised the dead Tyler Johnson runs a ministry called the Dead Raising Team in the US He claims to have brought several people back to life He says he even persuaded the authorities in his state to issue him with an official photocard which lets him through police lines at car accident sites  Johnson appears in a new documentary film called Deadraisers which follows enthusiasts as they trail round hospitals and mortuaries trying to bring people back to life Sadly those they pray for in the film remain resolutely dead  Johnson is unwilling to provide successful case studies And in general the proof that believers cite is a bit unconvincing  for example there is an American heart surgeon who allegedly brought a heart attack patient back from the dead with prayer But he was also using a defibrillator and other doctors find the story entirely unremarkable   Alun and Donna have not had any success with dead raising either Last year Donnas brother died of a heart attack By the time they got to the mortuary he had been dead for eight hours They prayed over him for nearly an hour and although at one stage they thought they saw him move that was as good as it got  Are they discouraged Not at all says Alun Practice makes perfect adds Donna But in this country we dont often get access to dead bodies  And it takes a lot to shake Alun and Donnas faith Alun himself has serious medical problems He was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in his s has had complications major surgery and is now on a waiting list for an ileostomy He needs a miracle But so far and despite the prayer none has come
