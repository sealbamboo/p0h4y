Popular culture suggests that women lose interest in sex as they age but new research finds that those who want it keep on having it More precisely women who value sex the most are more likely to remain sexually active according to a new study of more than  midlife women conducted by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Center for Research on Healthcare Women who said sex was moderately or extremely important were three times as likely to remain active as women who said not at all said Dr Holly Thomas the womens health expert who helped design the study published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine Thomas and her colleagues studied women between the ages of  and  starting in  After four years researchers determined that  of the initial  participants were sexually active Of that group nearly  percent said sex was moderately to extremely important By the end of the study more than  percent of those who valued it most were still sexually active For a group then ranging in age from  to  active meant that they had sex at least once in the previous six months The new research didnt look at frequency but Thomas said other research shows that once a month is average for this age group Sexual contact too means different things For  percent of study participants it could mean simple touching or kissing For the other  percent Thomas said it meant something more involved A womans sex life may change over time but that doesnt necessarily mean sex isnt important or she isnt enjoying it Thomas saidThat makes sense to Bonnie Taylor  of Hood River Ore who has a doctorate in psychology a husband of  years  and what she says is a pretty darned good sex life She says the new research isnt surprising After years as a busy mom and professional she says her sex life has been liberated Oh yeah she says Theres more time And we have the house to ourselves That makes a huge difference
