Uncle Sam wants your doctor to go digital And the federal government is backing that up with money for practices that start using computerized systems for record keeping Nearly half of all physicians in America still rely on paper records for most patient care Time is running out for those who do to take advantage of federal funds to make the switch So practices like   are scrambling to get with the program Nearly  patients come through the office on a typical day Doctors and staff pop in and out of exam rooms and offices constantly carrying big stacks of manila folders holding patient charts Behind the front desk Dr Jay Kinsman stands at the practices information nerve center Therell be probably  pieces of paper come in on the fax two times three times a day he saysi with a chuckle If that goes down we might as well close He is only halfjoking The office has a backup fax machine just in case About a year ago the practice decided it was time to go to an electronic health record system or EHR Kinsman took charge of shopping for the right one He quickly felt overwhelmed Do we really need  different EHRs and  fairly widely used ones and  really big ones he asks Could we get by with one Would we do better with just one product Actually theres closer to  products out there The market exploded when the federal government started offering doctors   to buy them The government also said that those who dont go digital will face penalties in the future So all across the country doctors like Kinsman are taking sales calls His decision will affect not only his and his partners days but also their incomes When we were starting to think about this we were hearing dollar figures on the order of  per physician to purchase an EHR and install it and then lost revenue in the first two or three or four months he says Basically were planning on seeing only half as many patients a day for the first two to four weeks There are also decisions about computer hardware  laptops or tablets in the exam room Host the system on their own server or in the cloud Hire a technolgy specialist or outsource the job Vexing as all that is the practices business manager Vicky Bonato says its probably not even their biggest challenge Having everybody have a positive attitude to do it If we could all keep positive and just get through it and learn it she says if we could do that I think well be OK Not every doctor in the practice is enthusiastic about switching to electronic records Mike Spangler has been practicing medicine for  years Hes not convinced that going digital is going to make things better Its going to take a lot of time its going to decrease productivity he says And its going to be very expensive So it means kind of three strikes against it and not as many strikes for it Spangler isnt just griping Margret Amatayakul a   who has written about digital health records says the experience   Especially when people are finding that they bought a product and now are not happy with it she says It wouldnt surprise me if there would be two or three times a replacement process before things settle down for any given practice The message from the federal government is much more upbeat It says American medicine is   toward reaping the   of the digital age The White House says more than half of US doctors are now using electronic records in a   way and the Obama administrations   of health information technology says digital records will transform the practice of medicine
