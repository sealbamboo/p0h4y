Patients in England cannot rely on information on waiting times for nonemergency operations such as knee and hip replacements a watchdog says The   after reviewing  cases in seven trusts The watchdog said it was unable to discern whether this was deliberate but overall the practices concealed delays rather than overrecorded waits The government said the issue would be investigated The NAO said that the lack of reliability whatever the causes was harmful to patients because it hampered their ability to make informed choices about where to choose to have their treatment It also called into question whether the NHS was actually meeting its waitingtime targets There are more than  million referrals for elective operations each year Patients are meant to be treated within  weeks of a referral and the NHS is currently meeting its targets on this  but only just and the report noted there was growing pressure on waiting times The waits are monitored and recorded by hospitals themselves They have the power to pause the clock if a patient is unavailable for appointments for personal or social reasons The patient can also be sent back to their GP  which means the clock starts all over again  if they fail to attend appointments But the watchdog said this leeway was being applied wrongly or inconsistently Of the  orthopaedic cases reviewed the watchdog found that more than half were not supported by documented evidence or were incorrectly recorded  The NAO also highlighted other cases that were brought to its attention during the review These included North West London Hospitals Trust failing to record the waiting times of  of its inpatients while Barnet and Chase Farm failed to properly monitor more than  patients The problems have now been rectified There is also the wellpublicised case of   The report urged NHS England to apply greater scrutiny to waitingtime statistics to establish what was really happening NAO head Amyas Morse said Performance information should be reliable  However we have found significant errors and inconsistencies in how trusts record waiting times masking a good deal of variation between trusts in actual waiting times Katherine Murphy of the Patients Association said the findings were concerning accusing the NHS of deliberately manipulating the figures The care and welfare of patients must always come first and managers efforts to try and fudge their figures to meet targets will inevitably divert attention from providing highquality care for the patients Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said What this report reveals is real huge questions now over what we are being told by the government about the NHS and waiting times   Ill be writing to Jeremy Hunt today to say there must be an urgent review into NHS waiting time statistics so that the public can have confidence in them NHS England said action would be taken We firmly believe it is essential to have accurate information provided in a timely way to ensure better care for patients said NHS Englands director of policy and strategy Bill McCarthy A spokeswoman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Its crucial that reporting is always accurate and we will work with the NHS to make sure hospital staff get the support they need to get this right
