When an Ebola outbreak lasts for months and continues to show up in new cities health officials take notice Thats exactly whats happening in West Africa An outbreak that started in Guinea last February has surged in the past few weeks Its now the deadliest outbreak since the virus was first detected in  More than  cases have been reported in three West African countries and the death toll has risen to  the World Health Organization   Wednesday Thats up from  cases reported two weeks ago a  percent spike There are many villages in the eastern part of Sierra Leone that are basically devastated virologist   of Tulane University   NPRs Jason Beaubien We walked into one village  and we found  corpses One house with seven people all in one family were dead Its a very serious situation there adds Garry who just returned to the US from West Africa This is about as bad as it an Ebola outbreak gets Ebola often kills around twothirds of the people it infects And it kills quickly sometimes within days sometimes within weeks That actually makes outbreaks relatively easy to stop says   of the University of Texas Medical Branch Typically an outbreak starts in Central Africa Geisbert says The WHO goes in and quarantines the area and within a few months theyve contained the outbreak But the pattern is different in West Africa Geisbert says The virus continues to pop up in new locations It has swept through Guinea jumped across the border into Sierra Leone and most recently   seven people in Liberias capital    a dense metropolitan area with nearly a million people Why has Ebola been so hard to stop in West Africa No one is sure Geisbert says But there are probably several issues This is the first outbreak in this part of Africa The region isnt as wellequipped to handle Ebola as Central Africa where the virus is more common Health officials still dont know how people are getting sick In the past people have caught Ebola from eating monkey meat or from bat bites Then the virus spreads from person to person through bodily fluids Travel has become easier and easier in West Africa over the past few decades So persontoperson transmission is a major concern
