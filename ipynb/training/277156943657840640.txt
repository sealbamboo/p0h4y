This years unusually early flu season is continuing to intensify federal health officials say The number of states now reporting widespread flu activity doubled to eight in the past week according to the latest   from the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Last week Alaska Mississippi New York and South Carolina were reporting widespread flu Now Alabama North Carolina Ohio and Rhode Island have joined the list The number of people being hospitalized because of the flu is slightly higher than usual for this time of year Thats a reflection of the fact that the season started so early In fact aside from the   this is the earliest flu season since the  season according to the CDC And that year turned out to be one of the worst especially for kids Three more babies have died from the flu in the past week the CDC says bringing the total number of children who have succumbed to the flu so far this year to five One big difference between this year and the  season is that so far the vaccine appears to be a very good match for the strains of flu that are circulating most widely Thats important because one of the reasons officials are concerned is that one of the strains is similar to the  strain that caused so much illness and so many deaths
