I really could die happy if I was allowed just one more bite of caramel cake she said with a sigh The woman was dying of cancer and I was her chaplain I dont suppose you have any No sorry But why are you supposed to hate your body Well Kerry she looked incredulous that I even asked and laughed Because Im fat  She ran her soft hands over her ponderous breasts and her mounding cancerridden belly She spilled over the sides of her recliner Ive known that since I was little She examined the crocheted blanket on her lap   Everyone told me  my family my school my church When I got older magazines and salesgirls and boyfriends told me even if they didnt say so out loud The worlds been telling me for  years that my body is bad First for being female then for being fat and then for being sick   She looked up and this time tears trembled along her bottom eyelids  But the one thing I never did understand is why does everyone else want me to hate my body What does it matter to them There are many regrets and unfulfilled wishes that patients   in the months before they die But the stories about the time they waste hating their bodies abusing it or letting it be abused  the years people spend not appreciating their body until they are close to leaving it  are some of the saddest Because unlike the foolish or bestintentioned mishaps the terrible accidents the slipups that irrevocably change a life this regret is not a tragic mistake Its intentional Its something other people teach them to feel about their bodies its something other people want them to believe   Sometimes its based on their allegedly unattractive physical features They might be ashamed of their weight their body hair their thin lips or droopy eyes   But this body hatred can also come from a religious belief about the sinfulness of their bodies It isnt always the media and peer pressure that create this shame sometimes it comes from a pastor or Sunday school teacher or lessons at home that begin at birth and seep in along with mothers milk Some women grow up thinking that their very existence in a body that might be sexually attractive to someone else is cause for shame  that their bodies make bad things happen just by existing   Either way the result of the messages is the same They lived their lives thinking their bodies were something to tolerate at best something to criticize to despise at worst  a problem they could never correct Too often its only as a patient realizes that he or she will lose their body that they finally appreciate how truly wonderful it is   I am going to miss this body so much a different patient many decades younger told me   She held her hands up in the dim light that seeped through the sunshade on the window  She stared at them as though she had never seen them before   Id never admit it to my husband and kids but more than anything else its my own body Ill miss most of all This body that danced and ate and swam and had sex and made babies Its amazing to think about it This body actually made my children It carried me through this world She put her hands down   And Im going to have to leave it I dont have a choice And to think I spent all those years criticizing how it looked and never noticing how good it felt  until now when it never feels good   It isnt just health that they wish they had appreciated Its the very experience of being in a body something you likely take for granted until faced with the reality that you wont have a body soon No matter what you believe happens after death be it an afterlife reincarnation or nothing at all the fact remains You will no longer be able to experience this world in this body ever again  People who are dying face that reality every day So they talk about their favorite memories of their bodies About how the apples they stole from the orchard on the way home from school tasted and how their legs and lungs burned as they ran away The feel of the water the first time they went skinnydipping The smell of their babies heads The breeze on their skin the first time they made love outside    And dancing Ive heard so many stories about dancing USO dances during World War II shagging at South Carolina beach houses long exuberant nights dancing at roadhouses and discos and barns I cant count the number of times people  more men than women  have closed their eyes and said If I had only known I would have danced more While these wishes and regrets are sad for each individual they raise questions about how we all live our lives  What does it mean that so many voices out there insist that the body is something to despise because it is too fat sinful ugly sexual old or brown That we teach each other in thousands of blatant and quiet ways to think we are shameful That our bodies are something to be overcome beaten into submission or to be despised  How do these voices telling us that we are supposed to hate our bodies affect our notions of how we care for the sick disabled elderly children mothers soldiers workers immigrants men and women What we believe about our bodies affects how we treat other bodies and how we treat each others bodies is how we treat each other You know what Kerry my cakeloving patient asked as she ran the sleeve of her nightgown across her eyes Even though I was fat even though I got pregnant when I was wasnt married even though Ive had this cancer for  years and I havent had any hair in years  I dont hate my body They were wrong and they always have been   I thought I was going to die for so long I figured it out And thats why Ive been happy anyway I just need to figure out how to get some caramel cake into the house
