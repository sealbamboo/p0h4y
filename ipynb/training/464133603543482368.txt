For possibly billions of years the DNA blueprints for life on Earth have been written with just four genetic letters  A T G and C On Wednesday scientists announced that that they added two more In a paper published in the journal Nature bioengineers at Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla said they had successfully inserted two synthetic molecules into the genome of an   bacterium which survived and passed on the new genetic material In addition to the naturally occurring nucleotides adenine thymine guanine and cytosine which form the rungs of DNAs doublehelix structure the bacterium carried two more basepair partners which study authors have dubbed dSICS and dNaM For more than a decade scientists have been experimenting with socalled unnatural base pairs or UBPs saying they may hold the key to new antibiotics future cancer drugs improved vaccines nanomaterials and other innovations Until now however those experiments have all been conducted in test tubes These unnatural base pairs have worked beautifully in vitro but the big challenge has been to get them working in the much more complex environment of a living cell lead study author Denis Malyshev a molecular and chemical biologist at Scripps said in a prepared statement The new genetic material did not appear to be toxic to the bacteria and it only remains in the organisms genome under specific lab conditions In a natural environment the molecules  nucleoside triphosphates Â  degrade and disappear in a day or two Once they disappear the bacterium reverts back to its natural base pair arrangement Still experts said insertion of the synthetic materials into   genome was a milestone This definitely is a significant achievement said Ross Thyer a synthetic biologist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the research What Im most excited about is how this will help us answer some bigger evolutionary questions Why has life settled on a specific set of bases Malyshev and colleagues went about creating the semisynthetic bacterium by genetically engineering a stretch of ringlike DNA known as a plasmid The engineered plasmid contained   usual complement of coordinated AT G and C nucleotides as well as two manmade molecules which join to form a new rung on the DNA ladder But the task of getting bacteria to maintain those molecules in their DNA was far more difficult Like all genetic material the new molecules degrade over time Although cells routinely repair their naturally occurring nucleotides with materials on hand the   have no means of producing the foreign synthetic materials If this manmade genetic material was to survive within the bacteria and be passed on during reproduction the studys authors reasoned that they would have to surround the cells with a solution containing the new material They would also have to create a doorway through which the synthetic molecules could enter the cell To create this portal study authors engineered an   strain that expressed an algal nucleotide triphosphate transporter NTT protein which would recognize the necessary molecules in a surrounding medium and escort them into the cell This was the big breakthrough for us Malyshev said Once those conditions were met the semisynthetic bacteria survived and appeared to reproduce without a notable growth burden authors wrote Also the cell did not attack and remove the foreign material Thus the resulting bacterium is the first organism to propagate stably an expanded genetic alphabet authors wrote The next step for synthetic biologists will be to give experimental cells a reason to want to keep the synthetic genetic coding Right now if theyre gradually lost the cells dont care Thyer said So one of the next big challenges is to engineer the cells to become dependent on these unnatural bases We need to give them some function that provides a significant benefit to the cells
