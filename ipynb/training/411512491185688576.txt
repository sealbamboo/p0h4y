But Eric Boyles who lost his wife and daughter in the crash said on CNNs Anderson Cooper  There are absolutely no consequences for what occurred that day The primary message has to absolutely be that money and privilege cant buy justice in this country Is affluenza real Or is it a way for coddled children and adolescents to evade consequences for their actions Not surprisingly affluenza does not appear in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM the psychiatric Bible But the term highlights the issue of parents particularly uppermiddleclass ones who not only refuse to discipline their children but may protest the efforts of others  school officials law enforcement and the courts  who attempt to do so said Suniya Luthar a professor of psychology at Arizona State University There are families where very very few limits are set at a time when they should be she said By age  she noted its too late The horse is out of the barn The diagnosis for youths in such situations would be impulse control problems said Atlanta psychologist Mary Gresham  and impulse control problems are seen across all socioeconomic levels in families where limits arent set We dont know if the rates of poor limitsetting are higher in affluent families or not Gresham said noting that there has not been a lot of research  Luthar says she has studied wealthier families however and weve found the level of serious adjustment problems ranging from depression anxiety delinquency substance abuse higher among kids of uppermiddleclass families She says in one of her studies her team gave youths several different scenarios ranging from minor to serious infractions  such as being caught for the third time with vodka at school or plagiarizing on a test  and asked them how likely their parents would be to protest any punishment for them There was definitely a subgroup of kids that said My parents would object to punishment from school officials  she said However she points out that this is not the norm Its a small group of parents but very vocal aggressive entitled  There is definitely a small subgroup that is powerful and way off the charts I wouldnt say theres worse parenting in affluent families and fewer limits set Gresham said Thats not true But in wealthy families Gresham said kids without limits have a lot more resources to use for their impulsive behavior They have a lot more money and a lot more access to powerful cars that are fast to drugs and alcohol because those things cost money So the extra resources that you have to live out your impulse control problems really create a problem Both she and Luthar pointed out that affluent families also have the means to afford things like quality defense attorneys and treatment for their children And says Gresham children in affluent families may not have jobs and may have more free time The day of the crash Boyles wife Hollie and daughter Shelby had left their home to help Breanna Mitchell whose SUV had a flat tire Youth pastor Brian Jennings also stopped to help All four died when Couchs pickup plowed into them The vehicle also struck a parked car which slid into another vehicle coming the opposite way Two people riding in the bed of Couchs pickup sustained severe injuries Earlier that day Couch and some friends had stolen beer from a local Walmart Three hours after the crash Couchs blood alcohol level was  three times the legal limit for someone of legal drinking age according to prosecutors  There are ways in a society that we collectively shape the behavior of our kids meaning parents school officials and law enforcement Luthar says If you find the parents are not imposing limits themselves but fighting consequences  then obviously the child is going to continue whatever she said You keep upping the ante And unless a child faces consequences their actions are likely to mushroom It really speaks to the importance of attending to our childrens behavior early on she said In all cases it is the duty of us  to step in and do the right thing Its not just loving our kids but putting the appropriate limits on their behavior Gresham says she understands why Couchs sentencing left some outraged but agrees with the judge that he should be in treatment I can understand how people would be angry if yearolds from less affluent families are sentenced to juvenile detention and not treatment she said All teenagers who act out should actually have access to therapeutic resources although not all of them do Luthar says she doesnt like to blame children for their actions But on affluenza she notes If you have a child who grew up in the inner city and the parents abused crack and the child was abused all along and grew up at the age of  and ran over four people how likely is it the public or culture would say You must understand what the child did was a result of his upbringing It is hard to justify such vastly different approaches taken toward innercity children versus those in affluence
