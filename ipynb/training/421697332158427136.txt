Death seems one of lifes few certainties but the cases of a girl and a young woman who are being kept on life support even though they are legally dead show how difficult it still can be to agree on the end of life In Oakland Calif the family of yearold   waged a legal battle to override at least three neurologists who said that the child died when her brain lost all function after complications from a tonsillectomy Though a coroner has issued an official death certificate for her Jahis family won the right to keep their child on a ventilator The husband and parents of yearold   in Fort Worth Texas were ready to accept their loss when doctors declared her brain dead after a suspected brain embolism But Munoz was  weeks pregnant when she was afflicted Because of that the hospital has refused to remove her from a ventilator despite her loved ones wishes Both cases run counter to a   that has been used for decades with rare exceptions If a person experiences the irreversible cessation of all functions of the brain he or she is considered legally dead Whats confusing is that someone who is brain dead can look and feel alive  they can keep breathing with the help of a ventilator and their hearts can keep beating Given the right treatment many of their bodily functions can stay intact for weeks and months after they are considered medically and legally dead Many people confuse brain death with coma vegetative state or other disorders of consciousness says   a neurologist who directs the clinical ethics program at the DartmouthHitchcock Medical Center and serves on the World Health Organization committee on standards for death determination In a coma or vegetative state a person is alive Bernat tells Shots In both cases theres evidence of neurological function  patients can usually breathe on their own their reflexes might still be intact and they might respond to outside stimuli In brain death there is zero brain function Bernat says Doctors use a slew of different tests to determine if a person is brain dead They test reflexes and see if the patient tries to breathe when carbon dioxide levels in the blood increase If the patient shows no signs of brain function throughout these tests they are officially brain dead A braindead person can never recover Bernat says The best doctors can do at that point is to offer compassion That might mean keeping the patient on a ventilator until the family says its goodbyes It might also mean suggesting that the family donate their loved ones organs to save someone elses life Bernat says Studies have shown that this is something that can create some good out of an otherwise tragic situation Indeed explaining the situation to family members can be the biggest challenge for doctors says   who heads the bioethics division at New York University Langone Medical Center I think some of the difficulty in medicine is not uncertainty about brain death or when death comes its about how to manage it Caplan tells Shots While hospitals should give families time to say goodbye Caplan says they also shouldnt keep these patients on ventilators indefinitely In McMaths case Caplan says I think doctors or nurses or facilities who  keep dealing with this body to keep maintaining the appearance of life they really ought to be investigated because theyre not acting in an ethical manner Theyre not letting the family come to an acceptance of what has happened Media coverage of brain death can cloud public understanding Caplan says Ive seen headlines that have said Little girl brain dead now pronounced dead  he says That gives the suggestion that maybe brain death isnt death And beyond legal and medical definitions life and death are rarely simple or clearcut Just ask any poet or philosopher The fight over what it means to be dead is essentially a philosophical or religious fight says   a professor of medical ethics at Georgetown Universitys Kennedy Institute of Ethics In many ways he says its the abortion question at the other end of life To reflect that two states New York and   allow doctors and hospitals take into account families religious and moral views in determining death At least in New Jersey there can be living people with dead brains Veatch tells Shots A coroner can choose to hold off on declaring that a braindead person is dead if the family objects to that definition of death for religious reasons In effect Veatch says as long as the family members are able to pay to keep a braindead relative on the ventilator legally they can do so for as long as theyd like There are three main schools of thought on death Veatch says Theres the commonly accepted view that a person is dead when all brain functions cease But theres also the view that a person is only dead after their heart stops beating Thats the view held by many Orthodox Jews and Native Americans as well as some Catholics and fundamental Protestants Veatch says And theres a third variation While most definitions of brain death mean that all parts of a persons brain are out of commission Veatch and some others believe that a person can be brain dead even if certain minor functions of the brain remain For example if a patient shows a gag reflex but no other signs of life they should be considered brain dead Though most laws and medical practices are based on the definition that equates total loss of brain function to death Veatch says Theres nothing illogical or unscientific about choosing either of the other two groups of concepts of death It makes sense to let families choose between the three definitions he says I dont see any reason why we will ever have unanimous agreement on that question
