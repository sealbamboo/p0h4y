We talk about some grim stuff in this space so when a bit of good news surfaces about aging we want to celebrate And this   does sound promising Researchers there compared two groups of nonagenarians born  years apart and found that not only did those born in  live longer than those born in  but they also scored   The new generation of very old people in Denmark is functioning at a much higher level said Dr Kaare Christensen lead author of the new study and an epidemiologist at the University of Southern Denmark You can see why this deserves two cheers though maybe not three Scientists here and elsewhere continue to ponder the impact of our extended lifespans Do we rejoice because people over age  represent the fastestgrowing segment of the American population Or fret because longer lives frequently also mean years of illness and disability with an increasing risk of dementia We would all fret less if the characteristics of age began to change so that  really was the new  In these two cohorts drawn from everyone born in that year and still living in Denmark and tested in  and in  that appears to have happened The chance of surviving to age  was nearly a third higher among those born in  compared with the  group But those old people didnt reflect fears that more years mean more sickness or disability Even though they were two years older at the time of testing the laterborn subjects got significantly higher scores on two types of cognitive tests and the proportion who got the highest scores nearly doubled to  percent from  percent They also scored better on a scale that measured their mobility though tests showed no difference in physical strength or speed Why would yearold Danes born in  do better than yearolds born in  especially if they were older when they were tested Education has a known association with cognitive ability but it didnt play a major role in these differences Dr Christensen said Nor did some major historical event  a famine say or two World Wars  provide an explanation Instead he said the later cohort had a lot of things on their side that we cant disentangle like better diet and living conditions improved medical care a stronger economy more stimulation from sources like radio and television And though they were not physically more robust they reported less difficulty in getting around possibly because of better adaptive equipment They benefited Dr Christensen said from a better head and a better environment Another study appearing in the The Lancet found that in England and Wales dementia rates in a sample of those over age  had dropped by a quarter over the past two decades If we use todays yearolds to forecast future care needs we might be unduly pessimistic Dr Christensen said Its possible to increase the number of people who live to very old ages and at the same time have them function better Didnt I just post a few days ago about pervasive disability in the elderly about rates rising with age until   I did and both these findings can be true The University of California San Francisco study I cited used federal data to examine the final two years of life in people over age  And it didnt include dementia which surely would have increased the proportion of people unable to function independently By focusing on people healthy enough to survive into their s the Danish study eliminated the many people with chronic diseases and disabilities who had already died at younger ages More importantly when you look more closely at the data the elderly Danes were contending with their share of health problems and dependence as Dr Christensen acknowledged Were not saying that at  youre as fresh as a young person he said Its still a challenge to be  Of the nearly  people in the later cohort for instance about  percent demonstrated mild to severe dementia scoring below normal on cognitive tests In fact  percent of both groups were too mentally or physically disabled to participate so the researchers interviewed a proxy like a family member About half the people in both groups were living in some sort of care facility They werent Superdanes And how to calculate the role of the country itself with its Scandinavianstyle welfare system Its not Wonderland Dr Christensen said but he noted that these seniors had known nearly lifelong national health care pensions that helped them avoid poverty and subsidized housing and nursing care Maybe the bottom lineÂ  is that wed do better if we moved to Denmark Nor do we know if these improvements will continue for those born in  or  What the Danish and English studies do show though is that the phase of life we label old age can get better over time even for the very old That the environment has an impact and the environment can change That as Dr Christensen said we are moving in the right direction A better head and a better environment Yes we can applaud that
