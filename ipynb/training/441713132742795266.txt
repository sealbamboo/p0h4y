Getting Latinos to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act is seen as critical to the laws success The Latino population is disproportionately uninsured and relatively young but enrollment hasnt been going well This in part explains President Obamas appearance Thursday at a townhallstyle event hosted by the nations two largest Spanishlanguage television networks Univision and Telemundo The tough questions he got only scratch the surface The televised town hall was conducted entirely in Spanish Obama wore an earpiece so he could hear the questions translated into English and a voiceover broadcast the presidents answers in Spanish As the questions came some of the challenges the president and his administration face in selling the health care law were brought into focus There was a question on video from a woman in California who is undocumented but who has children who are citizens Shes worried that by signing her children up for health insurance shell open herself up to deportation Obama tried to be reassuring None of the information that is provided in order for you to obtain health insurance is in any way transferred to immigration services he said But followup questions indicated theres still a lack of trust On the question of cost Obama was asked if the Affordable Care Act is really affordable For a lot of people its going to less than  a month which people can afford In some cases for young people it may be as little as  or  or  a month If that makes sense to you then take advantage of this now Obama said But that argument may not resonate with many Latinos Amelia Goldsmith is a health care navigator at the   in Richmond Va A couple of weeks ago she was helping a Spanishspeaking woman find insurance that would on its face seem like a bargain  a month with a  deductible This woman was saying So I need to pay this amount every single month and then I need to pay this amount in order to get assistance as well  Goldsmith recalled She said this woman  and a number of people who shes worked with in recent months  simply didnt understand the language of copays and deductibles The woman got medical care at a free community health clinic and had never dealt with insurance before Explaining Yes that is something that you would need to do was something that really didnt make sense for her in her personal situation since she has a card to get free medical assistance because she is uninsured Goldsmith said The fact that outreach campaigns hadnt accounted for this is just one symptom of what some say has been a   For instance the Spanishlanguage version of   wasnt available until December And it was just a poorly translated version of the English website says Gabriel Sanchez the director of research for   I think theyve cast a very wide net and hoped along the way Latinos specifically would get on board he said But they really havent done things really culturally sensitive and directed particularly at the Latino population Instead of starting with what would resonate with Latinos outreach campaigns were developed in English for Englishspeaking audiences and then translated political consultant Fernand Amandi says It didnt work Its not just a health insurance need its an economic need Amandi said And the fact that there is something within reach yet it is in this case explicitly being lost in translation is I think a great tragedy This years open enrollment period is set to end March  which means there isnt much time to adjust the pitch
