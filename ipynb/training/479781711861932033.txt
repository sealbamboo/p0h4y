Our patient was never going to wake up He had an unrecoverable brain injury The prognosis had become clear over time As the patients attending physician in the intensive care unit I arranged a meeting with his sister the only visitor wed seen for days and explained She was resolute Hell wake up she said Hes a fighter Do everything you can to keep him alive The next day I told the social worker what the patients sister had said What about the wife the social worker asked  That was the first Id heard of a wife A spouse is the official next of kin No decision should ever be made without the spouse But I hadnt known she existed I discovered that she visited the patient after her work shift usually at  pm By that hour our team was gone The doctors on night duty were on for emergencies not conversation And so she was invisible to us How could we have missed this most basic and vital piece of information Its easier than you might think The sister didnt get along with the wife and apparently wasnt moved to tell us of her existence The social worker had been out sick and his replacement assumed that we knew And we had a concerned sibling at the bedside who fulfilled our mental checkbox for who makes an acceptable surrogate decisionmaker We hastily called a meeting with the wife She arranged to leave work early and she met us in our conference room Feeling a combination of shame and relief at the averted disaster we apologized for not being in touch We didnt mention that we hadnt even known about her  She was shocked by our grim prognosis Angry But then with resolve she stepped into her role as decisionmaker He would never want to live this way she said His father had suffered a devastating stroke years ago and her husband had remarked several times Dont keep me alive if Im like that She wanted to bring him home immediately with hospice support Another day in the ICU would have gone completely against his wishes As Dr Atul Gawande described so beautifully in his book   checklists improve medical care I use a variety of them on my daily ICU rounds One assesses each organ in the body moving systematically from nose to toes Another evaluates settings on the breathing machine  By systematizing my approach Im confident that Ill always remember the many different steps involved in treating a patient with cardiac arrest Ill be more prepared to start tube feedings or begin to wean the patient off the ventilator when the time is right  But despite my checks and balances I had almost allowed the wrong person to make crucial decisions for this vulnerable patient And I had nearly excluded a wife from her rightful place on her husbands team Missing this crucial piece of information would have caused far more suffering and damage than any miscalibration of a ventilator  I realized then that I needed another checklist  one that puts patients and not just their organs in the center It would account for the human needs that we werent always taught to prioritize ones that didnt seem fatal if overlooked  clearly identifying the patients next of kin communicating with the family and identifying the goals of care asking about symptoms like pain delirium shortness of breath My critical oversight would not have happened had I sought out the social worker on the first day to confirm the true next of kin He thought I knew I thought I knew We both were wrong Now years after that incident I use   on every critically ill patient I see in intensive care After I go through the cardiovascular system the pulmonary system the kidneys and the ventilator settings I turn to the presenting resident and say Now lets do the patientcentered checklist  I have never since misidentified a surrogate decisionmaker And I know that I am doing a better job at managing my patients symptoms A checklist that addresses the human needs of a vulnerable patient is as crucial as those that deal with his organ function After all care is about the whole patient not just his parts
