New Yorks health insurance marketplace has been running relatively smoothly compared with healthcaregov the site the federal government is running for  states But thats a low bar and even though about  New Yorkers had signed up in the first two months almost every day still brings complaints and glitches Donna Frescatore the head of the   says there are no serious patterns of trouble just individual issues that the state and its contractors address one by one We try to listen to everything  to social media to customer service to our navigators  and work every day to make it better Frescatore says Health insurance exchanges are in the middle of their version of the holiday shopping crunch Millions of Americans who want coverage in place for the start of  have to buy it by Dec  At the nerve center of New York states exchange in Albany staffers hope not to repeat the chaos of early October when the website launched The call center for the New York state marketplace operated by a contractor called Maximus is located in an office park on the edge of the state capital Albany Joey Cappuccitti is one of more than a hundred customer service specialists taking calls He specializes in helping small businesses and he says things have calmed down since the exchange debuted On launch day Oct  top state health officials gathered several miles away in a small windowless conference room at the main computer hub in a converted shopping mall Contractor Chris Harmer remembers that based on months of passing stress tests everyone was confident the system could handle what was coming But that day the site was overwhelmed by the traffic That was a spike no one couldve planned for said Harmer a project manager from Computer Sciences Corporation which largely operates the state exchange It was a load beyond any reasonable modeling given the population of the state Harmer said technically the system didnt crash It was just running very very slowly But many customers couldnt get past the home page and many of those who did get through only got a screen or two into the application process before it froze The state realized they had to do two things First they tackled the technical problems They expanded the servers immediately and went to work revamping the website Frescatore the exchange chief recalls that the online application initially required people to check a box early on the top of one of the Web pages if they wanted financial assistance but people didnt see it Theyd get to the end and say I thought Id qualify for some and I didnt Why is that And wed go back and look and theyd missed it she says So Web designers eliminated the check box and made that fork in the road much more clearcut for applicants The bigger more abstract challenge is trying to adjust peoples expectations  not over how quickly Web pages should open but over what it means to shop for subsidized governmentbrokered health insurance online On Oct  President Barack Obama said You can compare insurance plans sidebyside the same way youd shop for a plane ticket on Kayak or a TV on Amazon Its a message state and federal officials have been promoting for years since the health law passed in   much to the chagrin of contractor Harmer I dont think its the correct analogy for a marketplace Harmer said The complexity of the Affordable Care Act means the whole application process is complicated too Its a little like applying for financial aid for college You have to put in a lot of personal financial informationbefore you figure out how much youll have to pay It does depend on the household the ages says Harmer It depends on all these factors instead of just saying Heres a quote which may or may not be correct Despite improvements most days bring new complaints to the exchanges   where Maryann Manelski a New York Citybased filmmaker and writer wrote Ive spent over  hours trying to navigate the site only to get spinning rainbow wheels and the site not responding At the New York State of Health traffic has been steadily increasing over the past two months And as with retail stores at this time of year the call center has been increasing staff  by to percent  to meet the growing demand Officials say theyre confident the system can handle a rush of insurance purchasers before the Dec  deadline The states goal is to enroll about  people by the end of next year
