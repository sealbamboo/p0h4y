 Every six minutes a   under the age of  is treated in the ER for a stairrelated injury new US research shows The study found that from  to  more than  children arrived in hospital emergency rooms with such injuries And those younger than  who are carried on stairs seem especially prone to getting hurt There is however some good news in the report The annual injury rate did in fact drop during the course of the research We can be happy that the numbers are going down but its still a very common source of injury said study coauthor Dr Gary Smith director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Childrens Hospital in Columbus Ohio The study appears online and in the April print issue of the journal   In the s Smith and his colleagues warned about the hazards of baby walkers wheeled walkers that could send babies tumbling down stairs Manufacturers redesigned the walkers so theyd come to a halt at the top of a stairwell Smith said For the new study the researchers decided to take a wider look at stairrelated injuries We wanted to get some uptodate information so we could give information to parents about the hazards and come up with some new strategies Smith explained The study authors used government data from about  hospitals to estimate the number of emergency room visits that were due to stairrelated injuries They found that about threequarters of the injuries were to the head and neck and almost  percent of the kids injured had to be hospitalized Kids under the age of  have a high center of gravity up around their chest not near the waist like in adults Smith said They tend to topple forward and usually dont have the upper body strength to break their fall They typically injure their face head and neck Among injured kids under the age of   percent were hurt while being carried Overall kids who were injured while being carried were more than three times as likely as other injured kids to need to be hospitalized Why so many injuries in kids who were being carried Were in this multitasking world where were trying to do a lot of things Smith said Parents need to resist that temptation If parents do need to carry a child on stairs they should use one hand free to steady themselves on the handrail he said or leave the child in the crib Overall the number of stairrelated injuries per year fell by almost  percent from  to  To prevent children from falling on stairs University of Pittsburgh pediatrician and assistant professor Dr Sonika Bhatnagar recommended that parents keep kids away from stairs when possible keep stairs free of objects dont use them with a stroller dont use baby walkers and dont allow kids to play on or around stairs Study coauthor Smith said many stairs arent designed to prevent injuries and Bhatnagar agreed She said building codes should allow wallmounted gates on stairs to keep kids off them some stairways arent designed to allow their use and encourage handrails that allow easy gripping Other stairway design features can improve safety too she said
