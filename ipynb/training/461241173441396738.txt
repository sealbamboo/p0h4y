You might think that the more hours youre awake the more calories youre burning so you should be losing more weight But youd be wrong  In fact people who dont sleep enough at night risk gaining extra pounds not losing them according to John M Jakicic director of the   at the University of Pittsburgh I think poor sleep is a contributing factor to weight gain says Jakicic When you have poor sleep or lack of sleep youre setting a whole cascade of events in motion hormonally that could set you up for weight gain Hormones that regulate growth and appetite are part of the equation according to Jakicic but equally culpable is sleep sabotage He believes that the more youre awake the greater the chance youll have an extra snack or two or three or four A  study in the   supports that theory It found that people who dont get enough sleep are more likely to be hungry because the body needs more energy to stay awake Unfortunately sleepy eaters tend to consume more than enough to compensate which leads to weight gain  People who are well rested dont slog through the day says Jakicic If your body is worn youre not going to be bounding up the stairs to your office and you might be less motivated to make it to the gym Less physical activity means fewer calories burned which over time can lead to weight gain    If youre not sleeping well at night you may be causing hormonal imbalances that could be making you feel hungry when you dont really need to eat The appetite hormones leptin and ghrelin are made predominantly during sleep which means that people have less of a sense of satiety if theyre not getting enough sleep says   author of Real Cause Real Cure The  Root Causes Of The Most Common Health Problems And How To Solve Them That hormonetriggered lack of satiety could explain the  am munchies Your growth hormones are also to blame according to Teitelbaum When you sleep your body is hard at work building muscle and repairing and rejuvenating tissue The less sleep you get the less time your body has for these critical processes  And since the more muscle you have the higher your metabolism not sleeping enough could be affecting how effectively your body burns through calories You wont have as much muscle if youre not getting enough sleep he says Youll actually wind up with more fat and less muscle   So if you suffer from insomnia restless leg syndrome fibromyalgia or any other sleep or pain disorders that can make shuteye elusive seek treatment And yes if youre on a diet getting quality restful sleep can help you shed pounds but itll take awhile  If youre properly rested youre going to find that its easier to lose weight says Teitelbaum Its going to be gradual over time Youre looking at losing four five or six pounds over a year period You cant sleep yourself thin and catching Zs will never take the place of a healthy diet or exercise Try to focus on the quality of your rest not the number of hours youre getting each night within reason of course  Its going to come down to the quality of sleep Jakicic says I think youre going to see a big difference between people who sleep six hours and have good quality versus those who sleep six hours and have poor quality Its really hard to have a lifestyle that allows you to lose weight if you dont have the energy to go out and do more   So eat well and rest up Your body will thank you for it
