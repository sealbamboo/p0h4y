Nearly  in  American high school seniors has used a hookah at least once in the preceding year and the risk was greater for students from higherincome families according to a study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics Hookahs a type of water pipe have become increasingly popular in recent years in the US and abroad numerous studies have reported Experts believe this is due in part to the perception that they are less dangerous than cigarettes and other forms of smoking The authors of the   describe hookahs as an ancient form of smoking in which shisha an herbal material that can be tobacco or nontobaccobased smoke is passed through water before inhalation The water pipes originated in ancient Persia and India in todays urban cities they are frequently shared in hookah bars or hookah lounges where smoking is seen as a social activity Data from  students who took the annual   survey show that  of  graders had tried a hookah in the  months before answering the questionnaire the researchers said That figure is the average of survey responses for the years   and  The study authors from New York Universitys Langone Medical Center found that the typical student who had used a hookah was a white male with welleducated parents and a steady source of spending money Given the cost of frequenting hookah bars it is not surprising that wealthier students as indicated by higher weekly income are more regular visitors the researchers wrote Their statistical analysis showed that  Compared with boys girls were  less likely to have used a hookah in the year before they took the survey  Compared with whites students who identified themselves as black were  less likely to have used a hookah  Compared with students in rural areas those who lived in urban areas defined as counties where at least one city had at least  residents were more than  times more likely to report hookah use  Compared with students whose parents were not well educated students from homes with highly educated parents were  more likely to have used a hookah  Compared with students with limited income those who earned at least  per week from a job were  more likely to have used a hookah In addition those who received between  and  per week from other sources were  more likely to have smoked Most states allow adults to use hookahs once they turn  and some high school seniors certainly meet this requirement But in some ways the popularity of hookahs seemed to mirror the use of illegal substances For instance students who said they had used alcohol were  times more likely than abstainers to have tried a hookah students who had ever tried marijuana were  times more likely to have tried a hookah and students who had used cocaine LSD and other narcotics were  more likely to have tried a hookah By far the biggest risk factor associated with hookah use was smoking High school seniors who regularly smoked cigarettes were more than  times more likely than nonsmokers to have used a hookah the researchers found Even students who said they had smoked only once or twice in their lives were more than twice as likely as nonsmokers to say they had used a hookah Although some of the risk factors for hookah use  high parental education and high family income  are linked to lower rates of teen smoking the study authors expressed concern that hookahs may serve as a gateway to cigarette smoking for some high school students The researchers also said they believed that the misconception that hookahs are less dangerous than cigarettes probably leads to the social normalization of hookah use as a trendy and acceptable way to have fun with friends In reality the water pipes expose smokers to tar nicotine and carbon monoxide in even higher doses than cigarettes the study said Medical researchers have found links between hookah use and lung cancer esophageal cancer respiratory and cardiovascular problems dental problems fertility issues and infectious diseases One bright spot is that several studies have found that when people understand the true risks of hookahs they are less likely to use them
