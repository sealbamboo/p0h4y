Try this quick word association Sadist And you respond Hannibal Lecter The Marquis de Sade Actually you didnt need to come up with representatives of extreme criminal behavior or sexual torture You might just as well have considered the colleague two cubicles over The one who spends lunch hour splattering the brains of video game characters Those who enjoy inflicting at least moderate pain on others directly or vicariously mingle with us daily Think mean girls taunting a classmate to   Or the professor who grills a squirming clueless student lips curled in a small savage smile  a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia calls such people everyday sadists They exist on a spectrum he said It could be at a hockey game and your guy is pummeling the opponent into hamburger and people are standing up having orgasms to taking revenge on those you think deserve it to schadenfreude But acknowledging that sadists regularly cross our paths is unsettling said   a professor of psychology at Emory University who studies   We prefer to think Theres sadists and then theres the rest of usÂ  There is little research on sadism because of the ethical and moral dilemmas posed by laboratory experiments Recruiting participants poses other hurdles In a study published this month in the journal Psychological Science Dr Paulhus and his associates developed a questionnaire and experiments to identify   In the studys first experiment to learn if everyday sadism correlated with the questionnaire researchers recruited  psychology students ostensibly to understand personality and tolerance for challenging jobs The students chose among tasks that stood for jobs killing bugs exterminator helping the exterminator exterminators assistant cleaning toilets sanitation worker or enduring pain from ice water a worker in cold environments Among the participants nearly  percent chose to be bug assassins or assistants  percent chose toiletcleaning and  percent pain tolerance Gender was evenly distributed among those choosing various tasks  Students who chose to be bugkillers were presented with three cups each holding a live pill bug To anthropomorphize the bugs each was given a name Muffin Ike or Tootsie Bugkillers had to drop a bug into a modified coffee grinder force the top down and grind the bug up Note to cringing readers a secret barrier spared the tiny troika Though the machines emitted crunching sounds the researchers said no bugs were harmed in the experiment During the execution of the assignment some bugkillers quit after one or two But some asked for more bugs On a questionnaire rating their emotional reaction to their jobs the bugkillers who ground up all three had the highest scores describing significantly greater pleasure than did those who didnt finish or who chose to assist The studys second experiment looked at the lengths to which a sadist would go to hurt an innocent victim In  Dr Paulhus and colleagues had proposed a cluster of traits they called the Dark Triad narcissism psychopathy and Machiavellianism The traits are present in many people not currently in jail or in therapy Its a taxonomy of personalities whom others rate as being obnoxious people you deal with on an everyday basis Dr Paulus said He has been investigating if everyday sadism should be added to the cluster  a Dark Tetrad Psychopaths want to get things from people and dont care about hurting them to do so he said Yet sadists look for opportunities to hurt people and prolong it for their own pleasure Studies also indicate that sadists will choose to hurt people without provocation even if the act takes time and effort  the only reward being the pleasure of inflicting cruelty Dr Paulhus wanted to see whether a questionnaire could predict which participants would make a sadistic choice Again  psychology students rated statements from the Dark Triad scale as well as new ones like I enjoy mocking losers to their face I enjoy hurting people and In car racing its the accidents I enjoy most The participants competed in a computer game supposedly against an opponent in another room Only the winner could blast the loser with a whitenoise sound rated  to  The opponent always chose zero so that the winners choice was not based on the need to retaliate But half the group had to postpone the blasting  first they had to complete a boring lettercounting chore in nonsensical text Only when they finished could they blast away Those participants with the highest sadism scores on the questionnaire were more willing to do the extra work for the opportunity to be cruel Narcissists and Machiavellians were less likely to do so Dr Paulhus feels that his study helps establish that everyday sadism has distinct attributes He noted however that when the hockey fans battered opponent is carried out on a stretcher and waves his hand to show hes alive the fans applaud So they have an empathic side as well Everyday sadists he said are not the sum of their cruel streaks Dr Lilienfeld agrees such people certainly abound But demonstrating the pervasiveness of lowlevel cruelty he said leaves unanswered a question that has long haunted researchers We dont still know why some people are chronically mean he said
