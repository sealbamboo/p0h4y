For those who arent familiar with our Stone Age ancestors Neanderthals are an extinct species of human who differ in DNA from what scientists call modern humans by   Modern humans first left Africa about  years ago   and wandered toward Asia and Europe There they encountered Neanderthals and another species of human called Denisovans  Scientists believe Neanderthals died out about  years ago possibly because they were simply absorbed into the modern human population Roughly  of genomes of nonAfricans today come from the Neanderthal species according to Nature Until now scientists hadnt pinpointed exactly when Neanderthals and modern humans began interbreeding  Sequencing of the yearold bones DNA showed that  of his genome also came from Neanderthals according to   His Neanderthal DNA segments were long the scientists say which suggests that the love fest between the two species began between  and  years ago  Paternal and maternal chromosomes are shuffled together in each generation so that over time the DNA segments from any individual become shorter Nature explains Of course when it comes to evolution theres always a debate Some scientists believe modern humans left Africa more than  years ago This is just a random find in a Siberian river deposit Chris Stringer a paleoanthropologist at Londons Natural History Museum told Nature What else could be there when they start looking systematically
