People stationed at North Carolinas Camp Lejeune while the water there was contaminated were more likely to die from several types of cancer as well as Lou Gehrigs disease according to an official government report released Wednesday Its the latest in a series of reports showing the contaminated water at the base seriously affected Marines and their families The study found elevated risks at Camp Lejeune for several causes of death including cancers of the kidney liver esophagus cervix multiple myeloma Hodgkin lymphoma and ALS amyotrophic lateral sclerosis also known as Lou Gehrigs disease Frank Bove of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and colleagues   published in the online journal Environmental Health Not very many people who drank the contaminated water have died yet and so more study will be needed to really nail down the risks said Bove a senior epidemiologist at CDCs Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry But the findings add to evidence that cancercausing chemicals such as benzene and trichloroethylene TCE caused severe illnesses TCE is used as a degreaser and a drycleaning solvent Other reports have found that children of Marines at the camp had higher rates of leukemia lymphoma and neural tube defects An   published in  found that hundreds of thousands of people may have been drinking and bathing in contaminated water at the camp for as long as  years Marines have complained they and their children suffered cancer including breast cancer and leukemia because of the contamination Jerry Ensminger blames the water for the death of his yearold daughter Janey in  Janey was born at Camp Lejeune while Ensminger was serving there Hes glad the studies are starting to be done but is pushing for much more Its like pulling teeth with these people Ensminger told NBC News How can they get a full picture when they wont do the studies Mike Partain says he feels vindicated The yearold insurance adjuster was born at Camp Lejeune and believes his male breast cancer was caused by the contaminated water I dont drink I dont smoke I have never done drugs I dont fit into any of the risk categories he said Partain says if people know they have a higher risk of cancer they might watch for symptoms and get treatment earlier He Ensminger and others have been lobbying Congress to force more studies I want more understanding he said The Veterans Affairs Department has for people who think they may have been affected They may be eligible for medical care through VA for  health conditions including lung breast and bladder cancer leukemia infertility kidney damage and other conditions For the latest report Bove and colleagues compared more than  Marines stationed at Camp Lejeune from  to  to  similar Marines stationed at Camp Pendleton in California over the same period The Lejeune Marines had about a  percent higher risk of dying from any type of cancer compared to the Pendleton Marines the study found They had a  percent higher risk of kidney cancer a  percent higher risk of liver cancer a  percent higher risk of Hodgkin lymphoma and a  percent higher risk of multiple myeloma Marines had double the risk of ALS if theyd had a high exposure to vinyl chloride This is another positive study that shows a definite impact of contaminated water at Camp Lejeune on the Marines who were there during  Richard Clapp an epidemiologist at Boston University told NBC News It shows an increase in deaths due to several types of cancer including leukemia and lymphoma as well as Lou Gehrigs Disease ALS with increasing exposure to specific chemicals in the drinking water The contamination of the water is clearly documented and Marines in particular might be at high risk because they drink so much the researchers said A marine in training under warm weather conditions could drink between one and two quarts of water per hour they wrote Combining this ingestion rate with dermal and inhalation exposures from showering twice a day a marine could consume a literequivalent of up to eight liters of drinking water per day Water from one particular part of the installation Hadnot Point was so highly contaminated that a Marine could easily take in  milligrams of trichloroethylene TCE a day between  and  the researchers said ATSDR says trichloroethylene is the most frequently reported organic contaminant in groundwater estimating that  to  percent of drinking water supply sources have some TCE contamination The US Marines did not have an immediate comment on the study The USMC says the drinking water at Camp Lejeune   all government drinking water standards and is tested more often than required
