 One in  American truck drivers train conductors airline pilots and other transportation workers may be dangerously   a new survey suggests Many said they feel drowsy while working and some worry that their fatigue poses a threat to commuter safety the National Sleep Foundation NSF poll found As many as  percent of these employees work while sleepy compared to  percent of nontransportation workers It is exciting that we are finally able to see the statistics and hopefully do something to improve the situations for our transportation workers sleep medicine expert Joyce Walsleben said Walsleben who is an associate professor of medicine at the NYU School of Medicine in New York City added that many transportation workers are forced to work horrendous schedules which puts us all in jeopardy Too many societal tragedies have already occurred because of sleepiness The survey was conducted this year and is the first of its kind the NSF said It involved nearly  pilots truck drivers train engineers and conductors and bus taxi and limousine drivers all over the age of  as well as nontransportation workers for a point of comparison Among the findings roughly one in four train operators and airline pilots say their job performance suffers due to sleepiness at least once a week By contrast just one in six nontransportation workers say sleepiness has affected their work When it comes to sleep dissatisfaction pilots and train operators took the prize with  percent and  percent respectively telling the survey team they rarely or never get   on nights they work The same was true of  percent of truck drivers and  percent of nontransportation employees By contrast  percent of bus taxi and limo drivers claimed a similar degree of sleep dissatisfaction Safety is at the heart of the problem the poll suggested with  percent of pilots admitting to having committed a serious error when flying Just less than  percent of train operators said they experienced a near miss due to fatigue with  percent of truck drivers acknowledging the same With transportation workers shifts often subject to change the survey showed sleepiness is not only an issue while on the job but also a problem when these workers are commuting to work Six percent of pilots and train operators said they have been in car accidents en route to work This compares with just  percent of nontransportation workers polled Transportation workers experience considerable variability in the days they work the times they work and the amount of time off between shifts Patrick Sherry a sleep researcher and professor from the University of Denver Intermodal Transportation Institute said in the NSF news release This makes it difficult for such workers to maintain regular sleepwake schedules which can in turn make it difficult for these workers to maintain alertness on the job Making work more regular might help Employers should put more effort into designing workrest schedules that facilitate sleep and minimize workers exposure to irregular variable schedule changes Sherry said Another sleep expert Dr Yosef Krespi of Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City said the new survey should be seen as a wakeup call for employers He pointed to one  study of  patients and another from  involving  people that found that sleep deprivation is linked to increased risk of heart disease and hypertension Krespi also noted that after  hours spent awake the brain is no longer able to perform as well as when it is rested with performance dropping to levels equivalent to that of a blood alcohol level of  percent at or above the legal limit in most states In other words Krespi said extremely sleepdeprived individuals perform similar to drunks Driving home from work after a long shift is associated with   Dr Sanjay Patel a sleep researcher at Brigham and Womens Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston noted in the NSF news release We should all be concerned that pilots and train operators report car crashes due to sleepiness at a rate that is six times greater than that of other workers Noting that about one in  Americans say they are likely to fall asleep at unplanned and inappropriate times such as in meetings or while driving the NSF survey team advised anyone who suffers from regular sleepiness to seek professional help Transportation professionals need to manage sleep to perform at their best NSF CEO David Cloud said in the news release
