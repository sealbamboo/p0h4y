The report does not single out any physicians or hospitals but shows how well states and the federal government are doing in terms of supporting emergency care said Dr Jon Mark Hirshon an emergency physician at the University of Maryland and board member of the American College of Emergency Physicians Categories included access to care and disaster preparedness among others  The countrys emergency care environment has actually worsened since  the last time the organization graded the United States on support for emergency care Five years ago the nation received a Cminus  The American College of Emergency Physicians used  measures for grading the states The report card rated some categories in  as better than others nationwide Quality and patient safety environment got a C so did public health and injury prevention and disaster preparedness The medical liability environment got a Cminus But access to emergency care scored a dismal Dminus If Im in a car crash and they bring me to hospital thats not ready for me my chances of survival are less Hirshon said So you want a state that has that type of trauma system And when you look at patient safety thats one of the components of patient safety Medical liability environment affects your ability to access a specialist in an emergency Hirshon said Appropriate physicians may not be available because they are afraid of being on call for patients they dont know for liability reasons he said There have also been trends of physicians migrating from states with highliability insurance premiums to others where it is not such an issue such as Texas Rosenau said  In a statebystate breakdown grading the  states and the District of Columbia on these parameters the report card found that the District of Columbia leads in emergency care support with a grade of Bminus Massachusetts Maine and Nebraska ranked second third and fourth respectively also getting Bminus Colorado squeezed into fifth place with a Cplus  At the bottom of the list Wyoming got an outright F  Arkansas got a Dminus New Mexico Montana and Kentucky came out with Ds  Access to emergency care was particularly lacking across many states the report card said In this category  states received an F At the front of the class in this category with As and Bs were the District of Columbia Pennsylvania Ohio Massachusetts and Maine  You can have the best medicine in the world but it wont matter if people cant get to it Hirshon said  Medical liability was good enough in Colorado Idaho Kansas and Texas to score those states As but  states got Fs   Three states got As for policies that support patient safety Maryland Pennsylvania Utah and North Carolina But  states got Fs in this category  For public health and injury prevention Hawaii Massachusetts Maine Minnesota Oregon Utah and Washington got As But  states got Ds or Fs Disaster preparedness was also a big problem with nearly half of all states receiving Ds or Fs On the flip side the District of Columbia and North Dakota aced this category   The report also highlighted that there were  million emergency department visits or  visits per minute in  and there were  million visits related to injury according to the CDCs   PDF  From  to  there was a  increase in emergency department visits according to CDCs data During this same time period the supply of emergency departments went down by   The number of patients visiting emergency departments is likely to increase as baby boomers age and develop more medical problems And the report projects that with the Affordable Care Act going into effect millions of people who cant find physicians who accept their insurance and who were added to Medicaid will also seek emergency care  suggested that Medicaid increases the use of emergency departments  Well be asked to do more with less resources which has the potential to impact emergency patients Hirshon said  The report card did not include freestanding emergency departments as they are new entities and need to be better understood Hirshon said  What can be done The Affordable Care Act calls for a work force commission to examine shortages of physicians and nurses and the American College of Emergency Physicians wants to see that funded Graduate medical education funding should also be expanded Hirshon said  The physicians group would also like to see enhancements of the   in Washington to help with disaster response Improvements have been made since the  report card one state started a new trauma system while another enhanced medical liability laws  We know that in every single category there was one state that was able to garner an A on this report card Rosenau said  Those are examples for other states unhappy with their grade he said
