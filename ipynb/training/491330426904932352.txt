How well do we understand and act on probabilities that something will happen A  percent chance of this or an  percent chance of that As it turns out making decisions based on the odds can be an extremely difficult thing to do even for people who study the science of how we make decisions  would know He teaches about risk and probability at the University of Michigan School of Public Health Back in  when he was studying behavioral decision theory in graduate school he was diagnosed with  People with the disorder cant produce blood cells the way they should making them much more susceptible to bleeding and infection ZikmundFisher was told that without treatment hed have about  years to live The other option was a bone marrow transplant that had a  percent chance of curing him and ensuring a normal life But the transplant itself  because of the chemotherapy because of the infection risks  had roughly a  to  percent chance of killing me within six months to a year ZikmundFisher says At the time ZikmundFisher was  married and had a child on the way Ultimately he made his lifeordeath decision based on factors even he couldnt quantify He concluded that with no transplant and  years of life he would get to know his thenunborn daughter but she would remember him as a father in and out of hospitals Those were not the  years he wanted So he chose to gamble on the transplant My experience my outcome has been very positive ZikmundFisher says I was on a hospital floor with  other patients going through very similar procedures Four of them never left the floor I was one of the lucky ones What became apparent to ZikmundFisher was that probabilities while useful are quite limited in their ability to predict what will happen to any one person Were never  percent alive We either live or die We experience outcomes he explains On a population level I can have  people in a room and some will have something happen to them and some will not And thats the hard part because if you happen to be the unlucky one who has that rare event happen to you you still have the bad thing happen to you in its full awfulness Still ZikmundFisher says when it comes to medical treatment its important that doctors think about the overall numbers  not individual cases A doctor doesnt see one patient They see hundreds of patients  thousands of patients  over their career We want doctors to make choices that give all of their patents the best possible outcomes regardless of whether that particular choice turned out well in the last time they tried it or turned out poorly he says We want doctors to take the long view to give us the best chances of success knowing that sometimes its going to work well and sometimes its not On a personal level ZikmundFisher acknowledges theres a harder reality I only have one hand in this poker game I only get one life he says I can play the odds I can try to give myself the best opportunities But risk is a part of our everyday life and rare things do happen and we have to accept that All Things Considered
