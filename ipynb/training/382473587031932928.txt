Sure alcohol has a downside but if theres one thing to say for drinking its that its not stressful Its fun and really  who hasnt knocked back a few in an effort to blow off some steam So Does drinking not necessarily a lot but some really reduce stress levels like it seems to or what The verdict Yes alcohol can relieve stress when consumed in limited amounts for certain people in specific situations In virtually all other cases it makes stress worse Heres whats really happening Alcohol reliably reduces the bodys physiological stress response But you may need to get drunk to get that benefit every time so its uh not a good destressing strategy for the long run Plus alcohol isnt metabolized like other foods and drinks The amount of energy it takes to metabolize large doses of alcohol causes more stress to the body even if you feel relaxed However moderate doses of alcohol can also reduce stress under the right circumstances for some people That last bit is important because for other people it can cause stress easing it momentarily even as its increasing chronic stress levels Not so magical now huh Lets unpack this a bit more starting with a pleasant positive experience Youre a moderate drinker No anxiety disorder youre not depressed youre not taking meds that dont mix with booze and theres no family history of alcohol dependence You just like to have a drink or two with your work colleagues your friends your partner Does it ease stress Maybe Could go either way At lower levels of intoxication  a blood alcohol level of  or the equivalent of two drinks for most people  alcohol can be a nice pleasant thing says University of Missouri psychology professor Kenneth Sher who runs the universitys Alcohol Behavior and Health laboratory But it could also be the cryinginyourbeer phenomenon At the slight buzz level alcohol is a social lubricant which often improves mood You start to let go of a few worries pay attention to the moment with friends Its telling that outside of people with alcohol dependence most people drink in a social situation says Sher The overall enjoyment is more pleasurable because its enhancing that social experience Drinking in groups creates cohesion enhances group bonding and formation and thats a clear social benefit Get drunk on the other hand and your body really relaxes Totally Stress whats that Youre at the legal intoxication level which the average person would get to after drinking say five ounce regular beers in two hours  At that level Alcohol reduces anxioustype responses theres a dampening of your stress response and your heart rate and youre inured to acute stressors especially if you experience them when youre drunk says Sher Got a problem with that Sher certainly does  Unfortunately the most reliable stressreducing effects of alcohol occur at the most problematic doses in terms of both acute harm and dependence he says So lets get back to the nice pleasant drink or two with friends Thats moderate drinking which has hearthealth benefits along with psychological ones The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines moderate for men as no more than four drinks at a time and no more than  drinks a week For women its no more than three drinks at a time and no more than seven drinks a week If its part of a lifestyle to enjoy food and alcohol and you look forward to it thats fine says Carol Landau clinical professor of psychiatry and medicine at the Alpert Medical School Brown University Its an enjoyable habit a lifestyle pleasure How can you tell when youre drifting to the dark side If youre looking forward to a drink to relieve your stress on a regular basis that is a warning sign says Sher Theres a very strong relationship between having thoughts like Alcohol helps me relax and Having a few drinks makes my trouble go away and alcohol dependency problems Be especially careful if you have problems with anxiety adds Landau If you have an anxiety disorder youre more than twice as likely as the general population to develop an alcohol dependency If youre taking meds regular drinking is even more dangerous Never mix benzodiazepine drugs for anxiety or panic disorders Xanax Ativan Clonipine with booze Alcohol interacts negatively with lots of other medications too   Even if you dont have an anxiety disorder or depression its easy to fall into the bad habit of using booze to chill out  I see a whole generation heading for their s who use stimulants to study and then alcohol and marijuana to have fun says Landau Thats not a good pattern  For women already in their s she sees another pattern Her caffeinefueled days are stressful so she comes home stressed out and has a drink Thats not a healthy habit either Once you start relying on alcohol to cut stress youre in trouble When youre alcoholdependent youre chronically stressed at a baseline level says Sher Its kind of an emotional hair of the dog phenomenon Part of the stress youre feeling is a consequence of the dependency Read You have higher levels of cortisol the stress hormone so you have to drink alcohol to get back to normal The key signal is flexibility If youre disappointed theres no alcohol and youre having trouble not drinking at a party or a friends house you likely have a problem Thats a sign of dependency says Landau  Says Sher If youre using any drug as a primary way to regulate emotion youre in big trouble So if you can drink moderately go ahead and enjoy it But if youre relying on alcohol to relieve stress youre walking down a dangerous path
