A threeday lockdown announced by Sierra Leone to combat Ebola will not help contain the virus medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres MSF says The charity said a lockdown would force people underground destroy trust between doctors and the public and ultimately help spread the disease Sierra Leone officials say the measure due to begin on  September will let health workers isolate new cases About  people in Sierra Leone Liberia and Guinea have so far died MSF whose staff are helping to tackle the outbreak said in a statement that quarantines and lockdowns end up driving people underground and jeopardising the trust between people and health providers This leads to the concealment of potential cases and ends up spreading the disease further the group  said Information Minister Alpha Kanu admits the lockdown is an extraordinary measure that will cause huge inconvenience but he says it is needed to stem the spread of a disease which has killed over about  of his people  Despite criticism from MSF Mr Kanu insists that the measure will minimise the spread of the virus and he is urging people to stock up on food telling them We did it during the war  Never since the rebel invasion of Freetown in  have I seen fear on the faces of people like in recent times Even so many people feel three days is too long to be asked to stay indoors Many others feel three days is too short to achieve the governments aim of restricting the virus  Sierra Leonean officials earlier said more than  people would be deployed to make sure residents stayed indoors Health ministry spokesman Sidie Yahya Tunis told the BBC he did not expect the public to object You follow or else youll be breaking the law If you disobey then you are disobeying the president he said The BBCs West Africa correspondent Thomas Fessy says the Sierra Leone populations willingness to obey will be key for the plan to succeed A forcible implementation is likely to raise human rights issues and could potentially spark violent demonstrations he says Last month Liberia sealed off a large slum in the capital Monrovia for more than a week in an attempt to contain the virus The disease infects humans through close contact with infected animals including chimpanzees fruit bats and forest antelope It then spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood bodily fluids or organs or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments Officials in Nigeria have meanwhile decided to reopen schools in the country from  September They were closed as a precaution to prevent the spread of the virus Separately a US doctor infected with Ebola is being treated in a Nebraska hospital after evacuation from Liberia Rick Sacra  was described as sick but stable He is the third American aid worker infected The other two recovered after treatment in Atlanta On Friday the WHO announced that the blood of patients who recovered from Ebola should be used to treat others People produce antibodies in the blood in an attempt to fight off an Ebola infection The antibodies may be able to help a sick patients immune system if they are transferred However large scale data on the effectiveness of the therapy is lacking
