It would have seemed the stuff of fantasy in the dark days of the s when an AIDS diagnosis was tantamount to a death sentence a pill taken daily that could protect against HIV infection But today such a drug exists The blue tablet marketed as Truvada has been available to people at risk of being exposed to HIV since  The pill can be highly effective    according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention It could have a dramatic effect in Los Angeles County where about  people are known to live with HIV Contracting the virus is no longer a death sentence because of a cocktail of drugs that suppress it but the county still reports more than  new HIV infections each year We want to bring HIV to its knees and this will help said Mario Perez who directs the countys prevention program But the concept of using the pill  known in medical circles as preexposure prophylaxis  has stirred a surprising debate in the gay community with some longtime activists calling Truvada a party drug that people will never take consistently enough to stave off infections If not taken daily the CDC warns protection levels are lower Most notable among the skeptics is AIDS Healthcare Foundation President Michael Weinstein whose organization recently launched a new advertising campaign urging the CDC to rethink its support for a communitywide prevention method that does not emphasize condom use first and foremost Those with a more sanguine view of the pill wonder why critics such as Weinsteins foundation would dismiss any tool with the potential to decrease HIV infection rates which are creeping up among young gay and bisexual men of color There is a moral imperative to make this available for folks who think its the right approach Perez said Were big fans in giving people options to achieve their goals with no judgment Public health officials throughout the US have already made the approach a key part of their official HIV prevention strategies Last spring the CDC added its stamp of approval when it released official guidelines on preexposure prophylaxis In July New York Gov Andrew Cuomo put the method at the center of an effort to drastically cut the numbers of new HIV infections in his state by  Truvada combines two drugs that have been part of the antiretroviral cocktail taken by HIVpositive patients for years The medicines tenofovir and emtricitabine work together to block an enzyme called reverse transcriptase that allows HIV cells to multiply In addition to suppressing HIV that is already in the body the drugs can also prevent the virus from gaining a foothold initially Its unclear how many in California are taking the drug to prevent HIV infection but the number probably isnt very large At  a year Truvada is expensive but it is covered by most insurance plans In early November Gilead Sciences the company that manufactures the drug reviewed retail pharmacy records from a little more than half of US pharmacies that dispensed Truvada between January   and March   and found that  people in the US started the prevention regimen during that period Advocates of preexposure prophylaxis blame the slow increase at least in part on moralizing by people such as Weinstein The crux of critics concern is that offering gay men another way to block AIDS infection will undermine a longstanding push in the community to promote condom use which is known to also prevent the transmission of HIV and STDs CDC guidelines for administering preexposure prophylaxis stipulate that Truvada should be used with condoms not instead of them But some most notably Weinstein say that men wont bother with condoms if they believe they are protected by a pill You have to be really paranoid about your health to wear a belt and suspenders he said If the culture shifts to unprotected sex because of the campaign to promote Truvada then HIV rates will go up Weinstein and others have noted that overall risk reductions in clinical trials for preexposure prophylaxis were lower than the CDCcited  The socalled iPrEx study for instance reported that people who took Truvada experienced only a  reduction in HIV infection risk The overall risk reduction rate was low because many participants in the study did not take their medication as directed scientists say Weinstein argues that others will also fail to use the drug correctly leading to a rise in new HIV cases and other sexually transmitted infections Adherence is a common worry Mitchell Katz who directs Los Angeles Countys Department of Health Services said that patients who have been careless about HIV prevention thus far  choosing not to use a condom despite the risks  are unlikely to ask their doctor about Truvada or follow through on daily dosing I think preexposure prophylaxis is a very useful intervention for a very small percentage of people he said I dont think its for everyone Katz said county hospitals and clinics do not have rules against providing the method but that use was not yet widespread Even the most enthusiastic supporters acknowledge that responsibly expanding Truvada use will mean setting up systems to make sure patients take the pill as directed Speaking with health advocates in August Sonali Kulkarni medical director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Healths Division of HIV and STD Programs said her agency was trying to figure out how to provide wraparound counseling to such users Such support would be designed to boost drug adherence and HIV risk reduction county health officials said Preexposure prophylaxis is a responsibility added AIDS Project Los Angeles health and wellness outreach worker Ken Almanza who began using the method earlier this year and is trying to teach other Latinos about the intervention But supporters also cite mounting evidence that the regimen is highly effective when followed properly  and argue that focusing on supporting adherence makes more sense than counting Truvada out altogether Weinsteins foundation looked at the data and came out in opposition the majority of the rest of the groups that do HIV work have come to an opposite conclusion said David Evans director of research advocacy at Project Inform in San Francisco Its not a silver bullet its not a magic pill its best with condoms  but theres also a recognition that not everybody uses condoms and for those people even a moderate effect would be advantageous Advocates in the gay community see critics such as Weinstein as Puritans engaging in what they call a shaming exercise similar to the disapproval unmarried women faced  years ago when they demanded access to the birth control pill Users have been branded as taking the pill so they can engage in promiscuous sex without condoms Theres still a fair amount of stigma around being a Truvada user said Jim Pickett director of prevention advocacy at the AIDS Foundation of Chicago and an advocate Its an admission I dont use condoms all the time Im not perfect but I can be prepared Pickett operates a website that allows Truvada users to announce their decision to take the drug and to discuss their experiences Los Feliz resident Jesse Reed took his Truvada story to Facebook Today is the first day in a new chapter of HIV prevention in my personal journey he wrote posting a photo of the oblong tablet For men such as Reed  who came of age shortly after the s AIDS epidemic the fear of contracting HIV has always been the monster under the bed Hes hoping that will change now
