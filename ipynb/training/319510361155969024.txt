There is a sign stating certain things you may not do on the High Line Manhattans celebrated elevated pedestrian park that was once a freight railway 
 Do not throw objects amplify sound or walk on the gravel or weeds But something is missing from the list a prohibition against jogging For those of us always searching for new places to run that omission is an invitation If you are one of the  million people who visited the High Line in  the question isnt so much whether you are allowed to jog up there but why you would even try It is often so packed with people that simply walking through can be a trick The park was an instant entry to the citys mustsee list when the first phase from Gansevoort Street to West th Street opened in  You havent been to the High Line people would say You must go to the High Line And some days it seems as if everyone does Crowds grow so thick that there are pedestrian bottlenecks and stopandgo traffic The secret is an alarm clock The park opens at  am and to go to the High Line at that hour is to enter a peaceful even solitary atmosphere that is a world away from the throngs that will arrive in a few hours I jogged there recently on a crisp early spring morning heading west on Gansevoort Street into the heart of the   Despite the nightclubs and boutiques Gansevoort remains a sweet timepiece of industrial New York especially early in the day I turned my ankle ever so slightly on the cobblestones and hopped on the sidewalk until I crossed Washington Street and climbed the stairs to the High Line There are two major construction projects at the southern end of the park One is a permanent   for Friends of the High Line the nonprofit group that runs the park The other one much larger is the downtown branch of the   which will feature multiple rooftop exhibitions facing the High Line A wall separating the path from the headquarters site posts information about the park I stopped briefly and brushed up on my history If you ran on the industrial West Side from the s to the s it might well have been to dodge freight trains which operated at street level So many people were not fast enough that the train route was called   The High Line was built to get the railway off the street Interstate trucking and air travel eventually doomed the High Line which had its final run in  Over the next three decades the structure sat unused as selfseeded vegetation grew on the tracks those plants inspired the parks current horticulture The High Line was scheduled to be demolished But in  two prescient residents   and   formed   which sought to preserve it and turn it into something special for the public After a decade of campaigning fundraising and restoration   beyond its supporters wildest dreams The High Line has spurred development and   to reuse their own abandoned infrastructure It also has its share of   who say the neighborhoods below it are becoming gentrified and saturated with tourists But I was just here for an innocent jog so uptown I went A collection of bare whitebarked   reminded me of an Ansel Adams photograph except the backdrop was the Standard Hotel rather than the splendor of Yosemite The Standard   and was the first of three buildings I ran under At this point the High Line is wide enough to have alternate parallel pathways which let me take a different road back Around th Street the railway shifts diagonally to the west crossing over th Avenue This gave me the sensation of looking through a camera that was panning to the left The northern vista was wide open Two buildings just ahead and to the left seemed to capture the new architecture that blends with old warehouses and tenements the wavy IAC headquarters and the Chelsea Nouvel a condominium just to the north that features colored windows with funky geometric shapes This area around th was like an open clearing that leads into the forest The path narrows sharply to barely more than the width of one train track Buildings begin to hug the High Line with a couple of   seeming to angle over it on higher floors Public artwork is a feature of the park but the only work I noticed on this run is Broken Bridge II by El Anatsui It is a striking collage of rusted metal and mirrors that covers the entire side of a building Just across the path is the Spanishtiled roof of the Church of the Guardian Angel I was running slowly  this was no time for a speed workout  craning my neck to absorb as much detail as I could and playing a game of   Here to the right was the General Theological Seminary   And there up ahead is the New York Times building peeking from above the   coops Around th Street a scaffolding cover begins and construction steals the show Major developments are planned around and above the   At the parks end at th Street I soaked in the sweeping northern views knowing they would probably disappear as a new neighborhood sprouts up A completed High Line would wrap around the development and end at the Jacob Javits Center at th Street making the entire park  miles My mile back was just as rich with fine views of New Jersey and countless details I missed on the trip uptown a wall mural some buds beginning to emerge a cleverly designed set of benches The morning light angled in from the east in scrumptious ways I was lucky enough to be weaving through the fabric of New York City  feet above traffic Yes you can jog on the High Line But lets keep it our little secret
