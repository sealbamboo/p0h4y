In the  years since her daughter Rachel was born with Down syndrome Jawanda Mast has always been clear that shed change the condition if she could  I couldnt love her more but I would give almost anything to take away that extra chromosome the Olathe Kansas mom wrote on   While I may know shes perfect the world doesnt  But when Massachusetts scientists announced recently that theyve found a way to silence the chromosome that causes trisomy  also known as Down syndrome it rocked Mast  and the rest of the disability community  Its so hard to imagine you could actually do that Mast told NBC News Yes I would take away the challenges I would take away the health risks But now I also stop and say Oh my goodness how would that impact the rest of her Hailed as a cure in a Petri dish the research by scientists at the University of Massachusetts Medical School is the first to find that it may be possible to switch off the genetic material responsible for the condition that causes cognitive delays heart defects and shortened lifespans The development is expected to help create new treatments for problems caused by Down syndrome  but it also raises the prospect of eliminating the condition entirely  Since it became public last month the breakthrough has sparked a firestorm of reaction among parents advocates ethicists and people with the condition said Dr Brian Skotko a medical geneticist and codirector of the Down Syndrome Program at Massachusetts General Hospital  This research really launches a million questions Skotko said On one hand almost everyone agrees theres a need for treatments to help the  people in the US living with Down syndrome including the nearly  babies born with it each year  On the other hand its unclear what costs there may be to shutting down the mechanism that creates people who offer lessons in patience kindness  and what it means to be human If Down syndrome were completely cured the world would lose something from the absence of that culture said Skotko who has a sister with the condition There is something positive that people with Down syndrome contribute to the world Brian Long of Boulder Colo is the father a yearold son with Down syndrome He welcomes the research which could lead to treatments to boost Connors intellectual abilities and speaking skills and prevent disease But he also wonders how tinkering with chromosomes could alter the essence of his son  So much of Down syndrome does impact the personality and character of the person said Long  In Connors example weve known him for  years We dont want a wholesale change  Advocates like Julie Cevallos vice president of marketing for the National Down Syndrome Society emphasize that the research is still early   When you go as far as a cure thats when folks step back and go Were not looking for a cure Were looking to help and support people with Down syndrome live healthy and productive lives said Cevallos mother of a yearold with the condition  David Egan a yearold Vienna Va man with Down syndrome said he applauds the progress in part because it might help with some of the social stigma that comes with the disorder He has friends whove been made fun of because of their disability who have a hard time coping with the condition  Im not saying to shut it down completely said Egan who has worked for  years in the distribution department at Booz Allen Hamilton the technology consulting firm I would say just to understand more about it  But ethicists fear that genetic manipulation could spell the end of the disorder  and of people who have it We now see very few persons with the symptoms of polio or the scars of smallpox said Art Caplan head of medical ethics at New York University Langone Medical Center The same fate despite the protests of some awaits Down syndrome and other genetic diseases if engineering genes creates cures That strong reaction surprised Jeanne Lawrence the professor of cell and developmental biology who led the research People may misunderstand the scope and promise of her work she said It likely wouldnt be possible to cure Down syndrome because the condition occurs at conception she said  Even looking forward really far I dont see how we could fundamentally change a person who has trisomy  to silence all the chromosomes in their body said Lawrence Instead it might be possible to target specific conditions Perhaps there will be a way to treat congenital heart disease early in children with Down syndrome or to stave off Alzheimers disease in adults she added No question the research is an advance in the understanding of Down syndrome which occurs when people are born with three copies of chromosome  instead of the normal two copies  Humans are typically born with  pairs of chromosomes including one pair of sex chromosomes for a total of  in each cell People with Down syndrome have  chromosomes in each cell The researchers discovered that a gene called XIST  which normally turns off one of the two copies of the X chromosome in female mammals including humans  could be inserted into the extra copy of chromosome  in lab cultures  Using skin cells from a person with Down syndrome they created pluripotent stem cells which can form a range of different body cell types When they inserted the XIST gene they found that it effectively silenced the extra chromosome  When they compared brain cells with and without the XIST gene they found that those in which the extra chromosome had been suppressed grew more quickly and were better able to form progenitors of other brain cells Lawrence said  Thats kind of useful right away she told NBC News There hasnt been a good way to understand whats wrong with these cells But her work was never targeted to eliminate the condition Lawrence added  I guess that we always thought that we were developing therapies to help children with Down syndrome We never thought for a moment we would aid in the eradication of it Lawrence said Thats a relief to geneticists like Skotko He worries about the demographics of the disorder which has been altered from an estimate of  people with Down syndrome in the US to  according to new research by Dr Edward RB McCabe chief medical officer at the March of Dimes The number of babies born with Down syndrome has been rising in the past decade McCabe found But research suggests that about  percent of women who receive a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome end their pregnancies And  in a country where women are delaying childbirth  there are not nearly as many Down syndrome births as there could have been  What if fewer babies with Down syndrome are being born and Down syndrome starts to inch closer to being a rare condition said Skotko The promise of new drug therapies and treatments may help he says giving hope to families expecting Down syndrome babies and to those with older children  and adults  Still Jawanda Mast says shes certain the questions raised by the new research will be debated for years in public meetings and in private conversations  Its an interesting thing because Rachels whole life theres been this discussion If you could take it away would you she said I think ethically were just taking the cap off the bottle
