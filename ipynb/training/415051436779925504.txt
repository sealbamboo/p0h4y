Despite White House and state   to promote the Affordable Care Act some people still dont have health insurance or any idea how to sign up for it Take Corryn Young a yearold dental hygienist in Fort Collins Colo She knows she needs to get health insurance but is a little vague on the details What my income would qualify me for when I need to be signed up what type of deductibles they have to offer  that kind of stuff overwhelms me Young says There are people available to help her with all of those questions The White House has set aside more than a quarter of a billion dollars nationally to pay navigators who can give people facetoface help  in buying coverage and in calculating subsidies to make it more affordable Navigators like Barbara Sigmon will sit down with Young and go over every aspect of her application Colorado got some of the most   to hire navigators Theres generally a lot more inperson help available in states that are cooperating with the health care law than in states not cooperating Navigators are working at   across Colorado  everyone from county health departments to local clinics to the state trucking association Meanwhile neighboring states Nebraska and Arizona arent embracing the health care law like Colorado is They have just two navigator organizations each and about  per uninsured person to spend on assisters Colorado has almost  per person There are dozens of people like Sigmon across Colorado just waiting for people to ask for help Business is sort of hit and miss she says Its either busy or its pretty slow But its starting to pick up and gain momentum as we do more of these outreach programs so that people know were here Sigmon is at a table near the exit of a local supermarket in Colorado Springs It was set up by   Colorados new health insurance marketplace and is stocked with brochures and little giveaway notebooks lip balm and stocking caps with Connect for Healths logo Sigmon says lots of people have heard of the marketplace but dont know about navigators Its because all the advertising thats going on on TV is advertising for the Connect for Health website she says Its not advertising for us Every person that Ive had come in is saying I heard about it from my mother my brother my friend  Connect for Health is starting to bring navigators out of their offices as part of a yearend marketing tour thats setting up tables at  different supermarkets and pharmacies across the state Corryn Young was on a break from work at the supermarket  and made exactly the kind of connection that the government and insurers hope for She spotted the Connect for Health table with just what she needed I was just getting Starbucks she says when she noticed the information table with a crowd of interested people around it It was a perfect place to get my questions answered Young says If I wanted to get signed up today they would have walked me through it and got me signed up I just have to go back to work Young made an appointment to follow up with a navigator And Barbara Sigmon booked several appointments for people who were glad to learn shes there They are very confused by the Affordable Care Act Sigmon says There are so many myths out there And especially Obamacare  they seem to think theyre being persecuted  so theres a lot of confusion Whether or not states are taking the federal money private groups are investing in outreach and enrollment too For example the   is sending volunteers to Denver neighborhoods knocking on every door and offering people help signing up for coverage But all of the effort has netted about   for private insurance in the states marketplace as of Dec Thats only about onefifth of the way to the states goal of enrolling  people by the end of March
