With a new White House push to promote the Affordable Care Act well underway the question is whether an improved HealthCaregov site and onslaught of positive talking points will be enough to bolster Senate Democrats facing tough races in  One reelection fight to watch is Democratic Sen Jeanne Shaheens in New Hampshire where shes been taking heat for supporting the new health care law Step inside a small diner called Chez Vachon in a workingclass section of Manchester NH and youd never guess the White House is actually regaining its footing on the health care rollout The president is reporting promising enrollment numbers and a faster website but John Hill couldnt care less He says the price of his insurance has skyrocketed We asked why the price of the insurance was so high says Hill They said Well the new Obamacare law Thats the reason why  That law had some pretty severe repercussions in New Hampshire A strong Tea Party faction in the state legislature voted down a state health insurance exchange so everyone in the state applying for insurance under the Affordable Care Act has to sign up on the federal government website But that federal exchange has drawn only one insurance provider for New Hampshire Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield And Anthem shut out  of the states  hospitals from its health plans on the exchange which means traveling in a car for an hour or more for many people in northern New Hampshire who need to see a doctor Hill says hes absolutely not voting for Shaheen next year She voted for this She knew what she was getting into says Hill Now she realizes Oh this is a big mistake  Shaheen was one of most vocal Democrats to criticize the launch of HealthCaregov Shes demanded an extension of the enrollment period and asked President Obama to appoint someone to oversee website fixes into next year Theresa Avard says Shaheens just trying to have it both ways by distancing herself from a law that so many people in New Hampshire hate You cant be a yoyo says Avard Im sorry you know Thats what I call my grandchildren when they dont do right They yoyo up and down But Shaheen rejects the suggestion that shes just protecting herself for the next election cycle This should not be about politics This should be about good policy says Shaheen Ive been working on health care issues since I first was elected to the state senate from the seacoast of New Hampshire over  years ago On this day shes touring the National Visa Center in Portsmouth to draw attention to a program granting visas for Iraqis and Afghans who risked their lives working for the US Since the rollout of the new health care law Shaheen hasnt hosted any town hall meetings But she says her office has been inundated with angry complaints from people upset about the launch Still Shaheen says Its a long time from now to November of  And I think were going to get the problems fixed with the health care law I think there will probably be other things that come up just as there are when were making that significant of policy change says Shaheen But the way to deal with it is to find those fixes Toppling Shaheen in  is going to take a formidable force She was a popular threeterm governor whos still enjoying pretty solid poll numbers For Shaheen right now Obamacare is the only cloud in the sky in New Hampshire says Dante Scala a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire So what she needs to do is just keep guard and not become complacent with what is clearly a winning position at this point Former Sen Scott Brown of Massachusetts keeps flirting with the idea of running against her and he has the star power but he still wont commit Bob Smith a former US senator has announced his candidacy but he still needs to move back to New Hampshire from Florida where he failed twice to win a Senate seat And the other Republican candidates just dont have much name recognition As split as New Hampshire is over the health care law its a big question whether people are going to be focusing on other things by next fall Back at Chez Vachon Bob Garon says Republicans need to give up on their obsession with the Affordable Care Act I really dont think that we are going to elect a politician because of Obamacare says Garon I think whats going to sink in is its the law  whether you like it or not You can bounce it around and play tennis with it all you want but its the damn law But the New Hampshire state Republican Party says it plans to make Obamacare a central issue next fall Theres no question that what voters care about right now is the collapse of Obamacare  the failed rollout the increased costs the decreased access to quality health insurance says Jennifer Horn chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party So absolutely that is something we will be talking about In recent months NPR staff has published a series of questionsandanswer stories related to the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare Now
