HealthCaregov was meant to create a simple easy way for millions of Americans to shop for subsidized health care Instead in a little two more than weeks it has become the   for the federal governments technical ineptitude A       clearly bears some of the blame But entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley likely would have approached the project differently from the start A week after the site launched   a jazz musician based in Philadelphia At that point Cloud had spent hours on the site trying to sign up for coverage Something went wrong and it just went to a page with all kinds of html stuff she said This week Cloud says she gave up on the website and ended up registering by phone The folks on the phone took all of her information  then asked if shed like to pick out her plan online or receive information about her health care options via snail mail Cloud chose snail mail Once I signed up with the telephone I didnt go back and try the site again she said At  days old HealthCaregov has become a bit of a joke  even to folks like Cloud who were eagerly awaiting its rollout So how could a roughly   software project that had been in the works for years have so many problems at its launch One bit of advice from Silicon Valley Start small Its not as if Facebook says OK here is our sixyear plan for how were going to make Facebookcom  says entrepreneur Ben Balter They build one feature at a time and take a step back look at how the feature is be used before they go on to the next feature Balter says you build something small you test it and when it works for your users then you take the next step Right now Balter works for   GitHub is a social codesharing service he says Think of it like Facebook for code So instead of posting pictures of your kids or posting  on Twitter what you had for lunch you are showing what projects youre working on By sharing the code you are writing lots of people can critique it find the bugs offer ideas and make sure it works Its called open source and Balter believes HealthCaregov should have been written that way from the start Why would you make that code private Balter asks But often when things dont work in government the impulse is to duck and cover and clamp down on information I think the key reason is the way projects get funded says Michael Cockrill who used to work in startups and is now the   He says to get a software project funded in the public sector typically you have say exactly what it is going to do spell how much it will cost and when you will finish As a result you end up creating this culture that is all about doing what you said you were gonna do Cockrill says Its a culture that is riskadverse and terrified of public failure You cant learn from little failures or adjust course midstream And instead of taking big jobs breaking them down into small tasks and testing for success at each step a project like HealthCaregov becomes a giant allornothing gamble Cockrill says too often its a gamble taxpayers loose Youve made all these commitments about what you are going to build What is it going to look like upfront Cockrill says And even if the market changes underneath you and even if your customers need something different  which you know always happens  you made a commitment a big public commitment and theyve written it into budgets and law Cockrill and many others around the country are trying to help governments become more flexible and agile as they embark on software development projects Its really hard to convince people to kind of trust you he says Especially when you are saying Look I dont know exactly what is going to look like  but we are going to do what matters most first
