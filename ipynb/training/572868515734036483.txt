Ubisoft has announced it is working on a video game to combat an eye disorder that can cause reduced vision Dig Rush is designed to be played on tablets by people diagnosed as having Amblyopia  also known as lazy eye The condition affects an estimated one in  children   and often causes them to see less clearly out of one eye than the other Ubisoft said it hoped the game would be more engaging and enjoyable than existing treatments The technique involved was developed by researchers at McGill University in Montreal Canada who initially carried out tests using a version of the blocksturning game Tetris before publicising their discovery in  French developer Ubisoft is best known for making entertainmentfocused video games including the Assassins Creed and Far Cry series as well as the choreographyfocused franchise Just Dance Its announcement was timed to coincide with the Game Developers Conference GDC in San Francisco Dig Rush requires the patient to wear bluered stereoscopic glasses  similar to the ones used for old D movies  while playing It works by showing some of its graphics in blue and some in red at differing levels of contrast so that each of the objects they represent becomes harder to see by one of the eyes This forces the player to use both their dominant and weaker eyes together in order to make progress rather than just relying on their stronger one or only seldom using the weaker one  Through repeated training the players brain should learn to improve coordination of both eyes helping the weak eye relearn how to see and potentially improving their sense of depth as a result Ubisoft said doctors would have the ability to adjust the games settings to suit specific patients conditions  Left untreated Amblyopia can result in the central vision of a persons lazy eye never reaching normal levels Studies carried out by the McGill team suggest twothirds of people who play such games regularly should experience improved vision in their weaker eye Amblyotech  a company that bought the researchers invention and licensed it to Ubisoft  said it believed the game was more effective than alternative techniques Current treatments options such as eye patching provide limited relief and have poor patient compliance due to discomfort and social stigmas said Joseph Koziak Amblyotechs chief executive He suggested that both children and adults could benefit from the treatment Amblyotech is currently seeking permission from the US Food and Drug Administration FDA to market the therapy in the US It acknowledges it will have to go through similar approval processes elsewhere before the game can be made available The Royal College of Ophthalmologists  which represents eye doctors in the UK  said it would need to see further evidence before being able to support the idea of medics prescribing the title The use of digital media is and has been researched and studied and shown to have some benefit said a spokeswoman As with all treatments their use must be based on scientific research and evidence to ensure a safe and effective benefit for patients
