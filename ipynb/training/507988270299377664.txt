Sure exercising can make you stronger happier and healthier But it can also make you stink And that polyester workout wear isnt helping Anyone with a drawerful of Tshirts knows that the synthetic ones can get sour after just a brief jog while oldschool cotton Tshirts remain relatively stinkfree all day And now science explains why The bacteria that flourish on a sweaty polyester Tshirt are different from those that grow on cotton researchers at the University of Ghent in Belgium found Polyester makes a happy home for   bacteria while   a common armpit denizen was found on both poly and cotton Polyester workout wear is light comfortable and dries quickly But its notorious for getting rank and staying that way Internet message boards are   on how to destink gym clothes but the perennial nature of the questions suggests that none of the answers  vinegar baking soda avoiding fabric softeners rinsing your clothes in the shower  works  percent of the time Microbes love the cozy warmth of the human armpit its like a trip to the tropics without ever having to leave home And its crowded in there Those microbes eat compounds in sweat and generate odors which support a flourishing deodorant industry One of the authors of this study Chris Callewaert is trying to figure out the causes of smelly pits a quest he details on his website   The scientists asked  volunteers to take a spinning class while wearing shirts made of cotton poly or blends The shirts were then incubated for a day and the microbes extracted and DNA fingerprinted Volunteers also had their armpits swabbed The   was published in the journal   It turns out the bugs on the shirts are different from the bugs in the pits While   is thought to be the main cause of armpit body odor there was no  on the clothes Instead   flourished on cotton and poly and   bacteria also known for making malodor loved polyester Its unclear how  gets on polyester clothing when its not a dominant species in the armpits Callewaert says Hes wondering if the bacteria might spread in the washing machine and is doing research to figure that out Hes also trying to help people with excessive body odor by giving them armpit bacteria transplants We have done transplants with about  people and most of them have been successful Callewaert a PhD student in applied biological sciences at the University of Ghent tells Shots All have had an effect short term but the bad odor comes back after a few months for some people Manufacturers have tried to make polyester fabric less hospitable to bacteria by impregnating it with antimicrobials like   or   Both products have been criticized as having potentially negative impacts on the environment and there are few data on how they might affect the wearer Callewaert thinks the ultimate solution will be something more organic  supplant bad bugs with good ones The bacteria has to do a war on its own he says If you have the good bacteria present eventually you have no bad odor
