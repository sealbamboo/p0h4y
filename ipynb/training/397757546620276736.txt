Lisa Dieckman a retired psychologist in Los Angeles likes the Affordable Care Acts promise that everybody can get health insurance But shes not happy about being told she cant keep her own coverage and will have to pay considerably more for a policy she doesnt consider any better Doug Normington who runs his own video production company in Madison Wis is also among those who recently got a cancellation letter from his health insurer Hes frustrated he cant find out about his options on the governments HealthCaregov website But hes glad he wont have to search high and low for an insurer that will cover him despite his diabetes  and welcomes the federal subsidy he expects to help pay the premium Statistics arent available yet but Dieckman and Normington may be among millions of Americans whose health insurance is   because their policies dont meet the requirements of the   The cancellations are making some people angry many anxious and opponents of the law feeling righteous They cite President Obamas repeated promise that people who like their current coverage could keep it In fact though the type of health insurance being canceled  nongroup policies that individuals buy on their own rather than through their employer  has   to abrupt cancellation sudden jumps in price and seemingly capricious restrictions on coverage The market for individual coverage has always been the most expensive the most volatile the least secure part of health insurance in the United States says John McDonough of the Harvard School of Public Health McDonough an architect of the   on which the Affordable Care Act is based acknowledges that the federal laws effect on buyers of individual coverage is a mixed bag but he claims by far the most of them will be better off Some of those folks will find theyre going to get much more affordable options he says And some of them  depending upon their age their geography and other factors  will find that it will   Its all about fixing what McDonough calls the most dysfunctional part of the health insurance system Around    about  percent of the nations population  buy health insurance on the individual market Theyre selfemployed like Normington retired from jobs that once provided group coverage like Dieckman or married to spouses whose employers dont provide family coverage like Meg Lanfear a violinist and selfemployed music teacher in Oak Park Ill She and her husband delayed having their first child for two years because the small firm he works for doesnt provide coverage for spouses And she couldnt find any insurer in Illinois willing to cover her because she had been successfully treated for cervical cancer She had to be cancerfree for three years one insurer said I basically waited until Blue Cross would insure me Lanfear says We just delayed our plans Lanfears hardwon coverage just got canceled too But shes happy shell be able to get new insurance to cover the birth of her hopedfor second child And under the new law maternity care will be standard I dont know if I can wrap my mind around it being a standard feature its been such an issue and ordeal Lanfear says But my feeling is that if the risk is spread across many people whether its cancer care or maternity coverage I think we all come out ahead in the end whether we end up using that part of our insurance or not That in fact is one of the major reforms of the individual insurance market McDonough says Insurers will no longer be able to reject   As of next year individual insurance policies will also come with some guaranteed benefits such as preventive and mental health care There will be caps on outofpocket costs a ban on lifetime limits and a curb on age or genderrelated discrimination in premiums There will also be   for consumers with incomes up to four times the federal poverty level  nearly  for individuals  for a family of four Dieckman the Los Angeles retiree says shes almost embarrassed about accepting the monthly premium subsidy of  that she expects under the Affordable Care Act She has an income of around  a year owns a mortgagefree home and has some savings I wrote to Obama saying I feel silly taking a subsidy she tells Shots On the other hand Im also not crazy about the fact that Ill be paying so much more Dieckmans insurer Kaiser Permanente has told her that her premium for a policy that complies with the new federal law will rise from  to  per month The subsidy will bring her cost down to around  One way to think about the subsidies for individual coverage is that theyre not welfare theyre a correction for an ageold inequity in US health insurance McDonough the Harvard policy specialist notes that people who get coverage through their workplace have always gotten   Those who buy coverage on their own have not
