Andy Serkis is known for bringing Gollum from The Lord of the Rings and the gorilla from King Kong to life using motioncapture technology He also plays Caesar in the justreleased Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and what many dont realize is that the technology doesnt make Serkis job any easier If you see it on film the actor did it in real life and that means he needs to be in top shape to play roles that involve biting off a Hobbit finger climbing the Empire State Building or overthrowing the human race in an apeocalypse One fact If youre going to climb Mount Doom it helps if you practice on the Matterhorn first A lot of people think its about learning monkey movements or a type of physicality and that is part of it but at the end of the day Im just an actor Ive been lucky enough to play some great characters but Ive developed a love for the technology because it allows you to do anything Ive found I was able to say something more about the human condition the further away I got from being human Caesar is a complex character in that he is a chimpanzee but hes almost a human in ape skin so it was putting together that human psychology with the ape physicality I based him on a particular chimpanzee named Oliver who behaved with very humantype attributes You really get put through your paces We spent a lot of time quadrupedal and using arm extensions to mimic the apes longer arms In the leadup to the shoots we had an ape camp where we stay in character for many hours and workshop the characters That by itself is a workout Youre sitting down on your haunches and your thighs are burning Youre hunched over and pulling in your stomach muscles Just being an ape is a workout Ever since I was  Ive been an avid mountaineer Ive climbed a lot in the Alps done rock climbing winter mountaineering and alpine climbing I climbed the Matterhorn in Switzerland in  Mountains have always played a significant part in my life and its helped with a number of the roles Ive played I have a road bike and a mountain bike and I tend to use them both a lot They help you keep your balance and your stamina I like to run as well We were shooting on location so youre out in woodlands on slippery surfaces running across logs and jumping off rocks Your body has to be tough and flexible There were a couple of big jumps I had to do that you have to hit a mark and be very accurate in a muddy rain forest My low back took a battering playing Gollum and then going from that into Kong I went from having a concave back with Gollum to a convex one as a gorilla so it was almost like remedial therapy It straightened me out I have ridden horses before but they definitely didnt like having apes on their backs There is a whole physicality in the way that we gripped them the way we rode and the way we would mount and dismount that were inhuman And also we were doing ape vocalizations so the horses found it a bit freaky I had to relearn how to ride a horse like an ape I had to change how I jumped off and how I gripped them with my thighs and distribute my weight differently
