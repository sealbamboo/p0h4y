More than three million home health aides  a lifeline for the elderly who are neither in institutions nor able to manage lifes mundane tasks on their own  are learning exactly how sclerotic the nations regulatory processes can be Nearly half of home health aides are so poorly paid they must rely on public benefits like food stamps and energy assistance Sixteen months ago President Obama promised to change Labor Department rules that exclude them from the protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act which guarantees minimum wage and overtime to all other categories of American workers The exclusion dates to  long before the demographic changes that are making this a country of older people  The aides are still waiting At the moment they are considered companions under the law  just like teenage baby sitters the kind who live down the block and watch your children for a few hours while you go out to dinner and the movies  Heres the thing the president   as the home care business has changed over the years the law hasnt changed to keep up He added that their inexcusable working conditions were just wrong and that he would guarantee they were paid fairly for a service that a growing number of older Americans could not live without The presidents speech was attended by Pauline Beck a home health aide from Oakland Calif who cared for an yearold amputee dressing him each morning settling him in his wheelchair cooking his breakfast and scrubbing his floors During his first campaign for the White House Mr Obama visited the pair and with cameras rolling   washing and folding laundry changing sheets and sweeping floors Frustrated but tentatively confident a promise made will be a promise kept Ms Beck recently noted that nobody does this work to get rich Such good will notwithstanding it will not be possible to fill the additional  million positions needed by  if conditions do not change  What has happened between then and now How does a simple rule change like this one stumble on its way from the presidents lips to the Federal Register   First in anticipation of drafting a proposed revision the Labor Department   during which interested parties could weigh in Then the department conducted an economic analysis of the annual costs of the change most to be borne by Medicare and Medicaid which would pay  million to  million more in reimbursement for home care Still those amounts would be more than offset by keeping the elderly out of expensive nursing homes where   Already  states and the District of Columbia assure home health aides  per hour the legal minimum wage as well and timeandahalf for overtime Four more states require only that these aides be paid the minimum wage But all of these states except Massachusetts Maine and New Jersey make certain exceptions designed to reduce costs like limiting overtime wages for livein aides who presumably are not caring for clients  Other exceptions include not requiring these payment rules for workers hired directly by the consumer from the socalled gray market usually on the recommendation of friends or neighbors rather than through an agency  Experts estimate that  percent of home health aides are found through the agency process Their services cost around  an hour but less than half goes directly to the aide the rest to the agency Forprofit agencies  an  billionayear industry led by Home Instead the nations largest provider of nonmedical home care  were initially the most vocal opponents of the rule change concerned that clients and their payers would not be able to afford the additional cost According to PHI formerly the Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute over half of home health aides are employed only part time and fewer than  in  earn overtime  After the Department of Labor submitted its proposal to the Office of Management and Budget a division called the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs began a day comment period another chance for advocates opponents and just plain folks to have their say  The comment period has been extended twice According to PHI which advocates for better conditions for lowwage workers more than  comments were received  percent in support of the change The Office of Management and Budget declined to respond to questions about this process citing a longstanding policy not to comment on rules under review After the extended period ended a few months ago the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs began a review of the Department of Labors costbenefit analysis and explored alternatives for reaching the desired outcome But the deliberations surely were slowed midway by the resignation of Cass R Sunstein the official heading Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and a longtime associate of Mr Obama  Mr Sunstein   from the Chamber of Commerce to the environmental community before choosing the groves of academe at Harvard Law School to the jostle of Washington Mr Obama announced Mr Sunsteins replacement just last week Howard Shelanski an attorney and economist During the review interested parties may meet face to face with regulators and the Office of Management and Budgets public records show that at least eight such meetings have occurred While representatives from Home Instead were among those who continued to lobby against the changes the directors of state Medicaid programs already strapped for funds became increasingly active in their opposition So did advocates for the disabled They were joined by disability rights advocates concerned that many of the disabled did need roundtheclock help which they feared would be limited by the overtime requirements Neither group was mollified by the suggestion that one fulltime worker could be substituted with aides on shifts so none would qualify for timeandahalf The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has extended the time for its own review to May  At that point the president or vice president may intervene if they do not endorse the outcome of the long process Bruce C Vladeck former administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration and also an employer of home health care aides for his own mother said that he had never seen such a clear instance of condoning the exploitation of millions of people Mr Vladeck said he was heartened by the presidents clear and public statements that the home care workers were being denied justice On the other hand Mr Vladeck said he was increasingly concerned by the delays at the Office of Management and Budget  Stay tuned May  is approaching the deadline for resolution of this ongoing travail The president and vice president may have far more pressing matters on their todo lists But they promised Pauline Beck
