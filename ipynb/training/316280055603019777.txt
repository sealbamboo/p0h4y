Last summer Bill Gates and his foundation held a competition to   Now hes hoping to do the same for condoms The Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation    to the best proposal for a more fun and pleasurable condom The competition is part of its   which has already doled out nearly  million for quirky but effective solutions to global health problems like microwaves to treat malaria and an electronic nose to detect tuberculosis But why do condoms need revamping Well modern condoms have some great assets Theyre cheap discreet and prevent sexually transmitted diseases including HIV But the Gates Foundation which supports NPR says that a lot of men perceive them as interfering with the pleasure of sex and that means they wont use them consistently The   or shortages is another problem in a lot of developing countries according to the United Nations So the foundation is calling for new shapes materials and packaging that significantly preserve or enhance pleasure in order to improve uptake and regular use Trojan and Durex have been trying to do this for decades with ribs contours and lubricants But we know empirically that those dont work as claimed the Gates Foundations Stephen Ward recently   the Humanosphere blog The idea here is to seed innovative ideas To get a sense of what kinds of ideas theyre keen on have a look at the post he and a colleague recently   on The Impatient Optimists blog First there are the   Shaped like miniature accordions these silicone rubbers fit loosely and aim to simulate the feeling of sex without a condom They also boast a  seconds application time the companys website   which presumably means they go on easily Others are searching for a solution for the ladies Bioengineers at the University of Washington have developed a super fine cloth that slowly releases spermicides and antiHIV drugs The material which selfassembles in an electric field could coat a vaginal ring or get inserted inside a woman the inventors recently   in the journal   Although the first female condom didnt appear until  male condoms date back to at least the th century when the Italian physician Gabriele Falloppio advocated a linen cloth soaked in chemicals to prevent syphilis Over the next few centuries condom material evolved from animal intestines and bladder to rubber and then latex But since the s the technology has changed little Ward tells Humanosphere while material science neurobiology and medicine have come a long way during this time Thats also why the  condom challenge is open to anyone who can come up with a gamechanging condom design in   by May
