Greek yogurt with its beneficial probiotic bacteria high protein content and rich flavor is one of the most popular health foods in America comprising a billion dollar market  But few people have as much appreciation for Greek yogurt  or expertise in making it  as Maria Loi an acclaimed chef author and host of television cooking shows that have aired in her native Greece and on PBS  For Ms Loi Greek yogurt is far more than a snack or breakfast item It finds its way into nearly all of her recipes She uses it in place of butter when baking cakes cookies brownies pie crusts and quick breads Where other chefs might use milk cream mayonnaise or sour cream Ms Lois recipes call for Greek yogurt instead Ms Loi finds that the yogurt keeps these foods moist and flavorful and as an added bonus it gives them a boost of protein But dont mention the commercial varieties of Greek yogurt found in many supermarkets Many of these are loaded with sugar and stripped of their natural fats which Ms Loi considers sacrilege She only trusts one or two brands and usually prefers to make her own yogurt using a family recipe as she has since she was a child Born and raised in Nafpaktos about three hours west of Athens Ms Loi has owned gourmet restaurants in Greece and in New York City where her homemade yogurt is used to make everything from parfaits to cheesecake and even ice cream She is the author of Ancient Dining the official book of the  Athens Olympic Games  Recently she published her latest cookbook The Greek Diet with recipes rich in yogurt nuts and olive oil We caught up with Ms Loi to talk about her new book her love of Greek cuisine and why she considers real Greek yogurt one of the pillars of a healthful diet  and even a beauty product  How did you learn to cook Did you learn from your parents I have to confess My mother didnt know how to cook But she used to make the best yogurt ever Thats how I got the recipe My grandmother and my greatgrandmother they were amazing in the kitchen They could make  different dishes in half an hour Thats a talent that I got from them As a child I would cook different foods every day and my grandmother would help me But as I got older I left Greece stopped cooking and started eating bad foods  What happened I became a lobbyist and I had to travel a lot I thought this kind of life would be better for me But I was always on the road and I was eating more Americanized foods  lots of packaged snacks chips and prepared food at airports I gained so much weight   pounds in two and a half years I tried dieting and would lose a few pounds but then it would come back Then one day I said to myself Enough Im changing my life Im going to cook People thought I was crazy How could she leave her career to do this But thank God I did because cooking makes me happy  What happened after you gave up life as a lobbyist I closed the book on that career and I went back to Thermo my village in Greece I wanted my life to be simple again I started growing tomatoes a lot of herbs making yogurt again And I went back to eating olive oil I lost so much weight and I wasnt as hungry anymore That was almost  years ago I didnt have the expertise as a chef back then but I had the expertise to cook And all of my friends would come over to eat Id have  people in my house for dinner Then one day my friend who was an anchorwoman said Maria come cook on TV with us You have to have a show The show became very popular Eventually I came to New York and opened a restaurant and here I am I love this town  Whats your favorite recipe in the new book I love things with yogurt and olive oil If you cut my vein olive oil will spill out But my favorite recipe in the book is the blackeyed beans with spinach and Swiss chard You can have it with two or three tablespoons of yogurt Its tasty and so easy to make  In the book you say that yogurt was a big part of your childhood How so When I was growing up we always had a big bowl of homemade yogurt in the kitchen When my siblings and I complained that we were hungry my parents didnt give us junk food There were no potato chips cookies or packaged foods They would tell us Go eat yogurt My grandmother used to say it was the food for everyone in our family from babies to the very old  Greek yogurt is a staple in your recipes What do you think of the commercial varieties in stores When I was growing up in Greece I never saw my mother or grandmother making zero percent yogurt Im sorry but thats not Greek yogurt Thats another kind of yogurt These yogurts have a lot of sugar and if you look at the small print on the labels they add thickeners to them Greek yogurt for me has to be strained and it has to have fat With real Greek yogurt you dont have to eat a lot You can eat three tablespoons and thats enough Youll be full and youll love it  Where can people find real Greek yogurt Ive seen real Greek yogurt in some supermarkets In New York you can find one at Zabars The brand name is Keso Its very good fullfat yogurt It doesnt have thickeners in it like the other yogurt or sugar If you put sugar in there it changes everything  Do you always replace butter with Greek yogurt  For me Greek yogurt works with everything and its better for food and life in general  as long as its  percent fat and up  I never cook with butter so I dont think about yogurt replacing butter as I usually replace butter with olive oil  But in some of my cakes I do use yogurt instead of other fats   That being said I believe in appropriate fats for appropriate foods What I mean by this has to do with location and availability In Greece we have lots and lots of olives and therefore lots of olive oil If we were to use butter it would come from goats milk because goats are much more prevalent in Greece  and goat butter is different both in flavor and in its health benefits   In your book you mentioned using Greek yogurt as a beauty product How so Greek yogurt isnt only for eating When I was a child I learned from my grandmother that it helps hydrate your skin making it soft and smooth My grandmother would use it as a beauty mask when all the men were working in the field She said it was better for you than any other beauty remedy And on very sunny days in Greece when I got sunburned my grandmother would use a thick layer of yogurt to coat my skin soothing it and cutting the healing time I still do this today and it still works perfectly for me Whats your favorite dessert I love yogurt with some sesame and some honey or pomegranate seeds Its fantastic And I always have Greek coffee for dessert I can drink it at  oclock at night and still go to sleep Thats exactly like my grandfather used to do He used to say I never did anything bad to anyone thats why I can sleep Its not the coffee that is keeping you up  its whatever you did that day In your book you talk about the health benefits of eating Greek But   in the Mediterranean as people eat more processed foods Have you noticed these changes in your village  This happened because people started eating a more westernized diet But now with the bad economy in Greece people in my village have gone back to eating the way they did in the past Theyre eating more beans nuts seeds whole grains and eggs Theyre growing more herbs fruits and vegetables Theyre eating yogurt that they make every day And they drink their own wine Young people now know what to eat Theyre eating the way theyre grandparents ate Theyre eating healthy again Not just in my village but throughout Greece So the bad economy is actually improving peoples health  least something good came out of it Tzatziki is one of the most wellknown Greek condiments available and for good reason  it pairs perfectly with most foods and adds a healthy herbaceous kick to anything it touches Serve as a sauce for vegetables chicken pasta or eggs or as an appetizer with crudits or grilled wholegrain pita  cucumbers
