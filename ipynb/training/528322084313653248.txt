Who hasn't complained about the time it takes to work out? For those days when time is about as precious as a Birkin handbag, there's a class that cuts the time in half without cutting the sweat. At a cozy little studio in Studio City, I spent a half-hour pushing and pulling muscles on a Da Vinci BodyBoard, a contraption that can be used in various ways to get the most out of your time.. The long board, which sits just a bit off the floor, has stretchy bands and ankle straps to boost the effort, and provides a low-impact cardio-pumping workout that aims to provide an even workout for all the muscles. Floery Mahoney created the board three years ago after she gave up her career making chocolates.. , 11650 Riverside Drive, Studio City, . The studio is tiny, with mirrors all around and a small-town feel. "It's about challenge, balance and improvement. Not perfection," says studio co-owner Lora Pavilack..  Half an hour. Each exercise — including jumping jacks and push-ups — is done for just one minute, sometimes with 15-second breaks in between. How hard can that be? Hard, it turns out..  Supportive and encouraging. Anything's possible for 60 seconds, right? "Keep it going, this is the end. Blast out the cardio," the teacher encouraged as the exercises grew in difficulty and the students decreased in oomph.. : $30 for a single class, but packages available. Pilates and other classes are also available.
