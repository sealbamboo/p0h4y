A halfcentury ago dogs lived in barns or backyards domiciled in shabby little doghouses Now they have the run of our houses and apartments They sleep in our beds full disclosure In some cases they are considered by their owners to be like children and possibly a bit cleaner So it is not so strange that the connected technologies that are creeping into the lives of humans are doing the same for pets Wearable pet activity trackers keep tabs on Bellas or Bears   Some go further monitoring dogs heart and respiratory rates and tracking locations in case they escape their homes Webcams allow people who are away from home to monitor communicate and play games with their pets breaking up the monotony of lonely days Whats making all these devices possible is an abundance of increasingly inexpensive miniature components created for the smartphone business wireless chips motion sensors and highresolution camera lenses that can be jammed into petfriendly devices Smartphone apps meanwhile are giving people a way to visualize the biometric data these devices collect and to snoop on pet behavior from anywhere with a wireless connection These device manufacturers are chasing the growing pile of money people are lavishing on animals Total annual spending on pets in this country including food veterinary care and medicine more than tripled over the past two decades to  billion last year according to the   The tighter bond between household animals and the people formerly known as owners has established pet wellness as a serious business and tech firms are taking note It is the idea of being able to interact with your pet in a more meaningful way said Con Slobodchikoff an emeritus professor of biology at Northern Arizona University Right now pretty much all people have is voice to interact with their pets or touch People want more Heidi Hurn recently clipped one of these gadgets the   to the collar of Hoosier her yearold chocolate Labrador retriever This  brushed metal device about the dimensions of a ketchup bottle cap records when he is active for how long and at what intensity level  It is the canine equivalent of the Jawbone UP a fitness tracker that Ms Hurn bought for her fianc Through an app on her iPhone Ms Hurn  who works in medical device sales in Seattle can see a bar chart showing how hard and for how long her dog walker is exercising Hoosier She can see how active he is when she and her fianc are not at home Revealed Hoosier is sacked out from five minutes after they leave until the moment they get home Ms Hurn said she and her fianc got the device because Hoosiers veterinarian emphasized that keeping him active is likely to extend his life She said the detailed logs of his exercise make the couple feel more responsible We are very attentive parents she said Hes our only child I too recently put a Whistle on the collar of Mitzi my yearold pit bullLabrador retriever mix After a few days I was able to compare her activity level to other mixedbreed dogs I felt small glow of pride when the Whistle app sent me a congratulatory text after Mitzi surpassed her daily exercise goal four days in a row More wearable tech for pets is on the way  Already on sale is a collar device called   that combines activity monitoring with location tracking to help recover lost pets   an activity tracker available later this year also monitors a dogs heart and respiratory rates We really see ourselves as the wellness coach for the life of the dog said Jeff Noce president of iC Innovations the maker of Voyce Its possible the data from these devices could eventually help medical researchers better understand pet ailments According to a   commissioned by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention more than  percent of dogs and more than  percent of cats are overweight or obese conditions which can lead to   and worsen   A   commissioned by Purina the pet food company found that a dogs median life span can be extended by  percent by restricting the diet to maintain ideal weight or almost two years for the Labrador retrievers in the survey Veterinarians have used expensive motion sensors for years to study pet activity levels but they say the new devices aimed at pet owners have the potential to be used far more broadly Im very excited about the activity monitors said Dr Ernie Ward a veterinarian and founder of the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention The solitude of pets is another concern that technology is tackling Many animals spend hours alone at home while their owners are at the office   lack of exercise and other factors can lead to destructive tendencies  is a wireless security camera that can also be used as a pet monitor It has a microphone and speaker so people can both speak to and hear their pets via a mobile app  I used a Dropcam to spy on Mitzi who had positioned herself on a couch in my living room while I was out of the house Through the speaker I ordered her down She cocked her head like the   and stared at the camera  and didnt move Im hoping for an update of the product that includes pet obedience A device called   coming out in May combines a webcam microphone and speakers with a lowintensity laser pointer the direction of which can be controlled remotely through a smartphone Owners will be able to play games with their cats and dogs using the laser assuming the animals are receptive to the idea of chasing a bright red light around a room People will be able to invite Facebook friends to play with their pets too by sharing access to their Petcubes While cats seem to pursue lasers without problems Dr Margaret Gruen a veterinary behaviorist at North Carolina State University said using a laser pointer with dogs could lead them to become shadow and light chasers a compulsive behavior Dr Gruen said it was unclear what effect owners talking to their pets through a webcam could have When they cant see them will that be confusing or comforting she said I dont think we know yet There are effective medications and behavior changes for treating separation anxiety in pets and playing classical music while an owner is gone can relax dogs too Dr Gruen said While it isnt clear yet whether these new technologies actually improve the lives of pets they are certainly likely to answer the emotional needs of many pet parents Remember the Baby Einstein DVDs said to enhance the intellectual development of infants Theres this industry that springs up around selling highly specialized products that will allow you to feel like youre doing a better job of parenting said Aaron Easterly the chief executive of the dogsitting website   Its really the exact same pitch for these products
