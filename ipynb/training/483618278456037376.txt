The Supreme Court has ruled that family owned and other closely held companies can opt out of the Affordable Care Acts provisions for nocost prescription contraception in most health insurance if they have religious objections The owners of the Hobby Lobby chain of arts and crafts stores and those of another closely held company Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp had objected on the grounds of religious freedom The ruling affirms a Hobby Lobby victory in a lower court and gives new standing to similar claims by other companies Todays decision jeopardizes the health of women who work at the companies included in the courts decision White House press secretary Josh Earnest said The AP reports that Earnest said the White House is looking into how many women could be affected by the decision He said Congress should take action to assist women affected by the decision The court concludes that there is an alternative to the contraceptive mandate in the opinion that   to the Supreme

against their religious beliefs about abortion The Department of Health and Human Services argued that the companies forfeited protection under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of  when they became corporations instead of other legal entities That  law requires that the government not infringe on religious beliefs unless that action constitutes the least restrictive means of serving a

enterprises  can opt out of any law saving only tax laws they judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious beliefs She added that The exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga would
