Samantha Schoech has struggled with weight for most of her life I am sort of a lifelong yoyo dieter and like many women weight is a frustrating topic for me she tells NPRs Arun Rath As a feminist she faces another struggle  the tricky prospect of balancing societys expectations of body image without giving into them and also wanting to be healthy She wrote about this tension  I live as many women do in sort of this frustrating dichotomy between wanting to be filled with selfacceptance and a sense of power and efficacy and value and being constantly told All thats great but if youre overweight youre sort of a loser  Recently she crossed the line into clinical obesity Shed successfully lost weight before but felt that she couldnt do it alone this time She sought out a diet clinic in the San Francisco Bay area and on her first visit she was prescribed a diet pill called phentermine Phentermine is one half of the infamous diet pill fenphen which was hugely popular in the s Fenphen was taken off of the market after multiple lawsuits and mulitibilliondollar settlements But phentermine remains a widely popular drug in the United States I chose to take it because I felt like anything that might help was welcome Schoech explains The truth of the matter is you know I have a certain amount of vanity and I care about how I look to a certain extent I am not trying to be a supermodel by any stretch of the imagination I am trying to be a healthy yearold mother of two Honestly I took that pill without a backwards glance I was sort of at a point of desperation mostly because I was tired of how much brain space my weight was taking up in my life I have a family I have a career I have a marriage I have friends I dont have time to spend  percent of my time loathing my body Plus I just honestly didnt like the way I look so you know theres vanity in there too  I didnt take the time to do any research before I started taking phentermine and it was only after I dropped about  pounds that I went and found out what the   are I personally have not had any negative side effects so Im still taking it I didnt tell anybody I didnt even tell my husband in part because I didnt want it to lessen my accomplishment I felt like if people saw my use of phentermine as this crutch they would write off my efforts  I was a blogger for a long time and Ive sort of had it with people weighing in on my decisions and my life Mostly its been overwhelmingly positive and people have been grateful for me stepping into this conversation about feminism and body image and dieting and health and secrets we keep and all of that But theres been some criticism too I mean somebody told me that it was irresponsible of me as a mother to take phentermine  I got a comment on the story saying Dont listen to the lies Go on an ego diet and binge on love
