Whooping cough was once one of the leading killers of babies around the world Now that its largely controlled with a vaccine scientists have had a chance to figure out how the disease came into being in the first place That story is told in a   published online this week in the journal   And it turns out that   arose quite late in human history  at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge England was one of more than a dozen scientists who pulled together a few hundred samples of the bacterium that causes whooping cough   The teams aim to create a pertussis family tree Its very much like doing a genealogical study and being able to say Ive identified my greatgreatgrandfather who lived between these dates Parkhill tells NPR In this case the scientists discovered that the ancestor of modernday pertussis emerged suddenly in the th or th century That isnt very long ago Parkhill says And really that was quite a surprise The genetic analysis is consistent with historical documents The distinctive cough with its whooping sound was mentioned in a Korean medical text from the th century The first documented epidemic arose in Paris in  Before that there was no sign of such a distinctive disease Its not mentioned in any of the Ancient Greek or any of the Ancient Egyptian records or anything like that Parkhill says A close reading of the genes also provides clues about where the human disease came from It appears to have evolved from a single event and that event was the adaptation to the human population he says It seems that a closely related bacterium found in dogs rabbits and many other animals mutated That change turned the bacterium into one that spreads easily from person to person and causes that agonizing cough The genetic analysis suggests that event happened several thousand years ago But for whatever reason the highly contagious disease remained hidden for thousands of years before it burst out as a fullfledged human disease That has implications for   today The bacterium continues to evolve and one consequence is the current vaccine isnt as effective as it used to be Parkhill says its time to use this new genetic information to tune up the vaccine For influenza we come out with a new vaccine every year or two Parkhill says Fortunately pertussis changes much more slowly so its much easier to keep up with it The current vaccine has been highly successful Though there have been a few notable outbreaks the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   that the vaccine has prevented  million cases of pertussis in the United States since
