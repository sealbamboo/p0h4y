Reading the latest   made me think of Mad magazine Not that I want to compare Pew analysts who carefully tabulated survey results from more than  people in  countries to the usual gang of idiots as the magazine often refers to its contributors But look at this Among the many questions they asked respondents How much of a problem if at all is the growing number of older people in your country In East Asia the proportion answering that it was a major problem was particularly high  percent in Japan  percent in South Korea and more than twothirds in China In European countries  to  percent described aging in those terms And Americans Only  percent expressed that much concern near the bottom of the scale with only Indonesia and Egypt below us Another question investigated peoples sense of whether they would have an adequate standard of living in their own old age In  countries fewer than half of respondents were very or somewhat confident of a secure future in Japan Italy and Russia the proportion sank below a third But not here Though Americans werent as ebullient about our old age as the Chinese with several years of explosive growth behind them or the Brazilians and Nigerians most of us think things are going to be just fine in our senior years Sixtythree percent of respondents in the United States expressed confidence  a sharply lower proportion than before the Great Recession but still higher than in most of the other countries surveyed Pew senior researcher Rakesh Kochhar pointed out several justifications for our remaining relatively unperturbed The US is aging but at a slower pace than the rest of the world and slower than its economic partners and peers in Europe China or Japan he said in an interview Several decades of high immigration have kept the fertility rate from a sharp decline Other countries see fertility rates dropping at a much faster pace Dr Kochhar said So while we are currently much older on average than citizens of Mexico for example where the median age is  compared with our  by  Mexico will have passed us Its median age will be  to our  So it is not completely delusional for us to be less worried than some countries Lets acknowledge too that an older population  particularly when people are healthier and more likely at least in this country to remain in the work force than in past decades  brings benefits as well as challenges Still given economists alarm over how little Americans save for retirement the galloping health care costs we are just beginning to rein in the lack of a safety net for longterm care the exhausted family caregivers who will eventually have to rely on fewer children when they need care themselves  given all that how can we be so whatmeworry Americans are optimistic about their own futures Dr Kochhar said with exquisite diplomacy Thats not all we are Pew asked who should bear the greatest responsibility for peoples economic wellbeing in their old age In many countries  including Spain Kenya Argentina Israel Egypt and Russia  the majority said the government had primary responsibility Most other countries named both families and the government as most responsible But in the United States the greatest number of respondents  percent said older people themselves ought to shoulder the burden Its an outlier view Only in three other countries  South Korea where a public pension program has only recently begun Germany and Britain  did a sizable percentage agree Which sort of explains things doesnt it No wonder we seem unconcerned We look at the challenges of an aging society and say Not our problem Not the governments problem  percent either or even families responsibility  percent Americans who in this study seemed to shrug and say seniors are or should be on their own are the Alfred E Neumans of the world
