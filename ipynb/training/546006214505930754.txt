Two new studies both released Monday offer additional evidence  if any were really needed  that breastfeeding can be really really difficult for mothers In   published in the journal   researchers interviewed firsttime mothers at the UC Davis Medical Center to assess their breastfeeding practices concerns and problems before they gave birth and on several occasions over the first two months of their babies lives  They found that  of mothers reported breastfeeding concerns at the peak time of difficulty their childs third day of life  including problems feeding concerns about milk supply concerns about their ability to breastfeed and pain Women who reported problems were less likely to continue breastfeeding than those who didnt so the authors recommended that all newborns be evaluated by a lactation expert The second study in   examined the    a controversial subject because research has linked bedsharing to increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome and suffocation The research team examined data from a study called the Infant Feeding Practices Study II which surveyed several thousand women around the US ages  or older who gave birth to healthy singleton babies  The mothers answered one questionnaire before they had their babies and   followup questionnaires over the following year  which examined feeding and sleeping practices Compiling the results the researchers found that babies who slept on the same sleeping surfaces as their mothers tended to breastfeed longer than those who did not  The durations of any and exclusive breastfeeding were longest in the often bedsharing group and shortest in the rare and nonfeeding groups Babies who slept in infant cosleepers which attach to the side of a parents bed were not considered to be bedsharing In this study as in the Pediatrics report around  of mothers interviewed said they had breastfeeding problems in the period immediately after childbirth But even though bedsharing may mitigate some of those problems the studys authors warned that the benefits of the practice must be tempered by the known safety risks associated with infantparent bedsharing and that there were other factors also associated with breastfeeding success such as older maternal age and higher education We are supportive of the recommendations to place infants to sleep in a separate but proximate location rather than sleeping in the same bed they wrote But they also noted that the study did not examine whether separatebutproximate sleeping arrangements such as cosleepers or placing a crib in the parents bedroom promote breastfeeding as successfully as bedsharing does They called for new research to help find out In the meantime new mothers feeding struggles are likely to continue The American Academy of Pediatrics publisher of the journal Pediatrics also offers a   and a
