A few years ago the Food and Drug Administration announced   saying that electrical wires in some St Jude Medical heart   which were implanted in tens of thousands of people were defective It was a rerun for cardiac patients In  Medtronic recalled its Sprint Fidelis cardiac devices   In both cases the FDA warned that   and   between living with the leads under close monitoring or having dangerous surgery to replace them Both companies reported deaths linked to the flawed leads 
 Now a new paper by Harvard researchers using records only recently made available by the FDA explains how the faulty leads got onto the market shedding light on a littleknown process used by manufacturers   An approval pathway for lowerrisk medical devices called the k clearance has received more public scrutiny including   
 For socalled highrisk devices like heart defibrillators the FDA typically requires proof of safety and effectiveness in clinical trials with real patients under reallife conditions But once such a device receives initial approval the researchers found an administrative maneuver permits companies to tinker with it  making the electrical wire thinner for example  without testing the changes in a single patient The process called a premarket approval supplement application allows manufacturers to get upgrades and improvements to patients faster medical device companies say The application is intended for a change to an already approved PMA that has met the agencys rigorous requirements for safety and effectiveness said Janet Trunzo senior executive vice president for technology and regulatory affairs with   a trade association She noted that the FDA could require a more rigorous review process if necessary The problem is that a device can be modified over and over even dozens of times without ever being put through new trials in patients From  and  the researchers found the FDA approved  new cardiacimplanted electronic devices like pacemakers and defibrillators During that same period the agency approved nearly  supplement applications A spokesman for Medtronic said the company   but the trials were begun in November  around the time the company also   and the resulting data were not shared with the FDA before the thinner leads went on the market The study was published only in  shortly before the recall For each device that went through the full premarket approval process  subsequent changes were made researchers also found Over time the accumulation of changes may lead to a device that is substantially different than the original product said Dr Aaron S Kesselheim senior author of   published in JAMA the journal of the American Medical Association Most of topselling devices that are out on the market now have all been approved via supplements for the last  years he said They are substantially different from the versions originally approved he said While some of the supplement changes were minor like rewriting instructions or changing the color  percent involved a change to the devices design Dr Kesselheim and his colleagues said Companies are not required to mention the changes on the package labels and generally do not As a result doctors are often unaware which version of the device they are implanting said   a cardiologist and professor at University of California San Francisco who   These supplements are not just flying under patients radar screens theyre flying under doctors radar screens Dr Redberg said The recalled wire in St Judes defibrillator was approved as a supplement to a device whose original design had been approved in  but had undergone  supplementary revisions according to the research The recalled Sprint Fidelis lead was approved as a supplement to a device originally approved in  and modified  times These leads may have worked in the lab but that is very different from what happens inside a human blood vessel Dr Redberg said People move around theyre very complex and the lead is going to be exposed to a lot more stress and forces of resistance Clinical trials dont always find rare complications But the failure rate in St Judes device was high enough that it would have been noticed in a trial she said The pace of supplements has increased significantly during the past decade to  a year from  the researchers found The last time an implantable cardioverter defibrillator went through a full rigorous premarket approval process was in  the researchers said indicating that all models released since then have been supplements to existing models But since a Supreme Court decision in  determined that manufacturers were immune from liability for personal injuries as long as their devices had been approved by the FDA injured patients who want to sue   Dr Kesselheim and his colleagues put forth several proposals in their article suggesting the FDA convene a panel of experts to review approved medical devices every five to seven years and determine whether the clinical data from the older models still applied to the newer versions But the agency appears to have rejected the idea An automatic advisory panel review is not a necessary or efficient use of FDA or taxpayer resources said Susan Laine a spokeswoman
