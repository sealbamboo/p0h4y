When the government created the   Drugs Fund CDF in  to pay for cancer drugs rejected by the National Institute for Care and Health Excellence Nice it was intended as a shortterm stopgap until a longerterm solution to the problem of evaluating and funding cancer drugs for terminally ill patients could be developed The fund which was given m a year to spend on drugs was set up in a context of media stories about cancer patients being denied lifeextending drugs Since then  patients have received drug treatments funded by the CDF Although initially welcomed by cancer charities many feel it has outstayed its welcome Owen Sharp chief executive of Prostate Cancer UK says it creates an additional layer of bureaucracy with the result that patients in some parts of the country are less likely to receive drugs from the fund than others adding The fund was set up as a short to mediumterm fix and I think it has proved to be exactly that It soon became clear that the fund was going to overspend its budget and in January NHS England announced that it would remove funding for  of the drugs currently paid for from the CDF although it also added four new drugs While patients already on those drugs will continue to receive them they will not be available for new patients Paul Catchpole director of value and access at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry ABPI has reservations about the process by which the decision was reached Nice uses a very sophisticated approach to evaluate medicines taking all the different costs and benefits into account whereas the approach that   England took is a much more blunt instrument Cancer charities too are unhappy with the decision Diana Jupp director of services and campaigns of Breast Cancer Care says that women who might have benefited from being moved on to certain drugs would now be denied them Taking away that potential option of a longer extended lifetime with your family is really frightening The CDF is now being propped up with more money it will receive m in  and m in  In the meantime the proportion of new cancer drugs rejected by Nice has grown in  Nice rejected nearly  of new cancer drugs put forward for approval compared with  in  The government is committed to maintaining the CDF until March  and has said it will consider what arrangements should be put in place in the longer term The Labour party has said it will create a m Cancer Treatments Fund starting when the CDF runs out which will fund the latest forms of radiotherapy and surgery as well as drugs The Liberal Democrats have not yet made an announcement about their plans Yet there is widespread agreement among stakeholders that the fund is not viable in the long term and that a better solution needs to be found A working party was set up last month with representatives from NHS England the Department of   cancer charities Nice the Ethical Medicines Industry Group and the ABPI to agree a system to replace the CDF  which may well entail giving decisionmaking back to Nice Emlyn Samuel senior policy manager at Cancer Research UK argues that this would give Nice a lot more control over negotiations with pharmaceutical industries about how drugs can be priced appropriately for the NHS However deciding which drugs provide value for money and which dont is not straightforward The cancer drugs approved by the CDF extend life rather than offer a cure They are expensive a drug known to prolong life for a few months may cost tens of thousands of pounds  though Mark Flanagan CEO of Beating Bowel Cancer points out that the market price often quoted is higher than the discounted price offered to individual trusts Nice uses a measure known as qualityadjusted life years to evaluate whether a drug gives value for money and is based on the quality and quantity of additional life a drug would provide The figures are set against the particular cost of a drug As Flanagan says It gives a health economists measure of what is valuable which is different from what life tells us is valuable Sharp agrees Many patients would prefer a drug that gave say two years of good quality life over five years of poor quality he says And Jupp argues that while reports on clinical trials show a drug extending life for three to six months for individual women it may give two years or more Many women living with secondary breast cancer are still at work theyre still looking after their children caring for their parents so that value is quite high There are other reasons why the current system is less than satisfactory Flanagan says that Nices evaluation of cancer drugs is based on clinical trial data that is by nature shortterm In the real world a cancer drug may shrink a tumour which then makes it possible to remove the tumour by surgery That cumulative benefit he says is completely ignored in the assessment of the drugs value and clinical effectiveness Furthermore he argues cancer doctors take an increasingly targeted approach to treating patients in the knowledge that individual patients with particular types of tumour will respond differently to treatment Were getting to the stage where youre getting smaller and smaller patient populations and you need to have a very complex and real life approach to what works So what should be the longterm approach to funding cancer drugs Flanagan suggests a system of paying drug companies according to how effectively their drug performs in practice Catchpole would like to see an approach where once a drug has been approved by the regulator access could be granted while data is collected about its real life impact It means that patients can continue to benefit and at the same time we start to gather more evidence In practice the approach will have to be hammered out by the industry working in partnership with patient groups Nice and the Department of Health Everyone agrees that it will be difficult but there is a consensus that the CDF is not the solution As Samuel says Wed like to see a day when there isnt a need for the Cancer Drugs Fund because Nice appraisal processes work effectively for cancer drugs
