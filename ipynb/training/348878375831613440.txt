At the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange in Carson City Nev workers have been counting down the days until Oct  on an office corkboard Sunday is a big milestone   days to the deadline for opening the online marketplaces that are a linchpin of the federal health law known as Obamacare  We certainly will need every one of the days that we have left said Jon Hager executive director of the Nevada exchange But I am confident we will be ready to go   Nevada is one of  states racing to launch their own marketplaces where consumers can compare plans prices and benefits and find out if they are eligible for a federal subsidy or Medicaid The other states are relying on the federal government Those marketplaces also called exchanges are key to expanding insurance coverage to an estimated  million Americans over the next decade The next hundred days are the sprint to the biggest openenrollment season weve ever seen in this country said Ceci Connolly managing director of PricewaterhouseCoopers Health Research Institute We know that this will be a real crunch period  Opening the marketplaces on time represents the Obama administrations biggest opportunity to fulfill the laws promise to extend coverage to uninsured Americans including those who have been denied coverage in the past because of health conditions Since the Supreme Court upheld the law last June though officials have had to overcome many hurdles from states reluctance to participate to critics predictions of unaffordable coverage to unexpectedly tight money   A quirk in the law gave generous funding for consumer outreach in states with their own marketplaces but little for states with a federal exchange That could be a problem since polls show that most Americans know little about how the law affects them  There are also technical challenges Obamacare supporters like to compare shopping on the exchanges to buying an airplane ticket on Travelocity or Expedia but building the backend system is far more complicated requiring computers at state and federal agencies to be able to talk to one another in real time to verify an individuals income and citizenship status and determine eligibility for federal subsidies or Medicaid the statefederal insurance program for the poor That system also needs to connect with the computers run by insurance companies  The biggest questions though revolve around who will show up and whether they will be able to afford coverage that takes effect Jan   especially the young and healthy who will need to buy insurance in significant numbers to balance the costs of insuring the sick who can no longer be turned away The law requires most Americans to carry insurance in  but some fear that the firstyear  penalties wont be a strong enough inducement If mostly older sicker people show up insurers will pass on their health care costs in higher premiums that will make coverage for all individuals less affordable over time  All of these challenges are occurring in a politically charged environment in which both parties are already spinning developments to buttress their positions on the law While the laws effectiveness wont truly be known for several years underwhelming enrollment and high premiums could turn public opinion against Democrats before next years elections  When government auditors released a report last week for instance saying the Obama administration faced challenges to open the federally run exchanges in time Republicans pounced  The Government Accountability Office report underscores the sad reality that the administration is still woefully unprepared for implementation despite the law being signed over three years ago said Rep Fred Upton the Michigan Republican who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee   President Barack Obama insists the exchanges will open on time and coverage will be affordable although he acknowledges there will be bumps along the way as there would be for any new program In July the administration plans to relaunch   the web portal for the federally run exchanges  Short on money and worried about starting outreach during the summer vacation period the administration wont launch its major public campaign until at least midSeptember But supporters of the law such as the nonprofit Enroll America are planning to use the day milestone to start their own efforts   Several states running their own exchanges including Connecticut Colorado and Kentucky have recently begun airing television commercials about the new options that will be available Oct  for coverage that begins in January Open enrollment runs through March  People need to know this is coming so they can start thinking about it said Carrie Banahan executive director of the Kentucky exchange that recently rebranded itself as Kynect Kentuckys Healthcare Connection Insurance is complicated and we wanted to try to make it easily understandable as possible she said Kentuckys exchange which expects up to  people to enroll in the first year has been testing whether its computer systems can connect with federal agencies as well as its Medicaid program We are meeting all our deadlines and are on track Banahan said  This summer it plans to begin marketing at minor league baseball games and the state fair In September it plans to have a booth at one of the states biggest early fall eventsthe Bourbon Festival  The staterun exchanges are at various levels of readiness Californias for example has approved insurance plans it will offer and awarded money to groups that will train guides to assist consumers Idaho whose legislature did not approve the exchange until March has not even selected a name or chosen a vendor to build its website said Stephen Weeg chairman of the exchange We are going to have to be like Star Wars and do everything at hyperspeed he said   Nevadas Hager said that state will not start its publicity push until Oct  so the exchange has time to work out any problems before too many consumers rush in  In the next three months it must certify health plans test computer systems and begin an outreach effort that will include television and radio ads and knocking on doors The exchange which will use Nevadahealthlinkcom in its marketing hopes to enroll  people in first year Hager said   Though most of the focus is on states and the federal government hundreds of private companies are doing much of the work including information technology firms such as Xerox and religious organizations and chambers of commercethat will educate individuals and small employers about their new insurance options  Insurers who have the most to gain from robust enrollment including Floridas largest insurer plan to launch education campaigns to counter widespread ignorance about the health law   This is a huge communication and education undertaking for us said Jon Urbanek senior vice president of commercial markets for Florida Blue the Blue Cross and Blue Shield in that state Among people eligible for subsidized coverage he added a lot of those dont even know what health insurance is
