Judi Kaufman was having a bad day There were more and more of those now  years into her battle against brain cancer A tumor her third now the size of a golf ball was encroaching on healthy brain tissue upending her balance and her speech Her walking was shaky and her stamina was depleted Usually generous with greetings and hugs on this gloomy December day she didnt feel like coming to the door to welcome a visitor Cancer wasnt something she had wanted in her life either but she had learned to embrace it She called her tumor Friendly and tried to understand the strange gifts it offered  even as it took so much away from her Yes Friendly had destroyed the part of her brain that let her compute numbers making it impossible for her to cook something she had always loved But the invader in her frontal lobe also loosened her up She started writing poetry meditations on cancer and death and sex and religion and all other sorts of topics that her old self would have thought better left untouched I lost all my inhibitions as a result of the cancer said Kaufman  I had been a prude but its all changed She was sure that brain cancer had made her a better person She found a purpose creating a charity that helped other patients encouraging them to explore their creative capacities too and raising more than  million for research But now with no tolerable treatment options left to stall her disease and little idea how the next few months would unfold it had become hard to work and to see people  even to read a book Im in a wait pattern she said I dont know how to plan my life Thats the hardest part Kaufman still composes poetry when she can She talks and a trusted assistant types out her thoughts In a poem she wrote in June World War III Kaufman depicts herself as a warrior Kaufman is devoted to her husband Roy their two daughters and their two grandsons She lives in a large Spanishstyle home in Beverly Hills that backs up to a school and the playful shouts of children provide the soundtrack for her day A pound standard poodle named Chakra is always at her side Shes the kind of gracious hostess who on an easier day in November donned a scarf and bedazzled Fitflops and offered mixed nuts  the fancy kind  in a glass dish Delighted to see a reporter dive straight for the macadamias Kaufman complained that too often guests wont touch the snacks she serves Why wont people eat the nuts she had asked Jerry Seinfeldstyle Kaufman used to be a whiz in the kitchen  testing recipes and running a company that sold mailorder pizzas made of chocolate She taught etiquette classes for executives and kids For decades she had been a lay leader for the American Jewish Committee an advocacy group In her office photos of her with luminaries such as Steven Spielberg line the walls When illness struck everything changed Kaufmans cancer is a relatively rare slowgrowing type called   It takes over the cells that create the fatty sheathing that lets brain circuits signal clearly said UCLA neurooncology Director Dr Timothy Cloughesy one of Kaufmans doctors and now a friend The disease strikes people at their core transforming personalities relationships and selfimages from the inside out Brain cancer is particularly devastating for patients and their families Cloughesy said not only because it takes peoples lives but because it affects their brains the way it does Cloughesy and Kaufmans other physicians excised her tumor irradiated it and used chemo to blast it away  but it always came back Over the years Friendly didnt only take away Kaufmans ability to compute numbers She had to relearn how to speak and how to walk It has been a rough road but poetry has rescued her In verse Kaufman has picked apart her relationships and described her desires She has written about cancers as pregnancies About life passing her by My brain is handcuffed to a chair she noted in How Things Look  Kaufman said she launched her charity   to benefit Cloughesys brain cancer research and to get other impaired patients in touch with the new creativity lurking within The group brings together a community of patients and Brain Buddies who help them through diagnosis and treatment and in many cases encourage creative pursuits Last year patients artwork  photos paintings crayon drawings and more  was displayed at the charitys annual gala at UCLA Kaufman has figured out how to own her condition Cloughesy said I think it was hard for Judi to be impaired he said And she just accepted it and took it on and developed into this person with this goal with this interest and a generous heart Things just crystallized for her Kaufman would agree Im glad I had brain cancer she said I always wanted to do good work Its hard to find good work Late to an appointment Kaufman shakily descended from her bedroom via a glasswalled elevator Roy had installed for her She had wanted to stay in bed and watch TV but the visitors were here and she had a yoga lesson with her friend Debbie Saidoff She wore a red Art of the Brain Tshirt for photos An assistant had done her makeup special for the day Kaufman thinks producing art gives brain cancer patients a   and worth when so much of what they had been good at is gone Cloughesy sees another benefit I think creativity does help people want to survive he said But its more about using art to create this tangible thing to realize what we lose Cloughesy has used funds raised by Art of the Brain to build a searchable collection of tissues MRI scans and clinical records from  UCLA and Kaiser Permanente brain cancer patients He hopes it will help researchers learn more about the disease  and like the artwork keep patients in the public eye Its a legacy it continues on its part of the answer he said Neither Cloughesy nor Kaufman is sure how much longer she has to live Kaufman says she isnt afraid to die Shes planning her burial so Roy wont have to  making calls to the worker at the mortuary who will arrange for her pine casket spraypainted bright red for courage Joes my friend now she said Other friends are more squeamish about talking of the end and Kaufman tries to respect that I try to have a seizure quietly she said Bit by bit she is saying goodbye to things she once loved like visits to Carmel After a recent trip there was scuttled at a doctors suggestion she no longer wanted to go back Ive been enough she said Now I watch Anthony Bourdain I imagine Im in Iran sitting on cushions drinking tea Saidoff soon arrived for yoga as well as their teacher Maria Cristina Jimenez whom Kaufman had met in a writing class years before They set up in a sunny annex facing a manicured courtyard and pool Chakra flopped down on the floor near their mats Saidoff moved through poses while Kaufman took the class seated in a chair They chanted their oms They joked about The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills which they had all been watching Do the headstand Kaufman barked at Saidoff She had been boasting all day about how good her friend was at it The women held hands during resting poses Kaufman started to look stronger Jimenez offered a message for the class Take a moment and live your life as it is today Not as you think it should look but how it is today she said Nothing has to look one way Nothing has to look one way Kaufman repeated after her looking across the room at no one in particular Maybe I dont have cancer she said  half joking and perhaps half willing it to be true
