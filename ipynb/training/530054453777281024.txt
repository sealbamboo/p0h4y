Closing what many see as a loophole that could trap millions of people in substandard insurance the Obama administration said Tuesday that largeemployer medical plans lacking hospital coverage will not qualify under the Affordable Care Acts toughest standard It also offered relief to workers who may be enrolled in those plans next year The administration will rule that plans without substantial coverage for inpatient hospitalization services do not meet the laws minimum value threshold the Treasury Department   It will issue final regulations saying so next year it said Its good news for employees said Sabrina Corlette project director at Georgetown Universitys Center on Health Insurance Reforms They shouldnt be stuck with subpar coverage Hundreds of employers with lowwage workers such as retailers and temporarystaffing companies   to offer such plans for  the first year large companies are liable for fines if they dont provide minimum coverage Unlike insurance sold to individuals and small employers large companies arent required to offer the health laws essential health benefits including hospital services But most analysts assumed that the minimum value calculator  testing whether insurance pays at least  percent of expected medical costs for a given plan  would require hospital care It didnt Although the insurance costs half as much as similar coverage including hospitalization an online calculator published by the Department of Health and Human Services certifies it as passing the laws minimumvalue standard Kaiser Health News and The Washington Post   Many see the calculator as flawed Numerous large employers have already committed to such coverage for next year brokers say Some have enrolled workers for insurance beginning in October Responding to industry pleas the administration agreed to allow those plans for a year if employers committed to them before Nov  But officials also moved to give their workers an affordable alternative granting an exception to the rule that would have barred them from premium subsidies if they opted instead to buy insurance on the health laws online marketplaces Under the health law employees offered minimumvalue coverage at work are ineligible for federal tax credits in online insurance marketplaces In no event will workers given an employer plan without hospital coverage be disqualified from the subsidies Treasury said Tuesday Its a very positive constructive sensible step said Edward Lenz senior counsel for the American Staffing Association a trade group for temp and recruiting companies The key is that everybodys going to be held harmless  companies that have committed to the plans as well as workers wanting to buy their own subsidized insurance with broader coverage Something like half the associations  members who employ  million people on any given day had committed to offer or were considering calculatortested plans without hospital coverage Lenz said While big companies that have traditionally provided major medical coverage arent interested numerous retailers homehealth companies light manufacturers hoteliers restaurateurs and other lowerwage employers also plan to offer them said brokers There was tremendous interest in this from companies that hadnt previously provided health benefits said Edward Fensholt a benefits lawyer with Lockton Companies a large insurance brokerage and consulting firm Employers that have committed to the plans are delighted by the decision to allow a oneyear reprieve Fensholt said Companies that were considering them but hadnt pulled the trigger by Tuesday are between a rock and a hard place he said Lowerwage employers that had never offered substantial coverage were already struggling to obey the health law said Kevin Schlotman director of benefits at Benovation an Ohio firm that designs and administers health coverage More than a dozen Benovation clients are in some stage of implementing calculatortested plans without hospital coverage he said The lastminute rule change is problematic he said These employers are searching for a solution that permits them to comply while at the same time doesnt burden the business with hundreds of thousands in expenses they have never had in the past While they lack hospital coverage lowcost plans that pass the calculator are rich in outpatient benefits such as physician visits Consultants and employers argue that such insurance is more useful to lowpay workers than the alternative coverage with hospitalization that comes with a  deductible  the portion members pay before insurance kicks in Hospital officials predictably praised the administrations move Hospitals and health systems were deeply concerned about plans that potentially excluded important hospitalization and are pleased with the action to address the matter in the best interest of patients Richard Umbdenstock president of the American Hospital Association said in a prepared statement The administration   it would move to disallow plans without hospital benefits from passing the minimumvalue test Large employers that fail to offer minimumvalue coverage next year could be fined up to  per worker The penalties become effective when workers buy plans in the online exchanges and qualify for subsidies based on their income Plans without hospital coverage that pass the minimumvalue test are different from skinny plans another kind of limitedbenefit plan offered by lowerwage firms such as retailers and staffing companies Employersponsored skinny plans include preventivecare benefits and little else Consumer advocates unexpectedly realized last year that skinny plans fulfill a second ACA requirement for employers which is to provide minimum essential coverage Failure to meet that threshold next year can cost large employers up to  per worker Tuesdays move affects only plans that claim to pass the minimumvalue test  not skinny plans and the weaker minimum essential coverage standard
