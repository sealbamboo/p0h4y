A plastic surgeon in the US has offered to operate on a British man once dubbed the worlds fattest At his heaviest Paul Mason weighed  stone kg and was bed bound at his bungalow in Ipswich Suffolk He now weighs about  stone kg after  but says his life is being hampered by a huge amount of excess skin New Yorkbased surgeon Dr Jennifer Capla said she was willing to donate her time to help Mr Mason In May Mr Mason    as part of his plea for medical help Mr Mason said he had begun trying to raise the money to pay for flights and a hospital stay in order to take advantage of Dr Caplas offer Dr Capla told BBC Radio Suffolk she had read about Mr Mason and his weight loss in the New York Times He is a highrisk patient and he has a lot of medical issues that we need to sort through she said However hes a great candidate for this skin removal surgery He has lost over lbs kg and he should be very functional and mobile and should be able to live his life but hes still wheelchairbound because he has all this excess skin Helping him get his life back is really the goal Dr Capla said she specialised in postbariatric body contouring but that although she had treated patients who lost up to lbs kg she had never treated anyone who had lost as much weight as Mr Mason The skin is the same in terms of looseness and the areas of target so its an area Im very familiar with she said Mr Mason said he had things in motion to raise the money needed All Ive got to cover is the medication the stay in hospital and the flights he said Mr Mason has not been able to have the surgery on the NHS because his weight has not been stable He said an operation to remove excess skin around his middle would make a huge difference I would be able to mobilise and lead a reasonably normal life then have my arms and legs done he said Five years down the road it would possibly have to be repeated because by then I should be at my goal weight and the excess skin I would have then would still need removing because of the extreme size I was in the first place A spokesman for the NHS Ipswich and East Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group said Before a patient has an operation it is important to take a balanced decision that is in the best interest of that patient In cases like this the NHS has a panel of people  including clinicians  who decide whether the patient should have such an operation A patient must have a stable weight before he or she is considered
