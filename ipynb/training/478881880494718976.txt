The NHS in England has advised women not to use certain home birthing pools after a baby had to go into intensive care for an infection believed to be linked to their use  Samples taken from the heated birthing pool have confirmed the presence of legionella bacteria which cause Legionnaires disease  Tests will establish if it is the same strain which infected the baby Public Health England says the temporary ban was precautionary  The majority of birthing pools used at home are filled from domestic hot water systems at the time of labour  these birthing pools do not pose the same risk and are excluded from this alert  The risk occurs with heated birthing pools filled in advance of labour and where the water temperature is kept constant by a heater and a pump  This is the first reported case of Legionnaires disease linked to a birthing pool in England although two cases were reported internationally some years ago  The heated pools from the supplier involved in this incident have been recalled  Public Health England said it was aware that around ten companies in total supply these specific home birthing pools and each have somewhere between two and  which they loan out  Midwives and every local authority in England are being contacted to see if they have any of these pools still in use Prof Nick Phin Public Health Englands head of Legionnaires disease said This is an extremely unusual situation which we are taking very seriously PHE and relevant local authorities are investigating the infection control measures required for this type of birthing pool and local authorities will be working with the small number of companies who supply these heated birthing pools for use at home  Louise Silverton director for midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives said Women planning birth at home using a traditional pool that is filled when the woman is in labour or using a fixed pool in an NHS unit are not affected by this alert and should not be concerned Birthing pools in hospitals are subject to stringent infection control procedures and monitoring Home birthing pools filled during labour come with disposable liners and are only in place for a relatively short time period reducing opportunity for bacterial growth Any women with concerns about using home birthing pools should contact their midwife or local maternity unit
