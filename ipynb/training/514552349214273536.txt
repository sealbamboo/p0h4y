After doubling over nearly two decades, rates of diabetes in the U.S. may be leveling off, a new study by federal researchers shows, a tentative sign of progress against a debilitating, costly condition.. About 29.1 million people, or 9.3% of the U.S. population, suffer from diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It has become a major driver of health-care expenditures in the U.S., accounting for an estimated $245 billion in direct and indirect medical costs in 2012, the most recent year available.
