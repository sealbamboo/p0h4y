All the outreach in the world wont count for much if the Obamacare ticket counter doesnt work Behind   to educate the uninsured about the Affordable Care Act is the assumption that software to sell the plans will be ready and userfriendly by Oct  when enrollment is supposed to start That assumption   Some wonder if systems will be tested and finished on time Others worry the programs will lead consumers to make dumb insurance choices Kaiser Health News got an early look at the exchange software that will be used in Minnesota Maryland and the District of Columbia A company called   is developing the Web interface for consumers under  who dont have employerbased health coverage to shop and sign up for a plan in those states Connecture isnt handling the software that qualifies you to buy under the health act or verifies your eligibility for subsidies Other companies are taking care of those Connectures piece is the pointofsale program the one that steers you through insurance choices and closes the deal That process is complex enough by itself How much coverage do you want What deductible Are family members on the plan Do you need an asthma program Do you want to keep your current doctor What about dental Proponents of the health law liken the signup software to Expedia or Travelocity where travelers can book flights and hotels It may be more like TurboTax escorting you through requirements and choices much more complex than whether you want a flight in the afternoon or the morning Like other filtering software Connectures program is a multistep search engine screening out inappropriate options based on what you tell it to deliver a manageable menu After   Strippeddown bronze plan or highbenefit platinum High deductible or low the program asks if its important to keep your current doctor Based on our research the choice of doctor was probably the No  and No  features of what people are looking for in a plan said Christopher Neuharth Connectures director of user experience To try to reduce sticker shock Connecture shows your net premium price    the tax credits are applied  early in the shopping process But perhaps the most important feature is the one estimating the   cost of coverage including deductibles and copays based on your reported health status Without that information somebody with a chronic condition requiring lots of care could choose a plan based only on a low premium not realizing the total expense could be substantially reduced by paying a larger premium up front Theres all sorts of wild ways that carriers can design benefits to meet the actuarial value required by the health law Neuharth said You have to show the total cost of ownership Its just three months until the exchanges open but the software isnt finished Connecture awaits tryouts by Minnesota Maryland and the District of Columbia and more details on specific demographic groups expected to apply for coverage It could tweak the software based on the responses Neuharth said In any event your exchange experience may vary Connecture had a head start compared to some launching work on the code shortly after the health law passed in  At the same time the best shopping site in the world wont delight consumers if products are sparse or subpar Thanks to the narrow networks of doctors and hospitals that many insurers are expected to offer your preferred doctor may not show up in any of the plans on offer On the other hand these narrow networks are expected to be less expensive because they seek discounts from select doctors and hospitals in return for patient volume Sorting out such pluses and minuses to help consumers make informed choices is the softwares job
