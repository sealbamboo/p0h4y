New research suggests that many women aged  who do not have children feel judged for not having had a baby Even if they plan to have a child nearly  have at some point felt stigmatised for leaving it late About  are too embarrassed to talk about fertility especially with family and friends often the biggest source of pressure Susan Seenan from Infertility Network UK says this prevents some women from seeking help for fertility problems The organisation which interviewed  women for its survey said it was a common problem Trying for a baby is a very personal thing which people dont always want to talk about but there is constant pressure from families saying Isnt it about time said Ms Seenan And if you dont say anything then friends and family assume you like your lifestyle too much to be bothered about children If women are then diagnosed with fertility problems the sense of isolation can become even worse she says Unfortunately infertility is still a taboo subject When women are labelled as infertile they feel a failure because they have let themselves and their partner down Their basic biological instinct to have a child is kicking in  and at that point everyone seems to have babies but they cant Ms Seenan suggests that for women in this position it is easier to talk about mental health problems than infertility problems which is the reason behind the forthcoming National Infertility Awareness Week Neela Prabhu  from London knows how hard it is to spend years trying to become pregnant She and her husband tried for over a year before seeking help and that took its toll on them both My mental state at the time wasnt great and although some friends tried to be wellmeaning they kept saying unfunny things about our situation They were trying to be helpful but sometimes it just hurt All I could think about was having a baby Neelas parents are from India and are very supportive but she says her mother couldnt relate to her problems partly because it is an issue rarely discussed in Asian communities  She says she wants this to change I want there to be more openness I want women to talk about infertility even if they are dying inside and I want to give women the confidence to talk about the journey of having a child But it just seems to be a taboo subject  why should this be Neela finally had a daughter four years ago after IVF and has recently discovered she is pregnant again with her second baby following two failed cycles of IVF last year She has never found out the cause of her fertility problems despite numerous investigations Neela started trying for a baby at  but many women leave it much later and by doing so they decrease their chances of conceiving naturally and risk missing out on treatment under the NHS Current guidelines recommend that women up to  should be offered three full cycles of IVF and women aged between  and  should have access to one cycle But there are huge variations in criteria across the UK In Oxford for example  is the limit for IVF treatment on the NHS Tim Child medical director at the Oxford Fertility Unit at the University of Oxford says people are leaving it too long before before going to see their GP about their fertility problems When couples start talking about their fertility thats the point to speak to a healthcare professional Good advice can be given early on about weight diet alcohol intake etc which could help but many couples try for years before seeking help and before they know it they are in their late s  and in some areas thats too old He says that women wrongly assume that IVF is a good fallback solution when in fact the success rates are  for the unders dropping to  for the unders and just  for women aged up to  Neela hopes that people can be more understanding and supportive towards women who cant just fall off a log and get pregnant so that people like her can feel more comfortable talking about it  Instead of asking personal intrusive questions she wants people to be aware that one in seven heterosexual couples in the UK is affected by infertility Being judged has made Neela speak out People used to ask me Dont you want another child Its really nobodys business but mine
