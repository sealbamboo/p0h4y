Certain medications or treatments may help us turn down the incline or reduce the velocity Others may allow us to push the off button once in a while But most of us keep going Its how were built For example I just went on a weeklong vacation to the Canadian Rockies with my wife and kids We had a great time  hiking biking canoeing whitewater rafting and mountain climbing through the wilderness Not to mention eating like champs and meeting some fantastic people along the way It was a lifechanging and memorable experience Plus the pictures were terrific We look so happy and healthy But what you dont see in the pictures is the length that I had to go to experience that fantastic journey First there was the packing Did I remember all my medication Did I pack all my equipment Is it in working order Do I have enough supplies for the whole week Then there was the carrying I dont check my meds or my equipment I carry them on the plane  lest they be damaged or lost by the airlines They are my cross to bear They never leave my side Finally theres the treatment regimen I spend about three hours a day taking my medication performing my chest physical therapy getting in my exercise routine and monitoring my blood sugar So it was a vacation but when you have a chronic illness truly there are no vacations As the famous quote goes Wherever you go there you are Some people find my ability to deal with cystic fibrosis inspirational But Ive never really meant to inspire anyone Im just trying to live my life I have come to the realization that in taking the steps to live my life with CF I may motivate others both with and without longterm disease to do all they can to achieve a fulfilling life Last week I had a meaningful conversation with a young man with CF who will be starting medical school in the fall  he called me to ask my advice on how to balance his studies with his medical routine I hope I gave him some solid recommendations that will help him along the way make his life easier and assist him in achieving his ultimate goal of becoming a physician More importantly I would venture a guess that I helped him to realize that what he is trying to do is possible Whereas a generation ago before all the advances we have achieved in treating cystic fibrosis such an ambition was unfathomable for a patient with this condition It will not be easy it will require perseverance but in the end if he puts his mind to it he will get what he is looking for out of life So we keep moving forward on that treadmill Putting one foot in front of the other Trying to reach our goals and ultimately achieve success
