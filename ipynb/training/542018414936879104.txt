Software billionaire Paul Allen says hes committing  million to create a  focusing on the mechanics of human cell biology The   first project the Allen Cell Observatory will focus on creating computational models for the kinds of   or IPS cells that have the ability to turn into heart muscle cells or the epithelial cells that form the inner linings of organs as well as skin Such cells hold promise for facilitating research into how cells become diseased and potentially for growing replacement tissues Cells are the fundamental units of life with every disease we know of affecting particular types of cells Allen said in a   Scientists have learned a great deal about many of the  trillion cells in our bodies over the last decades but creating a comprehensive predictive model of the cell will require a different approach The Allen Cell Observatorys goal is to produce a dynamic visual database and animated models of cell parts in action Such models could shed light on the processes by which genetic information is translated into cellular functions and reveal what goes wrong in a diseased cell That in turn could help researchers predict which therapies will work best to counter diseases or perhaps head off the disease in the first place Allens latest philanthropic venture was unveiled Monday at the   in Philadelphia It follows up on plans that the cofounder of Microsoft has had in mind for years Its the right time to start a big initiative in cell biology understanding how cells work understanding the detailed things that happen inside cells which is behind cancer and Alzheimers and all those things   Paul Allens net worth is estimated at   Over the past  years he has contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to scientific projects including the   the   and the   Last month he said he would contribute  million to the   Allen also owns somewhat lessscientific ventures such as the Seattle Seahawks and the Portland Trail Blazers The cell science institute will be housed in the sevenstory   that is currently under construction in Seattles South Lake Union neighborhood The building is scheduled for completion in the fall of  and will also house the Allen Brain Institute The colocation will be an obvious point of interaction said Allen Jones the brain institutes CEO The institutes executive director is   who served as the director of the federally funded   for  years and has spent the past  years doing cell research as a professor at the University of Virginia School of Medicine The institutes data models and tools will be made publicly available online Horwitz said We plan to engage the global cell science community in developing and executing our projects he said in Mondays news release And by openly sharing our data reagents databases and models we will leverage and empower research by our colleagues around the world The institute will bring on about  employees over the next three years Horwitz said during a news conference at the ASCB meeting Jones said Paul Allens  million commitment would be spread out over five years The Allen Institute for Cell Science isnt the only institution of its kind Several other cell research centers already have been created including the   at the HarvardMIT Broad Institute and   in the Netherlands Horwitz said there are almost no observatories in terms of what we intend to do I dont know of any observatories of any scale that have looked at the cell in an integrated way to deal with the images the way were dealing with them he said However Horwitz said the Allen Institute would collaborate actively with others in the field The cell is so complex there is no one that I know  who actually could do this by themselves he said
