My patient came to see me every six months or so with his wife of  years making the fivehour drive from West Virginia where he managed a few businesses He had myelodysplastic syndrome a type of bone marrow cancer that in his case was indolent requiring only regular shots with a hormone but no chemotherapy  yet  While his blood counts were not normal they were what I used to jokingly call good enough for government work until another  patient of mine who was a postal worker reminded me that not everyone found that comment funny  This was a routine checkup and I always looked forward to seeing him and his wife When I walked into the exam room they were sitting quietly next to each other with books open members of the cadre of patients and family members I referred to as my intellectuals They both beamed when I entered like old friends Its good to see you I said and I meant it Its good to be seen he joked  We reviewed his blood counts which were stable and he had not required any blood or platelet transfusions since I had last seen him I think we achieved our goal of wasting your time again I teased him Any plans for July Fourth Were having the kids and grandkids over for a few days he answered How are they dealing with your diagnosis I asked He shifted in his seat and looked over toward his wife We havent told them about it yet she said I was surprised My patient had been dealing with this serious medical condition for a couple of years and he was usually so pragmatic in how he managed all aspects of his life Not telling his children was more than just an oversight I asked him why Our son has been away doing a couple of tours of duty in Afghanistan he said We were going to tell our daughter but  He paused trying to find the right words It wouldnt be fair for her to know to have this burden and not him We were planning on telling them when were together over the holiday He seemed uncomfortable talking about it as if their family members didnt keep a lot of secrets from one another His illness was a biggie because his condition could deteriorate at any time I worried about his support network Have you shared the news with friends He half laughed Well not deliberately I went to the cancer center to get my weekly injection and ran into one of the people I work with who was getting chemotherapy for her breast cancer I hadnt told anyone about my problem He paused You know you dont want people thinking the boss is sick I asked how they both handled the surprise encounter She had been keeping her cancer diagnosis quiet so it became our secret He thought about it for a second It helped to have someone outside of me and my wife know Cancer like entropy tends toward chaos It disrupts the ordered growth of cells the integrity of tissues and the sanctity of nerves blood vessels and organs Cancer is an unwelcome house guest that upends lives and despotically redefines a persons sense of self in its own image  Amidst this bedlam sometimes the one thing that we can control is whom we tell There are a variety of reasons people keep the news of a cancer diagnosis secret Some are very personal its my body and what goes on inside it is my business Some are professional the screenwriter Nora Ephron kept her myelodysplastic syndrome a secret because she feared that no insurance company would sign off on any movie she tried to make And some are altruistic we dont want others to bear the emotional weight of knowing  My patient continued I also didnt want to tell the kids until I could better comprehend what was happening with my disease so I could show them that one plus one adds up to two not to some other number I feel like I know where things are going now Sometimes people dont talk about their cancer because they havent made sense of it themselves Its our job as doctors and nurses to be deliberate in asking our patients how they will explain their cancer to others to make sure they understand Keeping such a diagnosis hushed a secret from those who love and care for us is an unfair burden we shouldnt allow cancer to dictate too He sighed looking almost relieved as he pictured finally being able to share the news with his children and nodded his head Itll be good to let them know
