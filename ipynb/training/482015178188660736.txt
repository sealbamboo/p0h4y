One of my yearold twin daughters recently came home from school distraught When I asked why she lifted her foot  There was dog poop on her sneakers   She watched as I flicked away the doggy detritus with a twig then scrubbed the sole of her shoe with an old brush and hot water We dont like to pick up Buddys poop either I could hear her telling her sister but we do it because its gross to leave it on the sidewalk  When I handed her the shoe cleaned and as good as new she beamed Thanks Mom she said lacing up But after a few test twirls in the yard she stopped Didnt that dogs owner know he would cause so much trouble for other people she asked brow furrowing He might have even caused trouble for himself if he came back and stepped in it At the tender age of  she had seen how one persons bad decision could negatively affect others The same lesson is playing out for patients and doctors across the country albeit under far graver circumstances  This year there has been a   a dangerous disease that for decades had been virtually unknown in the United States And its become clear that measles has reemerged as a public health issue in this country because large numbers of individuals remain unvaccinated  Up until the late s measles was an unavoidable scourge infecting millions of children each year Highly contagious it could   after an infected individual had passed by resulting in   and nearly  hospitalizations annually as well as   when it     Happily in  scientists developed a safe and effective vaccine With this vaccine in hand public health officials pediatricians and infectious disease experts began a   to eradicate the disease Their principal strategy was to create herd immunity or     In any given population there would always be individuals who would not develop immunity to measles even after receiving the vaccine or who   because they were too young less than a year old or had immune systems already weakened from diseases like cancer or AIDS But health care experts discovered that if at least  percent of a community were immunized against measles all the members of that group would be safe Even if someone with the disease entered the community the immunized majority would serve as a buffer zone preventing further spread to unimmunized individuals If however the rates of vaccination fell below  percent and community immunity dropped that safety net would disappear In  after three decades of intensive efforts public health officials declared that endemic measles had been eradicated in the United States  But just as the experts were claiming victory   published in   that posited a causal link between the measles vaccine and an intestinal disorder and autism Subsequently dozens of peerreviewed studies based on the experience of millions of children found   and in  The Lancet   citing   and ethics violations The same year the   from practicing medicine because of ethical lapses  The retraction the disciplinary actions and all the subsequent scientific findings that refuted Dr Wakefields assertion did little to dampen the enthusiasm of his most fervent supporters They continued to promote his work and the idea that the   Believing that they were protecting the young against neurological harm these parents refused to vaccinate their children and    Pediatricians and infectious disease experts warned that these parents were putting their unvaccinated children at increased risk Measles remains the eighth leading cause of mortality worldwide and the greatest   Studies have shown that unvaccinated children are   to contract the disease than immunized children Furthermore the health care experts cautioned it wouldnt be just their own family members that these parents were putting at risk  This year the proverbial poop has hit the propeller Over the last five months there have been  outbreaks and almost   Its the highest number of cases since  and the number continues to rise Almost all the outbreaks can be traced to an unvaccinated individual who contracted the disease while traveling abroad and the majority of people who subsequently caught the disease were     Moreover because as many as a   chose not to vaccinate their children pockets of the population have lost the protective effects of herd immunity In these communities measles has spread like wildfire infecting not only those who were unvaccinated by choice but also infants too young to be immunized and children and adults with immune systems already compromised And it gets worse Given the earlier success of the measles eradication campaign most patients and   to recognize the disease Patients unaware that they are ill with such a contagious disease go to hospitals and clinics assuming that the providers there will know what to do to help them  But most practicing doctors myself included have never cared for a patient with measles Confronted with a patient suffering from a fever red eyes runny nose cough and blotchy rash we dont even think of measles let alone order the dramatic precautions necessary to prevent its spread like mandating facial masks isolating patients in rooms equipped with specialized ventilation systems and reporting to appropriate infection control experts And because measles was virtually nonexistent in the United States until this year many clinicians still assume that patients are vaccinated against the disease and therefore not susceptible   We have a whole generation of physicians who have never seen measles said Dr Julia Sammons medical director of infection prevention and control at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia Dr Sammons has just   on the diagnosis treatment prevention and control of measles to help increase awareness among doctors Youre not going to make the diagnosis or make efforts to control spread if its not on your radar screen she said While there have been no deaths yet associated with the recent outbreaks the lesson for patients and doctors is clear  When it comes to public health bad personal choices can have potentially devastating effects on others   Its easy to believe that vaccines are harmful if you arent seeing the consequences for yourself and other people Dr Sammons said But we need to remember that measles is a preventable disease
