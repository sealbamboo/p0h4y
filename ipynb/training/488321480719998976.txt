Retired Anglican bishop Desmond Tutu who describes as disgraceful the way former South African President Nelson Mandela was treated in his last enfeebled days has thrown his support behind a British assisteddying bill I have been fortunate to spend my life working for dignity for the living Now I wish to apply my mind to the issue of dignity for the dying the archbishop emeritus of Cape Town and antiapartheid leader wrote in an editorial in   I revere the sanctity of life  but not at any cost he said Tutu a fellow activist and longtime friend of Mandelas whom he calls by his tribal name Madiba says the end of the former South African presidents life robbed him of his dignity Mandela who served  years in jail for his antiapartheid activity and later became South Africas first black president   after a prolonged lung infection that left him incapacitated for many months There was that occasion when Madiba was televised with political leaders President Jacob Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa You could see Madiba was not fully there He did not speak He was not connecting My friend was no longer himself It was an affront to Madibas dignity Tutu writes On Mandela Day we will be thinking of a great man he said On the same day on  July  in London the House of Lords will be holding a second hearing on Lord Falconers bill on assisted dying Oregon Washington Quebec Holland Switzerland have already taken this step South Africa has a hardwon constitution that we are proud of that should provide a basis to guide changes to be made on the legal status of endoflife wishes to support the dignity of the dying Tutu  who was hospitalized last year for a persistent infection also writes of his own death I have come to realise that I do not want my life to be prolonged artificially he said I think when you need machines to help you breathe then you have to ask questions about the quality of life being experienced and about the way money is being spent The Nobel Peace Prize laureate said he wants to be cremated in a simple wooden coffin My memorial stone should also be modest he said My concern is not just about affordability its my strong preference that money should be spent on the living
