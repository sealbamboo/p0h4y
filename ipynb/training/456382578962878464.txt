The ebb and flow of mens beard fashions may be guided by Darwinian selection according to a new study The more beards there are the less attractive they become  giving cleanshaven men a competitive advantage say scientists in Sydney Australia When peak beard frequency is reached the pendulum swings back toward lesserbristled chins  a trend we may be witnessing now the scientists say Their study has been published in the  In the experiment women and men were asked to rate different faces with four standard levels of beardedness Both beards and cleanshaven faces became more appealing when they were rare The pattern mirrors an evolutionary phenomenon  negative frequencydependent sexual selection or to put it more simply an advantage to rare traits The bright colours of male guppies vary by this force  which is driven by females changing preferences Scientists at the University of New South Wales decided to test this hypothesis for mens facial hair  recruiting volunteers on their Facebook site   Big thick beards are back with an absolute vengeance and so we thought underlying this fashion one of the dynamics that might be important is this idea of negative frequency dependence said Prof Rob Brooks one of the studys authors The idea is that perhaps people start copying the George Clooneys and the Joaquin Phoenixs and start wearing those beards but then when more and more people get onto the bandwagon the value of being on the bandwagon diminishes so that might be why weve hit peak beard Peak beard was the climax of the trend for beards in professions not naturally associated with a bristly chin  bankers film stars and even footballers began sporting facial hair Some say the Rubicon was crossed in January when Jeremy Paxman the BBC Newsnight presenter   saying beards are SO  Paxmans beard  which briefly trended on Twitter  sparked a    the fear of beards In this latest experiment  women and  men were asked to rate the attractiveness of different samples of mens faces Some were shown mostly full beards Others were shown mostly cleanshaven faces A third group were shown an even mixture of all four varieties  cleanshaven light stubble heavy stubble and full beard Both women and men judged heavy stubble and full beards more attractive when they were rare than when they were common And likewise for cleanshaven faces Negative frequencydependent preferences may therefore contribute to changing beard fashions Prof Brooks concluded We know beards go through cyclical fashions People used to speak about a year timescale he said There is a   studying photographs of men from  to  in the Illustrated London News Sideburns moved on to moustaches then full beards In the s it was handlebar moustaches In the s it was Magnum PI moustaches In the s we saw a lot of clean shaven men and now big bushy beards are back The recent boom may have its roots in the financial crisis of  Prof Brooks suggests I think one of the reasons beards have made a comeback now is that its a difficult time Young men are competing to attract someone when work is not easy to come by So we might expect some aspects of masculinity to get turned up to eleven After the Wall Street Crash in the s there is some circumstantial evidence that beards got big again So maybe economic conditions have set the stage for the recent comeback in beardedness When Greeces economy tanked  did beards take off Thats something were going to look at One of the paradoxes of evolution is that genetically strong traits favoured by one sex do not simply become fixed in the other  a level of diversity is often maintained Though beard styles are of course not spread via genes there may be other visible human traits which are With female hair colour there has been speculation that red brown and blonde spread via their novelty  but the evidence is very ambiguous Dr Brooks told BBC News His team plan to continue their pogonophilic investigations and are looking for volunteers for   testing how people like faces with varying levels of beardedness Heavy stubble seemed to be the best in our last study Maybe a  day growth But those describe average tendencies he said Luckily in real life we never mate with an average We mate with an individual
