The stretch of Interstate  between Cheyenne Wyo and Lincoln Neb is straight and flat High plains stretch out on either side But scattered along this unremarkable road the Air Force keeps some of its most powerful weapons    Outsiders are rarely allowed to see the missiles up close But in the aftermath of   the Air Force has allowed some media including NPR a rare glimpse at Americas nuclear deterrence Traveling to the missile fields isnt done by helicopter or Humvee Instead were riding in a Ford Taurus with  miles on it Its our chariot says Lt Raj Bansal of the Air Forces th Missile Wing with a chuckle Capt Joseph Shannon riding shotgun is quick to chime in The key is to get us there safely he says Shannon and Bansal are on their way out for a shift or alert as its known in the missile business For the next  hours they will be responsible for  nuclear weapons They will oversee security and maintenance And if the order comes they will launch these warheads within a matter of minutes the exact time it takes is classified Will they ever get a coded message from the president ordering them to unleash their weapons I think its something everybody thinks about when they get the job Bansal says I mean youre basically eating most of your meals when youre on alert next to the keys and switches that would cause that act That act  its hard for even these officers to discuss a nuclear exchange And these days most Americans dont talk about it at all Bansals friends know where he works but dont have a clue what he does A lot of them are like Hey why are you complaining You dont really do anything  he says There is some truth in that Nuclear deterrence is at its heart a job of inaction These two train constantly to launch a massive nuclear strike at a moments notice But theyre unlikely to ever get that order Shannon sees it differently I wouldnt say our job is not to do something the job of deterrence is actually working Adversaries know that the missiles are there  theyre in place and they will be used he says If thats sitting in the back of their mind they wont do certain actions to cause them to be used And in practice keeping the missiles on alert is a grueling task Frontline crews can be on hour alert twice a week They also spend days being trained and tested on procedures Until recently the Air Force has kept staffing to a minimum so crew members often were called in for extra shifts Add in the lengthy drives to and from these remote bases and these officers can spend more than a week on the job Shannon has missed his daughters recitals Bansal has spent holidays underground We pull off the highway and turn left Past Dix Neb the road turns to gravel Eventually we arrive at what looks like just another ranch house At the gate were greeted by Tech Sgt Raymond Kaiser Mr Brumfiel Status Are you under any form of duress he asks me The question seems odd in the empty flatlands of western Nebraska Kaiser is responsible for maintaining the aboveground portion of this command center It looks surprisingly comfortable inside There are a pool table a workout room and television This is where a cook support staff and a heavily armed security force live The controls to the missiles themselves are  feet underground We pass through a final checkpoint and open the door to the elevator At the entrance theyve added a decorative touch a giant mural of Mario the cartoon plumber from the video game At the bottom Mario stands next to a mushroom cloud Missile crews are known for their dark humor Stand clear yells Bansal as he pulls open an enormous footthick blast door  tons of solid steel On the other side Lt Kirsten Clark and her deputy are just finishing up their shift in the capsule as crews call it The room is hollowed out like a concrete egg In the middle suspended on shock absorbers hangs the launch control center a room within a room Its long and narrow with a bed at one end and a toilet at the other In between two chairs face computer displays Clark hands over her command to Shannon No security or maintenance in progress Weve got television working today for once she adds TV is allowed down here Crews have long periods of downtime where they still have to keep alert especially at night Usually I like movies because they make the time go by faster sometimes I watch the Cooking Channel or the news she says Last night   was on Clark also spent time reviewing topsecret procedures for her weapons With the handover complete Bansal and Shannon are now the final link in a system stretching from the president of the United States to these missiles The missiles themselves are displayed in a grid on the computer console This is actually gaining status from  nuclear missiles which is kind of crazy to think about  I mean when youve been at this screen from something alerts you kind of lose sight of what it actually is he says Each missile is just a tiny rectangle on the screen It makes the enormousness of the job seem small and abstract And maybe the people asked to do this need it that way to let them get on with the daytoday of keeping the weapons ready Theres no emotional thoughts going into this its our job and this is what were going to do Shannon says Now if were topside actually seeing things I think thats totally different But down here this is what we see something on the screen and thats it Shannon and Bansal settle in for their alert At its heart this is what nuclear deterrence comes down to two officers  feet underground Working watching movies and waiting
