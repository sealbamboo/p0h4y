Energy drinks packed with caffeine can change the way the heart beats researchers warn The team from the University of Bonn in Germany imaged the hearts of  people an hour after they had an energy drink The study showed contractions were more forceful after the drink The team told the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America that children and people with some health conditions should avoid the drinks Researcher Dr Jonas Dorner said Until now we havent known exactly what effect these energy drinks have on the function of the heart The amount of caffeine is up to three times higher than in other caffeinated beverages like coffee or cola  There are many side effects known to be associated with a high intake of caffeine including rapid heart rate palpitations rise in blood pressure and in the most severe cases seizures or sudden death The researchers gave the participants a drink containing mg per ml of caffeine and mg per ml of another chemical taurine They showed the chamber of the heart that pumps blood around the body the left ventricle was contracting harder an hour after the energy drink was taken than at the start of the study Dr Dorner added Weve shown that energy drink consumption has a shortterm impact on cardiac contractility  We dont know exactly how or if this greater contractility of the heart impacts daily activities or athletic performance The impact on people with heart disease is also unknown  However the research team advises that children and people with an irregular heartbeat should avoid the drinks The British Soft Drinks Association
