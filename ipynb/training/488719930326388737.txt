From Ebola in West Africa to chikungunya in the Caribbean the world has had plenty of strange  and scary  outbreaks this year Some pathogens have even landed in the US Just a few months ago two men boarded planes in Saudi Arabia and brought a   from the Middle East to Florida and Indiana Nobody along the way caught Middle East respiratory syndrome But all of these planehopping pathogens got us wondering How easily do bacteria and viruses spread on commercial jets And is there anything we can do to cut our risk Microbiologist   and his team at Auburn University have been trying a few simple experiments to figure out the first question The airlines gave the scientists parts on commercial jets where spread might take place  a steel toilet button the rubber armrest the plastic tray table and of course the seat pocket in front of you Barbaree and his team sterilized the surfaces and then painted on two dangerous microbes the antibioticresistant superbug   and   O which will give you an unforgettable case of diarrhea Several days later the microbes were still happily thriving on the plane parts   survived about four days MRSA lasted at least a week the team   at a scientific meeting in May Such hardiness is common for MRSA and   Barbaree says Im not surprised at all the bacteria survived so long on the surfaces he says MRSA has been tested on other surfaces And in one case it lasted over a year In general the bacteria tended to stick on the plane surfaces instead of hopping onto a pig skin  an experimental proxy for a travelers hand But some of the bugs did make the jump from the plane onto the fake hand If youre going to pick up a pathogen on an intercontinental flight it will probably be one hanging out on your seat or another surface says   who specializes in aviation medicine at Lahey Medical Center in Peabody Mass When you look at most infectious diseases the overwhelming majority are transmitted when you touch a contaminated surface he says You grab the door knob of the airplane bathroom and then touch your eyes nose or mouth But were not all doomed to get sick after a plane flight Gendreau says You can change behaviors when youre traveling and substantially reduce the risk of catching anything First off keep your hands microbefree I recommend bringing aboard a sanitizing gel with  percent alcohol he says Before you eat or drink sanitize your hand And dont forget to use the sanitizer after you wash your hands in the bathrooms sink Gendreau recommends The water in airplanes has a dirty track record In  the Environmental Protection Agency   high levels of fecal bacteria in the drinking water of  of the  planes it tested Then in  the agency set forth new guidelines for airlines for testing their water Now the EPA   that water on the airplane is safe to drink if you dont have a suppressed immune system But Gendreau still wouldnt risk it He wouldnt even brush his teeth with the water in an airplane bathroom I use bottled water he says Of course not all pathogens live in water or on surfaces Many such as the measles and tuberculosis hang out in the air Commercial jetliners recycle about  percent of the cabin air So if a sick passenger is sneezing in first class will his viralpacked air eventually reach you in the back of the plane Not likely Gendreau says Airplanes have hightech air filters that remove more than  percent of dust and microbes from the air he says And the ventilation is compartmentalized So the air circulates only in part of the cabin But if youre unlucky and are sitting close to the sick passenger then a flupacked sneeze may find your lungs before it finds the filter Several studies have looked at how airborne diseases such as TB and severe acute respiratory syndrome move about on planes For TB the conclusions have been consistent When you sit within two rows of someone infected with TB and the flight is longer than eight hours theres a chance you could catch disease But the size of this transmission zone depends on the specific pathogen Take SARS for instance Back in  a yearold man boarded a plane from Hong Kong to Beijing He had a fever on the flight And when he got to mainland China he was hospitalized About a week later the man died of SARS During the threehour flight he had    other passengers with the virus About half of those people were sitting within three rows of the ill man But even passengers seven rows in front of him caught the deadly virus Dont fear Gendreau says Theres even a way to protect yourself from these airborne pathogens Take advantage of that vent above your head Set your ventilation at low or medium he says Then position it so you can draw an imaginary line of current right in front of your head I put my hands on my lap so I can feel the current  so I know its properly positioned Then if something infectious is floating in your personal space he says that air from the vent will create enough current to knock it away And youll be more likely to go home healthy
