Doing at least two and a half hours of vigorous exercise each week cuts the chance of developing flu new data suggests Around  people took part in this years   run by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Moderate exercise did not appear to have a protective effect the researchers said Overall flu rates have been relatively low this winter The Flu Survey now in its fifth year tries to track as much detail as possible about who does and does not get flu One of the questions people must answer when they register as well as their age if they are around children and if they have been vaccinated is how many hours of vigorous exercise they do each week such as running fast cycling or competitive sports ranging from none to more than five hours They are then asked to log in each week and note how they are feeling and whether or not they have any flulike symptoms The researchers say their findings suggest  cases of flu per  people could be prevented just by engaging in vigorous exercise  They also said this years survey found some of the lowest reports of flulike illness in recent years Over the winter flu season only  of reports were positive for flulike symptoms compared with  last year  Children also appear to have had lower levels of flulike illness than last year with just  reporting symptoms this flu season compared with  last year  Dr Alma Adler of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said We need to treat this result cautiously as these are preliminary findings However they are consistent with findings for other conditions and really show the health benefits of exercise  Although many people have dodged the flu bullet this winter flu can occur at any time so taking advantage of the better weather is a great opportunity to get out and get fit to ward off flu this spring Flu Survey provides data to the government and feeds into Public Health Englands national flu surveillance programmes and is being released at the start of National Science  Engineering Week
