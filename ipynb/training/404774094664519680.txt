A new method for scanning childrens livers for tumours could prevent them being exposed to unnecessary radiation according to doctors in London Children are more vulnerable to radiation which can increase the odds of them developing cancer later in life  The team at Kings College Hospital are trialling a scan that turns organs into a field of gold to find tumours The findings were   Nodules or lesions on the liver can be detected when children with liver disease or fatty livers have an ultrasound scan However these could be malignant tumours that need treating or benign growths that can be ignored  A CT scan can tell the difference but this exposes the patient to Xray radiation We are trying to stop children having unnecessary radiation as the longterm effects show a substantial increase in cancer Prof Paul Sidhu a consultant radiologist at Kings College Hospital told the BBC The team at the hospital is testing an upgraded version of ultrasound which has been used in adults for a decade but not yet in children  A harmless chemical injected into the arm forms temporary microscopic bubbles in the bloodstream It acts as a contrast agent in the ultrasound scan Prof Sidhu said It makes the arteries light up and then the veins and the whole liver It looks like a field of gold If the liver lesion is benign it lights up like the rest of the liver But a cancerous growth will rapidly get rid of the contrast agent It looks like a black hole Its so clear it is like day and night Prof Sidhu said  In a trial on  children with chronic liver problems the test was able to accurately diagnose patients  Prof Sidhu concluded This is an exciting breakthrough but it now needs multicentre trials probably involving up to a couple of thousand patients to prove it works
