Picking up early signs of yellow fever an infectious disease which can be fatal could lead to a new treatment and better diagnosis a study said Writing   US scientists looked at the virus in macaques in the first study in primates for more than  years They found out how the virus damages the body and which genes it disrupts  The World Health Organisation WHO said the study was encouraging  The virus endemic in tropical areas of Africa and Latin America can cause jaundice and kidney failure and mainly targets the liver It kills  of people infected if they are not treated   There are around  cases of the infection every year  Researchers at the University of California Riverside gave  macaques yellow fever A control group were given the virus and the vaccine to compare the results  The study said within  hours of the virus  of the animals lymphocytes or white blood cells had been lost in all  animals leaving it vulnerable to infection  Yellow fever does not present in humans until quite a late stage said lead author Ilhem Messaoudi in California and there are no approved drugs to treat it meaning early diagnosis is crucial for survival as it allows for rehydration and supportive care  She said it was extremely challenging to get the vaccine to people in remote areas who need it and that it was not safe for babies and the elderly  The loss of white blood cells occurred before changes in the liver the study found meaning if this translated to humans doctors could spot it earlier and the chances of survival could be improved  Researchers also looked at the macaques genes and  were found to have been switched on within  hours of the initial infection compared to the control group  Twentyfive percent of the monkeys survived the infection said Ms Messaoudi She said she would now be looking at what it was genetically in those animals that made them survive with a view to developing a drug  She said Can we use gene expression as a diagnostic in the clinic  could we run a quick analysis on patients white blood cells and determine which infected person is at high or low risk  Supportive care would follow for all patients but it would change the dynamics of how aggressive the treatment needs to be William Augusto at the WHO said This research work is at an early stage and although encouraging will need additional work in both animal models and on human beings to better estimate its implications in terms of diagnostics and antiviral therapy
