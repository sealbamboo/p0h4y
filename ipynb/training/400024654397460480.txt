It takes only a moment to step over the line especially when no one knows exactly where the line is In my case it started with a visit from my old friend the activist The activist became my patient back in the mids when HIV was slowly morphing into a treatable disease He was young then with a mop of dark curls  excitable suspicious and frantic about his health He was convinced the new drugs were pure synthetic poison a profiteering scam by the government and Big Pharma He was also feeling sick enough that he thought he might just give them a try He lurched back and forth between these two incompatible positions once or twice a month dragging me and my prescription pad behind him in a flurry of abandoned amber plastic bottles Eventually though good sense kicked in and he had to admit that on meds he felt a lot better than otherwise He managed to retain his contempt for the system while regularly filling his prescriptions I no longer winced at his name on my schedule And now it is suddenly decades later his HIV has long been perfectly controlled and he is still fomenting revolution He used to march and holler now he works social media with a miserable old desktop computer that keeps breaking down As it happens about a week before one of our infrequent appointments  he barely needs me any more  I had treated myself to a brand new laptop sending an old perfectly good model into the back of the closet Of course I wiped its hard drive clean and gave it to him  for he is my old friend But also of course we met furtively in a back corridor and I carefully concealed the contraband in a nest of old grocery bags  for he is my patient and gifts to patients well we dont usually do that Once again apparently we were dealing with two incompatible positions Everyone knows that professional boundaries guide all medical activity in hospital office and clinic But aside from indisputable sexual and financial depredations no one agrees exactly where these boundaries lie Kindness to friend and duty to patient Are they one and the same Or separated by a barbedwire fence Opinion is all over the map At one extreme is the position probably best articulated by one of medicines great clinicianscientists Dr Donald Seldin of the University of Texas In a  talk to an audience of physicians Dr Seldin deplored a tendency to construe all sorts of human problems as medical problems and thus within doctors duty and purview to fix If it isnt relief of pain prevention of disability and postponement of death Dr Seldin said why then doctor leave it alone He got a   In the opposite corner stands Dr Gordon Schiff of Harvards Brigham and Womens Hospital who was issued an official reprimand a few years ago for egregious boundary crossing The incident that it set it off Dr Schiff now  an experienced senior clinician had tangled with an insurer on the phone for two hours before he gave up and handed an impoverished patient  to pay for her pain pills A resident observed the transaction and turned him in But Dr Schiff is a proud repeat offender whose past infractions include helping patients get jobs giving them jobs himself offering them rides home extending the occasional dinner invitation and yes once handing over a computer He was told physicians should stay away from random acts of kindness  an activity that may sound harmless but is quite distinct from the practice of medicine and has its risks Patients might get too familiar expect too much Dr Schiff   a long rumination about the incident a few months ago which he reported in an interview has elicited the email equivalent of a standing ovation In it he considers whom exactly the sanctions against befriending patients are designed to protect The patient in some instances he concludes but the doctor in far more Lets not pretend we are imposing limits for patients rather than our own best interests Dr Schiff draws medicines borders around a shared social agenda doctors help the patients health by helping the whole patient Dr Seldins borders contain specific technical tasks If you think too superficially about all of this you may begin to hear Dr Seldin screeching like Ebenezer Scrooge Are there no charities Are there no social workers But its not quite that simple I too handed out the odd  bill at work without thinking much about it until I didnt see one patient for almost a full year afterward  and she was a sick person who really needed care What had happened I couldnt come back without your money she said So that was a random act of blindness on my part good evidence of the perils of the terrain and the need to think before each step I think  I hope  the activist and I understand each other a little better than that
