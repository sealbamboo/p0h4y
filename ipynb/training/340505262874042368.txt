The research followed nearly  women during their pregnancies and then looked at whether their diets were linked to bone mass in their children later on The scientists had the women record what they ate each day and measured concentrations of vitamins in their blood Then when the children were roughly  years old the researchers carried out imaging tests to assess their bone mass  The study found that the children whose mothers consumed more protein phosphorus and vitamin B when they were pregnant had the greatest bone mass and bone mineral content The researchers also found that higher consumption of carbohydrates and greater blood concentrations of homocysteine  an amino acid that accumulates in response to a deficiency in B vitamins  were associated with lower bone mass and mineral content  The study which was   could not rule out the possibility that expectant mothers who ate more vitaminrich foods simply went on to provide their young children with more healthful diets But the researchers said they suspected that there was a more direct relationship and that fetal nutritional exposures may permanently influence bone development
