Top health insurance companies told members of Congress Wednesday that more than  percent of people whove signed up under the presidents new health care law have gone on to pay their premiums  a necessary step for the enrollment figures touted by the Obama administration to hold up Aetna reported payment rates in the low to mid percent range Wellpoint said the rate was as high as  percent for those whose premium had come due and the Health Care Service Corporation which sells Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in five states pegged the rate at  percent or above The figures were in line with what individual insurers have said on earnings calls with analysts and elsewhere in recent weeks Democrats seized on the figures disclosed at a House hearing as the latest sign that the health care law has defied its critics and is working By any rational reasonable measure we can call this law a success said Rep Diana DeGette DColo Republicans said plenty more questions remained  including whether rates will rise next year and by how much and how many of those covered were previously uninsured While the administration toasts the laws success with its Hollywood allies declaring this conversation over we will continue our pursuit for facts said Rep Fred Upton RMich chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee The six insurance industry witnesses summoned by an investigations subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee were unable to provide details on coming rate changes or how many people were previously uninsured prompting frustration at times from Republicans whod called the hearing We just dont have access to those numbers said Dennis Matheis an executive at Wellpoint Inc Wednesdays hearing was called in the wake of the release of a GOP report last week finding that as of midApril only  percent of people whod signed up for health plans actually had paid their first months premium That would have undermined the Obama administrations claims that with more than  million people signed up the   has proven itself a success But the GOP report didnt take into account a surge of signups as the health laws first open enrollment period drew to a close at the end of March and none of the insurance industry witnesses called Wednesday ratified its findings Witnesses also were reluctant to fall in line with Democratic lines of questioning designed to show the law is an unbridled success But if the hearing was not always illuminating it was certain not to be the last of its kind in a midterm election year where Republicans are aiming to capitalize on the unpopularity of Obamacare to hold onto control of the House and perhaps retake the Senate
