Nonsmokers who live with a smoker are exposed to three times the officially recommended safe levels of damaging air particles according to a study The researchers found that living with smokers is the same as living in smokefree homes in heavily polluted cities such as Beijing or London They said moving to smokefree homes could have major health benefits for nonsmokers The study has been published online in the BMJs   It was carried out by researchers at the universities of Edinburgh and Aberdeen They said there was already strong evidence to suggest that exposure to secondhand smoke is linked to a wide range of adverse health events such as respiratory and heart illness Accordingly many governments have introduced measures to restrict their populations exposure to second hand smoke within workplace and leisure settings Fine particulate matter PM such as fine dust or soot suspended in the air has been widely used as a marker for secondhand smoke exposure Main outdoor sources of particulate matter include exhaust fumes from motor vehicles and industrial emissions and more is known about what impact this has on health than the impact within indoor environments Therefore the Scottish researchers set out to estimate the amount of PM inhaled by people living in smoking and nonsmoking homes They studied data from four linked studies carried out in Scotland between  and  that had real time measurements of PM in homes and combined them with data on typical breathing rates and timeactivity patterns Collectively the studies produced air quality data from  smoking homes with a further  nonsmoking households Most sampling was for a hour period with the exception of one study data which was generally carried out over a period of  days The results showed that the average PM concentrations from the  smoking homes were about  times those found in the  nonsmoking homes Nonsmokers living with smokers typically had average PM exposure levels more than three times higher than the World Health Organisations guidance for annual exposure to PM Many nonsmokers living in smoking homes inhaled similar quantities of PM to nonsmokers who lived and worked in smokefree environments in cities such as Beijing or London with high levels of air pollution The researchers also calculated that overall homes where unrestricted heavysmoking activity took place produced secondhand smoke concentrations that were on average about  times higher than homes where efforts to reduce or restrict secondhand smoke exposure were more common Some homes studied had particularly high rates of smoking Around a quarter of homes had  hour average concentrations more than  times that recommended as an annual average concentration by WHO The researchers also estimated that the overall mass of PM inhaled over an year period for a person living in a typical smoke free home was about g compared with a similar person living in a smoking home who would inhale about g Nonsmokers living in smoking households would experience reductions of more than  in their daily inhaled PM intake if their home became smokefree the researchers calculated and the reduction was likely to be greatest for the very young and for older members of the population They concluded These findings ultimately support the need for efforts to reduce SHS second hand smoke exposure in the home most notably through the implementation of smoke free home rules and smoke free multiunit housing policies Lead author Dr Sean Semple of Aberdeen University said Smokers often express the view that outdoor air pollution is just as much a concern as the secondhand smoke in their home These measurements show that secondhand tobacco smoke can produce very high levels of toxic particles in your home much higher than anything experienced outside in most towns and cities in the UK  Making your home smokefree is the most effective way of dramatically reducing the amount of damaging fine particles you inhale
