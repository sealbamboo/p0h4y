Pardit Pri had health insurance until she decided to quit her job as a legal administrative assistant and stay home with her newborn son  months ago She thought shed have coverage by now But it didnt work out that way I knew that I wasnt going to be working for a while because I decided to stay home with my son and I thought  OK fingers crossed Nothing will happen during that time  she says as she plays with her son in their Orange County Calif apartment She had planned to return to work when her son was about  months old and get insurance through a new employer What she found instead was an economy still sputtering toward recovery and employers willing to hire workers only on a contract basis with no benefits As a result the yearold Pri has been without insurance for nearly two years Her partner who runs a local pharmacy provides insurance for their son But she and her yearold daughter from a previous relationship have no health coverage They are part of the legions of the uninsured including  percent of Californias population The Kaiser Family Foundation    of Californias uninsured on the eve of the opening of health care exchanges that were created under the Affordable Care Act Pri is one of those people some of whom will be followed over time by Kaiser Health News to see how they fare Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation That lack of health coverage adds anxiety to seemingly benign events like when Pris daughter asked about tennis lessons She asked me the other day I thought I was supposed to be in tennis And Im like uh oh Theres no insurance yet They wont let you play sports unless you have proper insurance Even though she and her daughter are healthy the fact that they dont have health coverage is always in the back of Pris mind What if theres a car accident Or she catches pneumonia These are poor peoples problems Pri once thought  not the problems of a solidly middleclass family aiming for success If I ever mention it to someone or someone knows I dont have health insurance which I wouldnt want to hide theyd be like Oh OK Well what kind of a job does she have where shes not able to get health insurance  Pri says she would like to look into insurance through the health care exchange and she has a vague notion that under the Affordable Care Act she will have to buy health coverage soon or pay a fine But shes concerned about the costs She hadnt seen ads yet for Covered California the states online insurance marketplace nor had she gotten anything in the mail If you can get insurance for   its worth it Id rather get the insurance than be fined But if the insurance is like  I might just think about getting fined then I dont know  Right now it feels like a loselose situation for me Pri thinks she will earn just under  next year So a fairly minimal plan might cost her about  a month but with lots of outofpocket costs Another possibility weighs on her Thats my projected income and I go and buy insurance based off that projected income then I lose my job What happens then One of the uncertainties for people like Pri is that her income in the coming year is uncertain That means that the amount she would pay for health insurance as well as the size of possible government subsidies is hard to predict If she pays too much she could receive a refund when she files her taxes for  The process seems a little dizzying and the dawning awareness of the laws intricacies and monthly costs raise Pris anxiety about the new requirements She says Ill figure it out before Jan
