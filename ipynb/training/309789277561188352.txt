Who knew that the flower nectar of citrus plants  including some varieties of grapefruit lemon and oranges  contains caffeine As does the nectar of coffee plant flowers And when honeybees feed on caffeinecontaining nectar it turns out the caffeine buzz seems to improve their memories  or their motivations for going back for more It is surprising says   at Newcastle University in the the UK the lead researcher of a new honeybee study published in the journal   In order to study the effects of caffeine on bees Wright and her colleagues trained the bees Pavlovian style to associate a reward of food with a smell of a flower Its a little bit like Pavlovs dog explains   of the Royal Botanic Garden in Kew outside London When Pavlov rang the bell the dog salivated And in this case when the bee detects the smell it extends its proboscis Stevenson says The proboscis is the bees long hairy tongue used to suck up the nectar from the flower The researchers wanted to know whether the bees would respond differently to flowers that contained a caffeinated nectar compared to those that just had sugary nectar And wow turns out there was quite a difference The bees feeding on the caffeinated nectar were three times better able to remember the flowers odor  hours later Stevenson says So could this mean that a caffeinated bee has a better memory Thats exactly what the study shows he says They the caffeinated bees just didnt forget says Wright And the benefit of remembering Wright says these bees may have an advantage over their pollinating competitors in terms of locating food So whether the caffeine is improving bees memories  as these researchers suggest  or simply making bees more motivated or vigilant to seek out more of the stimulant its intriguing that caffeine could be giving bees the same kinds of buzz that people get Caffeine absolutely influences our behavior says   of the University of Chicago It changes mood and performance in a variety of different ways Due to genetic differences our individual responses to caffeine vary Some of the best studies on the effects of caffeine on people come from the US military where caffeine has been studied as a way to keep soldiers alert In one  researchers observed the effects of caffeine on a group of sailors who were training to become Navy Seals During one portion of that training they are substantially sleep deprived and exposed to a variety of other stressors including cold temperatures and demanding physical activities explains researcher   of the US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine in Natick Mass When Lieberman studied the behaviors of sailors who consumed caffeine compared to those who had a noncaffeinated placebo he documented a range of benefits We found that in moderate doses caffeine enhanced ability to pay attention and it enhanced vigilance says Lieberman And caffeine also seemed to improve the exhausted sailors shortterm memories something Lieberman was not expecting to see We were surprised that caffeine had such widespread effects he says But in the absence of exhaustion caffeine doesnt seem to help people remember any better I dont think we have good data that establishes that caffeine has beneficial effects on memory Lieberman says  at least among people who are well rested
