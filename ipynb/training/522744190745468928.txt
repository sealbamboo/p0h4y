Thomas Eric Duncan was about as infectious as an Ebola patient can get when he showed up in an ambulance vomiting and with diarrhea at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas last month Even though he had told at least one nurse he had been to Liberia he wasnt tested for Ebola right away Two of the nurses who treated him have become infected themselves And even though she shouldnt have one of the nurses   to Cleveland and back  boarding even though she   Now the plane she took is being disinfected and  people must be tracked down and watched The handling of the first US Ebola case has been one embarrassment after another for the US health care system Even as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr Thomas Frieden has reassured the US public that any hospital should be able to handle an Ebola patient the Dallas case has contradicted him at every turn It may seem like matters are out of control While CDC has predicted from the beginning that someone might show up from West Africa with Ebola and has been issuing guidelines to hospitals basic human error pops up time and again CDC isnt immune to this its revised its guidelines several times and admits mistakenly having advised an infected nurse that she could fly on a commercial jet Duncan first felt ill Sept  He should have immediately sought care having just arrived from Liberia and having handled a woman who later died from Ebola He didnt  its not clear why not and stories from various relatives are not clear on why not When he finally sought care at Texas Presbyterian on the night of Sept  he was already very ill vomiting and suffering from diarrhea He should have been isolated immediately and treated as if he had Ebola whether he tested positive or not It is still not clear whether this happened but the National Nurses Union which does not represent nurses at the hospital says its members have spoken to nurses who said Duncan was not isolated and that they were not given sufficient protective gear at first Once Duncan was diagnosed  three days later  nervous nurses did what they could to protect themselves anyway layering up in protective gear and sometimes putting on three pairs of gloves Now it seems they may have in fact put themselves more at risk by doing this Our investigations increasingly suggest that the first several days before the patient was diagnosed appeared to be the highest risk period Frieden told a news conference These two health care workers both worked on those days and both had extensive contact with the patient when the patient had extensive production of bodily fluids because of vomiting and diarrhea Both Nina Pham and Amber Vinson were helping Duncan and would have been close to him as he suffered the terrible effects of the virus and struggled to breathe Nurses who have asked to remain anonymous have said they were not sure what to do to protect themselves Frieden says the records support this When we reviewed the records for the first several days of the patients stay before he was diagnosed we see a lot of variability in the use of personal protective equipment and when our team arrived the same day the patient was diagnosed we noted for example that some health care workers were putting on three or four layers of protective equipment in the belief that this would be more protective Frieden said We certainly understand the fear and the anxiety thats normal and its understandable these are good dedicated people who worried about themselves and their families and they were trying to protect themselves better But in fact by putting on more layers of gloves and other protective clothing it becomes much harder to put them on it becomes much harder to put them off and the risk of contamination during the process of taking these gloves off it gets much higher Now CDC has sent a team of experts to the hospital including a site manager who will ensure that staff caring for Pham do everything by the book And theyll send a go team to any hospital that may get an Ebola patient in the future As they should have staff who treated Duncan were keeping an eye on their temperatures Vinson traveled to Ohio to   and even called CDC before she came home on a commercial flight to report her temperature was  She did call us and we did not tell her she could not fly a CDC spokeswoman told NBC News The threshold thats considered a fever with Ebola is  Such flubs are to be expected says Tommy Thompson a former Wisconsin governor who headed the US Health and Human Services Department from  to  I see mistakes being made but there are always going to be mistakes made Thompson told NBC News Any time you have an outbreak you are going to have mistakes made added Thompson who oversaw a disastrous response to the  anthrax attacks in which five people were killed and  made sick Thompson turned the anthrax debacle into a  billion program to rebuild the nations public health infrastructure The question says Thompson and other experts is whether the federal government state governments and hospitals learn quickly enough from the current mistakes Frieden says they have Ebola is hard to fight but we know how to fight it and we know how to beat it he said The situation changes every day were always going to be open with what we know and share more rather than less Were going to put an extra margin of safety to protect Americans Hes admitted to errors We couldve sent a more robust hospital infection control team and been more handson with the hospital from day one about exactly how this should be managed he said Tuesday I wish we had put a team like this on the ground the day the patient  the first patient  was diagnosed That might have prevented this infection Pham and Vinson were both diagnosed and isolated quickly and doctors say early treatment can help Ebola patients survive better Phams in good condition Vinson was sent to Emory University hospital which successfully treated   and   and which is treating a   infected in Sierra Leone whos asked to remain anonymous The hospital has also apologized We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola We are deeply sorry Dr Daniel Varga chief clinical officer for Texas Health Resources said in testimony prepared for a hearing Thursday Also in our effort to communicate to the public quickly and transparently we inadvertently provided some information that was inaccurate and had to be corrected No doubt that was unsettling to a community that was already concerned and confused and we have learned from that experience as well Now CDC has added  people to the list of those being watched   who treated or contacted Duncan while he was ill President Barack Obama canceled a fundraising trip and held a highprofile meeting with cabinet officials Wednesday On Thursday Frieden and other top health officials will testify before Congress about the nations Ebola response Obama whose last healthrelated mess the  of the Obamacare websites happened precisely a year ago said his cabinet was reviewing what happened in Dallas and how were going to make sure that something like this is not repeated and that we are monitoring supervising overseeing in a much more aggressive way exactly what has taken place in Dallas initially and making sure that the lessons learned are then transmitted to hospitals and clinics all across the country
