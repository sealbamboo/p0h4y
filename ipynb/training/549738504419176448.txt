Targets have become synonymous with the NHS From hospital operations to cancer care and fighting superbugs successive governments have used them to keep a grip on performance  And now  just five months away from an election  all eyes are on how the health service performs against its most highprofile measures But is this obsession with targets healthy and do they even work in the first place The answer is not a simple one One of the easiest ways to understand targets and the effect they have is to think of the health service as a balloon squeeze one part and it bulges out elsewhere Take hospital waiting times perhaps the flagship target of the whole NHS When the target was first brought in in  the bar was set at an month maximum wait Then over the course of four years it was brought down to six months  However it wasnt long before the balloon started bulging The target at that time only measured the point from diagnosis to treatment starting so what happened was a bottleneck  some said goslow  developed between GP referral and the patient getting the tests they needed for diagnosis For some the waits for diagnosis were actually longer than the time spent officially waiting  As criticisms grew ministers in England  by this point health had started being devolved  responded with their most ambitious target yet By  they said noone should wait more than  weeks from GP referral to treatment Some said it could not be achieved But it was  and the other parts of the UK followed with their own versions of the target Problem solved Not quite The target gives hospitals some leeway to take into account exceptional circumstances  and so only  of patients have to be treated in  weeks While it is a perfectly sensible measure which is supported by doctors it did have an unintended consequence When the week deadline was missed in the early years there was little incentive in coldhard performance terms at least to treat that patient as the target only measured those that were treated within  weeks The result was that by the summer of    was rising There were over  people who had waited for more than six months and nearly  for over a year Once again the balloon had bulged Since then there has been a big focus on tackling long waiters But that has come at a cost This summer  to keep the number of long waiters down  ministers   of the target to allow hospitals to keep up The target has now been missed for the last five months Dr Mark Porter a hospital doctor and leader of the British Medical Association is scathing saying they are politically not clinically driven As pressure on services rises and care is increasingly rationed they can actually leave some patients waiting longer for treatment as in order to meet one target a backlog of patients with perhaps more serious illnesses is created  Such an effect is not unique to hospital operations either It can be seen in AE units too Since  hospitals have had to ensure patients spend no longer than four hours in emergency departments  The NHS has largely succeeded over the years although it is proving increasingly difficult in  But if you look carefully at the data you can see some strange patterns Look at this graph below It shows how long patients waited in AE during  breaking them down into  minute groups As you would expect there is a fairly uniform distribution in terms of when people are seen until that is the final  minutes before the fourhour mark Then the numbers dealt with suddenly double  This is caused by a dramatic increase in admissions into hospital signified by the dark green colour here rather than being discharged or referred elsewhere Once the fourhour mark passes the numbers drop again So what is happening An admission does not necessary mean a patient gets seen immediately For some it simply means they are moved to another ward often attached to AE These are sometimes called medical assessment units To most patients they will be undistinguishable from the AE ward they had been in Over the years there have been reports of patients facing long waits in these units but because they have been admitted it is not counted in the official statistics Once again the target has  to some extent  led to a bulge elsewhere A bulge can also be seen outside AE units when ambulances queue Paramedics have to wait for a member of the AE team to be ready before they can handover their patients This should not take longer than  minutes but a   last year by the BBC showed it often does The thing with targets is that they often displace the problem says Kings Fund director of policy Richard Murray They dont necessarily make things better overall they just alter who loses out Nowhere is that clearer than with mental health It has not been subject to a target and now there are regular reports of patient care suffering The governments response Its in the process of rolling out a series of   So does that mean they are entirely bad No of course not says Mr Murray Waits are certainly shorter than they used to be while their use in areas such as cancer or for infections like MRSA is perhaps more compelling While some doctors may disagree you have to wonder whether the results we have seen would have happened without them Nonetheless they have always been  to borrow a quote from Tony Blair in   a blunt instrument They give an indication of what is happening but they dont always tell the full story
