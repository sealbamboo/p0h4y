Need more space in the oven this Thanksgiving Try serving this raw apple pie for dessert perfect for your vegetarian vegan and raw foods guests and especially for your overbooked oven    A raw foods enthusiast Marie Delcioppo loves challenging people to the raw foods diet by giving them a dessert first claiming Its pie how bad could it be For this dish she combined apples with nuts dates blueberries coconut and other spices to create a nutrient packed easytomake dessert Growing up in a big Italian family Ms Delcioppo remembers sitting in the kitchen and watching her father create exquisite meals from scratch However when Ms Delcioppo was older she was intimidated by cooking believing that she could never live up to her fathers expert skills in the kitchen  When she finally did start cooking she says I did not have high hopes for myself I was petrified She remembers she could barely cut an onion But her childhood experiences of watching her father create meals from basic ingredients inspired her to embark on the raw foods diet She was happy to find that it was one of the easiest diets to follow as no cooking is involved  To create her crisp fresh apple pie you will need a food processor not an oven To create the crust combine pecans dates and shredded coconut For apples she prefers Honey Crisp The filling is a mash of apples blueberries and chia seeds which help create the traditional pie filling texture Top it off with more apples sliced paperthin   if you dont have the knifeskills use a food processor or mandoline slicer Top it off with a walnutanddate crumble The pie has a different consistency than a traditional cooked pie but your guests will be impressed by the refreshing taste after a heavy meal  Its incredibly fresh says Ms Delcioppo You can really taste the flavors
