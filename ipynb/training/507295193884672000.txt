For a recreational runner theres no rite of passage as masochistic as running a marathon We ache for the battle scars chafing blisters and psychosis brought on by trying to figure out how to use the GPS watch thats supposed to be a training aid Ive run several Ks but never more than  miles in one outing Just before Christmas I decided to make the leap to get that marathon monkey off my back On Sunday Ill be one of the  people running from Dodger Stadium to the Santa Monica Pier in the Los Angeles Marathon I fantasized about finishing in under four hours which runners would consider respectable for a middleaged guy like me But since this was just for fun I didnt stress about the training There are marathon coaches running clubs and articles that provide detailed training schedules  for regular folks As a certified fitness professional I figured I was fully qualified to put one foot in front of the other How hard could it be Plenty hard it turns out My running schedule was based on two simple ideas Add distance incrementally and push hard The goal was to build up to  miles by early March then ease off for the final two weeks before the race to give my body a chance to recover To augment the distance training I planned to keep my conditioning up with a few comparatively short  to mile runs each week Weight training would change to boost endurance lighter loads and higher reps But things didnt go according to plan Heres how my training progressed then regressed On the first day of winter I ran my first half marathon in  hour  minutes  seconds and was neither tired nor sore The rule of thumb for estimating your marathon time is to double your best  or in my case only  halfmarathon time and add  minutes That calculation predicted a  finish I felt invincible Three weeks later I ran  miles at an minutepermile pace That would have been a  finish at marathon distance My thighs were battered but the invincible feeling remained Two weeks after that I logged another  miles at the same pace My right ankle turned stiff An mile run later in the week sealed the ankles fate purple swollen and definitely painful Experts at the running injury clinic at a local university did a full workup including a treadmill gait analysis The verdict Insufficient hip strength was causing my ankles to bend inward upon landing It wasnt the distances that had done me in it was the speed which causes a significantly higher impact Speed kills So in February I traded in running for hipstrengthening exercises with a resistance band plus a few hours on my road bike I also got a little depressed drank more beer than usual and put on a couple of pounds Training resumed this month but a lackluster race performance is certain Last week it took me  to go a halfmarathon distance I could have gone faster but I also could have ended up on IV afterward I thought I was tough But being in great physical condition is not enough What matters is listening to your body when its warning you that youre pushing yourself too hard Dont let arrogance mute that message See you at the finish I hope
