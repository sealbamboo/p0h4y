Jack Everett sat on his living room couch wearing a back brace eyes glued to a massive TV set playing his favorite video game NHL  Im the Boston Bruins the yearold said as he deftly worked the video controls The guy that just shot was Milan Lucic Hes a really good guy on our team Whether at home or during recess at his elementary school in suburban Los Angeles Jacks young life now is about sitting still Well I can eat lunch with friends and I play cards Jack says But his classmates are out running and jumping outside Thats a big change from last year when Jack played club soccer with multiple practices and games in a week He was doing a morning endurance workout and afternoon skill session says his mother Marcia Riso About two hours for each The coach would often have extra training on the weekend andor scrimmage Games were played on the weekends including tournaments which were two days long Then his back started hurting during games His parents thought probably it was a pulled muscle A sports chiropractor gave Jack massages and muscle stimulation But it didnt help Finally at a tournament in Orange County the pain became unbearable I played like one or two times says Jack And then I just couldnt do it anymore Jack Everett had broken a bone in his back The official diagnosis was a   in his lower back Jacks doctor said the injury was due to overuse Who knew says his mother that elastic little kids can break Sports medicine doctors say theyve seen a rise in overuse injuries among young athletes like Jack The toll on knees and ankles is wellknown But many parents are surprised to learn that children can injure their backs too Jack was all in with his beloved soccer He joined a club team that practiced and played  months out of the year Riso says she and Jacks father wanted their son to play several other sports too so he wouldnt burn out But Jack was as adamant as a yearold can be It was all soccer soccer soccer So we thought says Riso this is what he wants to do and hes great at it Why not But low back injuries like Jacks can keep young athletes laid up for months according to   an associate professor of orthopedic surgery at Loyola Medicine in Maywood Ill Jayanthi studied more than  young athletes and found that lower back injuries were the third most common injury in athletes younger than  after knees and ankles He presented the data last year at the American Academy of Pediatrics conference Almost half of the back injuries were severe enough to sideline kids for one to six months and put them at future risk for longterm back problems These back injuries are most often caused by repetitive bending Jayanthi says combined with high levels of sports participation Young athletes can reduce the risk of back injuries by not spending more hours a week than their age playing sports Jayanthi says Also they should not spend more than twice as much time playing organized sports as they spend in gym class and unorganized play Jayanthi also recommends something that many young athletes and parents would find inconceivable Dont specialize in one sport before late adolescence Thats easier said than done in the midst of a youth sports juggernaut that puts a premium on hypercompetitive training and playing at the earliest ages Jayanthi understands the dilemma And like any man of science he seeks data to prove a point A comprehensive   he published in the   examined the impact of early specialized training And if you look at all sports he says there are only two types of sports where specializing early leads to greater success later He says those sports are gymnastics and diving because young athletes in those sports have to compete before becoming fully mature Publishing a paper is one thing its another to convince what Jayanthi calls the stakeholders in a culture dedicated to intense youth sports Coaches sports organizations sports manufacturers and yes parents Like Marcia Riso We thought wow Riso says Jacks getting excellent training Hes got an excellent coach Hes working so hard He could really do well in this sport And hes starting so young  we thought that was a positive Because it is so competitive  And its so much about winning Which isnt a bad thing I believe in healthy competition But   When Jack Everett finally takes off for good the back brace he wears most of the day hell have a different sports experience says his mom The plan is to diversify  doctors orders in fact Riso says it makes her kind of sad because Jack loved his soccer team so much But not as sad as it makes her watching her son cope with injury and inactivity And theres a silver lining Once Jack is able physical therapy to strengthen his core and his glutes should make him one strong little kid Riso told him at the end of it hell have pack abs And hes very excited she says
