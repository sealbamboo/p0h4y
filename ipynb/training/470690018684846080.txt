Even as   and whooping cough  diseases once considered eradicated in the United States  surge around the country more people are still choosing not to vaccinate their children The rise of the antivaccine movement is not only dividing parents on the playground but causing strife within families Whether its a disagreement between siblings or a generational spat between grandparents and adult children the fear of vaccines and   is increasingly being played out at home Sundari Kraft of Denver Colorado the mom of a yearold advises parents in her community about the benefits of immunization as a volunteer for a provaccine group But theres one person she doesnt bring the subject up with her sister whose four children are unvaccinated Kraft initially had her own daughter on a delayed vaccination schedule a decision she attributes to uninformed parenting While antivaccination proponents many of whom believe that vaccines and the preservatives in them cause disorders such as autism     are a relatively   theyve become so vocal vaccine resistance is growing in certain areas of the country such as San Diego   and Portland Oregon Twenty states allow   the vaccine issue has been an ongoing fight in her family ever since she and her husband had a premature baby When the baby was in the NICU at the hospital they wouldnt let her husbands brother and sisterinlaw visit because they dont vaccinate their kids KortzKreuger says they also dont let them hold the baby which in turn has upset her husbands parents His parents think we are in the wrong and still ask my husband to let them hold him anytime we are together  it is a firm no Kortz Krueger adds My son will be a boy and he will get dirty and get scratches and bruises I know I cant protect him from everything but on things that I can you bet I am going to do everything in my power to Over the last eight years pediatrician Dr Nathan Boonstra says more parents in his practice at Blank Childrens Health Center in Des Moines Iowa have been questioning vaccines although families tend to argue over specific shots rather than all immunizations he says National vaccination rates for children  months are now above  percent for several key shots including MMR mumps measles and rubella DTAP diptheria tetanus and pertussis and polio so obviously most Americans favor immunizations But those rates are slightly below the  high of  percent for MMR and  percent for DTAP   While Boonstra advocates for full protection against preventable diseases its particularly crucial for highrisk children such as an immunocompromised child he says When families are in disagreement over vaccines he says my best advice is for both parents to continue to talk to the childs doctor and be willing to listen to the doctor and each other Doctors could help resolve disputes by thoroughly addressing a parents concern about vaccines A primary care doctor often doesnt have a lot of spare time during a day but I think its crucial to make the time says Boonstra Health officials worry that as more families resist vaccines there will be more outbreaks of measles whooping cough or other childhood infectious diseases A recent report from the CDC estimates that vaccines given over the last  years will  of children and more than  million hospitalizations However   that scare tactics about diseasesickened kids can backfire with parents Sue Leusner a mom of two in Tacoma Washington stopped vaccinating her children when her second child a son started showing signs of autism  walking on his tip toes loss of eye contact and loss over verbal skills  at  months old The more I started to read about it the more I became vehement about not doing it The risks outweighed the perceived benefits she says Leusner persuaded her husband not to take her oldest child then  to the doctor for booster shots While members of her family respected her decision some still dont agree Leusner just doesnt talk about it with them adding There are some people who have made up their minds and you are not going to change their minds Whats more difficult for Leusner is the opinion of people she doesnt know Its very polarizing and you get totally demonized as a parent if you dont vaccinate says Leusner Melissa Marr who along with her husband is a chiropractor researched vaccinations long before her daughter was born She says that after weighing the pros and cons they decided not to vaccinate their daughter and are now not vaccinating their monthold son She calls  as a result of their decisions a generation gap Our parents dont necessarily disagree but just dont really understand says Marr We dont do anything they did We had natural child birth not cesarean I breastfed until  months while they bottle and formulafed they did all vaccinations while we choose none But we stand by our decision
