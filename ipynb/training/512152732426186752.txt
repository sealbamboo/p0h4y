Many US scientists had hoped to ride out the steady decline in federal funding for biomedical research but its continuing on a downward trend with no end in sight So leaders of the science establishment are now trying to figure out how to fix this broken system Its a familiar problem Biomedical science has a long history of funding ups and downs and in the past the system has always righted itself with the passage of time and plumper budgets You know I lived through those cycles I know what they were like says cancer biologist Dr Harold Varmus whose long research career includes a Nobel Prize However he says the funding challenges were never in my experience anywhere as dramatic as they are now Varmus knows the problem well  now head of the National Cancer Institute he directed the entire National Institutes of Health in  when President Clinton started an ambitious push to double the NIH budget It has to be recognized that we actually   for that much that fast at that time Varmus says And many voices  including my own  were saying Yes this is great and we can spend the money well but you have to be prepared for what you do at the end of that five years  Doubling the budget he realized would of course encourage rapid growth  so smaller continual increases would then be required to keep this bigger enterprise humming And the annual budget did grow to an impressive size  surpassing  billion But adjusting for inflation todays federal budget for biomedical research has   much of that gain Many scientists say the obvious solution is to give them more money Theres no doubt that having a bounce back  an increase in our funding  would be helpful Varmus says But I dont think its going to solve all the problems at this point There are now   in the way research is financed Scientists and universities alike are thinking less and less about the exciting frontiers of science and more and more about tactics they can use simply to stay afloat Its difficult to operate and difficult to operate in an adventurous way Varmus says And thats bad not just for the scientists but for patients and universities hoping to benefit from the fruits of a scientists labor One of the biggest changes is in how NIH money is used These days its not simply for conducting experiments  its increasingly spent on scientists salaries and even to repay the loans on new laboratory buildings that sprang up like mushrooms during budget boom times This is a very tricky business Varmus says because we recognize that universities are under tremendous pressures In states for example that have some of the best public universities in the country the amount of money that can be used to support research activities has declined precipitously So the NIH cant simply make bold new rules about how these universities can spend grant dollars Instead Varmus and some colleagues have been focusing on gentler changes that might help We have to remember that this is a fragile system Varmus says  Do no harm the doctors mantra is very applicable here One idea is to   the number of young scientists being trained for careers that dont exist and to instead hire staff scientists to carry out more of the daytoday lab work that the apprentices now perform Staff scientists dont necessarily have to have PhDs Varmus says They might have masters degrees And being a staff scientist these days is quite an appealing way to practice science because you can concentrate on doing the work and not get tangled up in the sometimes noxious process of fighting for funding The NIH could also help some scientists avoid the money scramble by following the example of the   Varmus suggests This private philanthropy gives generous grants to individual scientists based on that persons broad ideas and talents rather than funding a specific research proposal Whether scientists can gently solve the structural problems remains to be seen Varmus says Last April he and some colleagues laid out several broad ideas in Rescuing US biomedical research from its systemic flaws an avidly read   in the   He and his coauthors are hoping to broaden the conversation We want to bring together folks who are in government administration scientific societies advocacy groups students faculty even members of Congress Varmus says One idea he says among other possibilities might be to convene a summit akin to the   where scientists gathered to set their own rules for dealing with genetic engineering Whatever the ultimate solution much is at stake We have a system that has worked well in the past that has made the US the leader in biomedical research worldwide he says and while I dont think weve lost that edge yet we do see a rising tide in lots of places Maybe eventually the threat of losing this competitive edge will spur the US Congress to address the underlying problems in the way it authorizes funding for biomedical research But that appears to be a distant prospect In the meantime another ancient injunction to doctors Physician heal thyself seems apt The research establishment will try to find a way to ease the pain on its own
