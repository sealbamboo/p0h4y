About  years ago a prestigious surgeon in Paris found a new body part while dissecting cadavers He described the structure as a pearly fibrous band on the outside of the bones in the knee That sure sounds like a ligament But nobody really gave it much thought And poof Over the next hundred years or so the body part was pretty much forgotten Then in the s the mysterious band of tissue reappeared in the medical literature every now and then It went by several names No one was really sure what the heck it was doing or even could tell with certainty which bones it connected Until now Orthopedic surgeons in Belgium have hunted down the enigmatic structure in cadavers And what do you know  the good Parisian doctor was right There   an overlooked ligament in the knee And it might be important for keeping your knee from twisting and turning especially after an injury to the   or ACL Dr Johan Bellemans and his team at the University Hospital Leuven   the ligament a few months ago in the   They named it the anterolateral ligament or ALL and they offered the first clear data on what its function is Its eyeopening and provocative work says   the chief of orthopedic surgery at the Hospital For Special Surgery in New York City He wasnt involved in the study but he saw Bellemans team present the work at a conference Weve known for years that there was a hardened fibrous tissue in this location he tells Shots And that this area of tissue plays some role So its not such a dramatic discovery but kind of a rediscovery  or a refocusing of attention The ALL is about the length of a small thumb The band connects the thigh bone to the shinbone on the outside of the leg The ligament probably helps to keep the knee from rotating inward the researchers suggest Damage to the ALL may be one reason why some people dont bounce back after ACL surgery About  in  people who have their ACL repaired can return to sports with no problems at all Rodeo says But for some the knee still isnt quite right It buckles abnormally or gives way during sports The ALL may have a role in a small percentage of patients with persistent problems after the reconstruction of their ACL Rodeo says We need to learn more about its function and pay more attention to it Even after ACL surgery is successful Rodeo says about half of people develop arthritis in the knee  years later The next frontier in knee surgery is preventing arthritis he says Should we start to focus on this ligament Maybe Bellemans the lead surgeon on the study tells Shots that about  percent of his patients with ACL tears also have an injury in the ALL Over the past few years he and his team have been repairing the ligament when they fix an ACL But its too soon to say whether the extra treatment raises the success rate of the surgery So why have doctors overlooked the the ligament for decades Its not so easy to find Bellemans says If you ask even the most experienced surgeon to look for the ALL they wouldnt find it Its in an area that we dont usually see during surgery
