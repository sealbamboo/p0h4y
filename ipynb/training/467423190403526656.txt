Genetic analysis of her remains suggests that Naia is related to modern Native Americans Its a clue to resolving the issue of whether the group we call Native Americans are indeed related to the first settlers of this land mass This study promotes the view that Native Americans and Paleoamericans share a homeland said James Chatters of Applied Paleoscience who was the lead author of the study  That homeland is called Beringia also called the Bering Land Bridge that connected what is now Siberia and Alaska The new research goes against the idea that the first Americans may have come over in separate migrations from Europe and Asia  Other genetic evidence from both modern Native Americans and ancient skeletons indicates that people of Siberia landed in eastern Beringia between  and  years ago the study said They seem to have moved south after  years ago  Naias genetic lineage was analyzed through mitochondrial DNA This is genetic material that is passed from mothers to children and is stored in the   a part of a cell that is essential for energy production and is sometimes thought of as a power plant Scientists are able to characterize genetic lineages by looking at mitochondrial DNA Its important to note however that this does not reveal as much information about a persons heritage as nuclear DNA which is stored in the cells nucleus and contains material from both parents Researchers are planning to look at Naias nuclear DNA also Chatters said Researchers found that the  to yearold teenagers mitochondrial DNA belongs to Haplogroup D a category only found in the Americas these days but which originally came from an Asian lineage Some South American populations today have this genetic signature  of indigenous people of Chile and Argentina have it so do  of Native Americans said Deborah Bolnick assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin  Through her maternal line the girl in the cave seems to have been related to modern Native Americans as well as their ancestors Bolnick said But wait  Naias physical features are very different from that of modern day Native Americans Flat broad faces with flaring cheekbones and short round heads are typical of Native Americans Chatters said By contrast Naia had an angular head and a small relatively narrow face  Naias features are more similar to other ancient populations and isolated huntergatherer populations in such places as the Philippines Chatters said  Paleoamericans  those earliest people with the distinctive skull and facial features  could have come from Siberia too Bolnick said It therefore seems more likely that differences between Paleoamericans and Native Americans today are due to evolutionary changes that occurred in Beringia and the Americas over the last  years Some scientists believe a population entered Beringia became geographically isolated and then experienced evolutionary changes in their mitochondrial DNA during several thousand years Chatters said  From there multiple migrations may have taken people out of Beringia and to the Americas What this study is presenting for the first time is the evidence that Paleoamericans with those distinctive features can also be directly tied to the same Beringian source population as contemporary Native Americans Bolnick said  Facial features may have evolved over time in response to such factors as changing climates and diets Chatters said Paleoamericans also have characteristics such as facial projection  features such as mouth and eyes protruding from the skull  that are related to aggression a behavior that would be favorable in a migrating population Chatters said As groups settle down however docility tends to be advantageous  The nearcomplete skeleton dated to between  and  years old was discovered in a pit that lies in an underwater cave system in a crevice the jungle floor about five miles from the Caribbean Sea  Traversing through a flooded tunnel divers discovered this chamber that was so dark it seemed to absorb their underwater lights  Alberto Nava of Bay Area Underwater Explorers said at a press conference They called it Hoyo Negro which means Black Hole in Spanish  The floor disappeared under us and we could not see across to the other side We pointed our lights down and to the sides All we could see was darkness said Nava who is the codirector and lead diver for the Hoyo Negro Project Navas team found many of Naias bones as well as a small cranium laying upside down with a perfect set of teeth and dark eye sockets looking back at us They made this discovery in   Most of the bones are still underwater Chatters said Scientists conducted the DNA analysis and age estimate based on one of Naias wisdom teeth  Recently to protect the skull and some bones damaged by unauthorized visitors we recovered them from the cave but studies of those pieces have not yet begun he said  This cave site was probably dry until about  years ago when it flooded because of glacial melting researchers said There is evidence from the way that the bones are distributed in the cave and iron oxide on the walls that it contained an ephemeral pool of water that may have been filled by storms Chatters said We may never know why Naia died but Chatters said it looks like she took a great fall into the pit fracturing her pelvis She would not have entered the cave system through a crevice in the jungle as the divers did but rather from a groundlevel entrance as the ground was lower than it is today The name Naia comes from the Greek word for water nymph researchers said Even if we dont know what she called herself further investigation may uncover more about her roots and life
