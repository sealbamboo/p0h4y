Her son Gabriel is now  He gets to live a pretty normal life and goes to school full time in Alameda California thanks to the immunosuppressant drugs hes taking for his heart He takes two pills every day so that his body will not reject the donor heart that keeps him alive Because his immune system cant fight off the  in the measlesmumpsrubella MMR vaccine it is the only vaccination he cant have  Now with about   having sprouted up across the US this year more than half of them in California Vallejos is gravely concerned about her sons safety Vallejos a yearold professional counselor says she understands the hesitation some parents have about vaccinating their kids I understand fearing for your child I handed my son over to a cardiac surgeon when he was  days old knowing that I might never see him again she says All she wants for her son is to keep him safe but if theres a live case of measles at Gabriels school his cardiac team told Vallejos that she will have to pull him out Vallejos doesnt want to see Gabriel quarantined and forced to do schooling at home She urges those who dont vaccinate their kids to consider what their choice really means Just like you dont want people forcing you to make choices about your childs healthcare I dont want your choices to either force my family into undesirable positions at best and at worst to harm or even kill my son she says  One parent to anotherlets keep all our loved ones safe One death by preventable disease is one too many If you stop  in the grocery store and asked her where she stands in the vaccination debate the Beaverton Oregon resident will fervently tell you shes provaccination Her yearold daughter is up to date with all her shots but her yearold son hasnt been immunized Thats not for lack of trying The teacher has struggled deeply with not vaccinating her son Brayden who has had allergic reactions to every vaccination shot hes received since he was young Typically after Brayden gets a vaccine he spikes a fever of  degrees and is rushed to the hospital West explained After that hell spend days in bed unable to lift his limbs West says she feels guilty having one child who isnt vaccinated She found herself arguing with close friends because Brayden isnt immunized against measles  But West has tried multiple times to vaccinate Brayden because she feels its her civic duty I would love to vaccinate him she says Her son also struggles with a host of other food and environmental allergies that the family tries to manage It really bugs me when families have totally healthy kids and they dont vaccinate With the cases of measles rising West hopes that families who have resisted vaccinating will at least try like she has with Brayden It is an ethical thing for me to try she says These kids who are compromised are like canaries in a coal mine They get sick easily and they get sick harder Parents today dont know how bad it can get says   The yearold remembers having measles back in  when she was  years old and attending the first grade in Knoxville Tennessee She was confined to her bedroom for days with the curtains drawn All her parents could offer to treat the symptoms were baby aspirin soup and cold compresses For two weeks she endured a high fever and excruciating body aches and she was covered in a thick itchy rash I was young but I remember it all very well and would not wish this on anyone child or adult says Lambert who now lives in Harpers Ferry West Virginia It took about six months or more for me to become myself again but I remained a much weaker kid for a long time With news of measles now present in  states Lambert says she is surprised more people her age are not speaking up about the dangers They know better and know what can happen  She hopes younger parents will think about the dangers of future outbreaks and reconsider their stance on vaccinating  The way parents view vaccines seems to have changed since the s and s Lambert says She remembers parents had no choice about immunizing their kids Students were simply lined up at the gym or lunchroom and inoculated I dont remember anyone who refused for their kids to be immunized at that time she says  Lambert has five adult children They were all immunized when they were younger and all six of her grandchildren are vaccinated as well including her grandson Isaac who is  years old and was diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome at age  Her family does not believe Isaacs condition has anything to do with vaccinations   Most folks my age and older remember the horrors of measles polio and smallpox We surely dont want that to happen again
