In a call center in Rancho Cordova Calif on Tuesday all the workers wore the same Tshirt Keep Calm And Go Live They were ready and waiting to take calls from consumers who could buy health insurance on Californias new insurance marketplace for the first time So the Tshirts urged calm but the mood was ecstatic and emotional among the architects and key backers who gathered to flip the switch on the Golden States exchange Peter Lee executive director of   the states exchange addressed a cheering crowd in this Sacramento suburb and drew a stark contrast to the grinding politics of Washington DC that shuttered much of the federal government While Washington is talking about shutdown were talking about startup said Lee as he declared an end to the era of a punishing individual insurance market Gone are the days of invasive questions when you apply for insurance about your allergies your asthma your diabetes your cancer Gone said Lee Youre never going to be asked that again Gone are rates based on your answers to those questions While the mood was equally buoyant at a Hampton Va rally the circumstances for people wanting insurance in the state couldnt have been more different At Enrollfest one of the few Affordable Care Act events in Virginia organizer Gaylene Kanoyton was quick to point out that the state is not providing any resources So we just have to go ahead and move on It is a grassroots effort It is up to all of us as citizens to come together Kanoyton managed to get a dozen local agencies health centers and advocacy groups to set up tables at the Boo Williams Sportsplex in the southeastern Virginia city She advertised the event in churches community centers and on the radio and says that some  people showed up Among them was Brenda Harrell  a former hairstylist whos lived in Hampton all her life Im here to get some insurance some coverage Harrell said Ive been out of work over a year I have heart and respiratory failure denied for Medicaid and still dont have any coverage I havent seen a doctor for my breathing for over a year She brought along her portable oxygen tank She has  in medical debt already and cant afford new tubes for the tank Shes just been using the same ones over and over she says Now she has a glimmer of hope as she sits down with a certified application counselor from a local health center to help her sign up on the federal governments enrollment site   But the site is overloaded They try four times but cant do much more than enter Harrells name and set up a password And even if they could Harrell would still probably be out of luck Her income is less than  a year  too much to qualify for Medicaid in a state thats not expanding the program and too little for a subsidy to help her buy a plan on the exchange It will be a different story for people in similar situations in California The state was an eager early and bipartisan adopter of the Affordable Care Act said Anthony Wright executive director of   a consumer advocacy group We were the first state in the nation to set up an exchange and that was under a Republican governor Wright said Our bill to set up the preexisting insurance program was cosponsored by a Republican in our Legislature While  million uninsured Californians are expected to qualify for a subsidy to buy private insurance another  million will be newly eligible for Medicaid All told there are  million uninsured Californians who will have to decide what kind of coverage they want to buy to comply with the laws mandate that they have health insurance
