Everyone knows that the first rule of driving is never take your eyes off the road Teen drivers start off being careful but they tend to start multitasking after just a few months behind the wheel according to research published Tuesday in the   And while older drivers can handle eating or talking to passengers which trip up the newbies dialing a cell phone increased the risk of accidents among young and experienced drivers alike This isnt great news since its   that distracted driving is a leading cause of accidents among all drivers It makes sense that young drivers will start testing their limits after a few months behind the wheel according to   a behavioral scientist with the National Institutes of Health and a coauthor of the study You increase the difficulty of a task until you make an error SimonsMorton tells Shots It seems like a very natural thing but still its very dangerous because good driving ability and safety judgment develops over a very long period of time Within six months of getting their licenses young drivers in this study started texting eating and adjusting the radio while driving as much as their more experienced counterpart But it takes thousands of hours of practice to get good at driving according to SimonsMorton That disconnect may help explain the high accident rates among teenage drivers The researchers compared data from two small studies  one tracked  newly licensed young drivers and the other looked at  drivers with more experience All the participants had sensors and cameras installed in their cars The researchers used the sensors to track when drivers got into accidents or close calls The videos were then used to see what the drivers were doing just before the accidents occurred Because the researchers wanted to focus on the effects of distracted driving they ignored crashes caused by drunk driving and ones that were clearly caused by other drivers Since the number of people in this study was small SimonsMorton says the results will have to be verified by other research A couple of bigger studies already in the works   thats tracking over  drivers might make things clearer But SimonsMorton says this is the first totally objective look at teen driver distraction The data also showed that for both teenage drivers and adults talking on a cell phone didnt cause accidents But dialing the phone increased the risk of crashing in both groups While youre talking on a phone you can still be looking at the forward roadway SimonsMorton says Looking away from the road to text or dial is much riskier he says With that in mind SimonsMorton says it makes sense to restrict cell phone use in cars A lot of teenagers are used to talking on the phone and texting before they learn to drive he says And when they start driving they bring these things right into the vehicle
