Youve heard the dieting advice to eat breakfast like a king lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper Well theres mounting evidence that theres some truth to it A new   published in the   builds on previous studies that suggest its best not to eat too many calories late in the day The Spanish study finds that dieters who ate their main meal before  pm lost significantly more weight than those who ate later in the day This held true even though the early eaters  were eating roughly the same number of calories during the fivemonth weightloss study as their nightowl counterparts    The study included  overweight and obese volunteers who lived in the Mediterranean seaside town of Murcia Spain Their average age was  Half were men half women Their midday meal constituted about  percent of their diet of roughly  calories a day on average Right  thats not a lot of calories The average nondieting American eats about   a day according to the US Department of Agriculture On average the early eaters in the Spanish study lost  pounds compared with the late eaters who lost  pounds Both the early eaters and late eaters had similar levels of physical activity and got similar amounts of sleep so researchers ruled out these factors as possible explanations for the differences in weight loss The study suggests that its not just what we eat but when we eat is important says study author   who directs the Medical Chronobiology Program at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston So whats at play here Well Scheer says recent animal studies have shown that the timing of eating can have a powerful influence on weight regulation and metabolism This new study he says is among the first to suggest its also key in people Only in recent years are we trying to study this and tease apart what the underlying mechanisms might be says Scheer In the study the people who ate late and didnt lose as much weight also tended to skip breakfast or eat just a little in the morning Scheer says that because eating seems to send a signal to our body clocks its possible that when people delay eating a big meal until late in the day things get out of whack The master clock in the brain gets out of sync with the mini clocks in the cells of the body that regulate metabolism When the timing of meals do not match with the sleepwake cycle well theres a disconnect between the different clocks that we have in basically all the cells of our body explains Scheer And with this disconnect the complex systems that regulate weight dont work as well he says Not everyone is convinced by the findings of this study   of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center says shes skeptical that the timing of meals can influence weight loss so significantly The study shows an association between the timing of meals and weight loss says Fernstrom but its not proving cause and effect Weight loss is complicated But Fernstrom says as we learn more about the many factors that may influence weight regulation its important for dieters not to lose sight of the big picture The greater importance is   you are eating Fernstrom says If you want to lose weight you need to eat fewer calories and exercise more That of course is something you likely already know
