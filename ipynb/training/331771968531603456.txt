
 At an assembly during my first week of medical school one of the institutions venerable deans took to the podium to announce that our class marked a turning point in the schools history nearly half of us were female  My classmates and I were unimpressed  For while our genders might have been mixed it hadnt taken us long to realize that on paper we were remarkably alike We had similar college majors grade point averages and scores on the standardized Medical College Admissions Test or MCAT Most of us came from relatively comfortable backgrounds spent summers working in a lab and had parents heavily vested in our education Two of us while not related even shared a relatively uncommon last name The few classmates from    AfricanAmericans Latinos and Native Americans  stood out This   medical school a classmate remarked Its not about who you are Its about how well you do in science and the MCATs That perspective has long been assumed to be a guiding principle of medical education But now as the   and   once again to define diversity and admissions policies   in   reveal that admissions policies have been quietly but radically changing in a handful of medical schools And those changes have yielded surprisingly successful results Each year on average   some  applications for each entering class of  to  or more students The first cut is most fierce of those thousands of applicants only a few hundred are invited for an interview From there roughly one in every four of those interviewed will be accepted Medical schools have traditionally relied on undergraduate science grades and the MCAT to decide which applicants to interview They based this approach in part on   between science GPA and MCAT scores and subsequent medical school performance But   have also revealed that MCAT scores are significantly influenced by a students race   and socioeconomic background   too that a large and lucrative industry has developed around MCAT preparation and students who could not afford the   or time required by such prep courses were finding themselves at a disadvantage In response a few medical schools and the   began to experiment with a different approach to admissions Instead of using grades and MCAT scores as cutoff points to whittle down the initial applicant pool they began assessing those numbers in the context of life experiences socioeconomic status cultural and ethnic background gender identity and the medical schools particular mission be it to produce research scientists compassionate clinicians or both  But unlike traditional medical schools that might have been reserving such holistic review for the   these schools went one step further they engaged in holistic review from the getgo applying it to every submitted application The results have been both uplifting and unexpected Since   in all phases of its admissions process five years ago faculty members have noted that students appear to be more collegial supportive of one another open to new ideas and perspectives and engaged in community activities They also have turned out to be as prepared as previous students with     And despite a lack of quotas or caps students from groups underrepresented in medicine have     This is not your fathers Oldsmobile of a medical school class anymore said Dr Robert A Witzburg coauthor of one of the articles and the associate dean and director of admissions at Boston University School of Medicine  The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has been engaged in an   Starting in  they began offering an early assurance program to a select few college sophomores These students did not have to take the MCATs and were guaranteed a slot in the medical school if they continued to study humanities or social sciences and maintained a  grade point average instead of pursuing the traditional premedical science program Two years ago the school   detailing the results of the program  students performed as well as their more traditional counterparts and were more likely to pursue fields like primary care and psychiatry Based on the successful outcomes the school now   Beginning this fall they will invite college sophomores from all majors to apply and will reserve half the slots of each medical school class for these nontraditional premedical students  Its time for us to take some risks said Dr David Muller author of one of The New England Journal of Medicine articles and dean for medical education at Mount Sinai We need to push the limits on what weve been complacent about for too long Still there are significant challenges for medical schools in adopting such holistic approaches Medical schools are under growing pressure to sustain or even increase their   and administrators may worry that paying less attention to MCAT scores which are often used to calculate school rankings could hurt their institution   A holistic approach to admissions also requires a lot more work than simply looking at test scores Boston Universitys medical school admissions office for example processes roughly  pages of documentation each year and many institutions may find the additional work required too laborintensive  You could sort every female applicant in Wyoming by MCAT score with three keystrokes said Dr Henry M Sondheimer coauthor with Dr Witzburg of one of the articles and the senior director of Medical Education Projects at the Association of American Medical Colleges It takes more time to get to know the students Nevertheless  of the nations  medical schools have already expressed interest in adopting some form of the holistic review approach enrolling in a   offered by the AAMC And over the next few years the AAMC will track how students accepted under this approach fare and assess how they do in medical school during training and most importantly in practice  No one is saying that skills and inclination in science is not important Dr Witzburg said But in this rapidly evolving and diverse society they are insufficient
