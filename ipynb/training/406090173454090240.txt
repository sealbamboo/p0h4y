But even after the accident that took her husband her leg and part of her colon as the couple returned from their honeymoon Bradford hasnt lost her faith From her bed at Atlantas Grady Memorial Hospital where she spent most of November Bradford smiles as she replays the details of her wedding day  It was Saturday October  She had turned  the week before It rained that morning she and her bridesmaids put trash bags over their heads to protect their hair They ran out to Walmart to pick up lipstick bought coffee at Starbucks and got ready in the dance hall at High Praise Worship Center in Panama City Florida  Bradfords sisterinlaw did her makeup and her maid of honor did her hair Before the ceremony the bridal party sat and prayed for God to bless them  Her grandfather was the first to arrive getting ready in his truck He was the one who walked Bradford down the aisle and gave her away With Pastor Joshua Gay officiating the couple took communion read letters they had written to each other and had their first kiss as husband and wife Love Train played as the new Mr and Mrs Storey walked out of the church  There was tons of food at the reception held at the home of close church friends Bradford only got one plate of her moms macaroni and cheese before it was all gone but there was plenty of tater tot casserole chicken punch and root beer  Storeys favorite  and a big bonfire for making smores The newlyweds danced to God Gave Me You by Dave Barnes For their honeymoon they drove to Gatlinburg Tennessee That week they posed for goofy pictures at the Hollywood Wax Museum and Ripleys Believe It Or Not won tickets to the Dolly Partons Dixie Stampede dinner show and drank hot cocoa at a cozy coffee shop At the Hollywood Stars Car Museum Bradford paid extra to have Storeys picture taken in the General Lee the car from The Dukes of Hazzard That just made him happy she says her hands clasped over her stomach  On the last night they ate at Burger King because they had a gift card and watched the Tennessee vs Alabama football game  Her voice slows down as she talks about the day after that That Sunday October  they woke up in the dark to get a head start on the drive home so they would be back in Panama City for the evening church service They stopped a couple of times for gas  He encouraged her to sleep Ill be OK he told her  She remembers telling him she loved him Bundled in a blanket because the heater wasnt working in their  Chevrolet Blazer she lay back in the passenger seat and closed her eyes as they continued southbound on Interstate   She woke up to the SUV rolling and rolling It landed upside down in the median on I near LaGrange Georgia between Atlanta and Columbus The car was totaled but you could still see the words Tasha  Buck on one of the backseat windows No one knows what happened for sure Storey was pronounced dead at the scene but Bradford didnt learn that until after she was airlifted to a hospital  She remembers looking down and seeing that her right leg was mangled and her shoe was gone She was yanking on her seat belt to get out She remembers screaming for her mom her grandmother anyone she knew  After that she remembers all the strangers who came to her aid Alex Hart a lawyer who served in the Marines was first one on the scene He and a friend were on their way back to Albany Georgia from a trout fishing trip when they saw the SUV flip  When he got to Bradford he said she was lying on the ceiling and he could tell her leg was injured badly He cut her seat belt and pulled her out  Keith Powell of Tallahassee Florida pulled up behind Hart The state ethics investigator had been driving home with his wife from Atlantas HartsfieldJackson Airport after a cruise to celebrate their th wedding anniversary   They propped Bradfords head against a stuffed animal and covered her with blankets to keep her from going into shock  She heard a woman with a sweet voice talking to her Is this your purse pretty girl Do you know where your phone is baby  That was Gail Gentry of Phenix City Alabama who had been driving northbound on I on her way to Atlanta for ministry school She sang and prayed aloud for God to protect the young woman  A second woman Carol Aaron found Storeys cell phone and started calling everyone she could until she reached a member of their church All I could think of was this is somebodys child  I couldnt leave her said Aaron who lives in Pine Mountain Georgia I would want somebody to do the same thing for my daughter  After sheriffs deputies and a fire department arrived at the scene Aaron Gentry and Powells wife collected the couples belongings that were strewn on the highway  Bradford was airlifted to Columbus Medical Center in Columbus Georgia As she lay in the emergency room the nurse from the Air Evac Lifeteam who had held her hand in the helicopter told her Storey didnt make it  I said Lord Peace be still with him and hes in a better place And I cried a little Bradford said I knew God had his side because he was such a good Christian man I had no doubt where he was going to go After that all she can remember was people shoving things in her mouth and putting IVs in her They flew her to the Atlanta hospital where her mother and grandmother saw her for the first time  I just wanted to get there I just wanted to get to her said her mother Rhonda Cooper of Panama City She had been driving to church at High Praise when she got the call that Bradford had been in an accident but had no idea how bad it was When Bradford arrived at Grady it wasnt clear she was going to make it said trauma surgeon Bryan Morse Her vital signs were unstable  her blood pressure low her heart rate high A bedside ultrasound showed she was bleeding internally from her belly  She was in the operating room within minutes where the Morses team worked to stop the bleeding Because the blood supply to her colon had been cut the right side of her colon was dead and was removed  At the same time a second surgical team was working on her mangled right leg It was fractured in multiple places and she had torn the main arteries veins and nerves  Vascular surgeon Ravi Rajani got the blood flowing back to the limb but her leg was damaged so badly it couldnt be saved   Bradford was moved to the intensive care unit and received a massive blood transfusion Two days later they removed her leg  I hate that she lost her leg but I still have her  I can live without a leg and I know she can too because shes a trouper Cooper said  On Wednesday Bradford was discharged from Grady to a hospital closer to her Florida home After a few months of physical therapy Morse said shell learn to use a prosthesis and move on with her life In time he expects her to make a pretty full recovery Shes been a miracle to everybody Morse said Shes really an inspiration to all of us and a reminder of why we do what we do To see her recover from this and still maintain such a positive attitude has been refreshing  There have been some bumps in the road  Bradford has struggled with bouts of nausea and vomiting during her stomachs healing process Her mom posts daily updates on Facebook She keeps a hopeful tone but is real about the details We had to clean where her stitches were twice last night Cooper wrote one morning She has such strength while theyre taking out her stitches and pulling out gauze in her open wound and poking her with needles to get blood and shots every day this goes on Ill see tears running down her little face and I hate to see her go through this but so thankful she is with us still Bradfords been working hard By the time she left Grady she was able to get up out of the hospital bed and go to the bathroom with her walker stand and wash her hands and get back in bed On good days she wheeled herself to the post office to check for packages from loved ones all the while posting optimistic and lighthearted updates on Facebook about her progress  She calls her stump Jack because she says it looks like Jack Skellington from The Nightmare Before Christmas  Emotionally she grieves the loss of the life she was just starting Now instead watching TV and playing with her cat in the little townhouse she planned to share with her new husband shes wondering what the future holds   First shell be transferred to a rehabilitation hospital to learn how to do things like put on clothes bathe and balance After that shell move in with her mother It will be a while before her leg has healed enough for a prosthesis Until then shell get around with a walker and wheelchair  On a table in her hospital room sits a book of painted handprint flowers from the toddlers in her churchs daycare program where she and Storey taught twice a month I think about having children  it hurts All these other people are having kids Bradford said But God has a plan I think of all the beautiful children in church I got to teach That fills a void It makes me want to strive even harder to work my legs to where I can sit on the floor and play with them  A church acquaintance   to try to ease the familys financial burden  Bradford has health insurance but that wont cover all the bills for medical rehab and therapy Storey had been a commercial fisherman for years and had recently switched jobs to be home more with Bradford He had no benefits or life insurance Bradfords mother has also had to take an extended leave of absence from her job She and Tashas grandmother have been staying in a hotel near the hospital  So far about  has been raised Among those sharing her story are the people who helped her at the scene of the accident Tasha and her mother regularly exchange Facebook posts and text messages with several of the witnesses Gentry who stayed while the paramedics were on their way searched for days until she was able to track Bradford down at Grady She has since become a friend I wanted to make sure she survived Gentry said I began to wonder if maybe her injuries were worse than I thought Once I met her I loved this girl I want to see her prosper  I want to see her overcome all of this I dont think it was an accident that we ended up there at that time to be able to help at that time I just think God does that sometimes Powell said Its something you never expected but it happens and then you feel kind of a kindred spirit to them You realize how fleeting life can be sometimes so when you have connections like that you want to follow up with it Bradford calls them her angels  When they pulled me out of that car I didnt know where they came from All I knew was peace and comfort she said It feels like God put them there While she was in the intensive care unit she had a dream where her husband appeared at the spot where the accident happened  He said I cant stay but I just want to tell you goodbye and I love you she said God has a greater plan than Ill ever know I know with time and healing hell send someone my way who will love me for me
