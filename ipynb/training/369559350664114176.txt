There are a lot of people that will look and laugh and stare in shock and awe and amazement Warren says as he walks down the street in a preview for TLCs upcoming show The Man with the Pound Scrotum The onehour special airs Monday at  pm ETPT  Its tough to deal with it you know because essentially this is a sort of living and breathing freak show It began in  Warren told TLC when he awoke to a shooting pain in his testicles The tissue around his penis soon began to swell eventually growing at an estimated rate of  pounds per month  One doctor told Warren that it might be necessary to castrate him to fix the problem others told him that he would probably die on the operating table And the cost of the surgery alone would be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars After Warren appeared on the Howard Stern radio show appealing for help a fellow scrotal lymphedema sufferer referred him to Dr Joel Gelman who offered to do the surgery for free  Gelman director of the   at the University of California Irvine specializes in urethral and penile reconstruction surgery  Although the headline of TLCs special is catchy scrotal lymphedema is a very real condition Gelman said He hopes media attention surrounding the show will encourage other men with the problem to seek treatment  Here are some more answers about this condition  Scrotal lymphedema also known as scrotal elephantiasis is a massive enlargement of the scrotum due to thickening of tissue and accumulation of fluid Gelman said  Outside North America scrotal lymphedema is often caused by a parasitic infection called lymphatic filariasis thats spread by mosquitoes Threadlike worms lodge themselves in the lymphatic system   where they can interfere with a persons immune system  But lymphatic filariasis is virtually unheardof in the United States Gelman said Most cases of scrotal lymphedema here are caused by blockages in the lymphatic vessels that prevent fluid from draining from the area Doctors are unsure what causes this blockage in Warrens case Gelman believes it was an injury or trauma to his scrotum  The most obvious symptom is a large scrotum this can range in size from a grapefruit to a basketball But the mass doesnt max out at any particular size Gelman said It will keep growing until the patient seeks treatment  Warrens scrotum was the largest Gelman had ever seen Warren didnt report that he was always in pain but I think the biggest problem is that the sheer size of the mass made it very uncomfortable for him the surgeon said Its like lifting weights to take a step Warrens penis was buried about a foot under his skin Gelman said but fully functional A tunnel of sorts had formed from the tip to the top layer of his swollen skin allowing Warren to urinate without assistance  Its rare especially in the United States Definite numbers are difficult to come by and the condition may be underdiagnosed due to physicians lack of awareness Gelman said Many patients with the condition are also obese and are simply instructed by their doctors to lose weight  Surgery is usually the best option to remove the swollen tissue Gelman said A surgeon who specializes in this type of procedure will cut a Tshape in the mass identify the penis and testicles to make sure they arent harmed and then excise the excess tissue The surgeon will then use undamaged tissue to cover the penis and scrotum  Warren is walking again and enjoying life Gelman said Hell need a followup surgery to remove some additional skin that was damaged by his condition Gelman will perform a skin graft to cover the penis and scrotum  If you are experiencing the symptoms noted above see a doctor as soon as possible Ask for a referral to a specialist if your primary care physician is unfamiliar with these types of conditions  An unusually large scrotum can have a variety of causes Gelman said One of the most common is a hernia in which a small part of the intestines enters the scrotum Another cause is fluid buildup on one side of a mans body between the testicle and the skin this is called hydrocele All are treatable and usually not lifethreatening unless left too long
