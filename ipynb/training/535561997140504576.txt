Obesity used to be an issue primarily in welloff countries It was one of those things flippantly dismissed as a firstworld problem Now people are packing on the pounds all over the planet In some fastgrowing cities in China for example half the people are now overweight A new   from the global management consulting firm McKinsey  Company finds that more than  billion people nearly  percent of the worlds population are overweight a bit chubby or obese just plain fat Over the last decade no country in the world managed to trim its obesity prevalence Some of the worst rates of obesity are now in the developing world It seems that many of the emerging markets that are on this phenomenally fast growth trajectory are on an even faster obesity trajectory says Richard Dobbs the head of the McKinsey Global Institute and one of the authors of the obesity report Indeed the number of people categorized as excessively heavy is growing faster than the buffet line at a Vegas casino The report predicts that if current trends continue  percent of adults in the world will be overweight by the year  The report also finds that burgeoning waistlines have a ripple effect This is a massive global economic issue says Dobbs Its largely been left to the health people but actually its having a huge economic effect and there really hasnt been a systematic view of how to address it The McKinsey report estimates the economic impact of obesity around the world at  trillion a year Part of that figure is the cost of caring for diseases that are linked to obesity like Type  diabetes But theres an even bigger cost in the loss of productivity Dobbs says People suffering from obesity often work less They have to take more time off sick They retire early or even die early The United States has the highest obesity rate in the world   And while Americans are known for enjoying fast food and being big the other countries in the top five fattest nations might surprise you Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Mexico and South Africa Dobbs says its going to take far more than banning supersize sodas to address what the new report calls a critical global issue The challenge we have with addressing obesity is we are fighting thousands of years of evolution he says Our bodies have a natural inclination to want to horde energy when we have it available We want to horde food and to horde fat Programs to get individuals to eat right and exercise more must be a part of any weight loss effort But the report makes it clear that focusing just on the eating habits of the morbidly obese  in other words blaming the victim  wont solve anything This growing global problem is result of social and economic changes that have swept the world over the last century Food for instance is relatively far cheaper than it used to be In the United States the share of average household income spent on food fell from  percent in  to  percent in  and to  percent in  the report notes McKinsey and Co suggests  interventions to combat the obesity crisis  from simple things like requiring food labels to include calorie counts to plans to overhaul urban transportation systems to discourage cars Changing whats in your refrigerator will also help Personally I know if theres cheese in the fridge I eat it Dobbs says If I open the fridge and theres not cheese there I eat the celery
