Premature birth is now the biggest global killer of young children   A study in the   shows it accounts for more than one million deaths per year  mostly in the developing world   The complications of childbirth accounted for another  deaths a year   Being born too soon  when the lungs brain and other organs have not developed  can make babies highly vulnerable These figures are significant as for the first time neonatal conditions have overtaken infectious diseases such as pneumonia  as the biggest childhood killer Prof Joy Lawn of the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine one of the report authors said The success weve seen in the ongoing fight against infectious diseases demonstrates that we can also be successful if we invest in prevention and care for preterm birth The report authors argue that two thirds of these deaths could be prevented without intensive care Kangaroo care where babies are carried skintoskin on the mothers chest is one simple intervention which is being promoted worldwide  The technique keeps the baby warm and makes breastfeeding easier     Most of the deaths occur in the worlds poorest countries with some of the highest rates in West Africa  where the risk will be even greater now due to Ebola The worldwide mortality rate among the underfives has declined from  to  deaths per  live births since    Most of the reduction has been due to progress made in protecting children from diseases like pneumonia diarrhoea measles and malaria The mortality rate among premature babies has also fallen but at a far slower rate   As a result deaths in the first  days after birth now make up an increasing proportion of childhood mortality Some  newborns die daily said Andres de Francisco of the Partnership for Maternal Newborn and Child Health  We have an epidemic of preterm and newborn deaths that represents one of the greatest health challenges of the st century  Mortality linked to preterm birth is also an issue for developed nations despite childbirth itself being safer than ever In the UK preterm birth complications account for  child deaths a year  more than double the number in France or Italy Obesity and later motherhood are among the risk factors for prematurity as is the rise in the rate of Caesarean deliveries   But many of the causes remain unknown Prof Lawn told the BBC  Even very premature babies are surviving in the UK due to improvements in medical care   But babies can spend an average of three months in intensive care  This is traumatic for families and many end up with longterm health complications  It is also hugely expensive for the NHS Landmarks including the Empire State Building Brandenburg Gate and Bosphorus Bridge are being lit purple to mark World Prematurity Day on Monday  In England the First Direct Arena in Leeds will be illuminated
