A lot of Americans are struggling to lose a whole lot of weight and they try all kinds of crazy things   a man from Billerica Mass  decided to shed pounds by getting into the often intense highadrenaline sport of cyclocross racing road bikes on obstacle courses Two years ago Gagnon tipped the scales at  pounds He was depressed and embarrassed to leave the house Being as big as I was I really felt like I didnt belong anywhere Gagnon says I was stuck in my house for almost  years just going to my work and back Back then Gagnons diabetes was getting more serious He was losing the circulation to his legs and his doctors were talking about gastric bypass surgery Then some sort of a switch flipped in his head and Gagnon decided he was going to race bikes something hed wanted to do since he was a kid Gagnon contacted Cosmo Catalano a cyclist from Hartford Conn on Facebook and asked if he wanted to go for a bike ride Hes like  by the way I ride kind of slow  Im  whatever pounds  Catalano says I said  OK I can deal with that  This is how hundreds of New England cyclocross racers met Gagnon Now just two years after making that decision Gagnon met up with his bike racer buddies in Lancaster Mass to do his very first race called the Midnight Ride of Cyclocross These days at age  Gagnon is  pounds slimmer He is still very big by any standard but a lot less so Seeing him surrounded by svelte Lycraclad athletes squeezed into some spandex of his own is a little bit jarring at first As you watch him however you start to get used to the big guy in bike shorts especially when you realize that Gagnon himself is way past being selfconscious You know Im riding in spandex in Boston with these guys Never thought I could do that and its liberating in a way Gagnon says It really forces you to be honest with yourself accept who you are because if you cant accept who you are you cant do anything Before the race Gagnon goes for a ride around the course with his lieutenant Catalano who gives him tips about how to ride it Gagnon rides along on a custombuilt titanium bike that is reinforced to hold his weight After checking out the course he lines up at the start in a crowd of  other racers and after a few nervous final moments the race is off The racers hurtle along dirt paths and through soccer fields on bikes designed for racing on pavement There are obstacles in the course like barriers that they have to jump over or steep hills they run up with the bikes on their shoulders The slender athletic racers are panting and working hard For Gagnon however its actually physically dangerous He has angina and his doctor told him not to let his heart rate get too high during the race or he could end up in the hospital  something that has happened before Everybody at the race knows about Gagnon and throughout the race the announcer gives little updates on his progress Two laps to go for Ernest Gagnon the announcer says Nicely done Ernest  hang in there After  minutes Gagnon finishes dead last Catalano and friend Steve Lachance quickly join him near the finish line I told you you could do it I told you you could do it Lachance says A steady stream of folks Gagnon barely knows some of the    who have sought him out after hearing about his story come by to congratulate him Gagnon says there isnt a weight goal hes aiming for he just wants to be healthy Hes already eyeing a couple more cyclocross races to do later this year
