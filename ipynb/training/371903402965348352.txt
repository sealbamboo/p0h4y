Katie Doderer is a very poised yearold with short blond hair and a wide smile Shes a straight A student who loves singing dancing and performing in musicals This could be considered something of a miracle I have a complex medical condition known as congenital central hypoventilation  blahsyndrome CCHS Katie explains stumbling on the full name of her malady Basically my brain doesnt tell me to breathe So I am reliant on a mechanical ventilator She also has a pacemaker to control her heart rate and she has lupus And though CCHS is very rare  Katie is one of only  children in the world diagnosed with it  she is part of a growing segment of the population that the health care industry calls medically complex children More than  million children in the US are born with multiple chronic illnesses that often require frequent trips to the hospital Problems include cystic fibrosis muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy among many other diseases As medicine has advanced more very sick children survive past infancy and even thrive The number of medically complex children is growing at a rate of about  percent a year according to the Childrens Hospital Association And that comes with a heavy price tag for state and federal budgets Katies care has been expensive but her family is in a better position to deal with the challenges than most Her mom is the CEO of Arkansas Childrens Hospital Katie hit a million dollars in her first year of life says Marcy Doderer Katies mother Katie used to require hour nursing now the nurse only comes at night but it still costs almost  a year by Marcys estimate Its a service that most private insurance doesnt cover It is however paid for by Katies Medicaid coverageeven though the family is well off The stereotypical image that comes to mind is a very poor family with a child on   says Marcy But it is important to know that in most states theres some sort of program that is there to supplement private health insurance for a truly medically complex child The sickest  million kids account for about  percent of Medicaids total spending on children Many of these children have a combination of private insurance and Medicaid and it can be challenging to coordinate care and coverage Marcy Doderer who until recently was the CEO of the childrens hospital in San Antonio Texas acknowledges that her job gives her family an advantage I know how to navigate the system she says I know how to find ways to get what my child needs that the average family would never know how to do Still Marcy has seen first hand all the ways that the medical system can fall short for patients like Katie She says Katies care is often scattershot In our current health system in San Antonio there are no links between the medical records of the different specialists Marcy says There is not a single person other than my husband really who is paying attention to how care is coordinated for a kid like Katie Katies dad Mark Doderer is her main caregiver He has traveled with her more than  times to Chicago to see the doctors who specialize in Katies rare disease But Katies Medicaid doesnt travel with them The hospital in Chicago doesnt accept the Medicaid Katie got from Texas And that care isnt coordinated Mark says the doctors in San Antonio and Chicago often want to do the same test twice like an EKG Theyll just repeat it because they want the EKG done according to their rules and that its in their records he says What a waste Mark remembers a mix up between doctors that ended with Katie being prescribed a medication that interfered with another she was already on The result could have been fatal Marcy Doderer says hospitals can do better At the Childrens Hospital San Antonio Doderer says shes tried use her experience as a mom to improve things by focusing on a childcentered team approach even hiring special care coordinators in charge of managing care for each of the sickest kids The Childrens Hospital Association has been lobbying Congress to help create a special network within Medicaid to coordinate care between hospitals too Our hope is to create legislation that would identify these kids in a separate bucket so to speak so you can build bridges between the state Medicaid programs to make care more seamless for kids who have to cross state lines Doderer says Improving the communication between doctors and hospitals to limit repeat tests and unnecessary procedures for medically complex children could save Medicaid  billion over  years according to a recent   by CHA But Matt Salo who runs the National Association of Medicaid Directors  worries that while making care more efficient is a worthy goal it could come at a price Its important to think about health care spending not as competing for infinite dollars where everyone gets everything they want says Salo Health care is unfortunately a limited pool of funds So carving out additional dollars for one group may well mean that another group gets lesslowincome frail seniors or individuals with physical disabilities In her new role running the childrens hospital in Little Rock Doderer says shell continue her push for better care For Katie it means a new school new friends and a new set of doctors She has challenging days Marcy says of Katie Its not easy walking around with a ventilator and you dont get to go swimming or have normal sleepovers with your friends But she has traveled internationally she snowskis she plays the harp Up next Learning to ride a bicycle ventilator and all
