Many of these doctors also had financial ties to the companies that manufacture the drugs they prescribed ProPublica reports and have accepted thousands of dollars from drug companies in the form of promotional or consulting fees  Although Medicares drug program has been considered an achievement in government health care this seeming fiscal success has hidden billions of dollars lost to unnecessarily expensive prescribing over the programs eightyear history the report said  Part of the wasted money results from wellintended aspects of Medicare A provision called   which has given individuals with low incomes access to cheap medications has at the same time enabled doctors to prescribe namebrand drugs without complaint from lowincome patients ProPublica said Regardless of the medications cost Part D allows patients to pay less than  per prescription if they have low incomes  The lack of incentives for cheaper drugs for lowincome patients is an important point raised by the report said   an MIT economics professor who was not involved in the study  Insurance companies can use financial incentives to sway participants who are not impoverished toward generic coverage Gruber said which has generally prompted a shift toward lowercost generic coverage But lowincome populations are covered by the subsidy which caps what they pay for prescriptions anyway so there arent financial incentives for the use of generics  Medicare needs to find a different way to monitor prescribing patterns and lower costs for this population Gruber said in an email  Part D cost taxpayers  billion last year and more than a third of that went toward this lowincome subsidy ProPublica reported More than  million people receive the subsidy The ProPublica piece pointed to       showing that Medicare could save  billion a year in seven drug categories if generics were prescribed to lowincome patients and other Medicare enrollees in the same proportion The savings might be even more to the tune of  billion in a decade    Medicare pays for one in four prescriptions in the United States ProPublica said but it does not limit the namebrand drugs that physicians can prescribe  Who are the doctors prescribing so many namebrand medications ProPublica found some patterns in ethnic neighborhoods and areas around large cities  For instance a stretch of Koreatown in Los Angeles has seven of the doctors with high rates of namebrand prescribing and a building in Brooklyn with six such doctors is in a Russian community  The average cost of a Part D prescription in these enclaves can be more than  percent higher than that of surrounding areas ProPublica said  The reports findings about money wasted on brandname drugs arent too surprising said  assistant professor of public health and medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York  I think that theres a lot of marketing and misconceptions about how good is the newest latest drug for which theres not a generic alternative said Bishop who was not involved with the ProPublica report  There are few instances where brandname drugs are superior to their generic alternative Bishop said She could not think of a specific example By and large if there is a generic it should be prescribed she said There are some efforts already in place toward addressing the problem For instance the way Bishops electronic health records are set up when she enters a medication into her system a generic gets automatically prescribed if one is available She also noted that sometimes pharmacies will give patients the generic version of a drug even if the brand name has been prescribed unless the physician has specified otherwise  There are also drugs that have no generic equivalent Bishop noted But for those that do have generic alternatives marketing efforts are generally stronger for the brandname versions  Many of us who practice medicine and know about the issues of rising health care costs know that we spend a lot on brandname medications when we dont necessarily need to she said This is an interesting study because it quantifies it with a very small group of doctors  Variations in prescriptions for brandname drugs have been on the radar of many insurance companies and health care researchers Bishop said They should look at the issues presented in the ProPublica report to help control rising health care costs she said  Why some doctors continue prescribing brandname versions of drugs that have generic equivalents is an important question she said  Thats a question that the medical community has to come to terms with she said Are we not being good stewards of the resources that are available by prescribing things that could have cheaper as effective alternatives
