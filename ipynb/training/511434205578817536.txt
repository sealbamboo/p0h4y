Shopping for cigarettes in Uruguay isnt a pleasant experience Photos of decaying teeth premature babies and gruesome hospital scenes wrap around every pack In fact the country requires manufacturers to cover at least  percent of the packaging with medical warnings and graphic images Cigarette giant   sees this requirement as a violation of a treaty law So its suing the country of Uruguay for  million The lawsuit is based on a  trade agreement between Uruguay and Switzerland where the company is located The cigarette manufacturer   Uruguay is violating its promise to respect intellectual property rights Studies have   that such gruesome packaging reduces smoking particularly in pregnant women To better understand this case before it goes in front of the World Bank this month NPRs David Greene spoke with   a reporter based in Uruguays capital city Montevideo Here are highlights from their conversation which has been edited for clarity and length In  the government says that cigarette makers have to cover cigarette packs  percent with health warnings and what are called pictograms which are the graphic photos that show hospital scenes what happens to a fetus when a pregnant woman smokes  really scary pictures of the negative health effects of smoking on the human body Then in  the Uruguay government raised the required coverage to  percent This is more than any other country had mandated before Uruguay also said you couldnt have any variation of a single brand sold in any store You could have Marlboro but you couldnt have Marlboro Light or Marlboro Gold They said terms like light and gold deceive consumers into thinking that those types are healthier than the average cigarette And in the end Philip Morris had to take seven of its  products off the shelves And thats when they decided to file the lawsuit Philip Morris is saying that the percentage of warning labels that are required on cigarette packs in Uruguay goes beyond what is reasonable to protect people from the harmful effects of smoking The company says that the warning labels leave no space for legally protected trademarks Uruguays University of the Republic in collaboration with a professor from Massachusetts Institute of Technology did a   that showed that between  and  in Uruguay smoking has gone down  percent annually Theyve also done studies that have shown that less pregnant women are smoking and that the birthrate has gone up because of it Actually former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg donates millions of dollars to developing countries that are trying to stop smoking His   has paid for these studies as well as a big chunk of Uruguays legal fees The amount of money that Philip Morris has at its disposal puts Uruguays gross domestic product to shame The outcome of this case will set the tone for other countries I spoke with Uruguays former secretary of public health who said that Philip Morris intention was to make an example out of Uruguay There are a lot of other countries that are also in legal disputes with Philip Morris right now  Australia for example It was the first to adopt plain packaging in  And Philip Morris has been   them ever since Philip Morris has also threatened in the last few weeks to sue the UK
