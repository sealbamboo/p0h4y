When Devon Walker returned to the Tulane University campus last week he was greeted with kisses in the hallways Students and faculty applauded him One year ago this weekend in the second game of the football season Walker a team captain for Tulane went in for a tackle and broke his neck He was paralyzed from the shoulders down For months he recovered far from home in two different hospitals But now hes back in Louisiana and reenrolling at Tulane in New Orleans When asked how hes doing Walker keeps it simple Im fine Im fine he says He usually doesnt go into the details the challenge of using a ventilator to talk How he cant sleep at night because he just cant get comfortable Or about the searing nerve pain he suffers all too often his whole body burning like its on fire There was no need to rush back to school But Walker did I guess Im pretty stubborn when it comes to a lot of things You can ask a lot of my friends and stuff they can attest to that Walker says When I get something on my mind I just do it And if it doesnt happen when I think its gonna happen Im going to keep fighting to make it happen sooner or later Of course thats why Walker made the football team in the first place Curtis Johnson knew Walker long before he took the job as Tulanes head coach a season ago The two lived in the same suburb when Johnson was an assistant coach for the New Orleans Saints When he saw Walker play in high school he was sure the kid was too small for college football When he came in I looked at him  he was just a skinny little kid Johnson says And I said That skinny little kid he cant play  But Walker proved Johnson  and everyone else  wrong He made the football team as a walkon safety with no athletic scholarship four years ago He played when he had no chance of playing And when Johnson got hired before last season Walkers senior year the coach realized something about the undersized player in the No  jersey This guy he is a starter Johnson recalls thinking Then came the game against Tulsa last September It was the last play of the half With the ball at Tulanes yard line Johnson called a blitz The Tulsa running back reeled in a short pass and Walker all  pounds of him came straight for him But then the Tulsa running back stumbled falling And Im going in to ensure he goes to the ground Walker recounts So Im going head first And I completely dont see my defensive lineman behind him running straight towards me  saw him  until the players collided and Walkers body went limp Instantly his teammates called for help as Walker struggled to breathe The teams doctors concerned he had no pulse performed chest compressions on the field They finally got him stabilized but there was no reversing the damage caused by Walkers fractured vertebrae A year later the football team still prays for Walkers recovery while Walker himself is working for it Hes bound to a wheelchair Just leaving the house in the morning takes  minutes and the help of a nurse Still three days a week hes at a rehabilitation center at Touro Infirmary in New Orleans pushing his therapists to push him Ill put it this way Sometimes I need a break before Devon needs a break says Holly Pellerito Walkers occupational therapist She worries that Walker might be trying to do too much too soon But this young man has goals He wants to graduate with a degree in cell and molecular biology in the spring And physically theres at least some reason for hope In Walkers arm muscles Pellerito says theres twitching So theres something there Theres some connection being made she says So were not gonna stop until we can try to make something functional The football team isnt giving up on Walker either Just before the season opener last week against Jackson State University coach Johnson addressed his team Then he introduced the player in the fresh new No  jersey given to Walker just that night With that Walker began to speak Theres not much I can say that hasnt been said already and theres not much more that I can do that I havent done already he told the players The fact of the matter is my days are up on playing football Yall days are still in front of you all Walker talked about where he had come from and where they might still go He asked them to play that night as if they might never play again  to play hard always And then they took the field Jackson State never had a chance Tulane jumped out to a  lead and went on to win  Its a different feeling but its a good feeling Walker said from the sidelines Its good to be back Close to my friends close to my teammates As close as I can get to the game right now The next morning away from the spotlight he would awake again with nerve trouble For two days his body would burn itching with pain Rehab and other plans would be canceled But that night at the game Devon Walker felt like a player again  and he looked like one too He went home still wearing his jersey
