Children in the UK are eating far too much salt with much of it coming from breads and cereals research suggests  Children should eat less than a teaspoon of salt a day but  of the  children in the study published in   ate more than this Breads and cereals accounted for more than onethird of the salt in childrens diets A fifth came from meat and onetenth from dairy products  This was despite a UKwide drive to cut salt levels in food The Department of Health said its voluntary salt reduction code with manufacturers was working but agreed that more progress is still needed Manufacturers say they are reducing salt in many products including bread   The study authors say efforts must be redoubled because salt increases the risk of high blood pressure from a very young age and high blood pressure can lead to heart disease and stroke For the research they asked the parents of the  children to keep a detailed food diary and take photos of all foods and beverages their child consumed as well as any leftovers At the same time the investigators analysed urine samples from the children to get an objective measure of salt intake  On average five and sixyearold children in the study consumed g of salt a day  more than the recommended g maximum  Eight and nineyear olds consumed g a day  within their g limit  Thirteen to yearolds consumed g a day  more than the g limit  Boys tended to have higher salt intake than girls particularly in the older and younger groups  about g higher per day in  to yearolds and g per day higher in  to yearolds Much of the salt consumed was from processed foods rather than added at the table  Lead researcher Prof Graham MacGregor who is chairman of both the charity Blood Pressure UK and the lobby group Consensus Action on Salt  Health CASH said It is very difficult for parents to reduce childrens salt intake unless they avoid packaged and restaurant foods and prepare each meal from scratch using fresh natural ingredients He said manufacturers needed to do more to cut out salt  Each g reduction in salt consumption would save thousands of lives from heart disease and strokes he said A Department of Health spokeswoman said On average we are eating approximately g of salt more each day than the recommended amount and it is vital that we address this This is why we are working with industry through the Responsibility Deal to reduce the amount of salt in foods We have just finalised new salt targets for  categories of food and call on industry to sign up Salt levels in many of our foods have reduced significantly some by  or more and since  more than  million kg of salt have been removed from the foods covered by the salt reduction targets However average salt consumption remains high at around g per day  so there is still a long way to go to meet the g per day population intake goal  Manufacturers insist they are reducing salt in many products including bread Terry Jones of the Food and Drink Federation said Although salt intakes in the UK have reduced significantly in recent years we recognise that more work must be done to help and encourage people to stay within recommended limits This is why food manufacturers have a long history of reducing salt in products and providing clear onpack labelling to help people know what a product contains  Luciana Berger MP Labours shadow public health minister said the government had lost its way on public health  She said We are consulting parents and experts about whats in childrens food and whether they would find it helpful to have maximum levels of sugar fat and salt
