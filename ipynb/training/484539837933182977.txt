the sudden turn in his health I felt strongly from Day  that when a senior executive is diagnosed with that kind of illness especially one that is obviously more fatal than not that the company and I had an absolute obligation to make disclosures about the disease and what the treatment would be and to lay it all out to the GM board of directors Mr Pearce now  and in good health recalled Like Mr Pearce corporate leaders from   to   and now   have wrestled with how  or whether  to go public about health problems How much to disclose and when involves delicate corporate and personal decisions for which there are few hard rules Executives have no real legal obligation to tell the world they are sick Some like Mr Jobs who died in  of pancreatic cancer tend toward secrecy Others like Mr Dimon

prognosis was good Serious illness strikes boardrooms more often than you might think Executives after all get sick like everyone else Over the years cancer heart attacks and strokes have hit senior executives at companies ranging from   to   to the   Handling the news is particularly difficult when it involves a leader who has become the face of the company That was the case with Mr Jobs and to a lesser degree is also the case with Mr Dimon perhaps the nations preeminent banker Tuesdays news rekindled old concerns about whether the bank has moved quickly enough to groom potential successors given Mr Dimons long run as both chairman and chief executive JPMorgan has said its bench is deep Still employees inside JPMorgans headquarters on Park Avenue were absorbing the news on Wednesday The banks share price fell  percent even as the broad stock market clung near record highs But corporate governance experts generally praised the banks timely disclosure given JPMorgans importance to Wall Street and the nations economy as well as Mr Dimons biggerthanlife role inside the bank JPMorgan hit the right note in its disclosure said Gary Hewitt the head of research at accounting and governance research firm GMI Ratings Its a difficult balance between the legitimate right to privacy on the part of the executive and the legitimate right to know when critical things might happen to an executive for shareholders No specific securities regulations compel companies to disclose healthrelated information about their executives Experts say such rules would probably violate an individuals right to privacy under existing health care laws A  study of disclosures of chief executive illnesses found that many executives waited to go public until they believed their illness was manageable Other companies made the disclosure only upon the executives death I think they either dont want to admit they are ill because it will cause concern for the company or I think they dont disclose it because they dont have a succession plan in place said Lex Perryman the author of the study and an assistant professor of management at the Milgard School of Business at the   Tacoma For corporations big and small a crucial question is whether top executives alert their boards when they fall ill In April  Frank C Lanza the chief executive of the military contractor L Communications announced he had undergone esophageal surgery to remove scar tissue caused by acid reflux He died two months later and an autopsy determined the cause of death was esophageal cancer The revelation prompted questions about whether the board was aware of the severity of his illness But experts say it is important that wellknown executives like Mr Dimon who have become closely linked to companies they oversee disclose important information to investors There have been several prominent examples over the years of business greats providing rapid disclosure of illnesses In the spring of  Mr Buffett disclosed that he had prostate cancer In  Andy Grove who built   into the worlds most powerful chip company went public through a startling firstperson essay in Fortune magazine detailing his discovery and treatment of prostate cancer But the company often given poor grades on such questions is   which was widely criticized for providing limited information about the health of Mr Jobs After months of speculation about Mr Jobss appearance in early  Apple went public saying the executive was suffering from a hormone imbalance About a week later Mr Jobs took a medical leave of absence stating that his health problems were more complex than first thought He died in October  at age  For Mr Dimon who steered JPMorgan through the financial crisis of  and into record profits the decision to disclose his illness was a nobrainer according to two people close to the executive Mr Dimon who is  and regularly runs and plays tennis noticed something was offkilter with his health several weeks ago these people said Before alerting employees or shareholders Mr Dimon went through a series of tests last week including a biopsy and various scans Doctors confirmed that the cancer had not spread beyond the original site and the adjacent lymph nodes on the right side of his neck an assurance that Mr Dimon relayed to employees and shareholders in a memo Tuesday night Mr Dimon had also alerted Lee Raymond the lead independent director on the banks board along with several other board members after receiving a complete diagnosis on Monday Mr Dimon in his memo said his treatment was expected to last about eight weeks and restrict his travel Nonetheless he plans to remain immersed in his role at the bank While every person is different Mr Pearce the former GM executive said maintaining a full workload while being treated for a serious illness was not easy Mr Pearce had been told that the fiveyear survival rate for his form of leukemia was  percent He subsequently underwent a   transplant After a fourmonth recovery he returned to work I was incredibly nave to think I could go back and do what I was doing the way I was doing it before said Mr Pearce He stepped aside in  I told them they were paying me as if I was performing as I had before and I didnt feel like I was at that time and I didnt know whether I ever would again he said
