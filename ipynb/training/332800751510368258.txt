By their euphemistic names ye shall know them The Memory Care Unit The Reminiscence Neighborhood Homestead These special units for residents with dementia have spread throughout the American nursing home industry more than  percent of nursing homes now include one The laudable idea was to move patients with dementia out of the typically overstimulating and understaffed nursing home into a separate wing a calm and secure environment where welltrained staffers would offer tailored activities handle problematic behaviors and provide greater support But Ive always wondered whether these units actually live up to their promises and their higher price tags In a competitive nursing home market they may provide an edge in attracting paying customers But do they provide better care or mostly a reassuring name and a locked door The research provides some intriguing findings but sadly no clear thumbsup for families trying to figure out if this is the solution for someone who wanders gets frightened or obstreperous or needs more attention Early on in the mid s a research team followed nearly  nursing home residents in four states looking at declines in their mobility and ability to function But after a year they reported in The Journal of the American Medical Association   or decline more slowly than residents with dementia in traditional nursing homes Perhaps it was asking too much to expect specialized care to arrest the decline caused by a progressive neurological disease one of the studys authors Dr Philip Sloane a professor of family medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said in an email But he added In our extensive experience weve found that most dementia units have leaders and staff who are not very familiar with or up to date on the many options available in dementia management Fastforward a decade Andrea Gruneir a health scientist now at Womens College Research Institute in Toronto found   even when comparing residents with similar levels of cognitive impairment The special units she and her colleagues reported in  were significantly less likely to use bed rails   and feeding tubes which can cause complications but havent been shown to prolong life They were more likely to use toileting plans helping residents to get to the bathroom than to rely on briefs or pads Its a more laborintensive way to handle incontinence but its preferred for residents dignity and quality of life Dr Gruneir told me But residents of dementia units were also markedly more likely to receive antipsychotic drugs when youd hope that aÂ trained staff might mean fewer meds They have welldocumented side effects Dr Gruneir said of such drugs But people will also tell you there arent a lot of good alternatives in dealing with problem behaviors Evaluating these units often requires this onehandotherhand approach In another study Dr Gruneir and her colleagues found that   Encouraging right  That hopefully means the home can prevent the need for hospitalization can stay on top of symptoms and get the appropriate care without calling paramedics Dr Gruneir said They know that many residents wont benefit from a more aggressive level of care But the lower hospitalization rate applied to the entire nursing home including residents without dementia not only to those living in the special unit Dr Gruneir theorizes that nursing homes that invest in specialized units probably do other things better too Putting in extra resources seems to benefit everyone she said To add to the complexities a more recent study based on statewide data from Minnesota suggests that dementia units can affect a factor that matters greatly to patients and families quality of life In facetoface interviews conducted for the state   on measures like comfort autonomy meaningful activities and the environment compared with cognitively impaired residents in traditional nursing units There are some very positive things happening on specialized care units said the studys lead author Kathleen Abrahamson a public health specialist at Western Kentucky University But the residents of dementia units also had lower mood scores even when the researchers controlled for depression diagnoses Possibly its residents had more undiagnosed depression Dr Abrahamson suggested What to make of all this There are mixed signals about dementia units Dr Gruneir acknowledged Sometimes it looks like they do better on some things and other times they dont seem to make much difference Thats probably because theres little standardization or regulation of what dementia units should offer and for whom so some probably do a fine job while others just lock the doors To complicate things further many assisted living facilities have specialized units for dementia too If your parent or relative lives on a dementia unit please tell us about your experience in the comments section below But the clear bottom line is that families looking for nursing homes for loved ones with dementia still have to undertake due diligence visiting at various times of day asking questions looking at   talking to other residents families You cant assume that a special dementia unit means better care Depending on the facility it may not make much difference
