                       Consumer surveys show that many Americans think glutenfree casually abbreviated GF means a food is healthy But unless you have a medical issue that requires gluten avoidance this usually isnt true In fact manufacturers often use less nutrientdense flours and fat to replace the gluten in carbohydraterich foods such as pasta crackers and snacks So when you opt for these GF products youre spending more for no additional nutrients and sometimes a less healthy product If you want to cut down on gluten try replacing refined carb products with foods that are naturally glutenfree such as fruits vegetables and legumes instead Oatmeal can be a great wholegrain energy source Or it can be a sweet bowl of refined carbs that leave you starving midmorning The primary oatmeal culprits are the refined instant varieties that are low in fiber and protein and have added sugar Avoid these by choosing an instant oatmeal where the first ingredient listed is steel cut oats whole oats or whole groats and one that has at least g of fiber and g protein per serving Another good signtheres no added sugar or its at the end of the ingredient list Better yet cook and refrigerate a batch of steel cut or oldfashioned oats that you can simply reheat and flavor yourself with fruit and toasted nuts Reducedfat peanut butter is not necessarily a healthier version of regular peanut butter Read the labels to see why Both regular and reducedfat peanut butter contain about the same amount of calories but the reducedfat variety has more sugar But isnt it healthy to

yet find a store where you can grind your own or   at home Sure a baked potato in its natural state that is sans toppings is a very healthful food Potatoes are naturally rich in vitamin C potassium and fiber Plus a mediumsized baked potato contains only about  calories But if youre eating out dont assume that the baked potato is the healthiest choice on the menu Many restaurantstyle baked

necessarily the cranberry itself but the fact that this dried fruit is often sweetened with added sugar When purchasing any dried fruit you want to see only one item in the ingredient listthe fruit

protein and veggies may appear to be the lighter choice among sandwiches and subs but dont let its thin profile fool you Wraps often have more calories saturated fat and sodium than two slices of wholegrain bread Many are also made with refined flours and hydrogenated oils which means they often have less fiber and contain trans fats If you prefer wraps to bread check the calories and

Kamut quinoa farro amaranth speltthese are just a few grains that have been around for hundreds of years but have only recently made it to the supermarket shelf These ancient grains as theyve been
