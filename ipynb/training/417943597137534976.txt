The seconds left in  are slipping away And you know what else is slipping away The seconds left in your life Luckily for you theres a new product called   a wristwatch that counts down your life so you can watch on a large dotmatrix display as the seconds you have left on Earth disappear down a black hole Your estimated time of death is of course just that  an estimate Tikker uses an algorithm like the one used by the federal government to   But the effect is chilling a sort of incessant grim reaper reminding you that time is running out Tikkers inventor is a yearold Swede named Fredrik Colting He says he invented the gadget not as a morbid novelty item but in an earnest attempt to change his own thinking He wanted some sort of reminder to not sweat the small stuff and reach for what matters Colting a former gravedigger figured imminent death was the best motivator there is Thats why he calls Tikker the happiness watch Its his belief that watching your life slip away will remind you to savor life while you have it And it turns out there is some evidence for his point of view A   showed that thinking about death makes you savor life more And a  study has shown that   more likely to donate your blood But thats not the whole story A whole dark underbelly of research suggests that thinking about our own mortality can bring out the worst in us The work of Jeff Greenberg Sheldon Solomon and Tom Pyszczynski  grandfathers of an idea in social psychology called terror management theory  has shown that thinking about death makes us well pretty xenophobic When confronted with our mortality we cling to those like us and disparage those who are different Now why do you get both positive and negative effects Well thats an open question in science right now Do both always occur Does it depend on the person Does it depend on the way in which you are made to think about death specifically picturing your own death or thinking about death in a more abstract or subliminal way No one knows yet So whether Tikker will make you happy or as Solomon quipped to me a xenophobic serial killer is still unknown What is known is that the watch will be available in April  and thousands of preorders have already rolled in
