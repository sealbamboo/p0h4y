A new study suggests something encouraging for busy people Every  of movement counts toward the  minutes of moderateintensity physical activity   each week University of Utah researchers found that each minute spent engaging in some kind of moderate to vigorous physical activity was associated with lower BMI and lower weight OK that seems kind of obvious But according to the current physical activity national guidelines aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of at least  minutes and the everyday stuff like walking the dog or climbing a flight of stairs arent long enough to count toward meeting the Guidelines This new paper published today in the American Journal of Health Promotion suggests that reaching those two and a half hours minute by minute is just fine The idea here is you can do a minute at a time and thats not a problem says Jessie Fan lead author of the new paper and a family and consumer studies professor at the University of Utah For the women studied each minute spent in higherintensity moderate to vigorous activity was associated with a  drop in body mass index a measure of fat based on height and weight For a  woman that means a drop in weight of nearly half a pound The effect in the guys was a little less substantial a minute of exercise was associated with a  drop in BMI translating to a pound drop in weight for a  guy That doesnt sound like much and it isnt on its own  but thats just   points out Miriam Nelson a nutrition science professor at Tufts University who was on the committee that put together the  Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans Multiply that by  or  or  and youve got some real results  all achieved by teeny tiny bouts of highintensity activity  High intensity Fan says essentially means moving with a little pep enough to get your heart rate going its not sprinting or   for example but its not ambling down the sidewalk either  I think its easier for people to process that message Fan says Otherwise if they dont have a block of time they might be discouraged and they dont do anything Fan and colleagues gathered their data using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey a research program that uses interviews and physical exams to track the health of a diverse selection of American adults and children For this study researchers gathered the BMI and weight of  adults ages  to  and compared that to their physical activity level which was tracked by an accelerometer a device that measures movement The results experts say lend some numerical evidence to the idea that every minute counts Time is precious says Michael Mantell PhD a behavioral science expert with the American Council on Exercise He says the all or nothing approach  as in If I cant work out for an hour at the gym why bother at all  is an excuse that too often keeps people from doing any sort of physical activity This study identifies why that belief is inaccurate Mantell has oh about a thousand ideas to put this idea into practice You could energetically clean the house while listening to peppy music or go outside to wash and wax your car In the kitchen you could chop veggies wash dishes or stir batter by hand instead of with an electric mixer On your way to work or while doing errands get off the bus or subway a stop earlier than normal or park a little farther away from the store At home play with your kids or grandkids push the baby in the stroller or walk the dog  The major message Mantell says is to take a minute for yourself
