Girls are the perpetrators of some form of dating violence nearly as often as boys surprising new studies show  More girls   percent  than boys   percent  reported committing an act of physical dating violence said researchers who are presenting their findings beginning Wednesday at the American Psychological Associations annual meeting Slightly more boys   percent  than girls   percent  reported perpetrating at least one act of sexual violence  For her study Dorothy Espelage professor of educational psychology at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign and her colleagues conducted a longitudinal study among  students starting in grades   and  and followed them over a period of four years Researchers interviewed the students at intervals over that time  The study looked at a spectrum of behaviors ranging from name calling and expressing anger spreading rumors and using controlling behaviors such as keeping track of dating partners to physical violence such as slapping hitting and biting and sexual violence including forced kissing Taken as a whole one in three reported being the victim of at least one of the behaviors on that spectrum While most of us may not rank namecalling or badmouthing another to their friends as violence the researchers say they included the psychological and relationship tactics because they can have a profound impact  We see in other research that the psychological stuff has just as much of a negative impact on health outcomes as the physical and sexual violence said Carlos Cuevas associate professor in the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University who is also presenting a study on youth dating violence at meeting Espelage and her colleagues found that acts of verbal dating violence were common For example  percent of all study participants admitted deliberately doing something to make a partner angry and  percent used a hostile tone Physical and sexual violence were less common in the group studied with  percent saying they had hit or slapped a dating partner  percent saying theyd bit a partner and  percent saying they had forced a partner to kiss  The main aim of the study Espelage helped conduct was to illuminate any links between bullying at younger ages and violence as children began dating  Using selfreports taken at intervals from  through part of  the study showed a very clear and dramatic link Middle school bullies were seven times more likely to become dating violence perpetrators by high school This was true for both boys and girls  Our data show that for kids who gained selfesteem by dominance in middle school via verbally or psychologically bullying others their need for control spilled over into their relationships four years later Its not just the Nelson Muntz types either Espelage explained Im talking about the popular kids the high social status kids too If youve got a nasty bully girl in junior high shes going to have a bad outcome Cuevas study of  teens focused on the influence of cultural factors in dating violence among Latino youth He found low incidence of selfreported sexual violence   percent of boys admitted perpetrating an act of sexual coercion compared to  percent of girls Girls were more likely than boys to engage in any instance of physical or psychological dating violence Both Cuevas and Espelage stressed that other studies have shown that severe injurycausing violence is more often male perpetrated and that girls typically have a greater fear of injury from dating violence Before conducting his study Cuevas anticipated that family bonds and support would help prevent both delinquency and dating violence But I was a little surprised We thought it would be helpful but it turned out to be   helpful in decreasing all forms of violence we measured and all forms of delinquency We think family education is one of the real gateways for intervention and prevention he said If you are able to educate families and parents around these issues it provides the first line of defense for helping kids avoid getting into these kinds of behaviors
