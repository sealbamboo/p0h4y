What happens in Room  at the YMCA in Wayne NJ on Wednesday mornings doesnt look terribly dramatic About a dozen people trickle in step on a digital scale show the program leader Elizabeth Youngstein their logs  on iPads or smartphones or in paper notebooks  recording what they ate since last week and how much they exercised  We want  minutes per week Ms Youngstein said  So I track whether theyve tracked Then as in any support group members sit around a table and talk about what worked this week and what didnt Barbara Biazzo knows shes not drinking enough water but at least Im moving Marilyn Gerardi enjoys using the treadmill but it hurts her knees Ms Youngstein suggests a recumbent bike Joe Venezia is substituting Greek yogurt with horseradish for mayonnaise   Most participants here are in their late s and s but Rosalie Scudellari is   I somehow see your face when I think about another snack she tells Ms Youngstein  Its Week  of the Diabetes Prevention Program and however commonplace the conversation the results can be impressive In  a large national clinical trial showed that among adults at risk for Type  diabetes this lifestyle modification program and resulting weight loss   in  subjects participating in the program compared with those who did not  and by an even more substantial  percent in those over age   So the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   Now  organizations around the country  health care providers community groups employers colleges churches    Several providers are experimenting with online versions The YMCA the largest single organization involved enrolls  percent of participants nationally This may be the largest national health effort that most of us havent heard of and one of the most important especially for older adults   Ann Albright who directs the diabetes division at the CDC estimates that in the first two years nearly  Americans have joined one of its recognized diabetes prevention programs which are aimed at people whose weight blood glucose levels or other factors suggest they are at elevated risk for developing the disease This is not a diet some sort of temporary thing Dr Albright said  This is intended to help people adopt new habits and to look at that as a way of life The CDC curriculum involves  weekly sessions then monthly followups for a year  The goal along with  minutes a week of walking or other physical activity is significant weight loss You will get diabetes reduction at  percent of body weight Dr Albright said But were shooting for  to  percent  In YMCA programs the organization says participants average a  percent loss after a year Why do older people do particularly well in this program  It probably has to do with their commitment Dr Albright said They become more engaged Maybe they realize where they are in their life course And maybe they see more diabetes with its pernicious effects Close to  percent of the population in the United States has Type  diabetes diagnosed or undiagnosed Dr Albright pointed out But prevalence rises with age Among those over age  nearly  percent have the disease  Weve got the evidence We know what to do Dr Albright said  Are we going to make it work The CDC and other public health advocates face two considerable barriers First though the number of groups with CDCrecognized diabetes prevention programs keeps growing it remains insufficient  About  million Americans are prediabetic the agency estimates Compared with that  program participants sounds pretty wimpy Dr Albright acknowledged We need millions  a major public awareness challenge Second the programs cost while lower than some gym memberships could discourage people particularly seniors The CDC estimates that the yearlong intervention costs an average  to provide Each organization sets its own charges at the Y the sticker price is  for the year Heres    Groups work to lower costs with fundraising grants and scholarships the Wayne YMCA program was free because of a pharmaceutical firm grant and some insurers cover the program But Medicare and Medicaid dont   The CDC is pushing for Medicare coverage legislation to mandate Medicare coverage has also been introduced in the House and the Senate Dr Albright sounded optimistic Its more expensive to treat diabetes she said than to prevent it  Increased exercise and healthier eating the programs central tenets have become so broadly understood that you might wonder why sitting in a room with a dozen others helps people achieve them But research shows that it does They hear what other people are going through and think If they can do it I can do it  Ms Youngstein said of her group   It has worked that way for Walter Weiss a retired postal worker with a family history of diabetes My doctors want me to lose weight he told me after the meeting  Every time I go Lose weight  His children were concerned enough to buy him a Fitbit last Christmas   A healthier lifestyle always seemed too difficult but he has turned  and the older you get the more you contemplate your mortality Mr Weiss said He weighed  pounds when he began the program in November and has lost nine pounds to date  Using the  percent goal he has eight pounds to go Mr Weiss showed me his meticulous tracking in a spiral notebook noting every eggwhite mushroom omelet and roasted chickpea snack every exercise session The latter have expanded Walking through his condo complex proved a bit boring he said so he does a daily twomile loop around a park reservoir instead   Some days he said I feel good and I go around again
