A solid nights sleep does more than recharge a growing brain  it may also help keep a growing body lean Breathing problems or a chronic lack of sleep early in life may double the risk that a child will be obese by age  according to research published Thursday in   Childhood obesity has been linked before with the number of hours a kid sleeps each night But other early problems with nighttime breathing  like snoring or the more serious    also seem to be predictive of significant weight gain among children according to the research Its the first study to look at both sleep duration and breathing problems as separate risk factors for obesity says Karen Bonuck professor of family and social medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University and lead author Sleep problems need to be thought of as a composite she tells Shots Its not just sleep duration sleep hygiene sleepdisordered breathing We need to think about healthy sleep overall and we need to think about it early To examine sleep habits and how they might predict a childs body mass index Bonuck and her colleagues used the   which tracked  children in England for  years The mothers surveyed were asked how long their children typically slept at ages  months  years about  years  years and  years They also reported any sleeping problems like snoring apnea or mouth breathing between the ages of  months and about  years old Finally the survey collected the height and weight of the children at ages  years  years and  years They found that children who had multiple sleeping problems were twice as likely to be obese by age   or  years compared with those who had no problems At age   percent of teens with no sleep problems were obese compared with  percent of those with multiple sleep problems In addition children who slept less than  hours per night at ages  and  years were more likely to be obese at age  While the study could only confirm an association not causality it makes sense that children who dont get enough solid sleep are tired and may eat more sleep scientists say Some of this actually might be related to certain hormones that regulate appetite says   a pediatric sleep medicine specialist at the University of Chicago Medicine Comer Childrens Hospital Another theory holds that poor sleep quality or short duration may cause stress on the body that leads to inflammation Though many questions about sleeps effects and mechanisms remain all agree its important especially in growing children Bonuck says Newborns should get   according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and preschoolers  to  hours Parents should look for early signals Bonuck says Noisy or halted breathing at night could mean something serious is amiss Watch your child she says Does she or he snore more than three times a week The American Academy of Pediatrics   that all children who snore regularly be screened for sleep apnea  partly because its easier to prevent childhood obesity than to treat it As Benjamin Franklin once said An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure  Bonuck says Pun intended
