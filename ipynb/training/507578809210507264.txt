Its only a matter of time some researchers are warning before isolated cases of Ebola start turning up in developed nations as well as hithertounaffected African countries The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa has killed more people than all previous outbreaks combined the World Health Organization said Wednesday The   includes about  cases and  deaths across four countries Meanwhile the authors of a new analysis say many countries  including the US  should gear up to recognize isolate and treat imported cases of Ebola The probability of seeing at least one imported case of Ebola in the US is as high as  percent by late September researchers   Tuesday in the journal  Thats compared with less than  percent right now These predictions are based on the flow of airline passengers from West Africa and the difficulty of preventing an infected passenger from boarding a flight As with any such analysis theres some uncertainty The range of a probable US importation of Ebola by Sept  runs from  percent to  percent But with time  and a continuing intense outbreak in West Africa  importation is almost inevitable the researchers told NPR What is happening in West Africa is going to get here We cant escape that at this point says physicist   the senior author on the study who analyzes the spread of infectious diseases at Northeastern University To be clear the projection is for at least one imported case of Ebola  not for the kind of viral mayhem afflicting Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone What we could expect if there is an importation would be very small clusters of cases between one and three Vespignani says But the probability increases as long as the West African epidemics keep growing And that means US hospitals doctors and public health officials need to heighten their vigilance The same is true for a roster of  other nations from the UK to South Africa which are connected to West Africa through air traffic Vespignani and his colleagues say Theres a  to  percent chance that an Ebola case will turn up in the UK by late September Belgium France and Germany will have lower risk But its not negligible Vespignani says Sooner or later they will arrive The probability of imported cases in Africa is higher not surprisingly Theres more than a  percent probability Ebola will show up in the West African nation of Ghana by late September according to the study Gambia Ivory Coast Morocco South Africa and Kenya are among  African countries where Ebola could pop up Officials at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had a presentation on the numbers on Tuesday The CDC has deployed teams of personnel in West Africa to help bring Ebola under control And here at home the agency is charged with preparing both the US medical system and the American public for the possibility that the deadly virus could sneak into this country Biostatistician   from the University of Florida agrees that Ebola doesnt pose a public health threat in the US and other developed nations But that doesnt mean that preparation isnt urgent We certainly need to make sure that staff and leadership of American medical centers understand the implications of Ebola says Longini who also worked on the study We need to have diagnostics in place to identify Ebola quickly We need quite a few local labs to do this and not just rely on sending samples to the CDC And we need to make sure isolation and quarantine of contacts takes place If it doesnt we could have a small cluster of cases The analysis by Longini Vespignani and their colleagues takes into account the number of airline passengers coming from West Africa to various countries For instance more than  a week arrive in Britain from Nigeria many of them originating in other African countries Hundreds to several thousands travel every week from West Africa to France Germany Spain Italy South Africa Egypt Saudi Arabia India China and other countries The researchers calculated the impact of severe restrictions on flights from Ebolaaffected regions An  percent reduction in air travelers would do no more than delay the impact of Ebola by a few weeks A  percent chokeoff of air travel is considered impossible Unless you can completely shut down the transportation systems these kinds of efforts will at best buy you a little time Longini says And they can be quite counterproductive because youre interrupting the flow of help goods and services It can make the epidemic worse in the country thats being quarantined The basic problem with confining Ebola is that like any infectious disease people can be infected without showing symptoms In Ebolas case the average incubation period is  days though it can be longer Thats more than enough time for an infected traveler to land on the other side of the world Fortunately an Ebolainfected person cant infect others unless hes obviously sick At that stage the virus can spread by direct contact with the infected person or bodily fluids On average each case of Ebola infects about two other people That spread rate is similar to that of the flu and roughly half the rate of smallpox Vespignani from Northeastern University says screening airline passengers is not going to prevent Ebola from traveling across the globe I dont trust screening too much he says Its difficult Intercepting passengers that are really not sick is not easy
