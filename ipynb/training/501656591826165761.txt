The California Supreme Court has   for an injury incurred on the job The case is one of the first in the nation to assess legal remedies available to paid caregivers who work with Alzheimers patients at home   The facts In September  Carolyn Gregory  was washing dishes in the home of Lorraine Cott an yearold woman with advanced Alzheimers Without warning Ms Cott came up behind Ms Gregory knocked into her and began reaching toward the sink As the caregiver struggled to restrain the older woman a large knife Ms Gregory was washing fell and sliced into her left hand Ms Gregory subsequently lost sensation in her thumb and two fingers and experienced considerable pain Since Ms Gregory was employed by a home health agency she was entitled to redress for the injury under the agencys workers compensation policy The question at issue was whether she could sue Mr and Mrs Cott both died last year for negligence as well In a to ruling the California Supreme Court said the caregiver could not citing a legal doctrine known as the primary assumption of risk That principle holds that workers who perform jobs they know to be dangerous  firefighters and police officers are primary examples  cannot seek recompense from clients when bad things happen as might be expected on the job Those hired to manage a hazardous condition may not sue their clients for injuries caused by the very risks they were retained to confront Justice Carol A Corrigan wrote in the majority opinion This applied to Ms Gregory the court said because she knew Ms Cott could be violent and dealing with the elderly womans difficult behavior was one of her primary responsibilities  This assumption of risk legal principle had previously been established for institutions that serve Alzheimers patients the new ruling extends it to home health aides in California The justices asserted that there was a public policy interest in treating people with disabilities in the communities where they live   If liability were imposed for caregiver injuries in private homes but not in hospitals or nursing homes the incentive for families to institutionalize Alzheimers sufferers would increase Justice Corrigan wrote  The California Supreme Court noted that its reasoning applies only to professional home health care workers who are trained and employed by an agency That leaves open the question of how the court might handle injured home care workers hired through registries independent contractors not registry employees or employed directly by families  Recognizing the complexity of issues at stake in this case the court also recommended that the California Legislature examine training requirements and enhanced insurance benefits for Alzheimers caregivers    While were disappointed with the courts decision were gratified that it recognized that adequate training and protection for home care workers are important considerations said Matthew Stark Blumin associate general counsel of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees which filed an amicus brief supporting Ms Gregory     Home care agencies need to ensure that caregivers for dementia patients understand what this kind of work is about and the potential for risk and harm said William A Dombi vice president for law at the National Association for Home Care  Hospice   Workers shouldnt be able to say they didnt know what they were getting into And in the end thats good for consumers
