A bn scheme to cut hospital admissions in England and treat more people at home is risky and overly optimistic health researchers warn   Nigel Edwards from the Nuffield Trust says the Better Care Fund due to start in  could even lead to more hospital admissions He says cutting the length of hospital stays would be more effective The government says pilots in  areas are already working well Mr Edwards says there is a proportion  perhaps around  of hospital admissions  who could be cared for in the community if GP and nursing services were improved Then he says there are a number of patients who may be admitted to hospital for a day or two and while they could be cared for at home the diagnostic and expert resources needed may well be the same He says the real issue is about those patients who remain in hospital for longer Writing in Scrubbing Up Mr Edwards says Most beds are occupied by relatively small numbers of patients who stay a long time  In fact in medical wards  of the patients that stay in hospital for more than a week use over  of the beds   More can be done quickly by reducing patients length of stay  A large proportion of patients could be more effectively cared for elsewhere This will require better social care community services and new types of care   The Foundation Trust Network which represents NHS trusts which look after their own finances said the fund was a step in the right direction but warned it carries significant risk that needs to be managed  Sir Merrick Cockell chairman of the Local Government Association said local areas piloting the fund were already going above and beyond what had been expected He added Most areas are now confident they will be able to provide services seven days a week identify a lead professional for those in greatest need and use patients NHS numbers to share information Sir Merrick said Increasing demand means that councils need an extra m each year just to maintain services at current levels  However the BCF was never intended to solve the issues related to distressed health economies  The Better Care Fund is not a quickfix that will solve the problems of the health and social care system overnight and it is shortsighted to expect the BCF to payback results in its first year  It is the opportunity to transform and improve the lives of those using health and care services over the medium and long term at a lower cost Health Minister Norman Lamb said The Better Care Fund isnt just about cutting hospital admissions  its about reducing the time people spend in hospital having services closer to home and preventing people from getting ill in the first place  Its a new joinedup approach which will transform patient care He added Noone said its going to be easy which is why we are working closely with local areas to get their plans for integration right  But when we do patients will get better care in the community and the NHS will be able to focus its attention on those who need it most
