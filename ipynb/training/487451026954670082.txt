On the Fourth of July before the meat and fish hit the grill I decided to throw on some fruit Ive always loved the way roasting summer stone fruit like peaches and apricots deepens their flavors and I thought a sizzle on the grill might do the same It did Just a few minutes on each side  enough to create griddle marks on a peach or an apricot and soften it but not so long that the fruit collapses brought out the juices and warmed the fruit through When I removed the peaches and apricots from the grill I tossed them with a little honey and lemon zest On a summer night this warm combination served with vanilla ice cream is hard to top and perfect for a party But when I grilled the peaches and apricots again I decided to do something else I made crpes first and used the fruit as a filling I couldnt get grilled fruit out of my head and worked on other recipes after I grilled the peaches and apricots  not just desserts but salads with grilled fruit some wonderful combinations and a starter of grilled figs  I didnt fire up my outdoor grill just to grill fruit however You can grill fruit just as easily on a grill pan a griddle on the stove or an electric indoor grill But if I knew that a friend planned to grill I took fruit If I didnt get it onto the grill before the other food was cooked Id wait for the residue to cook off and then give the grate a good scraping with a spatula I didnt want my pineapple or watermelon tasting like fish or steak  Grilling the apricots makes them contrast beautifully with the pungent arugula in this salad  Serve these figs warm as an appetizer with goat cheese or as a dessert with ricotta or yogurt  Crpes are great to have on hand for desserts and easy to make with a nonstick or seasoned crpe pan
