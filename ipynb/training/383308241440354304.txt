Lets face it In the popular imagination the   has a large gut protruding from under his white doublebreasted coat And that stereotype is often accurate  by    percent of chefs in the US are overweight Weight gain seems to be par for the course when youre spending your day tasting food and your late nights unwinding after a stressful dinner service This week a group of chefs in Washington DC went public with their extra weight when they announced theyd lost a collective  pounds in a week weight loss competition to raise money and awareness for the American Cancer Society But the event was also a strange one chefs using their celebrity status and their bodies make for complicated public health messengers In the spring the American Cancer Society had approached chef Mike Isabella a DC restaurateur to brainstorm fundraising ideas for its annual   event Isabella suggested that he challenge his rivals and friends in the DC restaurant world to a weight loss competition  in part because hed recently gained a few dozen pounds It sounded good to ACS which   being as lean as possible throughout life without being underweight and avoiding excess weight gain at all ages to prevent cancer I looked around at the chefs and mixologists I knew in DC and realized wow we are really fat said   the chef and owner of the restaurants Graffiato Kapnos and G and a former contestant on the show   He managed to get  chefs and mixologists to sign up for the Fit for Hope Challenge and commit to biweekly workouts with trainers  a wellness coach and movement specialist helped the chefs identify ways to improve their diets Many were doing a lot of latenight eating and drinking and skipping breakfast says Pampell So one of the changes I suggested was to consume no more than three drinks and stay away from all starches at night She also helped persuade many of them to fit in workouts in the morning before going to work Will Artley the head chef of Pizzeria Orso in Falls Church Va began the challenge in June at  pounds By Tuesday he said he had dropped down to  pounds losing more than  percent of his body weight How did he do it I exercise a lot now as much as three times a day and Im training to do triathalons and Iron Man competitions he tells The Salt My diet is a lot more balanced now I only eat carbs after working out Artley tied for first place in the Fit for Hope challenge along with Todd Thrasher of Restaurant Eve who lost almost  pounds Isabella noted in his speech that the competition had been fierce and that there had been plenty of smacktalking along the way The chefs in the challenge demonstrated that its possible to lose a significant amount of weight in a short period of time says Artley If the world is going to change the way it eats then chefs need to show they have the ability to change he says But we couldnt help wondering Are chefs really the best messengers for public health given that theyre the masterminds behind restaurants that enable and celebrate indulgence and gluttony And while the restaurant industry is not to blame for the obesity epidemic more Americans are consuming the majority of their meals outside the home which often means theyre overindulging A  review   found that portion sizes have increased over time leading to more calories consumed overall According to ACS spokesman Robert the chefs were encouraged to serve healthy fare at the event which featured small plates from more than  area restaurants and bars Many did have healthy offerings in small portions like the chickpea salad from Artley and the scallop ceviche from Ripple chef Marjorie MeekBradley But will their menus be changing too to give their diners plenty of healthy options Its not clear Artley says hes leaving the decadent dishes like his BLT Gnocchi But I do think more about making my menu responsible and wellbalanced with a variety of choices he says The trouble with weight loss challenges is that they sometimes only produce shortterm benefits As weve   only  in  Americans who lose weight are able to keep it off after one year Thats something that chefs trainer Pampell is well aware of Many of these chefs have yoyoed with their weight in the past she says and Im not sure all of them will be able to keep the weight theyve just lost off in the long term she says
