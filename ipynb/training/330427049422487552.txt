All Things Considered In a   after the Boston Marathon bombing Cam West breezes into the hospital room like a coach trying to inspire the team at halftime Celeste Corcoran sits in a chair the stubs of her legs wrapped in gauze Shes holding hands with her daughter Sydney who was also injured West leans over Celeste and grips the arms of her chair She dabs away tears She can barely speak He moves in close and waves a hand above her stubs This doesnt matter he tells Corcoran Its just a change of scenery It really is West knows what it feels like to wake up groggy and confused in a hospital bed his parents at the foot of his bed He was just starting on the road to recovery when we first met him and   Even then West was telling himself that he could once again lead Marines in combat though shooting running and gunning would be trickier he knew after losing a leg And as he told us then he had a fallback plan  to be a rancher in Colorado If I dont do the Marine Corps thing he said in  look for me poking cows Longhorns Today West is still a Marine But he helps civilians cope with the loss of a limb through the   which supports critically injured Marines and their families West and a handful of other Marines have visited  amputees at four Boston hospitals For Marines in Afghanistan losing a limb is too common Wests unit was rd Battalion th Marine regiment  or   as they called themselves It had the highest casualty rate for Marines in the past decade because its mission took it to a nest of Taliban fighters and roadside bombs It was so bad some Marines strapped on loose tourniquets before heading out on patrol But no one expects middleaged Americans and their children who are watching a road race on a city street to suddenly and violently suffer such injuries Which makes the adjustment that much harder Some of those injured had no idea they had lost a limb until they awoke from sedation two or three days after the explosion West notes Youre missing a limb you had  hours prior and dont know what occurred or how it occurred Yeah its a pretty big shock During their hospital visit the Marines told the Boston amputees about rehabilitation and about prosthetics They told them there would be good days and bad But West can say from experience that even more than the conversation just standing there likely provided the strongest reassurance The mobility that we had the positive spirit that we had and the motivation that we had were most important West says I think that does more than anything you can actually tell them West and his fellow Marines say theyre planning a third trip to Boston and they plan to go back again and again to encourage those who lost a limb that day And how did his ambitions turn out West has decided for personal reasons that combats no longer for him So hes going with that fallback plan a ranch although not in Colorado Instead it will be along the GeorgiaAlabama border where he was born He already has eight cowboy hats and still watches John Wayne movies almost daily Ive got a nice piece of property and Im going to raise beef cattle he says and live the Southern solitude life Well not that secluded West is planning to get married at the end of the year His fiancee he says is a cowgirl at heart
