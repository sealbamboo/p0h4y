
 As I approached four years as a widow the loneliness of a oneperson household began to drag me down Acquiring a fourlegged companion rather than a twolegged one appealed to me And so in February I adopted a monthold puppy a hypoallergenic Havanese small enough for me to pick up and carry even into my ninth decade when I travel to visit family and friends While most dog owners I know encouraged my decision several dogless friends thought I had lost my mind How with all my work travels and cultural events was I going to manage the care of a dog No one asked this when I decided to have children In fact few people consider in advance how children will fit into their lives If you want a child badly enough you make it work I am now making it work with Max II little mischief that he is and I am besotted Hes smart  smart enough to know when I really must work and cannot spend time throwing a ball for him As I write this hes asleep on the floor at my side although during a phone interview two weeks ago he managed to shred every piece of paper he could grab in my study Yes hes a lot of work at least at this age But like a small child Max makes me laugh many times a day Thats not unusual apparently In a   of  people who kept laughter logs those who owned dogs laughed more often than cat owners and people who owned neither When I speak to Max he looks at me lovingly and seems to understand what Im saying When I open his crate each morning he greets me with unbounded enthusiasmLikewise when I return from a walk or swim a day at the office or an evening at the theater But perhaps the most interesting and unpremeditated benefit has been the scores of people Ive met on the street both with and without dogs who stop to admire him and talk to me Max has definitely increased my interpersonal contacts and enhanced my social life People often thank me for letting them pet my dog Max in turn showers them with affection Prompted by my son a fellow dog lover to explore the health benefits of pet ownership I dug into the literature focusing first on what pets can do for older adults then branching out to people in all age brackets  than any other type of nonhuman companion Studies of the health ramifications have strongly suggested that pets particularly dogs can foster cardiovascular health resistance to stress social connectivity and enhanced longevity The researcher Erika Friedmann whose   showed that other factors being equal people with pets were more likely to be alive a year after discharge from a coronary care unit said studies also    even though owners drank more alcohol ate more meat and weighed more than those without pets Other studies have found that older people who walk dogs are more likely than those who walk with human companions   Controlled studies by Dr Friedmann a professor at the University of Maryland School of Nursing have also demonstrated a lower level of physiological arousal from stressinducing situations when a friendly animal was present I cant yet say that Max II has reduced my anxiety I remain ever alert to his need to head outside and his attempts to chew or tear up anything he can reach But there is no question that I am thrilled by his antics endearing personality unconditional love even when I yell no and the many connections hes fostered with both acquaintances and strangers As a study published in  in Society  Animals concluded pets ameliorate some determinants of   such as loneliness In a   of  residents of Western Australia the researchers found pet ownership to be associated with social interactions favor exchanges civic engagement perceptions of neighborhood friendliness and sense of community Elderly dog owners report   according to a  study by veterinary researchers at the University of California Davis Children too can benefit from pet ownership medically and socially Rates of   and  are lower among children with dogs at home from infancy onward Among boys in particular who may have few activities that foster nurturing behavior caring for a pet enhances emotional development and security according to Gail F Melson professor of developmental studies at Purdue University She found that yearolds who turn to pets for support are rated by parents as   than comparable children who have pets they dont rely on But before acquiring any pet and especially a dog Alan M Beck who heads the Center for the HumanAnimal Bond at Purdue urges people to carefully consider the implications Look for an animal of an appropriate breed size and temperament for your household he said Do you have the income exercise ability and time the pet needs In an interview Dr Beck suggested speaking to owners with the kind of pet you are considering If possible visit a household with one Better still he said try petsitting for a few days or fostering an animal for a few weeks to appreciate more fully what pet ownership entails and to determine if you are up to the task If youre going to get a dog you should be prepared to spend time on basic training and socializing the animal Dr Beck said A properly socialized dog is better behaved and less likely to be aggressive and bite someone In an interview Dr Friedmann emphasized that pets are not a panacea to be treated like a drug taken when you feel unwell Living with a companion animal involves responsibilities the establishment of structured routines for feeding exercising and nurturing she said The benefits you derive from the animal are linked to these responsibilities
