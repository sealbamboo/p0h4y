Visits to emergency rooms for traumatic brain injuries  most of them concussions  jumped a whopping  percent in just four years according to new research that suggests a growing awareness of the seriousness of these injuries Highlighting the danger a second study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that college football players especially those who had been diagnosed with concussions appeared to have atrophy in a brain region vital to creating new memories Researchers cant say whether the rise in ER visits from  to  comes from an increase in concussions greater awareness of their dangers more vigilance on the part of doctors making the diagnosis or a combination of those factors said Dr Jennifer R Marin the studys lead author and an assistant professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School But brain injury experts said the biggest factor was probably a growing public awareness of their impact  and that they dont only affect   Weve known that there were problems with boxers brains since  but boxing was historically viewed as a uniquely brutal sport that had to be different from football said Dr Douglas Smith a professor of neurosurgery and director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center Next people started thinking that football might be like boxing but only at the pro level where there are big guys crashing into one another Now we realize that kids can have the same issue Its not just boxers or pro football players It can be your kid In fact the biggest jumps in ER visits for traumatic brain injury were among  and seniors In the second study researchers scanned the brains of  college football players who had had a concussion  players without concussions and  students who did not play football The researchers focused on the hippocampus an area of the brain that is crucial to forming new memories and that has been found to be atrophied in boxers and pro football players who have developed chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE Overall football players had smaller hippocampi than those who played no football But the most striking results were in players who had been diagnosed with concussions said coauthor Patrick Bellgowan an associate professor and director of cognitive neuroscience at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research The findings were dramatic said David Hovda a professor of neurosurgery at the University of California Los Angeles and director of the UCLA Brain Injury Research Center But no one knows whether the atrophy is due to the concussion itself or if the atrophy could have been caused by mismanagement of the player after injury he added As for the atrophy seen in players with no diagnosed concussions Hovda suggested it could be due to subconcussive blows brainrattling hits that arent hard enough to cause actual concussion symptoms Researchers also dont know whether the atrophy is permanent Hovda said We know that the brain atrophies with age so it would be interesting to know if this TBIinduced atrophy would stay ahead of the curve How big a deal is the loss of some hippocampal volume I know I use every neuron I have Hovda said So any atrophy would be significant What we do not know is to what extent the atrophy is clinically relevant The shrinking of the hippocampus is alarming Smith said This is another nail in the coffin for contact sports Its another topic to bring up over the dinner table when kids are trying out The question for parents is do you want to take that risk to the brain so your kid can be a teenage superstar and then spend the rest of his life dealing with whats left The rise in ER visits might be good news Bellgowan said if it is a sign that Americans are learning that concussions   A lot of parents still brush off concussions when kids dont appear to have severe symptoms Bellgowan would like to see parents take their kids to a concussion specialist no matter how slight the jolt to the head might seem at the time Symptoms can linger or even get worse if concussions arent managed properly he said One message were hoping to get out is that if a kid gets hurt parents should bring him in to see a specialist Bellgowan said This needs to be taken seriously because it may have longterm consequences
