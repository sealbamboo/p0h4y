As the body count in Africas deadly Ebola outbreak continues to rise some say the time has come for the US military to step in The US Military is uniquely poised to help with this disease says   an infectious disease researcher at Brown University whos volunteering in Liberia the country hardest hit by Ebola Weve trained for it weve got the logistics weve got the support and we have the matriel The Department of Defense runs a sophisticated health service for its own troops Its staff includes infectious disease experts doctors and nurses It can set up massive field hospitals almost anywhere On top of that the military can do logistics like no other It can move fuel food and supplies en masse Earlier this week on NBCs   President Obama called the Ebola outbreak a   But the Pentagons commitment seems modest in the wake of Obamas comments It plans to supply Liberia with a bed field hospital  but no medical staff The   says hundreds of beds are urgently needed A bed hospital it isnt going to be a big help to the Liberian people so this was a big disappointment Flanigan says But the military says it cant do everything Our deployable medical capabilities are generally trauma medicine treating people who suffer wounds in combat and things of that nature says   the assistant secretary of defense in charge of Ebola response Thats not necessarily what theyre dealing with there And a large number of troops are dispatched that could make things worse Flooding the zone with everything can honestly cause more problems Lumpkin says So its important that we put the right capabilities in the right place at the right time Earlier this summer Liberian troops were in the wrong place and it made things a lot worse Security forces came in to quarantine the citizens of an Ebola stricken slum without explanation The situation rapidly escalated and shots were fired A teenage boy was wounded  Foreign troops would not be there to enforce quarantines But just their presence has the potential to destabilize says   a public health expert at George Washington University Its not so good to invade with public health that does not build trust that does not build sustainable relationships she says In fact until recently many charities working in the region didnt want military involvement But as the outbreak grows worse aid groups feel they have to take a chance I think what weve already seen is a sea change in the receptiveness of many international health workers to military engagement she says Doctors Without Borders which has clinics throughout the region   In neighboring Sierra Leone the   That work is being done in coordination with the charity Save the Children Flanigan whos working in Liberia says the help cannot come soon enough There are not enough medical personnel to staff the regular clinics and the regular hospitals he says There are not enough medical personnel to staff the Ebola treatment units
