Traditionally much hoopla surrounds the birth of the first baby of the New Year But it turns out that can be an expensive bit of good luck  While medical conditions and encounters dont care whether its  or  health insurance and subsidies generally play by the calendar year Deductibles reset on Jan  no matter if you began your six weeks of radiation in December or have been pregnant for the last eight months And with more and more policies including those offered under the Affordable Care Act carrying high annual deductibles of  or more that reset can lead to major expenses for consumers who must fulfill the new deductible  I have spent this year covering medical pricing and have received comments from a number of patients who fell victim to this deductible double jeopardy Jennifer from Evanston Ill wrote This year the beginning of the Affordable Care Act health exchanges may amplify the problem for some patients as they switch to new insurance Rebecca wrote  Unfortunately that is how insurance works Deductibles accumulate on an annual basis so claims for  accrue until December st and then start again for  said Susan Pisano vice president of communications for   a trade group She noted also that insurance companies generally do their accounting  according to when a claim was submitted not when the service occurred  This double jeopardy can prove extremely costly in a country where even routine pregnancies ending in simple vaginal delivery can cost  It may also be burdensome to patients undergoing prolonged or complicated treatment like breast surgery followed by reconstruction  Experts point out there are also time constraints built into Health Care Flexible Spending Accounts which allow consumers to place pretax dollars for unreimbursed medical expenses But these special accounts also track to the calendar year Although most plans allow for a grace period of a few months  allowing you for example to get reimbursed next March for care rendered this month  ultimately these plans are use it or lose it If the money is not spent by the deadline you lose it  According to Wage Works the employer keeps the unused portion and generally uses it to defray administrative costs of the plan or sometimes to pay for participants who have gone over their limit Unfortunately disputes over hospital bills can take a long time to settle leaving patients out of luck and money Dr Marguerite Duane a physician who was featured in my    on the high costs of pregnancy thought she was being sensible when she put thousands of dollars into her Flexible Spending Account during her last pregnancy to pay for the unreimbursed expenses related to the birth of her son Ellis  But when the hospital mistakenly charged Dr Duane for an extra night she spent many months disputing the bill By the time an accurate bill was generated she was no longer eligible to use the money  Which is all to say that as far as health insurance is concerned the devil is in the details And as millions of Americans are signing up for insurance policies under the Affordable Care Act it pays to scrutinize very carefully how each policy works Also as the end of the year approaches there are ways to minimize your financial exposure experts said Ms Pisano pointed out for example that it might behoove a patient being treated in  to push a hospital to submit the bill as early as possible or schedule elective treatment early in December so that it did not slip into January Likewise an obstetrician can bill at the beginning or the end of a pregnancy  a decision that may have huge implications for patient outofpocket costs  In terms of Flexible Spending Accounts patients dont need to settle billing disputes to tap into these funds said Jody Dietel chief compliance officer of the benefits firm WageWorks They should submit the bill  as soon as they get it If after adjudication the final bill is for less than the payout they will simply have to repay the difference Said Ms Dietel This is free money but like coupon shopping you have to be a little organized to use it
