On January   Hyatt crawled to the top of a tower at the plastics plant where he worked doubled over and struggled to catch his breath That was when it finally hit him  if he didnt lose weight he might not live to see his three daughters graduate college get married or have children of their own Heavy all his life from poor eating habits and little exercise Hyatt had lost weight before only to gain it all back So this time he didnt set a weight loss goal  He gave himself a bigger challenge Compete in an Ironman triathlon in five years or less Arguably the worlds most grueling endurance race the Ironman consists of a mile swim a mile bicycle ride and a marathon mile run with no break I cant explain how my logic works but I just decided if I try to run the Ironman even if I dont get there Im going to lose the weight and Im going to get fit said the yearold from Ottawa Illinois Eight months later Hyatt had completed his first triathlon run his first marathon and lost nearly  pounds To date he has lost  pounds and  inches off his waist by working out  to  hours per week  swimming running cycling and doing yoga  and sticking with a fairly rigid diet  I love the fact that Ive done what Ive done but it pales in comparison to what I want to do he said Hyatt was overweight as a child He remembers the other kids calling him Moby Dick and yelling There she blows Sports werent his thing He liked to swim but the only time he went jogging was when his concerned parents would make him run around the block to try to help him lose weight That just brought him more shame and ridicule  Id have people I didnt even know yell names at me  Here comes the fat boy running  But decades later when he laid down the Ironman gauntlet there was no turning back  He didnt tell his wife at first The Monday morning after his January  epiphany he snuck out of bed and got to the YMCA when it opened at  am He texted his wife something like I just went for a swim Im like what What are you talking about You dont just go for a swim in the middle of January she said As the months went on she got a clearer picture At first it was just the swimming and then he comes home and goes Im going to do a CouchtoK And then Im going to take up cycling and he signed up for a cycling class And then he said Im going to do the Ironman   The workouts escalated slowly During the first month Hyatt swam four mornings a week adding a couple laps every other day until he got to a mile After a couple weeks he signed up for a weekly spinning class When he joined up with some people starting the   for beginner runners he was still more than  pounds and breathing so heavily that the other joggers would ask if he was OK  But he made it to every run three days a week He finished his first K in  minutes and  seconds From there it was onto a K Dealing with naysayers was the hardest part In the beginning people told him hed destroy his knees He was too big to be running they said When he hadnt lost all the weight some people even accused him of lying about swimming a whole mile or running six He said his wife and two friends were the only ones who believed in him A nutritionist helped Hyatt balance his diet around running and cycling He sticks to whole grains lean meats fruits and vegetables and tries to eat a combination of  carbohydrates  fat and  protein per her recommendation  If the family goes to a Chinese restaurant he orders steamed chicken and rice with the sauce on the side He treats himself to a Skinny Cow ice cream sandwich most days and if hes training for a marathon hell eat a few slices of pizza In September  he ran a half marathon and later that month a triathlon A couple months later he did a full marathon  This past July he completed a half Ironman his proudest accomplishment so far Swimming  miles in Lake Michigan was like swimming in a washing machine and as he swallowed water and felt his chest tighten he seriously contemplated dropping out of the race But he kept going When you get to that finish line  it brought tears to my eyes he said At the same time it was a stark reality that Im only at half of where I need to be No one doubts him now He wakes up at  am on weekdays to run swim and strength train before he leaves for work at  am On weekends hes usually up by  am to cycle When the family travels his first call is to find the nearest YMCA with a pool  He weighs  pounds about  pounds from his goal weight He has gotten off two blood pressure medications sleeps better and is a much more pleasant person to be around his wife reports  Nobody would ever say anything to me anymore he said Im way more fit than the average person these days and Im proud of that And Im not going to quit Hyatt is saving money for the  entry fee required to participate in the Louisville Ironman in August And he wont be stopping there  After the Ironman hes got his sights set on ultramarathons trail running and the Boston Marathon to qualify hed need to shave more than an hour off his current time He also wants to win a race The human body is capable of so much more than you can fathom if you have the mental fortitude to put past the artificial limits that your brain places on it he said The harder it sounds or the more challenging it is the more appealing it is to me Shelley no longer worries how much life insurance they have though she does wonder when hell be home from his long runs or bike rides On the upside he cooks dinner for the family nearly every night to make sure the food is prepared healthily  There are time when Im like Oh my gosh I cant believe youre doing this I cant believe how insane I am to let you do this  she said But ultimately she said Im so happy and so thankful because hes adding years to his life After learning about Hyatts story the Ironman organization waived his entry fee for the Louisville race Hyatt has committed to give back by raising money for childhood obesity He has set a goal of raising
