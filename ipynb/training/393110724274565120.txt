The Obama administration has entered full damagecontrol mode over the balky website intended to enroll people in new health plans under the Affordable Care Act Senior officials met Wednesday morning with   and in the afternoon insurance CEOs got an audience at the White House Tomorrow some of the private contractors responsible for building the website   will testify at a   One of the big questions now circulating concerns what will happen if the website cant be fixed soon Will the government really penalize people for not having insurance if they cant realistically buy it Technically people are supposed to have coverage starting Jan   But   meaning you actually have until the end of March which is also when the current open enrollment period ends Still the way the signup works you have to enroll by the middle of the month before you want coverage for the insurance to take effect in time So right now to be covered by the end of March and avoid being penalized you have to enroll by Feb  Even the administration says it wants to fix this At a   White House spokesman Jay Carney said In terms of the Feb  date that you just mentioned theres no question that theres a disconnect between open enrollment and the individual responsibility time frames in the first year only And those are going to be addressed And if that mismatch does get changed it would give people an additional month and a half to sign up without risking a penalty  and without extending the existing open enrollment date But what about the possibility of extending the enrollment period which even   are now calling for if the website isnt fixed soon Or of waiving the penalty for the first year Thats where you start to run into big issues with the insurance companies that are offering these products in the exchanges They set their premiums based on the rules as theyre written  that healthy young people would be strongly encouraged to sign up by the prospect of a penalty and that they would be encouraged to sign up within this sixmonth window As one insurance industry representative said today If you change the rules insurers are going to want to change their premiums to reflect the possibility that fewer healthier people may sign up The other big problem is timing Stretching out open enrollment past that March  deadline starts to bump up against planning for  Insurance companies have to start submitting premiums for that next year starting in April insurance officials say so they really need to know whos signed up for the current year by the end of March
