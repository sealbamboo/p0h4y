Oh what a job Youve got  billion to address societys most intractable problems So what do you do If youre philanthropist Howard G Buffett son of famed investor Warren Buffett you set a deadline  years And you move at fastforward speed thats the way Warren describes his sons pace to steer the most vulnerable people on Earth towards a future where food production is efficient plentiful and affordable Warren Buffett Howard G Buffett and grandson Howard W Buffett sat down to talk with us earlier this week about their new book   Howard G Buffett wrote most of the book but his son Howard W Buffett contributed several chapters In the foreward written by Warren Buffett he describes his son Howard G as the Indiana Jones of his field And as weve   Howard G  who is most at home when inside the cab of a big ol tractor  has lots of ideas about how we can feed more than  billion more mouths by  Among his many conclusions Africa needs better seeds fighting the drug trade can influence food insecurity and more fertilizer isnt always the solution to maximizing farmers yields Following are excerpts from our conversation They have been edited for brevity and clarity   I think were pretty much on the same page The whole concept behind   is really a mindset If everybody thought they had to put themselves out of business in  years you had  chances to succeed in what your primary goals are you would probably be more urgent and you would be forced to change quicker You cant just stick with something that doesnt work And we stuck with some things that dont work for a long time    Well you still find a number of NGOs nongovernmental organizations that continue to spend huge amounts of money on projects and we found out  and we did that actually for quite a while we spent plenty of money on it and we just learned that if you want to change big problems you have to change them with scale And we also learned something that I really didnt want to engage in for quite a long time which was advocacy in terms of policy change Weve learned that project by project you cant change millions and millions of lives And its ineffective in terms of making a huge difference if youve got  bad polices They will defeat good ideas and good people So there isnt any choice in our mind today that we have to engage in advocacy   Yeah we dont have the kind of farm labor we need to do two things one is to pick all the food and collect all the food that we grow theres a huge amount of waste Second of all that waste is a great opportunity for food banks And then we have to have volunteer base incentives to support a volunteer base to move that food into the food bank system Theres millions and millions of pounds of food that could be used for that and a lot of it is good food Its nutritious food    It does make sense And one thing you always have to remember about philanthropy is that in business the market system tells you fairly promptly whether youve got a good idea or not If youve got a product and people dont like it it doesnt move and youve got to do something else In philanthropy you can keep doing things that dont work over and over again  So I love the fact that Howie as well as my other two children constantly test their ideas against whether they really are working and have a healthy suspicion of anything thats proposed Its somewhat different from business because in philanthropy youre tackling the very tough problems that have resisted intellect and money in the past In business youre looking for something easy to do maybe just a new improved product that will sell a little bit better than the previous one So in philanthropy if youre doing important things you have to expect mistakes    On biofuels I would say that theres an effort that I would support that moves away from the actual subsidization of biofuels Biofuels can stand on their own merits at this point And I think they have places where they fit well and make sense and places probably where they dont Weve had a couple of crazy policies on food aid One of them being that you have to have  percent shipped on US vessels That is so archaic It should have been done away with a long time ago It costs the taxpayers money and it costs people who need the food And its really simple to understand that That is pure politics not in the interest of the people who are hungry and not the taxpayers On farm subsidies your term goldplated crop insurance is a great way to say it Crop insurance is probably one of the best ways to protect the downside in a very difficult business but last year  and I know this factually not because Ive benefited from it but because I know neighbors who did  they benefited more from the revenue from crop insurance than if they had had a good average crop Thats a goldplated policy and its not the right policy Crop insurance should be a policy that keeps people from going broke to make sure they can farm next year but not to make them rich    One of the most important policies from my perspective and my own personal experience has been the conservation stewardship program that the USDA has in place CSP for short This program rewards farmers who have taken on new conservationbased approaches for water quality for the water table for their soil or for their air quality Whats promising for me is that the federal government is now recognizing an actual monetary value of those improvement practices In the book we have a specific chapter on a farmer in Northwest Iowa named Clay Mitchell Clay has done an unbelievable job of improving the productivity of his farmland by  to  percent over all of his neighbors and hes done it in a way that continues to build the organic material in the soil and continues to improve the environment all around him And he really is a superstar when it comes to farmers We need more leaders in the farming sector who continue to look at the value of their soil over time and what they can do to improve it because it also has the return of increasing their revenue  I think the science will develop It is developing The challenge we have is a lot of the discussion immediately goes to GMOs and it gets very confused about what GMOs are and what they arent and how you provide solutions  But its going to have to be done in a way that the knowledge is clearly based on evidence and science and you know theres this huge fear factor when it comes to GMOs    I think the biggest legitimate concern is what will we have in  or  years as a consequence of GMOs that we dont understand today There isnt anything today scientifically that Ive seen that indicates that that should be a great fear But I think also its not  percent clear and thats where we have to rely on government regulation and government agencies to do the best job they can To make sure how things are implemented allow us to adjust to that and adjust to what we learn in the future Its pretty complex and you have some very polarized opinions on it and different agendas on it and that makes it tough particularly in the area of politics  Im not going to make a prediction on it I dont feel its my place I use GMO crops on my farm in Nebraska and its allowed us to remain productive and profitable in what were doing  Its the issue where everybody wants to make a sound bite out of it and draw a quick conclusion and thats what does the damage If we can really have an evidencebased discussion that is driven by science then that is going to get us to the point where we can use this technology to save a lot of lives and improve a lot of peoples lives and that should be what people care about Whats very irritating is the people that typically are throwing stones either dont give other solutions or they are certainly not the ones who are hungry This has got to be about solutions and not simply about attacking things Solutions are feeding more people having less people hungry Solutions cant be Lets just stick with the status quo The solutions are How do we use technology in an informed way that is safe and help people  First and foremost a lot has to change from the donor community Those organizations and foundations even the government have to do a much better job of prioritizing the leadership that local communities can take in finding the best solution for themselves and creating sustainable eventually incomegenerating activities for their people It can be tough sometimes to channel that energy but we have to constantly be questioning ourselves and always trying to do a better job no matter what it is were doing  Ive got to add  I was in Chennai India after the tsunami and traveled to two other coastal areas down south They were rejecting aid for the most part and I will tell you they did a pretty amazing job on their own getting things organized And it was interesting to see a country that controlled aid quite tightly and did an unbelievable job of responding  The message is Youve got about  years in your lifetime to achieve the best things the biggest things you want to achieve and look at it like in  years youre going to be out of business So that means youve got to invest in the best people youve got to understand that everything is local and everything is personal But yet youve got to do it at scale and it means youve got to take risks and youve got to be willing to fail  From my own personal lens I would say the biggest take away for me is that a single individual when given the opportunity can change the world We have to keep that in mind and not lose hope in the face of so many challenges that were looking at all over the globe For me personally I have seen that through what my grandfather has accomplished in his career and Ive seen that through what my dad has already been able to do now through the foundation And if people keep that mindset as well it will provide them the energy and the determination to endure through whatever challenge they are trying to overcome  I am optimistic I feel terrifically about what all my three of my children are doing in philanthropy Weve been fortunate to make a whole lot more money than anybody can spend intelligently on themselves so the object is to spend it intelligently on the rest of the world
