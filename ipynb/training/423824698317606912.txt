As temperatures hit C at the Australian Open in Melbourne officials decided it was just too hot to play tennis  for more than four hours in the middle of the day because of extreme heat There is little doubt that people had been suffering in the sweltering conditions With readings in excess of C all week ball boys were fainting spectators wilting and players complaining of exhaustion and dehydration So what impact is the heat having on their bodies It is not surprising that by running around a tennis court for several hours in extremely dry conditions players were generating a lot of heat According to Prof George Havenith professor of environmental physiology and ergonomics from Loughborough University players will be producing the heat equivalent of around  W light bulbs When the effects of direct sunshine and radiation from the court surface are taken into consideration as well as heat from the spectators watching and the lack of air flow around the court this could increase the heat count by up to another  The key to coping with this level of heat production is losing it again through sweating In Melbourne thats possible because its dry unlike a tropical country where the humidity is high So its easier to evaporate sweat Players can cool down but it takes a lot of sweat to achieve it Prof Havenith explains He calculates that tennis players in Melbourne this week where the relative humidity is  would need to lose between  and  litres of sweat an hour from their bodies in the current temperatures Yet the maximum someone can drink in that time is around one litre so there is inevitably going to be a deficit of fluids in the body particularly during a long match lasting several hours As a result players can feel lightheaded weak and nauseous and start complaining of headaches and muscle cramps These are the signs of   which occurs when the body loses excess fluids and salts due to hot temperatures Usually the body slows down automatically when it reaches a temperature of C or C in response to dehydration and feelings of exhaustion But elite athletes can push through this stage and thats when they face the much more serious condition of     which is a medical emergency At that point the body is no longer able to cool itself and starts to dangerously overheat Although heatstroke can manifest itself differently in every individual the most important sign of the condition is confusion Prof Havenith says When a person becomes disorientated when they are not responsive any more thats when they are getting close to their limits To give themselves the best chance of coping with a match in the Melbourne midday sun tennis players should be preparing their body beforehand Precooling is now a common practice which can mean a cold shower or ice bath before playing and the intake of lots of cold drinks in the runup to a match to help maintain hydration levels Even eating cold foods with a high water content and avoiding hot meals can help experts say Ice collars  ice packs wrapped up in towels to be hung round the neck  and ice vests have become regular sights this week at the Australian Open  for good reason The best method of cooling people down is to apply ice to areas where crucial arteries are located like the groin and armpits This helps to cool the blood quickly and increases blood flow to the muscles in the body  Afterwards Prof Havenith recommends cooling the hands and feet in ice water rather than the more drastic full immersion in an ice bath because it does not have such a sudden impact on the cardiovascular system Most important is replenishing the bodys fluids by drinking water all day long Drinks containing glucose and electrolytes sodium and potassium salts can also help this process In the end players will just have to keep their fingers crossed for an airconditioned match in a covered court  and pray they wont meet Rafa Nadal
