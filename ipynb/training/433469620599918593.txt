Many people take vitamins as part of their daily fitness regimens having heard that antioxidants aid physical recovery and amplify the impact of workouts But in another example of science undercutting deeply held assumptions several new experiments find that antioxidant supplements may actually reduce the benefits of training  Antioxidants became popular dietary supplements largely because they were said to sop up free radicals the highly reactive oxygen molecules that are generated during daily activities Physical exertion through its breakdown of oxygen results in the creation of large numbers of these molecules which in excess can lead  to cell death and tissue damage So it seems logical that reducing the number of free radicals produced by exercise would be desirable  Enter antioxidants which absorb and deactivate free radicals While the body creates its own antioxidants until recently many researchers believed that we produce too few natural antioxidants to counteract the depredations from free radicals created during exercise So many people who exercise began downing large doses of antioxidants such as vitamins C and E even though few experiments in people had actually examined the precise physiological impacts of antioxidant supplements in people who work out  For a   researchers with the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo and other institutions gathered  healthy adult men and women most of them recreational runners or cyclists and conducted a series of tests including muscle biopsies blood draws and treadmill runs to establish their baseline endurance capacity and the cellular health of their muscles   Then they divided the volunteers into two groups Those in one group took four pills a day delivering a total dose of  milligrams of vitamin C and  milligrams of vitamin E Members of the second group got identical placebo pills  Finally they asked all of the participants to complete a vigorous week training program consisting of increasingly intense interval sessions once or twice per week together with two weekly sessions of moderately paced hourlong runs By the end all of the volunteers were more fit than they had been at the start with their maximum endurance capacity increasing by an average of about  percent But their bodies had responded quite differently to the training The runners who had swallowed the placebo pills showed robust increases of biochemical markers that are known to goose the creation of mitochondria the tiny structures within cells that generate energy in cells in their bloodstream and muscles More mitochondria especially in muscle cells means more energy and by and large better health and fitness The creation of new mitochondria is in fact generally held to be one of the most important effects of exercise  But the volunteers who had consumed the antioxidants had significantly lower levels of the markers related to mitochondrial creation The researchers didnt actually count the specific populations of mitochondria within their volunteers muscles cells but presumably over time those taking the antioxidants would see a smaller uptick in mitochondrial density than among those not taking them  That finding echoes the results of another study of antioxidant supplementation and exercise   in which half of a group of older men downed  milligrams daily of the supplement resveratrol an antioxidant famously found in red wine and the other half took a placebo After two months of exercising the men taking the placebo showed significant and favorable changes in their blood pressure cholesterol profiles and arteries with fewer evident arterial plaques  The men taking the resveratrol were not as fortunate They had exercised as much as the other men but their blood pressures cholesterol levels and arteries had remained stubbornly almost unchanged  Why and how antioxidant supplements would blunt the effects of exercise is not altogether clear said Goran Paulsen a researcher at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences who led the vitamin C and E study But he and many other physiologists have begun to suspect that free radicals may play a different role during and after exercise than previously thought  In this theory free radicals are not villainous but serve as messengers nudging genes and other bodily systems into starting the various biochemical reactions that end in stronger muscles and better metabolic health Without free radicals those reactions dont begin  And large doses of antioxidant supplements absorb most of the free radicals produced by exercise  Of course that theory is still unsubstantiated and requires longterm testing in people Dr Paulsen said It is possible he said that smaller doses of antioxidants or different formulations might be useful for athletes Meanwhile natural antioxidants from food sources such as blueberries and red wine are unlikely to be problematic he said Its probably only concentrated extracts that are potentially dangerous he said It is also worth pointing out that the volunteers who took the concentrated extracts of vitamins C and E increased their endurance to the same extent as those taking a placebo  On the other hand the supplements did not improve performance in comparison with a placebo so why bother with them Dr Paulsen asked Personally I would avoid high dosages of antioxidants while training he said The science on the topic may not be complete but the intimation of the recent studies is that by downing the supplements you risk losing some of the benefits of exercise
