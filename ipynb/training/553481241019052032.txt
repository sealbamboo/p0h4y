The company behind Britains first privately run hospital said it planned to pull out of its contract to run Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as it emerged that AE performance across   England had plunged to a record low Circle Healthcare blamed funding cuts and increased demand for AE services at Hinchinbrooke as it emerged AE performance across the NHS in England sank to its worst level ever last week with just  of patients treated within four hours over the New Year break The NHS constitution states that  of all AE patients should be dealt with within four hours Circle Holdings issued a statement to the London Stock Exchange blaming funding cuts a surge in demand for accident and emergency services and a failure to deliver joinedup reform between health and social services It said the company had entered into discussions with the NHS Trust Development Authority with the view to ensuring an orderly withdrawal from the current contract The statement lobbed a politically charged hand grenade into the election campaign with Labours health spokesman Andy Burnham criticising the government for agreeing a risky business model with Circle and his Conservative opposite number Jeremy Hunt accusing Burnham of playing politics with the issue Hunt highlighted Labours role in deciding to hand the hospital to the private sector Burnham inherited the decision to call in the private sector at the troubled hospital when he became health secretary in June  but was in office when a shortlist of three providers including Circle was drawn up in March  on the eve of the general election Circle was selected as the preferred bidder in November  by the coalition and awarded the contract a year later  Disappointing news on Hinchingbrooke but andyburnhammp must stop playing politics  he signed off decision to allow private sector operator The health secretary defended the governments decision to use the private sector to improve services He   This government makes no apology for seeking solutions for failing hospitals We wont be deterred from tackling poor care  driving up standards The prime ministers spokeswoman said There is disappointment that Circle has made this decision The priority and the focus now is to make sure that patient care is not affected while the trust development authority transfers the running of the trust The figures released on Friday by NHS England also show a sharp escalation in other problems experienced by the service over the festive period especially in the week including and just after the new year A total of  ambulances had to queue for at least  minutes outside an AE unit in England in the three weeks between  December and  January and were unable to discharge the patient in the back to AE staff because the emergency department concerned was so busy That was more than double the  such incidents in the comparable three weeks in the winter f  Similarly far more planned operations such as hernia repairs and cataract removals had to be postponed over the last three weeks because of the huge pressure hospitals were under In all  elective procedures were called off compared with  such surgeries the year before The number of patients that had to be diverted from one AE unit to another because the hospital they initially arrived at was so busy also rose yearonyear from  to  Bedblocking also reached new record levels Over the past three weeks  beds were occupied by mainly frail elderly patients who could not be safely discharged despite doctors having passed them as medically fit to go because of a lack of social care provision That was also significantly up on the  delayed transfers of care seen in the same threeweek period last winter However despite AE units coming under intense sustained pressure recently none has had to close temporarily a situation that sometimes occurs when a hospital cannot cope Two AEs have had to shut their doors to patients this winter though none since  December The weekend of  January just after the New Year celebrations saw some of the worstever performance by the NHS on these other performance indicators That may reflect the fact that many GP surgeries were closed or that hospital staff were on holiday or other factors For example over those three days a total of  ambulances had to queue outside AE units for at least half an hour while  hospital trusts experienced what NHS England calls operational problems trying to cope with demand Circles threat to pull out compounds the headache for the Conservatives posed by worsening AE performance across England because it focuses more attention on the governments reorganisation The company said that funding for Hinchingbrooke   Care NHS trust had been cut by about  for the current financial year and that the company had spent m to support the trust Circle is allowed to withdraw from the contract if it spends more than m A report by the Care Quality Commissions new regime is expected to be highly critical of the hospital The Circle statement said the reports conclusions which follow a preliminary report last year would be unbalanced and that it would contest many of them In   the CQC reported that patients at the hospital were being neglected hygiene was inadequate and Hinchingbrooke was facing staffing problems Steve Melton Circles chief executive said in a statement Like most hospitals over the past year Hinchingbrooke saw unprecedented AE attendances and not enough care places for healthy patients awaiting discharge At the same time our funding has been cut We also believe that inconsistent and conflicting regulatory regimes compound the challenge for acute hospitals in this environment This combination of factors means we have now reluctantly concluded that in its existing form Circles involvement in Hinchingbrooke is unsustainable The statement by Circle Holdings goes to the centre of many of the issues highlighted by Labour as it seeks to place the NHS at the heart of the election debate The statement by Burnham was carefully phrased  and lacked his usual robust language attacking the government  because Labour knows it is vulnerable to the charge that it set in train the process that allowed Hinchingbrooke to become Britains first privately run hospital Burnham said Patients who rely on Hinchingbrooke will be worried about their hospital following this announcement and ministers must provide urgent reassurance and set out a plan to ensure the continuity of services at the hospital in this uncertain time It was the decision of the coalition in November  to appoint Circle and they must take responsibility for this mess The government were explicitly warned two years ago about the risky business model Circle were operating but failed to take any action Given that these risks were known at the outset ministers must explain why they judged Circle a safe choice to run this hospital They must also set out today how long they have known about the problems at Hinchingbrooke Burnham would like to focus attention on the coalitions decision to pick Circle to run Hinchingbrooke and on the deal that was agreed after it was named the preferred bidder in November  Circle said in a statement We believe that solving the problems facing Hinchingbrooke can only be achieved through joinedup reform in Cambridgeshire across hospitals GPs and community services We fully support the vision of NHS England chief executive   Five Year Forward View but these proposed reforms are too far into the future If reform in the region develops fast and a new role for us does become clear we are happy to play our full part
