Mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price Group is urging Allergan Inc. to allow shareholders to vote on any major acquisitions as the Botox maker scrambles to fend off a hostile bid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.. T. Rowe, Allergan's second-largest shareholder with a roughly 5.4% stake, said in a statement it is concerned Allergan could strike a deal that would hamper a pending shareholder vote that is a necessary step in Valeant's $53 billion bid with activist investor William Ackman to take over Allergan.
