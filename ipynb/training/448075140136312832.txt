Nineyearold Zethu and her mother Nonhlanhla Lukhele sit watching cartoons together in their home in Mbabane Swaziland In front of them is a powerful and toxic cocktail of drugs to treat the drugresistant form of tuberculosis TB that has infected them both  Each day they have to take about  pills between them Nonhlanhla is also having daily painful injections A sideeffect is the loss of hearing She is now deaf  Well you cant exactly communicate with her because she cant hear says Zethu Whatever I try to speak to her she just doesnt understand  even if I write it down or speak to her in sign language  I wish it was like in the past when she could hear This is the new face of a very old disease TB is becoming increasingly resistant to the drugs traditionally used to treat it  Every year about  million people become infected with the airborne disease and  million die Normal TB is usually treated with a sixmonth course of antibiotics but because of the misuse of these drugs new strains have mutated into deadlier forms of the disease They are harder and more expensive to treat  Patients have to endure toxic treatment taking about  pills over the course of two years  Almost  people developed this type of drugresistant TB in  according to the World Health Organization WHO but fewer than one in four was diagnosed  That means they were not on proper treatment and were walking around in their communities potentially spreading these deadlier strains of the disease  Its very contagious says Nonhlanhla  I even infected my child  She is in and out of hospitals and she is getting behind with her school work I really dont see a bright future for her One of the key problems is access to labs that are capable of diagnosing these new deadlier forms of the disease so people can start on treatment  Earlier and faster diagnosis of all forms of TB is vital says Dr Margaret Chan WHOs director general  It improves the chances of people getting the right treatment and being cured and it helps stop spread of drugresistant disease The WHO says diagnostic facilities around the world are improving  In  there were just  multidrugresistant TB cases detected in  low and middleincome countries according to the WHO  Last year that had risen to almost  cases thanks largely to global health initiative called Expand Access to New Diagnostics for TB The other key challenge facing the fight against these new strains of TB is the lack of new drugs to treat them  Last week the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres MSF called drugresistant TB one of the biggest global health threats we face today and called for new and more effective drugs to be developed and trialled  It said although two new drugs have been released recently the first in  years it will be many years before patients have access to the revolutionary new treatment they need  TB drugs have to be used in combination in order to be effective but clinical trials combining the new drugs are not under way yet The DRTB drugresistant forms of TB crisis is everybodys problem and demands an immediate international response says Dr Sidney Wong MSFs medical director  Each year we are diagnosing more patients with DRTB but the current treatments arent good enough to make a dent in the epidemic It doesnt matter where you live until new short and more effective treatment combinations are found the odds of surviving this disease today are dismal
