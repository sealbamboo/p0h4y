The   can streamline innovate cut and chivvy all it wants to improve quality and save money but only citizens can change how they use the service The NHS is a collective social insurance scheme that requires a sense of ownership and responsibility from all who pay into it not just those who run it And the only people who can truly save the NHS are the people who use it Millions of citizens need to drive a paradigm shift in the provision of health and care The late Derek Wanless recognised this in his seminal report   He created the concept of the fully engaged healthcare economy that would cost bn less a year by  A figure that neatly meets the projected bn NHS funding shortfall If the public wants to maintain an NHS free at the point of need then people have to accept that they are responsible for the service and do some of the heavy lifting Wanless went further he said patients should ensure their actions do not add unnecessarily to the cost of the service What is the first step Help the NHS adopt technology In a world where digital innovation can sweep the globe in months the NHS is one of the most nonviral institutions in the world In  the public needs to do for the NHS what it has done for the banking airline holiday and insurance industries  adopt and demand digital approaches to the management of healthcare People need to bring their technology to the NHSs door Ask why appointments cant be booked by phone Send a secure message to ask if its really necessary to see a doctor Use a video call without having to leave work Demand to know why you cant record the way you want to be treated in an emergency in advance of a crisis And like a parent the NHS has to let go and trust its children The NHS needs to believe people can make their own tradeoffs between convenience and security Understand that individuals will know when its appropriate to use technology and when it is not In  the willing and responsible among the m users of the NHS need to help the services  million employees run the NHS more efficiently and effectively by creating advance statements and decisions filling out preconsultation questionnaires booking appointments online and asking clinicians to work with the digital tools the public use in their daily lives A GP who insists on always seeing a patient facetoface cant be argued with but a patient who is willing to fill in a questionnaire and receive a call back within an hour should be encouraged If the NHS lets go the public could revolutionise the running of the service Simple measures could save billions Different approaches could drive adoption including reductions in national insurance contributions or shared saving deals for companies willing to link their products to the NHS for free These are approach already being taken in the US In an attempt to create an alldigital national register of advance decisions and statements both houses of Congress in the US are currently debating bills that will pay every US citizen who creates an advance directive Once ratified Congress is happy for the citizen to find the right product and industry to make it available to clinicians  hours a day  which provides a free global alldigital emergency and advance care platform estimates a UK national register dovetailed with the organ donor register would save the NHS bn a year in reduced bed days and increased organ donations Does the engaged patient exist An impressive   have signed the organ donor register one of the  questions contained in an advance decision and statement and more than  million unique users look up health information on NHS Choices every month Reach out to these people and the odds are good they will respond Especially if clinical leaders who already support advance decisions and statements encourage the public to sign up A fullyengaged patient is possible  is the year to start  is the year the NHS needs to let go and let the public lead it to safety
