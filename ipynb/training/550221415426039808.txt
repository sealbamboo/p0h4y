Procedures for screening health workers returning to the UK after treating Ebola patients will be reviewed after an infected nurse flew from London to Glasgow despite raising concerns  Pauline Cafferkey told officials at Heathrow she felt unwell but was allowed to continue her journey She was diagnosed in hospital the next day  Another passenger on her flight said screening had been chaotic  The chief medical officer said the case raised questions over precautions However Dame Sally Davies said correct protocols had been followed The risk of raised temperature when she came back appears to have been very low she said  Thats why we look at what we do all the time to see should we have been more precautionary is it in the publics interest Is it in the patients interest But she added I doubt it would have made much difference Dame Sally said Ms Cafferkey had been in the early phase of the disease when she made the journey to the UK from Sierra Leone via Casablanca and her fellow passengers were at very low risk of being infected  She told BBC Breakfast The public health risk is negligible  Ebolas very difficult to catch Ms Cafferkey was diagnosed on Monday after returning from Sierra Leone where she had travelled as part of a strong group of healthcare workers from Save the Children She was allowed to leave Heathrow after her temperature was taken seven times   After an initial test she told officials she believed a fever might be developing while she was waiting for a connecting flight to Glasgow Her temperature was taken a further six times over  minutes but each test found her temperature to be normal  She reported symptoms the following morning after arriving in Glasgow A Department of Health spokesman said Naturally we will be reviewing what happened and the screening protocols and if anything needs to be changed it will be  Enhanced screening  which involves passengers having their temperature taken and completing a questionnaire about their health  was rolled out at some UK airports including Heathrow in October Save the Children said they had robust and strict protocols in place to protect our staff A statement added Save the Children also asks staff to be careful outside of the treatment centre where exposure to risks can be less obvious The charitys humanitarian director Michael von Bertele told BBC Radio s Today programme Its really important for us to try and understand whether it was a failure of training of protection of procedure or indeed whether she contracted it in some incidental contact within the community Because our workers dont just work inside the red zone which is a very highrisk area they do also have contact  although we are very very careful in briefing people to avoid personal contact  outside of the treatment centre   He also said that while protection is of a very high standard nothing is riskfree when it comes to dealing with Ebola  But Dr Martin Deahl a consultant psychiatrist who travelled back on the same flight as Ms Cafferkey said there had been issues at Heathrow He said there were too few staff on duty and the rooms where returning volunteers were held were too small Ms Cafferkey is currently being cared for at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead north London  She was said to be doing as well as can be expected under the circumstances by Scotlands First Minister Nicola Sturgeon Ms Cafferkey had no detectable fever or symptoms Anyone displaying symptoms at screening either in Sierra Leone or in the UK would not have been allowed to travel One third of the  other passengers on the flight from Casablanca to Heathrow had been contacted by Public Health England while advice had been given to more than half the  passengers from Heathrow to Glasgow officials said Another healthcare   for the disease A third patient from Cornwall who had recently returned from an affected country    Ms Cafferkey could be offered plasma from patients who have survived the virus as part of her treatment Dame Sally confirmed that plasma had been donated by British nurse William Pooley who recovered from Ebola in September after also being treated at the Royal Free Hospital Having fought off the infection his blood should help others do the same Other available treatments include antiviral drugs but there are no stocks left of ZMapp  the drug used to treat Mr Pooley Ebola is transmitted by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person such as blood vomit or faeces The virus has killed more than  people mostly in West Africa since it broke out a year ago The World Health Organization says the number of people infected by the disease in Sierra Leone Liberia and Guinea has now passed  The early symptoms are a sudden fever muscle pain fatigue headache and sore throat This is followed by vomiting diarrhoea a rash and bleeding  both internal and external  which can be seen in the gums eyes nose and in the stools Patients tend to die from dehydration and multiple organ failure    If you are happy to speak to a BBC journalist please include a telephone number Or comment here
