Smoking used to be sexy Look at   or   But that was then These days Americans are buying fewer cigarettes Just this week US tobacco companies released their first quarter earnings and unsurprisingly cigarette sales were down from last year But that doesnt mean tobacco companies arent still profitable Smokefree products like ecigarettes are marketed as a less harmful alternative And for now at least you can puff them indoors Ecigarettes are made to look like regular cigarettes but theyre far more complicated Its an electronic device that uses a battery and it heats an liquid nicotine solution that users then inhale like they would a traditional cigarette explains reporter Michael Felberbaum who   for the Associated Press You may have already seen ecigarettes for sale at your local drugstore So have all the major tobacco companies and they want to compete As of very recently all of the top tobacco companies have announced plans or already have an electronic cigarette on the market Felberbaum says Altria the company that brought you the Marlboro Man  is the last American tobacco company to say they plan to release an ecigarette later this year Theyre behind tobacco company Lorillard Inc who purchased the ecigarette maker Blu last year Freedom to puff on an ecigarette indoors might sound great to smokers sick of looking like aging hoodlums in doorways but ecigarette fans shouldnt necessarily get used to it Local governments are already taking steps to limit esmoking in places where traditional smoking is banned The FDA warns that more research needs to be done on the health risks of inhaling liquid nicotine The FDA has said that it plans to assert regulatory authority over electronic cigarettes And that could lead to them being regulated in the same way as cigarettes as far as marketing is concerned Felberbaum says That hasnt stopped people calling them an effective way to quit smoking Actress Katherine Heigl even puffed one on the   in  However because of the way ecigarettes are classified manufacturers cant advertise the product that way The companies are not allowed to market them as smoking cessation devices because that would put them in the category of other nicotine replacement products that are regulated by the FDA such as nicotine gum or patches Felberbaum says So for now ecigarette smokers can pretty much puff away and they are Industry experts say US sales could even reach  billion this year
