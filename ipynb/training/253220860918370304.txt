Medicaid is already the   health insurance program in terms of number of people covered It serves nearly  in  Americans Yet at the same time its putting increasing strain on the budgets of states which pay about   of its costs If the  health law proceeds as planned Medicaid could see as many as   added to its rolls over the next decade The prospect of expansion thrills   but it terrifies those who fear Medicaid is a   to deliver care So Medicaid is likely to undergo a major change regardless of whether President Obama is reelected or replaced by Republican Mitt Romney Democrats support a much bigger program Republicans have plans to   But first a little bit about the program When most people think of Medicaid they think of moms and kids on welfare And its true moms and kids who get welfare   health coverage In fact workingage adults and children make up about  percent of Medicaids population But theyre responsible for only onethird of its costs Twothirds of the dollars that are spent on Medicaid are spent on elderly and disabled people many of whom have multiple challenges and a good number of whom are either in nursing homes or are disabled people who also receive Medicare says   a professor of public health at the University of Chicago And while Medicaid is the health program for the poorest of the poor it also serves millions of people who are    those whose extreme health needs arent met by their private insurance That includes people like Marty and Shannon Svikhart of Baltimore and their  yearold daughter Simone The Svikharts were on Capitol Hill last week to urge Congress not to cut Medicaid funding Simone was born prematurely And despite a huge smile and a headful of blonde hair she still suffers from a long list of ailments Her mom says they include cystic fibrosis hydrocephalus a brain bleed Right now she also has high blood pressure Eventually she will have to have open heart surgery Shannon quit her job as a dietician to care for Simone full time Marty is an account manager for a firm that makes patio decking and they have good health insurance But its not enough Because Simone still needs to be on a ventilator at night she needs a night nurse and the familys private insurance will only pay for  days of coverage each year for that If we had to pay out of pocket for home nursing that would average about  per year Marty says That he says would be financially unmanageable unless we hit the lottery or something Under a   however that only accepts  children with complex health needs at a time Marylands Medicaid helps pay the familys night nursing costs Shannon Svikhart says its made a huge difference That means that Marty and I can sleep Marty travels so if we didnt have that he would have had to quit his job probably work locally And without the night nursing coverage Simone would likely have had to remain in the hospital where her care would be even more expensive So having the Medicaid help Marty says helps get the children out of the hospital faster which lessens the cost overall for the health care system insurance and everyone But Medicaid critics say while programs like that may be useful the program overall is still way too expensive For many states its the biggest item in their budget Theyre all struggling to figure out what to do said Grace Marie Turner Shes a conservative health policy analyst and was a member of the   Turner says one of the biggest problems is the amount of micromanaging of Medicaid that comes from Washington You wind up with all of this red tape and bureaucracy and its costly and in my opinion we wind up with a program that provides the worst care to the most vulnerable people she said Candidate Romney says he would solve the problem basically by ending Medicaids status as a shared federalstate program He would   in the form of block grants and let them craft their own programs But hed also make his Medicaid plan a moneysaver by capping what the federal government provides at the costofliving plus one percent Thats well below medical inflation     last month Thats a lower rate of growth than weve seen over the past several years a lower rate of growth than has been forecast under federal management And I believe on that basis youre going to see us save about a hundred billion dollars a year Conservatives insist states can run their programs more efficiently without cutting people or services Liberals are far more skeptical To me it is a very significant gamble that if you really cut the payments to states that states will somehow be able to find ways to cut money said Pollack of the University of Chicago Right now Medicaid pays very low rates to providers its costs per person have actually been going up slower than just about anyplace else in the healthcare system By contrast President Obamas Affordable Care Act originally required states to expand Medicaid to most nondisabled adults with incomes under  percent of poverty Thats about  for an individual And it will help more than just those people actually getting insurance for the first time Pollack says It also allows the people who are taking care of that individual to get reliable payment which is a really important issue for public hospitals and for many other organizations that just desperately need that support right now he explains But the Supreme Court this summer made that Medicaid expansion   Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius thinks eventually most states will opt in if only because the federal government will pay nearly all the costs We think at the end of the day this is a deal that states wont want to turn down she said at   this summer But as with few other programs the fate of Medicaid will be very different depending on who the next president is
