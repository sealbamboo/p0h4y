Cancer books suck says yearold Hazel Grace Lancaster But she has a favorite and so do I Mine is the novel John Green wrote about her    With an allergy to cheesy sentiments resembling Holden Caulfields Hazel is the derisive yet tender narrator of Mr Greens bestselling book and now movie The Fault in Our Stars Hazel undergoes drug therapy to extend her life not to cure the thyroid cancer that has metastasized in her lungs Despite a terminal prognosis she tries to focus on living with disease instead of dying from it In the midst of scares and incapacity Hazel manages to relish jokes books her parents and eventually her love affair with yearold Augustus Waters who had a touch of osteosarcoma a year and a half ago requiring the partial amputation of one of his legs Through Hazels wry perspective the author circumvents what his heroine calls the expletive conventions of the cancer kid genre No need for a spoiler alert here You may be or become as enthralled as I am by the sometimes funny sometimes sad plot twists of this narrative but what stays with me is Mr Greens analysis of the experiences of teenagers with disease   Like many sick children Hazel displays unusual maturity Pulled out of school she has spent inordinate amounts of time learning at home In the process she has had to cope with a dysfunctional body with terrifying breakdowns in the ICU with lugging around an oxygen tank and sleeping with a machine that forces air in and out of my crap lungs Precocious she fully comprehends the doublebinds of chemical that extend her life by disabling her    Early on physical evidence of cancer separated Hazel from other people She cherishes the cancer novel An Imperial Affliction because its dying heroine refers to herself as the side effect Cancer kids are essentially side effects of the relentless mutation that made the diversity of life on earth possible Hazel believes Contra Shakespeare in other words the fault resides in the stars not in ourselves Intimate with the look of death she pledges her love to her boyfriend with the word OK not the word always Hazels fear of wounding the people who love her emerges in her sentence I am a grenade Dread of shattering those close to her impedes her evolving relationship with her boyfriend but it also strains her bond with her parents   There is only one thing in this world worse than biting it from cancer when youre  she explains and thats having a kid who bites it from cancer  Hazels desperate desire to know what happens to the heroines mother in An Imperial Affliction after the books abrupt conclusion reflects her anxiety about what will happen to her own mother after all the devoted caretaking ends Will her mom stop being a mom after Hazels death When a foundation sponsors Hazels transAtlantic trip to meet the author of her favorite novel she encounters the testimony of Otto Frank the father of Anne Frank She thinks of him not being a father anymore left with a diary instead of a wife and two daughters   Upon her return to Indianapolis Hazels father broaches a third point Mr Green makes in this case about a potential balm for young cancer patients I believe the universe wants to be noticed Hazels father says At this task Hazel is a pro  she admires ridicules reflects mourns  and this is partly so because of her avid reading of writers who take notice of the universe The Fault in Our Stars suggests that the scrutiny we give the world as well as representations of it yield special rewards to teenagers with cancer   According to Mr Green the insecurity of cancer transforms but does not inhibit personal growth in awareness Hazels robust responsiveness derives from acts of attention  undertaken by reading Literature with a capital L and Authors with a capital A but also through intense engagements with video games and websites     Mr Green qualifies and extends his ideas through a number of adolescent characters with quite different experiences of cancer And just as adolescents sometimes resemble children and sometimes adults his cast of characters speaks to all ages   Yet Hazel with her distinctive mix of realism and humor most extravagantly pays her debt to the universe and to everybody who didnt get to be a person anymore and everyone who hadnt gotten to be a person yet     Currently I am reading This Star Wont Go Out a collection of journals and letters composed by the real girl who inspired John Green to create Hazel Esther Earl died in  at the age of  The memory of the person she managed to become continues to steer us in precisely the compassionate direction that I believe Esther would have wanted Lets hope the movie does too
