Pregnancy or the desire to become pregnant often inspires women to take better care of themselves  quitting smoking for example or eating more nutritiously But now many women face an increasingly common problem obesity which affects  percent of women of childbearing age In addition to   obesity  defined as a body mass index above   is linked to a host of difficulties during pregnancy labor and delivery These range from gestational diabetes hypertension and preeclampsia to miscarriage premature birth emergency cesarean delivery and stillbirth The infants of obese women are more likely to have congenital defects and they are at greater risk of dying at or soon after birth Babies who survive are more likely to develop hypertension and obesity as adults To be sure most babies born to overweight and obese women are healthy Yet a recently published analysis of  studies found that even modest increases in a womans prepregnancy weight   stillbirth and infant death Personal biases and concerns about professional liability lead some obstetricians to avoid obese patients But   chairwoman of the committee on ethics of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it is time for doctors to push aside prejudice and fear They must take more positive steps to treat obese women who are pregnant or want to become pregnant Dr Klipstein and her colleagues recently issued   Obesity is commonly viewed as a personal failing that can be prevented or reversed through motivation and willpower But the facts suggest otherwise Although some people manage to shed as much as  pounds and keep them off without surgery many obese patients say theyve tried everything and nothing has worked Most obese women are not intentionally overeating or eating the wrong foods Dr Klipstein said Obstetricians should address the problem not abandon patients because they think theyre doing something wrong Dr Klipstein is a reproductive endocrinologist at InVia Fertility Specialists in Northbrook Ill In her experience the women who manage to lose weight are usually highly motivated and use a commercial diet plan But many fail even though they are very anxious to get pregnant and have a healthy pregnancy she said This is the new reality and obstetricians have to be aware of that and know how to treat patients with weight issues The committee report emphasizes that obese patients should not be viewed differently from other patient populations that require additional care or who have increased risks of adverse medical outcomes Obese patients should be cared for in a nonjudgmental manner it says adding that it is unethical for doctors to refuse care within the scope of their expertise solely because the patient is obese Obstetricians should discuss the medical risks associated with obesity with their patients and avoid blaming the patient for her increased weight the committee says Any doctor who feels unable to provide effective care for an obese patient should seek a consultation or refer the woman to another doctor Obesity rates are highest among women of lower socioeconomic status the report notes and many obese women lack access to healthy food choices and opportunities for regular exercise that would help them maintain a normal weight Nonetheless obese women who want to have a baby should not abandon all efforts to lose weight Obstetricians who lack expertise in weight management can refer patients to dietitians who specialize in treating weight problems without relying on gimmicks or crash diets which have their own health risks Weight loss is best attempted before a pregnancy Last year the colleges committee on obstetric practice   to provide education about possible complications and encourage obese patients to undertake a weightreduction program including diet exercise and behavior modification before attempting pregnancy An obese woman who becomes pregnant should aim to gain less weight than would a normalweight woman The Institute of Medicine suggests a pregnancy weight gain of  to  pounds for overweight women and  to  pounds for obese women Although women should not try to lose weight during pregnancy a woman who weighs  pounds shouldnt gain at all Dr Klipstein said This is not harmful to the fetus Dr Klipstein also noted that obesity produces physiological changes that can affect pregnancy starting with irregular ovulation that can result in infertility Obese women are more likely to have problems processing blood sugar which raises the risk of birth defects and miscarriage There is also a greater likelihood that their baby will be too large for a vaginal delivery requiring a cesarean delivery that has its own risks involving anesthesia and surgery The babies of obese women are more likely to develop neural tube defects  spina bifida and    and to suffer birth injuries like   which may occur when the infant is very large High blood pressure more common in obesity can result in preeclampsia during pregnancy which can damage the mothers kidneys and cause fetal complications like low birth weight prematurity and stillbirth It is also harder to obtain reliable images on a sonogram when the woman is obese This can delay detection of fetal or pregnancy abnormalities that require careful monitoring or medical intervention
