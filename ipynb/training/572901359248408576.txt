A team of disease detectives quietly working behind the scenes has fanned out across Dallas amid the swirl of activity around a Liberian man who arrived here infected with the Ebola virus For public health officials the team is the key to containing the virus It includes experts from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention some fresh from working the outbreak in West Africa as well as a cadre of local health workers They are part of a key process in combating infectious diseases known as contact tracing The exercise can be surprisingly lowtech  shoe leather epidemiology practitioners sometimes call it  involving a lot of door knocking talking and careful listening Its a triedandtrue method of curtailing illness and saving lives experts say Executed early and well the approach can cut off an outbreak  even a horrific and deadly one like Ebola  before it explodes out of control Contact tracing is your No  way of controlling the epidemic said Dr Craig Smith a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America If we cant stop the clinical symptoms we have to stop the transmission Contact tracing is one of a number of bootsontheground measures in modern epidemiologys toolbox The field of epidemiology was born in  said Dr Melinda Moore a senior scientist at the RAND Corp in Arlington Va Dr John Snow was trying to figure out why Londoners were falling ill with cholera At the time scientists did not know that diseases were caused by germs and did not understand why illnesses spread Snow went door to door tracking down sufferers and their families questioning them in detail He noticed that many deaths seemed to occur in people who drank water from a single pump on Broad Street He urged city officials to remove the handle from the pump making it impossible for drinkers to access the water They did  and the epidemic subsided The general principles that Snow pioneered  tracking down people involved in an outbreak methodically reconstructing the creep of disease and acting to interrupt transmission  apply across the board The specifics can vary by disease said Smith of the Infectious Diseases Society of America Public health teams tweak their strategies depending on how a disease spreads and how long it incubates silently in the body before symptoms erupt Catching Ebola requires contact with an infected bodily fluid such as blood vomit or diarrhea The virus represents a nightmare foe for medicine because it is so consistently deadly once it strikes But Ebolas epidemiology can make it a unique and convenient disease to target through contact tracing Smith said because the contagious phase doesnt begin until a patient is already sick This means trackers on the ground in Dallas wouldnt have to seek out contacts who might have encountered Thomas Eric Duncan before Sept  when he first developed symptoms  including dozens who shared the flights he took from Monrovia Liberia to the US But the Dallas team would relentlessly pursue anyone who might have had significant contact with the patient between Sept  and Sept  when Duncan was finally admitted to the hospital Smith added Theyre going to say  hours a day minute by minute where was he what were his activities who was he in contact with Smith said They probe and probe added Moore who worked as a disease investigator over the course of a year stint at the CDC investigating a variety of outbreaks in the US and abroad In an Ebola investigation trackers follow contacts for  days which is the maximum time it takes for the virus to incubate If a contact doesnt display symptoms within that period of time he or she is not at risk of developing Ebola If the contact does fall ill he or she is treated immediately and is placed in isolation  and another day round of contact investigation and followup begins In Dallas as of Friday teams were focused only on Duncans contacts said CDC spokesman Dave Daigle During a news conference the previous day Daigle who in August returned from another Ebola contact tracing stint in Nigeria told reporters that disease detectives had cast a very wide net in Texas in an effort to make sure no one was missed On Friday federal and local officials said that they were monitoring  people on a daily basis  of whom were considered to be at high risk Ten county health department epidemiologists are working in conjunction with the CDC team to handle followups said Erikka Neroes a spokeswoman for Dallas County Health and Human Services The workers fresh from tracking cases of enterovirus D are often working past midnight she said Initial interviews of contacts are conducted in person by teams of two Followup which involves recording contact temperatures and asking a series of questions about symptoms generally takes place over the phone Tracers are doing facetoface followups with the family that hosted Duncan because they were in close proximity while he was symptomatic Neroes said Typically local health teams that handle contact tracking arent stocked with scientists doctors or nurses rather workers are technicians who follow a script or a checklist as they review key details with patients Smith said But the simplicity of the process belies the care required to do the job well public health workers said Tracing can be difficult if a patient is not honest or is not familiar with a disease CDC director Dr Thomas Frieden has alluded to this when discussing Duncan who may not have told airport workers in Liberia that he had been in close contact with an Ebola victim Missed nuances in communication can complicate informationgathering as well You have to come here and talk Georgia to me said Smith who works as an infectious disease specialist at University Hospital in Augusta Ga You have to be sensitive to peoples culture In Nigeria Daigle said during the Thursday news conference some contacts were hesitant when approached by tracers Many had heard rumors about Ebola Some believed saltwater might be an effective cure Contact tracers learned to be persistent Daigle said Ultimately the outbreak was contained
