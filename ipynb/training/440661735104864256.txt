The number of Americans who are infected with hepatitis C is falling but thats probably because more people who have been sickened by the virus are dying as a result government researchers reported Monday After analyzing data from thousands of people who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that about  of the population over age  have hepatitis C If so that would translate to  million people with the virus known as HCV In addition the researchers estimated that  additional people once had the liver disease but no longer have an active infection Altogether  of of the population has a past or current HCV infection according to   published in Tuesdays edition of Annals of Internal Medicine All of these figures are based on survey data collected between  and  Previous studies have estimated that  of Americans had a past or current HCV infection in the years  to  along with  of the population in the years  to  At first glance the declining prevalence of HCV might seem like good news But the authors of the new study in Annals think something else is going on If better treatments were curing patients then the statistics would show a   in the number of people with current HCV infections and an   in the number of people infected with HCV Instead the number of people in both groups has been falling in parallel This supports the suggestion that mortality among chronically infected persons has increased they wrote  is a dangerous infection of the liver that has become the No  cause of cirrhosis liver cancer and liver transplants in the US according to the CDC Some patients who contract HCV recover in a matter of weeks but at least  develop chronic infections that can last for the rest of their lives The virus can be spread through contact with infected blood and health experts estimate that hepatitis C now kills more Americans each year than HIV The CDC researchers also analyzed the data to identify risk factors associated with HCV infection Compared with Americans who never had the virus those with chronic infections were more likely to have received a blood transfusion before  and to have injected illicit drugs However  of people with chronic infections had neither of these risk factors in their history the researchers reported Therefore riskbased screening alone is an incomplete approach to identifying chronically infected persons they wrote People with hepatitis C were also more likely to be men to be between the ages of  and  to have less education and to have lower family income according to the study Overall  of all people with chronic hepatitis C were born between  and  This is why the CDC recommends that all people born during that window   Such screening would flag about  people who otherwise wouldnt know they were infected if all of them got treatment an estimated  deaths due to HCV could be avoided the researchers wrote The health impact of advances in HCV therapy can be realized only when HCVinfected persons are tested identified and linked to appropriate care and treatment they wrote The study authors are from the CDCs National Center for HIVAIDS Viral Hepatitis STD and TB Prevention in Atlanta and the National Center for Health Statistics in Hyattsville Md    and like   on Facebook
