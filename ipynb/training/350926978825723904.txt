Right now  million Americans have Alzheimers disease and other dementias One of them is yearold Pansy Greene Shes in the early stages of Alzheimers and she and her husband Winston want people to know that so far their daily lives have changed little despite the diagnosis They sit side by side on a loveseat in their den each with a dog in his or her lap to cut down on the barking That makes it easier for the Greenes to talk about what they call their journey a term that refers to much more than Pansys struggle with Alzheimers it describes the partnership that began when they met at a party as teenagers He didnt let go of me the whole night recalls Pansy He wouldnt let anybody else dance with me He asked for her phone number I guess I gave it to him she says with a laugh Pansy and Winston Greene got married when she was  and he was  They raised three daughters and spent their entire careers in the aerospace industry Winston worked on the B bomber Pansy worked on the space shuttle They now have the kind of retirement people dream of a comfortable suburban home with a view of the hills north of Los Angeles Its close to two of their daughters grandchildren and greatgrandchildren But one day about three years ago Pansy got lost trying to drive home from a place she went all the time She called her soninlaw and he said Just tell me the cross streets and Ill come and get you  It didnt take him very long so I wasnt that far from home says Pansy but I couldnt find my way out In the early stages of Alzheimers its shortterm memory that goes first Winston noticed that Pansy was forgetting things that had just happened Shed talk to her granddaughter on the phone for example and then the next day when her granddaughter called again Pansy would say Oh my goodness its good talking to you I havent talked to you in a long long time Winston says those were the subtle things that says that maybe there might be a problem But it was a yearlong quest to get a diagnosis The Greenes say the family doctor told Pansy Well youre getting old We all forget things But he gave her a prescription for Aricept a drug that helps with memory loss in Alzheimers patients though it doesnt halt the progression of the disease Eventually she got a firm diagnosis at the University of California Irvine By that time the diagnosis wasnt a shock But when she gave family members the news she was surprised to learn that several relatives  living and dead  also had Alzheimers Everybodys so secretive about everything Pansy says Nobody talks about it I said Nobody told me that our cousin died of Alzheimers  Why are you guys keeping it a secret  So she told all of her family members about her own diagnosis so theyll know where to go and get treatment or get some help if they ever need it Family history isnt Pansys only risk factor Her high blood pressure may have played a role Also AfricanAmericans are roughly twice as likely to get Alzheimers as whites But she doesnt fret over what she cant change Shes focused on doing what she can Its helping me a lot being active she says and doing my crossword puzzles But mostly she reads the Bible It helps me to focus and think The support groups she attends along with Winston also help He says the changes in their life have been small and gradual There are certain things that Pansy was doing that Im doing now Winston says For example hes taken over writing the checks But every so often he says I would say Pansy go in and write the checks and I think I do that just to see if she can still do it the way that she was doing it before And she can But hes had to become more patient If I see that Pansy may forget something I dont have to say Oh well Baby you just told me that  says Winston Thats what I have to really work on myself Instead he tries to say  We put it on the calendar and then I just answer her question Patience is all Pansy asks for Thats all I can do she says And life goes on They still go to the movies and babysit their greatgrandkids And theyre continuing to travel Theyve gone all over the world with a group of friends This fall theyre taking a twoweek river cruise in Russia They had to book it more than a year ago It was a risk But Winston says that one of the keys is you have to have faith And we just had the faith that things would be OK when we go in September Were not  holy rollers but we believe and the faith I think has taken us to where we are today One way Winston maintains his faith in the future is by not thinking about it too much Pansys held her own for three years but he knows that wont last forever I cannot look ahead he says I would go crazy and Im not about to do that Then he laughs We dont need no problems with   in this household The Greenes say theyre taking it a day at a time  and relishing the many longterm memories of the journey theyve shared for nearly  years
