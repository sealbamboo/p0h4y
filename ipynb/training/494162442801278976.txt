Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been warned by the UKs statistics watchdog over claims he made about accident and emergency waiting times in England Sir Andrew Dilnot said Mr Hunt was wrong to claim in the Commons that median waiting times to be seen in AE departments had halved since  He said the health secretary may wish to take advice on whether he should correct the parliamentary record  Labour said that Mr Hunt had been found out making dodgy claims But a government spokesperson said it had simply been a slip of the tongue on Mr Hunts part and that the numbers used by him and the prime minister were accurate The Conservatives and Labour have been involved in an increasingly rancorous fight about each others records on the NHS in recent months with David Cameron and Ed Miliband clashing on the issue on several occasions at Prime Ministers Questions  Sir Andrew chair of the UK Statistics Authority has now responded to a Labour complaint about the use of statistics by the prime minister and Mr Hunt on accident and emergency waiting times in England  Mr Cameron told the Commons on  July that the average wait for an AE assessment had more than halved from  minutes under the Labour government to only  minutes under the coalition  A week later Mr Hunt repeated the same statistic but specifically referred to a median wait  Sir Andrew did not criticise the prime minister but said the health secretary should have used the term mean instead of median  He said the statistics showed that the mean time elapsing before patients were assessed was  minutes in  down from  minutes in  On the other hand the median wait for assessment fell from nine minutes to eight minutes over the same period The mean is calculated by adding up all the numbers and dividing by the number of numbers The median is the number for which half the numbers are above and half below  The debate over waiting times in accident  emergency units in England is already highly charged  and it will be even more so as the election approaches  Thats why a rather dry looking letter from the statistics watchdog Sir Andrew Dilnot has some significance  In essence he is saying the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt was wrong to tell the Commons that median waiting times to be assessed had fallen under this government from  minutes to    What he meant was that the mean had come down over that time   As it turned out the median  seen by some statisticians as more relevant when dealing with data which includes some extreme values  had only come down from nine minutes to eight     Sir Andrew in effect dismisses the relevance of time to assessment in AE  a benchmark used by both the Prime Minister and Mr Hunt   He says that the most complete account of waiting times is time to departure rather than first assessment   On that basis median waits are up from  minutes to   If all this sounds technical it is   But it adds important detail to an intensifying debate to shadow health secretary Andy Burnham circulated to Mr Hunt and Mr Cameron Sir Andrew said data on AE waiting times data was complex with both the median and mean figures being referred to in official statistics But he added Statistics are often described in abbreviated terms particularly during public debate and caveats are not always repeated or indeed possible  However it is important for statistics to be described carefully  Where possible time periods should be specified the source data should be identified and particular care should be taken if the mean and median are substantively different But Mr Burnham said it was not the first time that ministers had been found out making dodgy claims about the NHS in Parliament Sir Andrew Dilnot confirms that waiting times in AE have got worse on this governments watch he claimed But his analysis concludes that things are even worse than we thought with hospital AEs missing the governments lowered target in every quarter for almost two years This is a damning verdict on David Camerons and Jeremy Hunts mismanagement of the NHS and their desperate attempts to paper over the cracks  The gap between their spin and the reality for patients is becoming dangerous
