Having even a small stroke can be a scare Some people recover well while others struggle to talk move or live as they did before Quality of life in the years after a stroke is something thats gotten surprisingly little attention even though socalled   are a common measure for the costeffectiveness of medical treatments Not surprisingly people who were disabled by major strokes reported the worst quality of life a longterm study of stroke patients in England finds But even people who had tiny strokes called   which leave little or no damage in the brain reported lower quality of life years later The issues included anxiety over the risk of future strokes and the hassle of taking anticoagulant drugs like warfarin which require frequent blood tests and careful attention to diet and other drugs The type of stroke people had mattered too People who had   which are caused by blood clots did better than people with hemorrhagic strokes caused by bleeding in the brain The researchers followed  people who had strokes and  who had TIAs for five years afterwards regularly interviewing them about their physical health and quality of life Because strokes become more common as people age the researchers adjusted the data to account for agingrelated problems seen in similar people who didnt have strokes In measuring quality of life the researchers counted both real years lost to an early death and the quality of years lived In the five years after a stroke people lost almost two years of life due to the risk of earlier death and another year due to reduced quality of life  a combined loss of  qualityadjusted life years or QALYs That measure ranged from  qualityadjusted life years lost in severe strokes to  years lost with a minor stroke People with TIAs had  fewer QALYs The main   is clotbusting drugs They must be used immediately after a stroke to benefit and work only with ischemic strokes Hemorrhagic strokes are treated with surgery After a stroke twothirds of people typically get   in an effort to regain function and relearn skills But clearly none of those treatments is providing a return to the quality of life that people had before the stroke or TIA Because stroke takes such a heavy toll on quality of life people should be diligent about stroke prevention says   a senior researcher at the Health Economics Research Center at the University of Oxford and lead author of the study It was published online in   If you want to prevent this try eating a bit more healthy LuengoFernandez told Shots If youre a smoker quit Do a bit more exercise Do all these things to try to prevent having a stroke in the first place Stroke is the fourthleading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of   according to the American Academy of Neurology
