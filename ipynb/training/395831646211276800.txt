Social Security has long been thought of as just part of a retirement plan  along with pensions and savings  but it turns out a lot of people depend on it for most of their income According to the Social Security Administration nearly a quarter of older married couples and almost half of single retirees count on   Gilroy Hain proves thats not an easy life Payday comes on the third Wednesday of the month and Hain  has certain rituals He gets  from Social Security Thats actually more than the average monthly benefit of  Hain takes care of the necessities then splurges just a little on luxuries  though to look at his rented bedroom the word luxury doesnt come to mind Theres no bed He has what he calls his sleeping couch and his sitting couch Theres a desk and some drawers All the furniture came from the ramshackle home of his landlady Myrna Anderson Allen Taking in lodgers is relatively new for her Im losing my jobs because of my age says Allen whos  I needed an additional source of income Hain has been renting a bedroom in her home for about a year His rent is  a month less than half of what an average onebedroom apartment goes for in Los Angeles He kicks in another  for utilities That leaves him with  for everything else But since he doesnt have health insurance or own a car the money goes a long way No problem says Hain Im actually living below my means Thats why renting a car is one of his payday rituals He can afford the  for the car insurance and gas The rental place is near the University of Southern California which happens to be his alma mater Its about   miles away He walks Its a walk he loves Though the neighborhood has seen better days its filled with beautiful old Craftsmanstyle homes And Hain comments on the architecture as he walks noting a faithful renovation here a bad one there Hain is familiar with the finer things He made pretty good money most of his life working in the aerospace industry He never finished his degree at USC but back in the day you could get a job and work your way up Just the fact that I could distinguish a molecule from an atom was enough to get me in the door he says Hain worked for various aerospace and engineering companies around the country The longest he was ever with any one employer was seven years He went from job to job to job until all of a sudden when he was in his s there werent any more jobs for him He drained his meager k account waiting for his job search to pan out It never did As he drives the rental car Hain explains that its part necessity part payday indulgence He uses it for errands and grocery shopping but also for what he calls nostalgia trips Those are monthly excursions to places he used to live in better times Recently he also took a trip to one place he ordinarily wouldnt go Its a busy boulevard next to the Century City shopping mall in West LA He points to a row of trees Thats where he slept after he emptied his k The trees used to be thicker he explains which provided more privacy It was actually almost like little rooms vegetable rooms Hain says There was a branch where I could hang clothes if I needed to let them dewrinkle But I had a regular little setup very neat From there he would walk up the street a couple of blocks to his parttime job at Starbucks He says no one there realized he was homeless I just make a point of crossing the street when I was sure nobody was watching I kind of liked the stealthy thing says Hain And I did it for two years And then he lost that job and went on general relief Thats just a little more than  a month It was a dark time I think I was aware that I was a little bit out of my mind Hain says But Social Security saved him If Social Security hadnt been here it wouldve been quite a different story he says Hain is now even able to save money Its for emergencies  like when he had to replace his eyeglasses  or for a trip to Ikea someday if he gets a place of his own The final payday stop is the grocery store Its too far from where he lives for him to carry all he needs so he uses the car to stock up He says he doesnt make a fixed budget for food I dont actually need to he says I stay within one without writing anything down As he pays the checkout guy smiles and wishes him a great day And though Hain may not be having great days right now just getting by is his success story
