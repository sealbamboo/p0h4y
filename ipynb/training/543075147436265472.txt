here are two narratives in the   inspired by the central bodies one is a story of opportunities and possibilities the other is finding someone to blame While the regulatory beatings are continuing there are signs the positive approach is gaining ground In recent days the   has been choking on its own bile First it had to admit that it had wrongly categorised  GP practices as high risk in ratings it had published for surgeries across England after   and a failure to test the data properly Then on Tuesday the CQC agreed to pay  in   brought by its former deputy chief executive Jill Finney The dispute arose from the investigation by consultants   into the CQCs flawed oversight of University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS foundation trust The regulator found itself driven by media and political pressure into ever more complex investigations built around highlycontested claims and counterclaims It is deplorable that an organisation dedicated to overseeing standards should end up in such a position with one of its own former managers It has at least avoided forming a circular firing squad with Grant Thornton having decided not to pursue the company for a contribution to the costs Meanwhile the regulators continue to acquire scalps The pressure exerted by Monitor on Mark Newbold to quit as chief executive of Heart of England foundation trust shocked managers and clinicians As a respected NHS leader  and one of the highestprofile doctors in a management role  his departure left many feeling vulnerable and will have set back the cause of getting more doctors into management the reputational risk is getting too great Two weeks later the chief executive of Chelsea and Westminster hospital foundation trust Tony Bell announced his departure after a critical CQC report Meanwhile on the sunny side of the street NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens told an   event that his organisation along with Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority are going to establish a   to move struggling health economies rapidly to new models of care outlined in the   This will certainly be tough love and they will not shirk from imposing solutions but it is the beginnings of a framework to do something the current regulatory regime has repeatedly failed at  helping providers and commissioners to get out of a mess Moving to a success regime from a failure regime is more than semantics it is a recognition that many institutional problems are rooted in the failures of systems rather than individuals and they require a wholesystems approach to sorting them out At present the overriding objective for any NHS organisation is to avoid being picked up by the regulators radar Managers know that like some piece of hightech weaponry once a regulator is locked on to you it is perilously difficult to shake them off The success regime offers the possibility of regulators finally being seen as helping solve problems rather than adding to them through micro management The attention on creating multispecialty community providers is an example of how regulators can help change systems Stevens defines these as a group of GP practices coming together with hospital specialists community services nurses and pharmacistsÂ to offer primary and specialist services The role of the regulators here would be to facilitate groundup reform by removing barriers and changing the flows of money to promote the growth of community provision break down the artificial divide between primary and secondary care and emphasise population health and prevention The exhausting rounds of regulatory beatings are demonstrably not delivering the required change   has its place but a narrow focus on individual organisations is the wrong approach Solutionsfocused systems reform is the way to go
