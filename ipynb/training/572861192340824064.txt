In  his onair audition for Kelly Ripas talk show included a playful homage to the movie Magic Mike Strahans athletic dance moves so impressed the movies star Channing Tatum that Strahan will act in the sequel Magic Mike XXL out next summer To prepare Strahan says he is working out a lot harder with heavier weights to build muscles that have to break down when its time to shoot When I was  I had the original bubble butt My brothers called me Bob for booty on back Using Jane Fondas workout tapes I did enough leg lifts to literally work my butt off Thats when I became conscious of the importance of working out and trying to improve my health I am a resident of LA and own a home here After Live on Friday I grab my stuff go to the airport and fly to LA Saturdays are my one day off to have fun and relax In the morning I either play basketball with the fellas or a friend and I drive our Morgan  Wheelers into the mountains of Malibu In my home gym I work out for an hour and before bed get a twohour Swedish massage At  am on Sunday Im in the LA studio Late Sunday I fly back to New York  There I read notes for Mondays Live catch some sleep then head to the studio Early in my career I was  pounds and ate anything I could get my hands on Not anymore I try to find little things that will have a big effect on my diet and help stave off health issues I gave up sodas and lost  pounds Now I drink lots of water For almost a year I have been taking Metamucil powder three times a day The fiber fills me up and helps lower cholesterol and steady blood sugar levels  something my parents fight My trainer Latreal Mitchell also does my nutrition She cooks for me so I have the energy to stay focused all day Eighty percent of the time I eat clean But I still like and occasionally eat ice cream and cookies With Latreals guidance I mostly choose fresh foods They are active kids When they are with their mother they live on a farm and do chores They care for three horses two dogs and nine cats They also rescue dogs At school they run track When theyre with me they swim do pushups and jumping jacks I dont let them lift weights They run after me through a makeshift obstacle course like two ducklings following the daddy duck I love watching them It reminds me of working out with my dad Great The bodys meant to be active When Im tired exercise gives me energy I feel better now than when I was  Instead of embracing getting older many people use age to limit themselves I have friends with parents in their s or s They move fine They drive Theyre on Facebook Twitter and Instagram Each is active  physically and mentally I hope I can maintain that
