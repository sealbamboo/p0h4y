Now imagine what could happen when the  million uninsured Americans  many of whom have never had any experience with health insurance  are confronted with having to choose a plan to meet the requirements of Obamacare next year Insurance is fundamentally complicated said George Loewenstein a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University and a coauthor of the study I have a PhD in economics and I consult with insurance companies but there are elements I cant understand so it didnt surprise when I saw the average person struggle with these terms Not knowing these terms can be expensive   We know from other research that people make disastrously bad insurance choices because they dont understand this basic language Loewenstein said  I seriously hope people will ask for help and can find good advice on finding the plan that is right for them Here are some terms you may want to learn before you dive into a decision about your health insurance for next year  This information is compiled from the   and   guidance on terms    The amount you owe before your health insurance benefits kick in For example if your deductible is  your insurance wont pay for anything until your costs are more than    A copayment or copay is the amount the insured person pays every time he or she receives a health service  For instance if your copay to see a doctor is  you pay that amount each time you see him or her  The insurance takes care of the rest   Your part of the costs of a health service that is covered by insurance It is calculated as a percentage and you pay it in addition to whatever deductible you may owe  For example if your plan allows  for a doctor visit and youve already met your deductible your coinsurance payment of  would be   The insurance plan picks up the rest of the cost     The most you pay during the period of your policy most policies go for a year before your insurance plan begins to pay  of the allowed amount  This total does not include your balancebilled charges your premium or the health care services your plan doesnt cover Some plans dont count the outofnetwork payments coinsurance payments copayments other expenses or deductibles toward this amount so read the plan instructions carefully     The amount you must pay for your insurance plan     The bill you or your doctor or health care provider submits to your health insurance company   This may also be called an eligible expense or negotiated rate or payment allowance It is the maximum amount on which payment is based for health care services that are covered by your insurance    An innetwork provider is a health care office that has contracted with the health insurance company to provide services for people on that insurance plan  An outofnetwork provider is someone who does not have such a relationship with the insurance company  Typically insurance will only cover the cost of services from health care providers who are innetwork     This is the set of health care services that must be covered by certain plans  starting in   There are  categories in which insurance plans must provide services and items Maternity and newborn care prescription drugs rehabilitative services and devices lab services ambulatory patient services emergency services hospitalization wellness and preventive services chronic disease management and pediatric services that include vision and oral care     Routine health care that includes regular checkups patient counseling and screenings to prevent disease illness and other health complications
