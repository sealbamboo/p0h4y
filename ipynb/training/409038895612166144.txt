If you want to eat a more healthful diet youre going to have to shell out more cash right After all Whole Foods didnt get the nickname Whole Paycheck for nothing But until recently that widely held bit of conventional wisdom hadnt really been assessed in a rigorous systematic way says   a cardiologist and epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health So he and his colleagues decided to pore over  studies from  different developed countries that looked at the retail prices of food grouped by healthfulness Across these countries it turns out the cost difference between eating a healthful and unhealthful diet was pretty much the same about  per day And that price gap held true when they focused their research just on US food prices the researchers found in their   of these studies I think  a day is probably much less than some people expected Mozaffarian tells The Salt but its also a real barrier for some lowincome families for whom it would translate to about an extra  a year Still from a policy perspective he argues  a day is chump change Thats the cost of a cup of coffee he says Its trivial compared to the cost of heart disease or diabetes which is hundreds of billions of dollars  both in terms of health care costs and lost productivity And so that relatively small difference he says should really be an incentive for policymakers to find ways to help lowincome families bridge that extra  per day The researchers evaluated the cost of food by types of eating pattern  for example a diet heavy on vegetables nuts and fruits like the Mediterranean diet versus one rich in processed foods and meat They also looked at price differences within specific food categories such as grains proteins fats and dairy The biggest price differences arose when it came to proteinsmeats Healthier leaner cuts they found were on average about  cents more per serving Only one of the studies included in the metaanalysis examined the cost of restaurant foods stratified by healthfulness  and thats definitely an area the authors say where more research is needed The research published this week in the   comes as House and Senate negotiators on Capitol Hill are debating a new farm bill  including billions of dollars in cuts to the federal foodassistance program formerly known as food stamps Its now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP This study couldnt come at a more relevant time says Josh Wachs chief strategy officer for   His group teaches lowincome families who rely on foodassistance programs like SNAP how to navigate the supermarket to make better choices on a tight budget  tips like buying frozen and canned fruits and vegetables when fresh is too expensive or teaching them how to cut up a whole chicken which costs less than buying individual breasts wings and other parts separately Another key tip When comparing two items focus on the price per unit rather than the total price We believe that education can help put healthy food in reach for many more families Wachs tells The Salt But subsidies for such education programs provided through SNAP could also be imperiled if the programs funding is cut he says And even for those of us who arent working under supertight budget constraints at the grocery store the results of the metaanalysis are eyeopening says Mozaffarian Just as an excuse to not eat healthy he says for most Americans I think price is not an excuse
