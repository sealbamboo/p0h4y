Almost every time reporters go out on assignment they run across something unexpected that they just cant fit into the story theyre working on When science correspondent Joe Palca and producer Rebecca Davis were in Boston reporting on a boy with a rare form of cancer they found themselves in the office of   a business dedicated to making artificial eyes Joe and Rebecca spoke with Joyce and Eric Jahrling two of the four Jahrlings who work at this family firm and learned some surprising things about making prosthetic eyes  and what its like to wear them What follows is an edited version of their adventure   Joe gets squeamish when he has to talk about eyes  he says its something to do with eye surgery he had when he was a small child So Im going to jump in when things get what Joe calls icky  And I promise I wont get too icky because I cant handle it Anyway we were in Boston to tell the story of a young boy named Noah Shaw He was born with a rare eye cancer called retinoblastoma and as part of his treatment he had to have an eye removed Well that surgery was five years ago Noah is now a healthy yearold and wearing a false eye is normal for him  no big deal But because hes still growing he has to get a new eye made from time to time  So we got to go with Noah and his parents Bryan and Elizabeth Shaw for the fitting And the thing that surprised both of us was about the shape of that artificial eye  Yeah I thought that a fake eye would be round  Thats only in the movies when it rolls down the planks  These fake eyes are actually small curved bits of plastic  kind of like a contact lens  and theyre slipped under the eyelids of the missing eye Thats how theyre held in place  And watching the Jahrlings make these prosthetics as they are officially known is really like watching an artist at work  Im making my own acrylic paints This is a raw plastic  Hes using a fine brush to paint what looks like a near perfect replica of Noahs existing eye  When hes done at the workbench he calls Noah over  OK lets take a look at your face mister I think you need a little bit more gold in there  Eric takes the eye back to his workbench Hes got a bit more painting to do he wants to make the pupil a little bigger he wants to add some tiny red threads to that will look like blood vessels  At an earlier appointment Erics sister Joyce took a mold of Noahs actual socket where his eye used to be  I usually do the impression of the eye socket like they take impressions of your mouth Same gel No flavor But you dont gag  So Eric is done touching up the eye and Joyce comes over to see how it looks on Noah  Hows that feel  Good  Let me see Let me see Chin way up there Not bad  Joe I was really surprised that you asked Joyce how to take the eye back out again  Yes I was pretty proud of myself  You can use your fingers to take it out You have a suction cup Or we even say the third method is the wooden mallet to the back of the head  We heard a lot of that kind of dark humor when doing this story especially from Noahs parents  Oh thats so true Noahs parents have these amazing stories about things that happen when your child has a fake eye  So one of the most common things when we got the first eye is sometimes it would rotate  degrees and so the pupil would be looking like it was staring down below the lid further than you could normally even move your eye and it would just look creepy It would look way creepier than if the eye was even gone  Bryan calls that the zombie rotation And they also told us that Noah got really good at taking his eye out  He would always take it out when he first got it and chew on it  And he used to play this little game with his mom and dad Theyd put him down for bed then theyd leave the room And a few minutes later Noah would take his eye out and throw it on the ground It sounded like an MM hitting the hardwood floor And then of course Mom and Dad would go rushing back into the room which would make Noah terribly happy  And then there was the time that Noah took his eye out when they were on a city bus  I didnt realize it until after I got off the bus and looked at him and I was like Oh my gosh your eye is gone  She put an ad on Craigslist It said Lost Prosthetic Eye And then she put in parentheses Its not a sphere and she held up a picture like the old one Elizabeth I had a picture of what it looked like and finally I called the MBTA mass transit and I said I think my sons eye might be on your bus  A few days later the mass transit folks knocked on Elizabeths door and said Excuse me maam is this yours
