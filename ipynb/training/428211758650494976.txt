A review is to be carried out of the major incident declared at Royal Victoria Hospitals accident and emergency department  Stormont Health Minister Edwin Poots told the assembly the Health and Social Care Board would carry out the review  The teams membership and terms of reference are being finalised he said  Earlier this month the RVH in Belfast declared a major incident with staff and patients saying conditions were horrendous  Belfast Health Trust said the move was necessary to trigger more staff to come in to help clear a backlog of patients  Mr Poots told the assembly on Tuesday The trust has an ongoing programme of reform to improve its service and the specific learning from this incident including modification of the trusts escalation plan in order to minimise the likelihood of having to instigate such measures again he added  There will continue to be periods of pressure in all our emergency departments throughout the winter  The Belfast Trust and the Royal Victoria Hospital in the three days that led to the emergency plan being put in place had  admissions to hospital In the same three days last year they had  admissions  In truth the problem didnt exist in the emergency department  the problem existed in that people were not being taken out of the emergency department to other parts of the hospital
