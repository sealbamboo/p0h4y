In speedy testing conducted as West Africas Ebola epidemic began to mushroom researchers have found that ZMapp the experimental drug that has been used in seven infected human patients to date prompted the recovery of  macaque monkeys infected with the virus Even when treatment with ZMapp was initiated five days after infection  a point at which researchers describe the sick monkeys as being three days away from death  the experimental biologic therapy reversed the bleeding rashes and elevated liver enzymes that are Ebolas hallmark symptoms and drove the virus to insignificant levels Three infected macaques that did not get ZMapp were dead within eight days The trial of the drug in nonhuman primates  the second yet conducted  was performed in April and May by Gary P Kobinger of the Canadian Public Health Agencys national laboratory for zoonotic diseases and special pathogens In the time the research was performed the World Health Organization estimated that deaths from the rapidly evolving outbreak rose from  in Guinea alone to more than  in Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea In authoring the study Kobinger was joined by a number of scientists from the San Diegobased biotechnology company MappBio that designed and developed ZMapp The   published Friday in the British journal Nature was conducted using a strain of the Ebola virus different from that circulating in West Africa today But Kobinger said the cloned antibodies at the heart of ZMapp appear to recognize and bind to both strains of the virus and predicted it would work in those infected with either strain In a preliminary test of the medicine against the circulating strain said Kobinger ZMapp performed as well if not better than it did on the version of the virus found earlier in Zaire In a call with reporters Friday morning Kobinger called the results fantastic news The finding strongly supports the hope that the experimental serum will rescue humans as well even days after they have fallen ill The progression of Ebola infection in macaques appears to be extremely close to what we think is happening in humans added Kobinger The evidence presented here suggests that ZMapp offers the best option of the experimental therapeutics currently in development for treating EBOVinfected patients the authors concluded We hope that initial safety tests in humans will be undertaken soon preferably within the next few months to enable the compassionate use of ZMapp as soon as possible they added The latest experiment used a slightly altered form of ZMapp than was used in a published  study and higher doses of the ZMapp medication than have been seen in earlier animal experiments Six animals started a nineday threedose course of the medication three days after being infected with Ebola And two other groups of six started the same threedose course on postinfection day four and five Most of the monkeys were evidently ill as early as three days after infection  they had begun to eat and drink less and become feverish and the virus was detectable in their blood By day five their symptoms were more pronounced said Kobinger In humans infected with Ebola the average progression of the disease from infection to death has been  to  days Kobinger said While its difficult to infer a timeline for humans from that seen in macaques he speculated that animals getting the medication five days after infection might be at a similar stage in the illnesss progression as humans at nine to  days after they had been exposed In macaques the treatment showed no signs of causing harmful or bothersome side effects But the Nature study did report that in preliminary animal testing infected macaques whose infection had progressed to the point where it was present in the central nervous system were not rescued by ZMapp Thomas Geisbert a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston called the drugs success at treating gravely ill monkeys a monumental achievement But it remains unknown whether ZMapp was responsible for the recovery of two US aid workers who received it in Liberia Geisbert wrote in a   published with the study So far about  of patients stricken with Ebola have survived even without ZMapp and two others who got the drug have died he noted Given the extreme supply limitations of the ZMapp medication Kobinger said the next urgent question for researchers will be whether smaller or fewer dosesor doses that are tailored to a patients viral loadmight work to reverse infection with the Ebola virus MappBio says that its stocks are completely exhausted and Kobinger said it may be months before more is available But Kobinger said Friday he would not expect a single dose to lead to recovery The antibodies in ZMapp are really buying time he said allowing the immune system to catch up with and overtake the Ebola virus replication In many cases we need the second dose he added
