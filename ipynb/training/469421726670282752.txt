specialist a few towns over informed him that he might not survive the year he asked for the closest transplant center  The closest transplant center was ours and it was more than  miles away Undaunted he and his wife drove to and from our hospital every day for more than a week for the testing and consultations necessary to determine if he could tolerate the radical operation and manage the complex postoperative care of a transplant Depending on the traffic the journey could take half a day so the patient and his wife quickly figured out the best hours and routes to minimize their travel time Forget about the new liver he joked after finally being placed on the transplant waiting list Im ready for a new car Almost a year later a liver became available for the man But because the liver was already on ice there were only a few hours before it would deteriorate to the point at which it would no longer work Our transplant coordinators immediately began making preparations to bring the patient in assemble the surgical team and start the operation that would remove his old diseased liver to make room for the new  But the man never got the transplant Living as far away as they did he and his wife couldnt get to our hospital fast enough  A few months later he died from liver failure He and the other patients I have known like him came to mind when I read a   on how policies restricting care to specialized regional centers can affect patient outcomes Following the ageold adage that practice makes perfect such policies limit where patients can undergo certain complex treatments or procedures to the centers that have the expertise to do them most efficiently Patients end up being channeled to those centers which in turn helps the clinicians there become even more adept and swift thus ensuring quality of care and potentially significant cost savings as well It appears to be a winning situation for both doctors and patients Not surprisingly   and   with the support of   have embraced centralized care covering  certain procedures only if they are performed at selected highvolume institutions   to greater clinician experience has helped to support these regulations with   the threshold number of procedures after which an institution might have better mortality rates  Even if patients have to travel far from home   that the improvement in quality and decrease in cost more than makes up for the separation from friends and family  There   however They contend that patients who live far away from these socalled centers of excellence might not be as likely to get the care they need and as a result could fare worse than patients who live close by  But few insurers or payers have paid heed to these assertions While there is an evergrowing body of research that supports regionalizing care   that geographic concentration of expertise leads to disparities For the critics to prove their point they would need to show the impact of limiting a potentially lifeordeath treatment to a handful of centers in the context of a large even national health care system And such a system did not seem to exist Now a group of researchers from Philadelphia appears to have found one And   not only confirms what critics have long feared but also reveals how even the most selfevident policy choices can have unforeseen and potentially devastating consequences The   established in  is the largest integrated health care system in the United States providing care to more than eight million veterans every year When the Philadelphia researchers did their study there were  five VA centers approved for liver transplants for patients with endstage liver disease   Houston Nashville Pittsburgh Portland Ore and Richmond Va Two more have since been added in Miami and Madison Wis While veterans who have secondary insurance like Medicare can go elsewhere for their transplant those who have only VA benefits must except in rare emergencies undergo their operation at one of those VA transplant centers The researchers combed through the records of the over  veterans administration patients who were classified as eligible for a liver transplant from  to  and found that almost  had been placed on the waiting list for transplant at one of the five transplant centers But the farther those patients lived from a VA transplant center the less likely they were to be on the waiting list And if they did manage to get on the list they were less likely to receive a transplant compared with patients who lived closer  Furthermore the farther they lived from the center the more likely they were to die waiting for a transplant Centralizing care concentrated expertise but it also isolated certain populations said Dr David Seth Goldberg lead author and an instructor in medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania In this case the Midwest became a black hole  Although the study uncovered an unintended consequence of  consolidating liver transplant care for veterans the findings have important implications outside the VA system Such consolidation of complex procedures is occurring in other health care systems too  and   of treatment centers are eerily similar to the map of VA liver transplant centers  While Dr Goldberg and his coauthors acknowledge that costly treatments cannot be offered everywhere they do believe that health care systems should begin to consider not only population density but also potential geographic barriers when regionalizing care  If the goal is to make treatment available to all sectors of the population Dr Goldberg said we need to look at maps when developing these sites and not just population density Geography matters
