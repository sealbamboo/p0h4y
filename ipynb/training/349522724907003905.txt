Women of all ages will soon be able to buy emergency contraceptives over the counter without a prescription now that the Obama administration has decided to stop fighting a judges order to make the drugs more easily available But better access to emergency contraception doesnt necessarily reduce rates of unintended pregnancy   has found Why thats so remains unclear although researchers have some ideas About half of all pregnancies in the United States are not planned and rates of unintended pregnancy are   among teenagers Unintended pregnancies can cause health problems for mother and child because the woman may not be in the best of health and may not get timely prenatal care Last week the Food and Drug Administration   that women younger than  will no longer be required to have a doctors prescription to get emergency contraceptives Women and teenage girls will be able to buy the Plan B OneStep version of the medication without showing an ID This   should increase use of the contraceptives which delay or inhibit ovulation and must generally be taken within three days of unprotected sex One prescriptiononly pill extends that time frame to five days Although making emergency contraceptives easier to get may help individual women buy them it may not affect the rates of unintended pregnancy rates overall Why is that Several studies have shown that even when emergency contraceptives are made more available and financial barriers are removed theres no impact on unintended pregnancy says   chair of the committee on underserved women for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and a professor at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine Part of the explanation is that women dont use emergency contraceptives every time they have unprotected sex says Espey Another reason is that estimates of the effectiveness of some types of emergency contraceptive pills   They prevent up to twothirds of pregnancies  not all of them Although its not as often discussed the most effective form of emergency contraception is an intrauterine device Inserted following unprotected intercourse an IUD can prevent  percent of pregnancies IUDs are also effective at preventing pregnancy more routinely Once inserted IUDs provide protection for up to  years But IUDs have to be inserted by a doctor or other health care professional Emergency contraception does require some sort of gametime decision says Bill Albert chief program officer at the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy Thats the great advantage of longacting IUDs You set it and forget it
