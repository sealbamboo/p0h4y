The NHS in England has repeatedly missed a key target for rapidly treating cancer patients official figures show At least  of them should start treatment within  days of a GP referral for suspected cancer  Between July and September    the third quarter in a row the target was missed Cancer charities said thousands of patients were being failed and Labour said the figures were a scandal Early diagnosis and treatment is vital for improving the odds of recovering from cancer  The NHS has a series of targets to ensure this happens  Some are being met including the twoweek wait target for getting  of patients to see a specialist within a fortnight of a GP referral  But of the  people who started cancer treatment between July and September more than  were not treated within the  day target For the past three quarters respectively just   and  of patients have been treated on time  Breakdowns for individual cancers in the previous quarter show the proportion of patients treated on time Sarah Woolnough from Cancer Research UK said This isnt just about missed targets  consecutive breaches mean thousands of patients are being failed  Todays figures show that more than a third of all NHS trusts in England have breached the day target These targets exist to ensure swift diagnosis of cancer and access to treatment which is vital if were serious about having the best survival rates in the world  Patients want confidence that suspected cancer is taken seriously and prioritised by the NHS  These breaches have become a trend and they are worsening which is why urgent action must be taken to support the NHS Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said Prime Minister David Cameron has cut the cancer budget by m in real terms while his topdown NHS reorganisation disrupted cancer services  As a result he is now failing to meet his own cancer target He has left families facing anxious waits for cancer tests and treatment and his complacency is becoming dangerous  When it comes to cancer speed is everything Labour is committed to cancer tests and results within one week to help end this scandal Health Minister Earl Howe said We inherited the worst cancer survival rates in Western Europe but as the ONS Office for National Statistics says outcomes for many types of cancer are now improving and in fact survival rates have never been higher Were referring  more patients for cancer treatment than  and have invested bn in better early diagnosis and treatment to make progress towards our ambition to be the best country for cancer care in Europe Dr Giles Maskell the president of the Royal College of Radiologists told the BBC One of the most important factors in causing these targets to be missed is the delays in imaging reporting  Patients are waiting too long for imaging test results and the latest statistics released by NHS England may illustrate this impact  The main obstacle to achieving faster imaging tests and results is the severe shortage of radiologists in the UK compared with other western European countries in the long term this chronic shortfall can only be addressed by training and recruiting more radiologists
