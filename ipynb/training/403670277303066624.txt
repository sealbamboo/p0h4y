Americans have not always been in love with nuts Think about it Theyre loaded with calories and fat Plus they can be expensive But Americans views  and eating habits  when it comes to nuts are changing Fast Theres a growing body of scientific evidence thats putting a health halo over supermarkets expanding nut aisles Earlier this year a large   concluded that people who eat a Mediterraneanstyle diet supplemented with daily portions of nuts and olive oil have significantly lower risks of heart attacks and strokes And just last month more evidence emerged that snacking on nuts   which may stave off weight gain Now a new study published in the   finds that people in the habit of eating a daily handful a ounce serving of nuts are more likely to live longer compared with people who rarely consume nuts The preponderance of evidence suggests a health benefit from eating nuts says researcher   of the DanaFarber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School To isolate the association between nut consumption and lifespan Fuchs and his colleagues combined data from two longterm studies that include about  women and  men The participants in the study completed food frequency surveys every two to four years over several decades They answered all kinds of questions about dozens of different kinds of foods including how many servings of nuts they consumed What we find is that regular nut consumers have about a  percent reduction in allcause mortality over the course of the study Fuchs says This includes lower death rates from heart disease and cancer Now since death is inevitable for all of us heres another way to think about the findings Men and women who were regularly munching on peanuts or tree nuts like almonds pecans and walnuts in their s and s when the study began were significantly more likely to reach their s compared with folks who didnt eat nuts So how could a daily handful of nuts possibly be so beneficial Fuchs says its not entirely clear What we think nuts do is that they affect metabolism he explains Prior research has shown that nuts help us feel fuller faster And nuts also help control blood sugar Fuchs says if nuts lead to a sense of satiety and help people eat less many of the other benefits may follow This could reduce the risk of diabetes and also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease he says Of course this study does not prove a cause and effect between eating nuts and living longer The design of this type of longterm observational study only enables researchers to establish an association  a link Going forward researchers want to try to better understand what might explain this link They want to know more about how the combination of beneficial plant compounds and minerals  such as magnesium fiber and protein  found in nuts may be influencing the body With all the good news about nuts in the news experts who track food trends say more Americans are eating them Nuts are in the perfect spot right now says   of Mintel The market research firm estimates that sales of nuts and dried fruit in the US will grow from about  billion in annual sales in  to over  billion by  Nuts check a lot of boxes that young adults are looking for Theyre high in protein theyre easy to grab and eat on the go and theyre a natural plantbased food Im a vegetarian so nuts are an important part of my diet for added protein shopper Emily Williams told me as she added nuts to her shopping cart at a Trader Joes in Washington DC Many grocery stores expanding nut aisles now include lots of variety  everything from darkchocolatecovered almonds to spicy Asianflavorinfused nuts And Frank says millennials love the variety Young adults arent just snacking on nuts  increasingly theyre tossing them in salads and sprinkling them in yogurt and cereal One note about the   study on nuts The major part of the study was funded by the National Institutes of Health The researchers also accepted a grant from the International Tree Nut Council Nutrition Research and Education Foundation to cover the cost of analyzing the data The nut council approved the grant without any knowledge of the results says Fuchs And there was an agreement that the researchers would have reported the findings no matter what the results showed
