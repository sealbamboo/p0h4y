Say your onemonthold baby is spitting up and crying a lot Your usual bag of infantsoothing tricks hasnt worked and youre worried that theres something wrong with her So you head to the pediatrician who tells you that your otherwise healthy child has gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD Would receiving this medical diagnosis make you more interested in giving her drugs than if you never heard the word disease Yes according to   published online Monday in   Researchers asked  parents visiting a pediatric clinic in Michigan about how they would respond to one of four hypothetical scenarios about a crying regurgitating baby Everyone got the same basic description of what was happening but some parents were told that the child had GERD while others heard no mention of a disease In addition half were told that the drug wasnt likely going to help the symptomswhile the rest were not given any information on effectiveness Parents who had the GERD label applied to the infants symptoms were more likely to be interested in drugs even when they were specifically told that they probably wouldnt work Its important for both patients and doctors to know the powers that these labels have says   an author of the study and an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Missouri The authors used GERD in their scenario because theres   that it is being overdiagnosed and overtreated with medications including   in babies Prescriptions to treat GERD are on the rise but theres no evidence that they help infants who are just fussy and spitting up a lot The drugs might help severe cases confirmed by endoscopy the authors said Part of the problem may be confusion about the difference between normal spitting up and GERD which is a more serious problem involving acidic reflux that damages the lining of the esophagus Spitting up can be a symptom but GERD has to be confirmed by endoscopy the authors said Frequent spitting up affects about half of babies under six months and is the result of an inefficient valve at the top of the stomach says   a clinical professor of pediatrics at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia who wrote a   accompanying the study Its almost always completely benign and goes away spontaneously usually between six and  months of age he says In addition to concern over babies being unnecessarily medicated labeling a child as sick can make parents worry long after the symptoms have ceased he says There can be an enduring unease about the possibility that the child is not entirely alright he says Parents should look beyond the label and listen to all the information that the doctor is telling you about the condition and possible treatments says Scherer
