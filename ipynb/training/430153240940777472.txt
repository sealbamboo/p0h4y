It sounds like a scene from a trashy sex comedy But stories of getting stuck during sex have been with us for centuries  and some of them might just be true An emergency trip to hospital is never pleasant but its certainly not something you would want to happen after sex  Its not the most romantic ending a couple can imagine says Dr Aristomenis Exadaktylos author of a study of  years of admissions to his hospital in Bern Switzerland He and his coauthors found plenty of patients who had experienced problems after sex  migraines heart problems even amnesia But asked on the BBCs Health Check radio programme if he had come across a case of the womans vagina clamping on to the mans penis he said No  and added that the idea was probably an urban myth Two listeners however wrote in to dispute this I must tell you it is no myth wrote one woman who asked to remain anonymous It happened to my late husband and myself one night He literally could not withdraw ie was stuck I attributed it to the intensity of the vaginal muscle response during orgasm Another correspondent who asked to be referred to simply as John grew up near an airport in southern England I remember hearing a story when I was  or  about an American airman who got stuck inside a lady and they had to get an ambulance and get them to a hospital to get them parted he says  John eventually joined the merchant navy and started an onoff relationship with a woman in Japan On one occasion he and his partner were having very enjoyable sex when he suddenly found that he couldnt withdraw Proceedings came to a halt and we decided that wed better separate he recalls It took two or three minutes of fumbling and laughing  the experience wasnt painful for either of them John who is now  has never before spoken about the incident and it was never repeated Dr John Dean a senior UKbased sexual physician says that both accounts are credible examples of a rare phenomenon that doctors sometimes call penis captivus captive penis  When the penis is in the vagina it becomes increasingly engorged he says giving his hypothesis of what causes the problem The muscles of the womans pelvic floor contract rhythmically at orgasm While those muscles contract the penis becomes stuck and further engorged Finally the vaginal muscles relax the blood flows out of the penis and the man can withdraw Many dogowners will have seen their pets getting stuck during copulation which breeders refer to as a tie However there are distinct anatomical reasons for this according to Peggy Root an expert in animal reproduction at the University of Minnesota A dogs penis has a compartment which fills with blood after intercourse has begun effectively locking the male in place  Dr Dean says that several of his patients have discussed with him their experience of getting stuck over the years more out of curiosity than because it was a major problem He draws a distinction between penis captivus and the more common and serious condition of vaginismus in which a womans vaginal muscles contract involuntarily preventing intercourse  Two reviews of the history of penis captivus published in  and  highlight the publics longstanding fascination with it In  Geoffrey de La TourLandry related how a voluptuary named Pers Lenard delt fleshely with a woman on top of an altar of a church and God tyed hem faste togedre dat night The following day the whole town saw the couple still entwined fast like a dogge and biche togedre Finally prayers were spoken and the couples prolonged intercourse came to an end although they were obliged to return to the church on three Sundays strip naked and beat themselves in front of the congregation Captivus features in several other medieval myths and stories which F Kraupl Taylor the author of   believes may bear only a tenuous connection with the actual facts  He is similarly sceptical about an account from  about an event in Warsaw in the s which ended with a double suicide This time penis captivus afflicted lovers trysting in a garden after closing time and the couple were only separated when the woman was put under anaesthetic But the real tragedy came after journalists  in their greed for sensational facts  published the story The next day two revolver shots put an end to the mental sufferings of the two lovers the story goes In his  book The Sexual Life of our Time Iwan Bloch recounted another case of penis captivus following on from a furtive meeting this time in a quiet corner of the docks in Bremen Germany The woman underwent an involuntary spasm the man  a dock labourer  became trapped and a great crowd gathered to watch Eventually the couple were carted off to a hospital chloroform was administered to the woman and they were freed  In a  manual of gynaecology the author Walter Stoeckel speculated that penis captivus only affected couples engaged in illicit sex the fear of detection presumably contributing to the force of the womans muscular spasm  This opinion is no longer held by experts but the narrative of a clandestine meeting followed by public humiliation continues Recent media reports of penis captivus  in Kenya Malawi  Zimbabwe and the Philippines  all concern adulterous couples  The Kenyan incident in  supposedly occurred after the cuckolded husband paid a visit to a witch doctor It was reported that the couple regained their liberty after prayers  and after the cheating man promised to pay the husband  Kenyan shillings  He was filmed going to an ATM to withdraw the money  The Zimbabwean media reported last year that a woman was bringing a law case against her longterm boyfriend for putting runyoka on her  a fidelity spell that caused her to get stuck on her lover    she was demanding compensation from the jealous boyfriend for humiliating her and trying to control how she should use her private part But there are several accounts of penis captivus taking place within a marriage including two unsensational case studies from th Century German gynaecologists  Perhaps the best verified example of the phenomenon also occurred during marriage After the Kraupl Taylor review was published the British Medical Journal received a letter from Dr Brendan Musgrave recalling an incident in  from his days as a house doctor at the Royal Isle of Wight County Hospital I can distinctly remember the ambulance drawing up and two young people a honeymoon couple I believe being carried on a single stretcher into the casualty department he wrote This account was corroborated by another doctor who had been on duty at the time Dr John Dean says that he cant explain this very unusual story since people experiencing captivus generally have trouble disengaging for only a few seconds  But he adds If youre in that position that probably feels like an eternity  or
