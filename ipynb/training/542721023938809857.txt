Radiation treatment for breast cancer could take less time and cost less for many women but doctors arent putting that knowledge into practice a study finds And one reason is that the doctors in charge of radiation treatment will make less money according to   a study author and chairman of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania For women as patients its much better to have the shorter course Emanuel told Shots They get done with radiation four weeks early and for society its less expensive The only person its not good for is the radiation oncologist I think its a challenge for them Radiation is a standard treatment for women with early stage breast cancer who have had a lumpectomy its good at killing cancer cells missed by surgery It typically takes five weeks to seven weeks five days a week But clinical trials of using fewer treatments but higher doses in each visit found it to be just as effective That typically takes three weeks In  the American Society for Radiation Oncology  the shorter course saying its equally effective for inbreast tumor control and comparable in longterm side effects with the conventional treatment especially for women over  who havent had chemotherapy or lymph node involvement And last year the society made considering shorter treatment schedules its No  priority as part of the   to reduce unnecessary medical treatments That has worked Since  the number of women getting the shorter course of radiation called hypofractionated whole breast irradiation has risen from about  percent to  percent in women over  the   finds It was published Wednesday in   the journal of the American Medical Association The share of women doing shorter treatments who werent in that group also rose from  percent to  percent Not bad you might think But other countries have embraced shortcourse radiation much more rapidly with  to  percent of eligible women getting the accelerated treatments That may be because those countries have a shortage of radiation facilities If they have to use the machine less for particular patients they can take in more patients in a timely way he says Whereas here we have an oversupply of radiation oncology facilities And those facilities need to make money In the   paper Emanuel and his colleagues found that insurers paid  more for radiation treatment for women who had conventional radiation an average of  compared with  Thats not a trivial amount of money per patient Emanuel says Patients outofpocket expenses were about the same Radiation oncologists have worried that getting the same amount of radiation in a compressed time frame may have longterm toxic effects but four randomized trials with at least  years of followup have found similar cancer control and cosmetic benefit And a  survey of women found them twice as likely to prefer the shorter treatment Other studies have found that radiation treatments can be difficult for lowincome women to manage because of the need to take time off from work and for child care Having the radiation oncologists professional society say that the shorter course should be the default option would help speed the transition Emanuel says So would having private insurers and Medicare switch to a bundled or reference payment so theyre not automatically paying more for the longer course I think patients and breast cancer advocates need to take a stand on this Emanuel says Its better for patients and docs need to put their patients first
