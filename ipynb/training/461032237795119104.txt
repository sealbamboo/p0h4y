Camels are almost certainly the source of the MERS virus that is on the upswing again across the Middle East researchers reported on Tuesday A countrywide survey of camels shows many   are infected with a strain genetically almost identical to the strain thats infecting people a team at Columbia University King Saud University and the EcoHealth Alliance reported The World Health Organization has expressed alarm about the increase in reports of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome MERS WHO reports more than  confirmed cases and  deaths since the virus was identified in  But Saudi Arabia reported more cases over the weekend taking the reported total to more than  with more than  deaths The researchers ran genetic tests on virus taken from nasal swabs of the animals who seem untroubled by it Given these new data we are now investigating potential routes for human infection through exposure to camel milk or meat products says Abdulaziz Alagaili of King Saud University who worked on the study published in the journal mBio Last week  a springtime surge in MERS cases The virus has infected people in Jordan Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia Egypt the United Arab Emirate France Germany Greece Italy Britain Tunisia Malaysia and the Philippines The number of cases sharply increased since midMarch  WHO says in its latest advisory But it also notes that most people are infected by other people not directly by camels More individuals are likely to be infected until the mode of transmission is determined and preventive measures implemented to break transmission from the source to humans WHO added People are only infected with a few different genetic types of MERS while camels seem to carry many different types says Thomas Briese associate director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia The narrow range of MERS viruses in humans and a very broad range in camels may explain in part why the human disease is uncommon because only a few genotypes are capable of crossspecies transmission he said Although there is no evidence that MERS is becoming more transmissible the recent increase in reported cases is a cause for concern added Columbias Dr Ian Lipkin whos been directing the work MERS first showed up in  when it killed an elderly Saudi man It  because its related to severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS which swept around the world in  infecting around  people and killing close to  before it was stopped Both conditions are caused by coronaviruses members of a family of viruses that usually cause common cold symptoms and that infect a wide range of mammals The virus can survive on surfaces and might spread when people touch something contaminated SARS appears to have spread that way and many other viruses do too
