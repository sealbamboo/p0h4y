linical commissioning is in urgent need of a new sense of direction and purpose as it faces the spectre of yet another round of reorganisation after the    into the workings of clinical commissioning groups CCG concludes that the future of the clinical role in commissioning remains fragile Interest from CCG leaders is waning and they do not have the time money or management support to do their jobs properly While the media is inevitably focused on problems in hospitals the commissioning system is also under unsustainable pressure They have always been underresourced and now many of them will be cocommissioning primary care from April with no extra cash or staff after   there is no possibility of additional administrative resources for taking on that role Instead CCGs have been helpfully advised to adopt pragmatic and flexible local solutions to running primary care commissioning which presumably translates as overstretched staff teams taking on more work This is not a trivial point The risk of conflicts of interest still looms over this whole exercise GP leaders are now going to be overseeing contracts affecting colleagues friends rivals and their own surgeries without the resources to ensure watertight governance Who is responsible for what is becoming muddled with a lack of clarity over the respective roles of CCGs the area teams also badly stretched and   England As a practice manager pointed out to the researchers the problem is nobody really knowing who owns primary care This confusion is going to impede work to improve the quality of primary care which is supposed to be the objective of the whole cocommissioning exercise Clinical commissioning is being undermined from other directions The debacle over the new tariff prices with trust objections   for the coming year prevents CCGs from planning local budgets with confidence and opens up the risk of midyear price changes triggering disputes with providers The    North West and Yorkshire and Humber  to be accredited for NHS Englands procurement framework leaves  CCGs facing the prospect of finding new service providers A number of CCGs across the country have already brought support services inhouse but whether that is financially sustainable for the long term is unclear CCGs are working hard to collaborate more closely with neighbours in running their operations and in commissioning services but again that takes time and resources Inadequate resources confused accountability and responsibilities conflicts of interest financial instability and unreliable support are all being piled on to organisations still finding their way less than two years after they were set up and led by people who are working parttime No wonder other parts of the NHS complain that clinical commissioning is not making enough impact The future of CCGs is far from secure They are still some distance from establishing themselves as system leaders driving clinical improvement system efficiency and better patient experience But as an alternative to flying the system leader flag CCGs are increasingly pursuing a more collaborative way of working with providers and local government   for example has set up a joint strategic planning board with the aim of moving to more integrated planning and delivery of care With a challenged health economy some struggling providers significant regulator involvement and the presence of the massive Cambridge University Hospitals foundation trust on its patch being a system integrator and change agent rather than trying to lead has to be the right approach This is the role CCGs are increasingly fulfilling Clinical commissioning still has an important role to play but it needs to be redefined for an environment of longterm financial stress and increasing collaboration between acute providers and between primary and secondary care And somehow it needs to be properly resourced to drive change
