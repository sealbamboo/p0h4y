What many parents have long suspected is true  taking your children to the pediatricians office for a wellchild visit increases their chances of getting sick In fact all family members were at increased risk of contracting a flulike infection in the two weeks following a wellchild visit according to a new study After Heather Day took her daughter Ashley for her month well baby visit Ashley contracted an ear infection After Ashleys next check up she got another ear infection It always seemed that at those annual well visits nine times out of   she got another ear infection says Day  who lives in the Philadelphiaarea town of Macungie Pa  When shed return to the doctors office to treat Ashleys infections Day would say I was just here and she was fine and now she is sick  The doctors and nurses replied Kids get sick Researchers from the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine looked at data from the   which includes data from  families collected from  to  The survey provided the researchers with information about office visits emergency room trips and other outpatient healthcare encounters Children and their families had a  percent increase in flulike infections after a child  or under went to a wellchild visit according to the survey data While that increase seems small experts estimate it amounts to about  cases of preventable flulike infections each year Dr Charles Foster a pediatric infection disease physician at the Cleveland Clinic says The risk to any individual patients is small but when you factor in how many wellchild visit there are each year then they come up with a very large number The studys coauthor Dr Philip Polgreen says the risk is actually quite modest and parents shouldnt avoid a scheduled doctor visit  These well visits are critically important says Polgreen an associate professor of internal medicine at University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine The study is being published in the March issue of Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology Both Foster and Polgreen say that better implementation of recommended hygiene practices in waiting rooms and by parents could reduce the spread of these illnesses  Doctors offices should offer face masks for sick children have segregated waiting rooms  one for ill kids and one for healthy children  supply tissues and hand sanitizer take sick children to an exam room immediately and clean shared surfaces and toys  Parents should teach their kids to sneeze into a tissue or their elbow and properly wash and sanitize their hands Also they might want to keep their kids away from those shared toys There are basic infection control principals that all pediatric offices should practice Foster says  Dr Richard So a pediatrician at the Cleveland Clinic says that his practice does not provide shared toys or books to reduce the spread of illness Instead they offer each child an individual box of crayons Having individual crayons  and that has been a trend in restaurants yeah it costs more but were doing what we can do to reduce the spread of illness in our office So says  Pediatricians have preventive tricks for their own families When Dr Dennis Cunningham a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Nationwide Childrens Hospital in Columbus and his wife took their children to the well child visits they provided their own toys which they cleaned every time they returned to the house Pediatrician So recommends that parents Anyone has a cold or a runny nose shouldnt handle a baby I think parents should stand up and say something So says   As for Ashley she stopped getting sick following her wellchild visits when she turned  and Day started taking her to a family medicine practice The now yearold high school sophomore is as healthy as any of her friends
