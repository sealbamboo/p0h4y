The world’s biggest dementia study was launched in the U.K. Thursday, and will analyze data from more than two million people to try and find new treatments for the little-understood disease, including its commonest form, Alzheimer’s.. The study – a $27 million public-private partnership – forms part of coordinated G8 efforts to target dementia, and will be run by the U.K’s publicly-funded Medical Research Council, with support from several drug makers – AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline and Janssen Research and Development, a unit of Johnson & Johnson.
