The Liberal Democrats will go to the next election with their heads held high Nick Clegg has said He told his party conference in Glasgow he would not seek to distance the Lib Dems from the coalitions record The deputy prime minister attacked the bitter tribalism of British politics and told activists in Glasgow the party had to make our voice heard He also announced the first national waiting time targets for people with mental health problems People with depression should begin talking therapy treatments within  weeks from April  Young people with psychosis for the first time will be seen within  days  the same target as cancer patients Also at the Lib Dem conference BBC political editor Nick Robinson said Mr Clegg had presented himself in the speech as the man to take on what he sees as increasingly extreme rival parties while attempting to break through the anger people feel at the Lib Dems  and to get voters to think again Opening his speech the deputy prime minister said Britain would not be intimidated by Islamic State paid tribute to murdered hostages Alan Henning and David Haines and declared his immense gratitude for Britains Armed Forces Turning to the domestic scene he said Labour leader Ed Miliband and Chancellor George Osbornes conference speeches could not have been more helpful if they had tried to the Lib Dems cause with one forgetting the deficit and the other unveiling tax cuts for the wealthy The Liberal Democrats would borrow less than Labour and cut less than the Tories he said If the Liberal Democrat voice is marginalised in British politics our country will be meaner poorer and weaker as a result he predicted We must not and cannot let that happen We must make our voice heard He outlined a string of coalition government measures which he said were designed and delivered by Lib Dems including raising the income tax allowance parental leave reforms and samesex marriage Mr Clegg said he may no longer be the fresh faced outsider and the Lib Dems no longer untainted by the freedom of opposition But the party still stood for a different kind of politics He said the politics of fear was seductive and beguiling but was in fact a counsel of despair He said he had chosen to debate on television against UKIP leader Nigel Farage  whose name he pronounced with a French lilt  because someone has to stand up for the liberal Britain in which we and millions of decent reasonable people believe Nick Clegg has delivered his final conference speech before the general election What do the Liberal Democrats do next Nick Clegg focused on opportunity for voters  and the Lib Dems You might have expected a party languishing in the polls months from an election to panic Not here He directly criticised Conservative Home Secretary Theresa May who had accused him of jeopardising public safety by blocking new datamonitoring powers Mr Clegg accused her of playing party politics with national security He added Stop playing on peoples fears simply to try and get your own way Your Communications Data Bill was disproportionate disempowering  we blocked it once and wed do it again A Lib Dem government would introduce five green laws on carbon reduction green space and energy efficiency Mr Clegg pledged He would not set out red lines in the event of a hung Parliament but said people do have a right to know what our priorities are He pointed to the rise in the income tax threshold to  saying Labour would never have made the change and the Conservatives were explicit that it was not their priority Mr Clegg said he thought Britain would have more coalitions in the future and rounded off his speech by saying the Lib Dems were the only party who says no matter who you are no matter where you are from we will do everything in our power to help you shine Labours deputy leader Harriet Harman said Nick Cleggs speech was that of a man trying desperately to justify the decision he and his party took to back the Tories all the way Nick Clegg was right about one thing in his speech the Lib Dems should be judged on their record It is a record of broken promises and weakness The mental health pledge which will be funded by reallocating money from other parts of the health budget is coalition government policy rather than a Lib Dem aspiration But Mr Clegg also pledged to extra money in the next Parliament if the Lib Dems are in government to introduce similar targets for conditions such as bipolar disorder and eating disorders Under the plan suicidal patients get the same priority as those with suspected heart attacks Playing devils advocate you could say the government has set its mental health targets in the areas and at the levels it knows the NHS can achieve Already nearly twothirds of patients get access to talking therapies within  days So asking the NHS to ensure  are seen within  weeks does not seem a big ask  A similar thing could be said for the twoweek wait for help for people experiencing psychosis for the first time Nonetheless those working in the sector are still delighted  Why To understand that you have to consider where mental health stands in the pecking order of the NHS Half of the bn Mr Clegg announced for the NHS at the start of his party conference conference would be spent this way Mr Clegg said the commitment would go smack bang on the front page of our next manifesto He said Labour introduced waiting times in physical health  we will do the same for the many people struggling with conditions that you often cant see that we often dont talk about but which are just as serious He added These are big big changes And in government again the Liberal Democrats will commit to completing this overhaul of our mental health services  ending the discrimination against mental health for good Mental health problems are estimated to cost the economy around bn a year and around  million working days are also lost annually The announcement was welcomed by mental health charities Mark Winstanley chief executive officer at Rethink Mental Illness said it had the potential to improve the lives of millions while Centre for Mental Health chief executive Sean Duggan said it would help to overcome the current postcode lottery accessing essential services Sue Baker from the Time to Change charity which campaigns to end the stigma around mental health said there should be no discrimination between different types of health spending
