A baby has been born through a new technique to reawaken the ovaries of women who had a very early menopause Doctors in the US and Japan developed the technique to remove the ovaries activate them in the laboratory and reimplant fragments of ovarian tissue The technique   has resulted in one baby being born with another expected The findings were described as early but a potential gamechanger The  women involved in the study became infertile around the age of  due to primary ovarian insufficiency The condition affects one in  women who essentially run out of eggs too young leading to an early menopause Women have a fixed number of eggs at birth and those with the condition tend to use them up too quickly or are born with far fewer eggs in the first place  Eggs in the ovaries are not fully formed rather they stay as follicles and some mature each month The teams at Stanford University US and St Marianna University School of Medicine Japan were trying to activate the last few remaining follicles which may be present  They removed the ovaries from the women and used a combination of two techniques to wake up the sleeping follicles First they cut the ovaries into fragments which has been used in the past as a fertility treatment Then a chemical to take the brakes off egg development was applied  The fragments were put back at the top of the fallopian tubes and the women were given hormone therapy Following the treatment residual follicles started to develop in eight women Eggs were taken for normal IVF and so far one couple has had a baby and another woman is pregnant  Prof Aaron Hsueh from Stanford told the BBC It has to be improved to figure out the best way to do it but we estimate it could help  to  of the women We think it could help in two other forms of infertility Cancer survivors after chemotherapy or radiotherapy if theres any follicles left theres a chance this will help  And also women aged  to  with an irregular menstrual cycle The implications for women with early menopause are still unclear as the technique will require further testing and refinement before it could be used in clinics Prof Charles Kingsland from Liverpool Womens Hospital and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said Its really clever but will it work for everyone We dont know  Its potentially really really interesting but we need a lot more investigation to confirm this is not another false dawn  I will see primary ovarian insufficiency on a regular basis in my clinic so if its effective in the long term its something wed be interested in Prof Nick Macklon from the University of Southampton told the BBC Finding a new way to get new eggs by waking up sleeping follicles is very promising Its potentially a gamechanger Its a very important and very exciting piece of science but it is not ready for the clinic It still needs good randomised control trial data  He added that performing the technique outside of a research study would be unfeasible but a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of egg development could lead to new medications
