We all carry with us reminders of the person we used to be Its just a lot more literal for some than others People who lose a massive amount of weight are often surprised at how unhappy they still are with their bodies The fat is gone but all that skin that held it in place It didnt go anywhere Its a less explored part of extreme weight loss The body may be lighter but its now weighed down with folds of sagging skin causing a wild amount of emotional and physical think chafing pain More extreme weightloss patients are choosing to remove the loose skin through cosmetic surgery and   showed that the bodies and minds of those who do end up faring much better What Ive found its very interesting  they go and get these surgeries and then they come in and theyre still not happy says Dr Steve Wallach a cosmetic surgeon in ManhattanI had one patient who specifically said Im wearing a fat suit I feel like Im a thin person inside wearing a body thats twice the size of mine Clothes dont fit because of excess tissue So they still feel notwhole and nothappy says Wallach Franklin Santana a yearold who lives in the Bronx had gastric bypass surgery in October  and before the surgery he weighed  pounds Two years later as of late last year he was down to  To the public he seemed like a trim even skinny guy But underneath the clothes he said his sagging skin reminded him of a deflated balloon To me it looks gross said Santana You know how a pumpkin looks at the beginning of October And then at the end of October its all sad and saggy and deflated I guess you could say it looks like that Fantana had done his research before getting the surgery done and he knew that hed probably be saddled with loose skin after it was over Deborah Olmstead who first had weight loss surgery done in  knew to expect it too she just didnt know how awful it would make her feel I was not really comfortable even looking at myself in the mirror with all the excess flesh said Olmstead who lives in New York state and had cosmetic surgery in Manhattan led by Wallach to remove the sagging skin in  Youve done all this work youve made this big massive change that you see on the scale but you dont necessarily see it in your clothing or the way you feel about yourself The loose skin is caused by losing a huge amount of weight  as in  pounds or more  in a very short amount of time It can happen when the weight is lost through diet and exercise but it happens more often to weightloss surgery patients With a slower more gradual weight loss its easier for a persons skin elasticity to sort of snap back into place shrinking back down as the fat is lost But when too much is lost too fast the skins elasticity doesnt have time to catch up To get rid of the loose skin exercise helps a little Jasmin Maldonado a yearold living in Brooklyn who lost  pounds after weightloss surgery nearly a decade ago says a daily routine of squats situps and pullups has made a difference But shes still embarrassed about the way she looks Just with my husband Im embarrassed to show myself Im always covering myself she said The most effective way to remove the excess skin is through cosmetic surgery in one or more of an array of procedures known as body contouring And those who do shed the extra skin generally fare better than those who dont both psychologically and physiologically People who had weightloss surgery and subsequently had the excess skin removed were less likely to gain weight back than those who had the surgery but did not undergo a body contouring procedure according to a recent study published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery The report followed about  patients whod lost about  pounds after weightloss surgery Those who did not have any cosmetic procedures to remove the resulting excess skin ended up gaining back about  pounds but those who did have body contouring done only gained back about  pounds About  bariatric procedures are performed each year in the US and the study authors led by Dr Ali Modarressi of the University of Geneva in Switzerland go so far as to argue that body contouring should be a routine part of bariatric surgery Granted theyve got some skin in the game so to speak About  percent of bariatric surgery patients undergo at least one kind of body contouring procedure Those who choose to have body contouring done usually pick the circumferential body lift Doctors make an incision across the back then around the flanks and abdomen cutting away some of the excess skin and tightening the rest of it by suturing the incision back together After the body contouring is done patients routinely lose another  to  pounds of loose skin alone People go with the body lift because it makes the biggest difference in their appearance doctors say plus its easier to talk their insurers into covering it because the surgery has some real physiological benefits in addition to the psychological improvements On most people the loose skin tends to hang down like an apron from their lower abdomen It chafes And it hurts like crazy patients say It feels like its like an open wound and it just doesnt heal said Santana whos tried products like Neosporin on the sores He had body contouring done this winter and his insurance covered the procedure And that helped me sleep and alleviated the pain but at the end of the day it comes right back Stopping the painful chafing is important and such a relief say people whove had body contouring done But the biggest change is what they see in the mirror after the surgery They feel better about themselves How could you not Its pretty dramatic Its no wonder they feel better says Dr Scot Glasberg a cosmetic surgeon in New York and presidentelect of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons They feel better physically and its no wonder they feel better emotionally and psychologically Were not talking about a sort of subtle plastic surgery there were talking about things that are rather dramatic Franklin and Maldonado both had body lifts done by Glasberg over the holidays Now Franklin says he finally feels like a normal person Maldonado says she feels more confident The last physical reminder of who they used to be is finally gone
