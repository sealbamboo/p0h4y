The following are some questions that you should ask as you move through the process First and foremost find out if you must have surgery Is it medically necessary Are there any alternatives What are the risks and benefits associated with each option Will your insurance cover the procedure Many people depend on the Internet to answer these questions Anyone can type surgery or preop into a search engine and find all sorts of information but I caution my patients to avoid going online to learn about their surgeries  You can reference the Internet as a guide but remember it is built for general information not detailed information about a specific case Every patient is an individual And I remind my family that doctors dont look for zebras they look for horses  youre not likely to be the rare zebra case that an Internet search might bring up  After you determine that you need to have surgery you have to think about where youre having it Youll want to look at the experience and expertise of the surgeon staff and hospital  Do they have established experience with the particular type of surgery you are having Do you have to go to a specific hospital or are there several from which to choose Could the procedure be done at a surgical center or outpatient facility If your child is the patient make sure the hospital has experience with pediatric patients The same goes for the elderly Youll also want to check with your health insurance carrier about what facilities they will cover Some insurance plans will not pay for a procedure unless the facility is in network  in other words your primary care provider may have to have a relationship with a particular facility The physical preparation is handsdown the most important individualized part of the surgical process  For some people little preparation is needed For others it may be necessary to speak to your primary care provider cardiologist or other specialists  Find out if you need any testing beforehand or if you need to make any changes to your medication regimen Ask your doctor about eating and drinking before the procedure If youre a smoker find out how that could affect your preparation Make sure you are eating well and getting enough sleep Its important to take good care of yourself before having surgery Mental preparation is also key You need to prepare your family or friends because chances are youll need their assistance when you come home Be sure to have caregivers ready to help you Dont have the unreal expectation that you will go back to your regular routine instantly For many people anesthesia is one of the most concerning aspects of surgery  Talk to your doctor about the different types of anesthesia Some surgeries require a specific type of anesthesia but you may have options If you do have the option of choosing what kind to have make sure you understand ahead of time what the risks and benefits are  Being nervous about anesthesia is normal but educating yourself will help alleviate your fears As an anesthesiologist I always remind people that my job is to wake people up not just put them to sleep Complications are sometimes unavoidable after surgery but you can help reduce some of the risks by following your doctors instructions and caring for yourself before you head into the operating room  After surgery you may have pain nausea or vomiting Ask your doctor what you can do to alleviate these common reactions Learn what your expected recovery time frame will be like Ask about your pain management options  And be sure your loved ones understand what to expect in the weeks following the surgery Knowing what to expect makes the recovery process easier
