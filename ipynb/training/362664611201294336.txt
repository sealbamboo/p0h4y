A Philadelphia nurse has been charged with assisted suicide for allegedly providing her yearold father with a lethal dose of morphine Authorities say Barbara Mancini  told a hospice nurse and a police officer on Feb  that she provided a vial of morphine to her father Joe Yourshaw to hasten his death Mancini and her attorneys acknowledge she handed the medication to her father but maintain she never said she intended to help him end his life and was only trying to help her father ease his pain  an act they say is legally protected even if it causes death Barbara did not would not would never hand medicine to her father with the sole purpose  or with even a remote purpose  that he was going to intentionally end his life on her watch Mancinis lawyer Frederic Fanelli told reporters during a teleconference Wednesday Its ridiculous its abhorrent that they would even say that A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for Thursday in Pottsville a central Pennsylvania town of  where Yourshaw lived Its purpose is to determine if theres enough evidence for the case to go to trial Mancini is being charged under a statute common in many states that makes it illegal to assist in suicide Other cases involving endoflife situations have been prosecuted under these laws although such cases    and when defendants are convicted theres a tendency these days to let them off with light sentences such as probation Three states have statutes explicitly allowing assisted suicide under limited conditions      and   Montana   under a  state supreme court decision and attempts to overturn it   The Pennsylvania case turns partly on the contested claims about Barbara Mancinis stated intentions when she gave her aged father a vial of morphine Joseph Yourshaw was a hospice patient suffering from diabetes and frailty According to an autopsy report filed by Dr Rameen StarlingRoney he stopped taking all medications in December  He drank regular soda and ate two boxes of candy per week and multiple pastries the report notes  a diet that would be expected to worsen uncontrolled diabetes In January  the autopsy report notes an entry in Yourshaws hospice chart says he told his family that he wants to die His wife Marguerite reportedly said Your daughter apparently referring to Barbara Mancini told you how to do that Just stop drinking Yourshaw became increasingly weak and short of breath Hospice records show that Mancini called to request lowdose morphine for Yourshaws pain On Feb  he had a fall The next day hospice nurse Barbara Cattermole paid a call to check on him at home and found Yourshaw unresponsive in bed Cattermole told authorities that Mancini said she had given an entire vial of morphine to her father to end his life while Mancini says she was merely trying to relieve his pain The hospice nurse called  and reported an attempted suicide Pottsville Police Capt James K Reiley who responded to the call wrote in a criminal complaint that Cattermole told me that her client had taken an overdose of his morphine with the intent to commit suicide Cattermole further stated that her clients daughter was present and told her she gave him the morphine at his request so that he could end his own suffering Mancini asked that her father not be resuscitated or taken to the hospital Reiley wrote that he advised Defendant that she no longer had any say in the matter and that her father was going to the hospital for treatment Yourshaw was revived with Narcan an antidote for opiate overdoses He died four days later reportedly after hospital personnel gave him a low dose of morphine for pain His death certificate lists the cause of death as morphine toxicity that complicated Yourshaws heart disease and diabetes and the manner of death as homicide The claim that Yourshaw died of a morphine overdose administered by his daughter is central to the case Defense attorney Fanelli says its not plausible that Yourshaw died of morphine toxicity four days after the dose he took at home He also claims there was no attempt to determine how much morphine was in his blood at the time of death Its nonsense to assert that one can die from morphine toxicity from a dose taken four days earlier Fanelli tells Shots Its unsupported medically scientifically and it just doesnt make sense The fact is after he was given narcotic reversal agents in the hospital Joe woke up and was raising hell with everyone saying Why did you revive me and why is everyone picking on Barbara  The group   which supports assistance in dying is starting a national letterwriting campaign to persuade Pennsylvania Attorney General   to drop the case against Mancini The attorney general was asked to prosecute the case by the Schuylkill County district attorneys office because of a potential conflict of interest A spokesman for the attorney general said she would have no comment on the case but provided the police complaint Kathryn Tucker director of legal affairs and advocacy for Compassion  Choices called Mancinis prosecution an outlier Its very bizarre she tells Shots Having worked in this area for  years this is the most outrageous attempt to apply this kind of assisted suicide statute Its crazy Tucker points out that while the US Supreme Court in  declined to recognize a constitutional right to assistance in dying it did say that a patient has a right to as much medication as they need even if it hastens the time of death Tucker says that is now a widely recognized holding
