 After a day of deliberations an FDA advisory committee concluded that the agency should approve canagliflozin Invokana a novel agent for type  diabetes The margin was significant with  committee members voting to approve the drug versus five nays The drug which belongs to class of drugs called SGLT inhibitors has spurred the interest of many in the diabetes treatment field because it has a novel mechanism of action  it does not involve insulin activity in any way Instead SGLT prevents blood glucose from being reabsorbed by the kidney causing it to be excreted in urine instead If approved canagliflozin would be the first SGLT inhibitor to come to market Another SGLT inhibitor dapagliflozin was   last year largely due to concerns about   which were not seen with canagliflozin Most panelists whether they voted yes or no on the approval recommendation said the efficacy data were convincing In nine phase II and III trials both the mg and mg doses of the SGLT inhibitor significantly reduced HbAc compared with placebo and proved noninferior to glimepiride Amaryl and sitagliptin Januvia But the drugs safety profile was less clear due to   about the drugs effects on LDL cholesterol early cardiovascular events and stroke as well as concerns about use of the drug in patients with moderate renal impairment a common comorbidity of diabetes My Yes vote reflects the fact that I have great faith in my FDA colleagues said panelist Julia Lewis MD of Vanderbilt University I would expect the labeling would reflect our concerns about using this agent in the low eGFR group and I think  the   will be completed with sufficient events in the right amount of time Panelists casting a No vote generally cited concerns about the need to complete a cardiovascular outcomes study before the drug hit the market They also cautioned that patients with moderate renal impairment shouldnt be able to get on the drug Use in renal disease is not appropriate said Peter Savage MD of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases NIDDK I didnt feel comfortable that this wouldnt damage the kidneys in the long term Cardiovascular safety has become a major issue for diabetes drugs since studies revealed an increased risk for heart failure with both pioglitazone Actos and   Panelists were ask to cast a separate vote on whether there was enough evidence that the drugs overall cardiovascular risk profile wouldnt exceed a hazard ratio of   a standard now required for diabetes drugs That vote was a dead heat  to  although more panel members cast votes indicating their belief that cardiovascular data presented thus far wouldnt exceed the ratio Im quite satisfied with the data weve seen that the drug is safe in terms of cardiovascular events said William Knowler MD PhD MPH also of NIDDK who voted in favor But I cannot have all my concerns allayed by data that only go for a year To be perfectly satisfied we need to see longerterm data specifically in view of lipid risk factors Again regardless of their vote on the cardiovascular safety question the panelists all said their cardiovascular concerns arose from the future impact of increases in LDL cholesterol as well as lingering questions about stroke risk Many attributed the drugs increased proportion of early major adverse cardiovascular events MACE at  days to chance cautioning that it should not be overlooked in further trials Earlier in the day panelists deliberated over increased risks of electrolyte imbalances and decreased bone turnover though these factors made few appearances in panelists rationale for how they voted on approval of the agent Some concerns were also raised about an increased risk of genitourinary infections and the fact that the most likely agent used to treat these problems would be fluconazole Diflucan  which may have interactions with the new agent or other medications that patients would be taking panelists said Source
