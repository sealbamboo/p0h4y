Dr Lynn Ouellette a psychiatrist from Brunswick Maine asks herself What if a lot these days What if they had found her son just a few minutes earlier What if they had gotten him to the hospital sooner What if theyd had the overdose antidote Narcan in the house What we know is that this saves lives and it gives addicts another chance she says Her son Brendan Keating  had struggled with addiction Hed been in and out of rehab and tried other types of treatment But Ouellette says she constantly worried that her exuberant funloving bigintheworld clownofthefamily would harm himself or someone else On Dec  her worst fears came true Keating was found in the family basement in respiratory distress from an overdose He later died at the hospital I would have done anything to save my sons life Ouellette says And thats true for so many other people and theyre not throwaway lives This week federal drug officials encouraged more widespread use of Narcan and some states have already moved in this direction But not the state of Maine Republican Gov Paul LePage opposes a bill that would put Narcan in the hands of more first responders as well as relatives of addicts LePage vetoed a similar measure last spring saying it would provide a false sense of security to drug abusers For several years overdose deaths in Maine have come close to or exceeded the number of fatal traffic accidents in Maine In  the last year for which statistics are available there were  most involving opiates and a combination of other drugs In Keatings case it was heroin and sleeping pills Narcan also known by its generic name naloxone attaches to the same receptors in the brain as opiates reversing overdose effects when someone is in respiratory distress Had we had it right with us it might have made a difference Oullette says Maine like so many other states has a high rate of opiate addiction But in his recent State of the State address LePage proposed hiring  more drug agents and expanding drug courts He did not address treatment We must hunt down the dealers and get them off the street he said We must protect our citizens from drugrelated crimes and violence We must save our babies from lifelong suffering The last reference is to the number of drugaffected babies born in Maine last year  Many of their mothers are Medicaid recipients another reason the LePage administration objects to the bill It would require the states Medicaid program to pay for Narcan prescriptions Jay Bradshaw director of Maines Emergency Medical Services says Narcan is effective in reversing the effects of opiate overdose but it takes special training to handle patients who go into rapid withdrawal and experience other side effects Seizure even cardiac arrest become very violent nausea vomiting are all common side effects he says Bradshaw says most paramedics and advanced medical technicians already carry Narcan and are trained to safely administer it under certain protocols He fears making Narcan more widely available could discourage people from calling those best equipped to deal with an overdose emergency
