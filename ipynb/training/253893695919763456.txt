Sherri Oliver lives in a small town on the Eastern Shore of Maryland Its a twohour bus ride to get to the   in Baltimore  and she has brought her daughter Katie Dail Katie has dangerously high levels of lead in her blood Shes a fastmoving firstgrader with coppercolored hair Katie has bright brown eyes but has trouble making eye contact She also has    and she doesnt really speak but she makes a kind of whooping sound when shes happy But Katie is not here for autism treatment The treatment she has been getting     is to get her lead levels down Although hospitals offer the  treatment some desperate parents are turning to homebased chelation kits and  overthecounter pills which doctors say can be more  dangerous Lead can cause serious behavioral problems in kids and lower their IQs When Katies lead levels are high she gets irritable and has more trouble learning her mom says She takes all my time Oliver says Katie was first diagnosed with an elevated lead level at age  Lead in the body is notoriously hard to get rid of It seeps into the bones to hide and sneaks across the bloodbrain barrier affecting mood focus and sleep Last year Katie stayed in the hospital for  days while nurses worked to bring her lead levels down through chelation Chelation puts a special chemical into the body that binds to lead and other heavy metals and helps flush them out But its not pleasant And it has to be given repeatedly over the course of the hospital stay Its nasty stuff But it had to be done Oliver says Nasty Katies mom says because the chelation pill smells really bad You ever been near a building when theyre getting their roof done you know and the smell just gets in your mouth Thats what it smells like she says They had to grind up Katies pills and hide them in apple juice She still wont drink apple juice Oliver says But nurse practitioner Barbara Moore who runs the lead clinic at Mount  Washington says getting past the smell is just one of the challenges of chelation A child during chelation needs close monitoring to make sure their kidneys are able to handle the lead burden as its being metabolized in the body make sure their liver is OK make sure their white blood cell count is OK she says Plus the chelation process doesnt clear all of the metal out at first  it only brings it out from the bone to the blood Some people test higher for lead after the treatment until it flushes from their system And importantly it doesnt cure the damage the metal has already done to the brain What we try to do is prevent any further damage Moore says In the US about  kids a year under age  have high levels of lead in their blood Only a small percentage of them test high enough to need chelation While the overall numbers of lead poisoning and chelation therapy are going down its still a problem in cities with old homes like Baltimore and when people get secondhand toys that may contain lead Its also a problem in some rural areas where lead persists in the soil Moore says Moore sees between five and  chelation patients a year in her hospital Things that we look at is how long had they been exposed to lead and how high was their lead level she says She says kids who put a lot of nonfood items in their mouths have an increased chance of developing the classic symptoms of lead poisoning behavioral problems headaches and sleeplessness The clinic helps educate families on what to do to decrease their risk of lead poisoning We really do a lot of education on cleaning toys cleaning household items  using vacuums that have HEPA filters Moore says Moore says its especially hard to keep an eye on the symptoms of kids with learning disabilities like Katie Katie puts nearly everything in her mouth from the coffee cup that a stranger left on a table to the corners of walls in her home When Moore brings Katie and her mom into an exam room Katie watches TV while Moore listens to her breathing and reads her chart Moore talks to Katies mom Moore suggests giving Katie ice cubes to keep her mouth busy and says Katies blood count is slowly going down But theres still a chance that Katie might have to go into the hospital for more chelation if things dont improve Recently a new challenge has cropped up for Moore and her staff  chelation kits for sale on the Internet These products  which run the gamut from clay baths to pills to test kits   claim to let consumers cure autism or Alzheimers or hardening of the arteries without professional medical help One website claimed its chelation product corrects neurological damage and gets rid of mercury Some autism advocates say mercury causes autism but there is no scientific proof of that   chelation is not an effective autism treatment Moore says the products arent safe I dont recommend the oral chelation that you can get over the Internet or over the counter We dont know what the safe level is of administering to a child or to anybody else really she says These products havent been properly tested for any diseases other than heavy metal poisoning In fact the National Institutes of Health   of chelation as an autism treatment citing too much patient risk But the NIH is   for hardening of the arteries Results are expected to be announced in  Recently the Food and Drug Administration sent   to eight companies that were selling illegal chelation therapies FDA labeling compliance chief Michael Levy says the agency is cracking down We are very concerned that the marketers of these products are preying on the most vulnerable of consumers he says Hes talking about consumers like Sherry Oliver who have very sick kids without many treatment options The FDA is concerned that people will put their health at risk by using the therapies and delay seeking appropriate medical treatment Before Oliver left the clinic I asked her if she ever considered one of those online chelation kits I actually looked into that and no absolutely not Most of them  I couldnt find out what was in them where they were from who made it nothing Oliver says She doesnt want to give her daughter something she cant check out and she doesnt want to make Katies developmental problems worse I cant risk it she says Katie and her mom bundle up for the long ride home Theyll be back to the hospital in a month to get Katies lead levels checked again
