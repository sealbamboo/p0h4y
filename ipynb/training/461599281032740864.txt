Nail salon dryers which use ultraviolet light to speed the drying and hardening of nail polishes and gels emit varying levels of radiation that can lead to risky skin damage in as few as eight visits to the manicurist a new study shows The nail dryers emit primarily UVA light  the same kind of ultraviolet light used in tanning beds  and are used to dry nail polish or to harden a gel manicure Gel manicures are popular because they create longlasting shiny nails through a chemical gel that is painted on the nail in layers and cured under UV light after every coating  who developed squamous cell skin cancers on their hands have suggested an association between cancer and the UV nail light devices but most doctors agree the risk is low In the new study researchers from Georgia Regents University in Augusta conducted a random sampling of  different UV nail lamps found in salons to determine how much ultraviolet radiation is being emitted when clients dry their nails under the lights  The study published as a   found wide variation in the dose of UVA light emitted during eight minutes of nail drying or hardening The dose measured in joules per centimeter squared ranged from less than one to eight  There is a vast range in the amount of light coming out of these devices said Dr Lyndsay R Shipp the studys lead author and a postgraduate resident at the universitys Medical College of Georgia The amount of UV exposure ranged from barely to significant she said DNA damage that can lead to skin cancer is known to occur around  joules per centimeter squared and none of the nail lamps came close to that number However the researchers estimated that for most of the lamps tested eight to  visits over  to  months would reach the threshold for DNA damage to the skin The study authors noted that the risk from multiple manicure visits remains untested but the study suggested that even with numerous exposures the risk for carcinogenesis remains small Dr Shipp said There is a theoretical risk but its very low Lamps with higherwattage bulbs emitted the highest levels of UV radiation but it would not be easy for a salon client to check the wattage before using a machine Dr Shipp said she sometimes uses the nail lamps and will continue to do so I do use them every couple of months she said noting that you can get that amount of exposure when driving down the road in your car Clients who are concerned about the risk but want to continue getting gel manicures which require UV light  have a few options They can skip the lotionandmassage portion of the manicure and instead coat their hands with sunscreen before having gel nails applied Another option is to wear UVprotective gloves with the fingertips cut off so only the nails are exposed to the light Users of regular nail polish can try fans or airdrying if they want to avoid the devices
