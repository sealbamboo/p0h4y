The early generation of glutenfree baked goods tended to be imitations often not very good ones of cakes and cookies usually made with wheat flour Kristine Kidd cookbook writer and former Bon Appetit magazine food editor is among those trying another tack She looked at the flours that have no gluten  almond buckwheat and sorghum among them  and figured out how to bake The result is her second book on cooking without gluten GlutenFree Baking Weldon Owen  Her first was  I did not want to make copies of things that are better made with wheat flour Thats just going to be disappointing said Kidd When she learned her celiac disease had resurfaced several years ago she began exploring a new world of cooking First I started doing things that were naturally glutenfree she said And those are in the book meringues with chocolate and ginger coconut macaroons dipped in chocolate and other cookies that use nut meals rather than flour Theres a cheesecake and a flourless chocolate cake with dried cherries rice pudding and Indian pudding There also is a version of the first recipe she ever made with her grandmother pecan thumbprint cookies this time using brown rice flour Most people who avoid gluten do so for health reasons They have celiac disease or other sensitivities to gluten which is found in wheat barley and rye Or they believe their diets are generally more healthful without gluten So its perhaps surprising to read the ingredient lists of many glutenfree baked goods on the market I noticed that most of the glutenfree prepared foods and the mixes focus on the white starches that are bad for you  corn potato white rice I wanted to explore the grains that are healthy for you Kidd said In her research sorghum came up over and over she said Its a grass often used in this country as animal feed and to make molasses But the flour is available in Whole Foods and health food stores as well as some supermarkets Its a nutrientdense grain and its got a very sweet neutral flavor It became my basic flour Kidd said It doesnt bind ingredients however so she used eggs or xantham gum for that Several muffins and scones are among the  recipes in GlutenFree Baking Cornmealpecan muffins are one of the many recipes in which Kidd uses cornmeal which adds texture and taste along with the sorghum flour Theres orange zest and cinnamon too They rose perfectly and seemed very close to gluteny muffins And corn of course is a great morning flavor Cornmeal combined this time with almond meal also worked well in the blackberry cornmeal cake which could be served plain for breakfast or dressed up with whipped cream for dessert Kidd said it was inspired by a cake she ate at the Santa Monica bakery Huckleberry and it has the rustic feel of many of the desserts there High in protein almond meal gives a great nutty cast to the cake People often ask Kidd for glutenfree recipes for white sandwich bread or challah To make them work well theyd have to be just white starches I try to keep white starches down to a quarter of the total But she understands the motivation At a glutenfree conference a few years back she said many people had just begun to avoid gluten They wanted to do what they had always done My mother always made me chocolate cake for my birthday so Im just going to go to that mix Now they dont have to
