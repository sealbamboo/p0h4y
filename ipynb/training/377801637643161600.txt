Its a cancer that usually strikes much later in life Hilaire was  More than  people who worked or lived near the World Trade Center on  have been diagnosed with cancer according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   A few months ago Hilaire received a letter from the CDCs National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health officially offering him medical insurance under the   About  people have been certified to receive cancer treatment under the WTC Health Program a representative told CNN These are the first numbers released since the program was expanded a year ago In September  federal health authorities   to the list of covered illnesses for people who were exposed to toxins at the site of the World Trade Center in the aftermath of the  attacks  Dr John Howard administrator of the WTC Health Program had said the year before that cancer treatments   by the compensation fund At the time he said there was inadequate published scientific and medical findings to link  exposures to cancer Others argued that hundreds of chemical compounds among them known carcinogens were present in the dust surrounding ground zero  Potential cancercausing agents such as asbestos that coated the World Trade Center buildings lower columns and benzene a component of jet fuel that caused uncontrollable fires when planes barreled into the twin towers have long been a cancer concern for researchers Scientists were also worried about the high volume of particulates and gases inhaled by responders survivors and people who lived in the area  Yet some officials were worried about making the connection between  and cancer too soon When the proposal to add cancer coverage was made experts estimated the cost would total between  million and  million And while someones cancer may have been caused by his or her work at ground zero it might also have been a coincidence  they may have gotten cancer anyway  A long lag time makes it particularly difficult to study the link Cancer doesnt develop quickly after breathing in something toxic the way asthma might Instead leukemia can take five to six years to develop and solid tumors can take  to  years In the end it was a study of firefighters that helped persuade the government to include cancer in the WTC Health Program Researchers found firefighters who worked at ground zero were   than firefighters who did not According to the  study published in The Lancet medical journal the increase occurred during the first seven years after  There were subtle increases seen in a few cancers in particular including gastroesophageal cancers and blood cancers such as multiple myeloma and nonHodgkins lymphoma One theory about how the cancers may have developed so soon among responders is that the unique characteristics of ground zero dust and the sheer number of chemicals contained in it may have accelerated disease The WTC Health Program will act as a backup insurance for Hilaire whose primary insurance through the city has been taking care of his medical expenses Doctors arent treating his multiple myeloma now its asymptomatic so theyre simply watching it But when it does start to cause problems  and it will his doctors say  theyll begin a treatment program  For Hilaire receiving the WTC Health Program welcome letter was more about recognition than assistance  They looked over my medical records  determined cause and effect he said After years saying We dont know were not sure they finally said Yeah you got it from there   And Hilaire knows the program will be a big help to those who dont have good health insurance  folks who lived or worked in the area who have since been diagnosed He said he thinks the number of people who have or who will get cancer related to  is a lot higher than  something only time will tell The WTC Health Program was created as a result of the passage of the James Zadroga  Health and Compensation Act The Zadroga Act passed by Congress in December  is designed to provide medical services and compensation for responders who were exposed to toxins while working at ground zero President Barack Obama signed the  billion legislation in January  The law is named after a New York police officer who died of a respiratory disease attributed to working amid the toxic chemicals at the attack site First responders volunteers survivors of the attacks and residents near the  site who meet specific qualifications are eligible for coverage according to the CDC  The program has also been recently expanded to include responders from the Pentagon attack and Shanksville Pennsylvania where United Airlines Flight  crashed People are still enrolling from those locations so the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health does not have an accurate count of how many people were affected a representative told CNN To determine eligibility for the WTC Health Program visit
