As a society we dont pay much attention to nutrition information when we eat out A US Department of Agriculture   estimates just  percent of Americans use nutritional information when deciding what to order But that could change soon As weve   the Affordable Care Act will require chain restaurants with  or more locations to post calorie information on menus or menu boards And what might make us pay attention Well researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health have a theory Instead of just listing calories why not also include how many miles of walking or minutes of running it would take to burn off the calories you order This could help people put the calorie counts in context People dont really understand what it means to say a typical soda has  calories says   an associate professor in the department of health Policy and management at Johns Hopkins So if were going to put this information in restaurants Bleich says listing the miles of walking it would take to work it off may be the more persuasive way Bleich and her team were interested to know how lowincome tweens and teenagers would respond to this kind of messaging So she and her colleagues posted calorie and miles to walk signs in corner stores in predominantly black neighborhoods in Baltimore Since sodas are a common purchase among teens the signs focused on beverages pointing out that a typical ounce soda has  calories which would take  miles of walking  or  minutes of running  for a pound adolescent to burn off It would take a little less time for an adult with a higher body weight to use up the energy in one of those sodas We sat in these stores for hours and watched what kids were doing Bleich says And her team documented that among the roughly  percent of teens who noticed the signs the calorie and walking information shaped their choices Before the milesofwalking signs went up the teens were purchasing about  calories worth of sugary drinks After the signs were installed the number of sugary drink calories purchased dropped to  So not a huge drop but a significant change Kids also started buying smallersize drinks Before the signs went up more than half of teens were buying ounce or larger servings After the signs were installed the purchases of largesize beverages dropped to  percent The   are published in the  Bleich says when she started the research project she drove through the Baltimore neighborhoods where the study was to be carried out These neighborhoods are lowincome heavy drug use Bleich says There are all sorts of social disadvantages And she recalls thinking Who the heck is going to care how many calories are in the sodas that theyre drinking But now that shes documented that the signs do make a difference she says shes very encouraged So to me the message is Among a population for whom health is probably not a primary concern were seeing a significant effect Bleich says And she says her hunch is that if she carried out the same study among higherincome populations I think the effects would be even bigger
