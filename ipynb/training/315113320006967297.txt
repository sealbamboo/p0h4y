What you do while youre asleep may say something about your cognitive function later in life Heres why Mayo Clinic researchers report that having a condition called   in which you act out dreams in your sleep appears to be a harbinger for something called   years later  at least in men After   Lewy body dementia is the secondmost common form of dementia in the elderly affecting over  million people in the United States The findings which havent been published were presented Thursday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in San Diego Socalled Lewy bodies are clumps of   that accumulate in parts of the brain involved in thinking and movement The condition is marked by cognitive fluctuations motor deficits and hallucinations According to   assistant professor at Mayo Clinic in Florida and lead author of the study Lewy body dementia or LBD can be thought of as on a spectrum  between Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease In a retrospective study Murray and her colleagues examined the medical histories of  patients at Mayo Clinic who had been diagnosed with LBD The diagnoses were confirmed after their deaths by brain autopsy They found that male patients were five times more likely to have had REM sleep behavior disorder than to have had any of the other core features A similar trend wasnt found in women The potential link between acting out dreams and developing dementia is not entirely new In fact in  the Dementia with Lewy Bodies Consortium   REM sleep behavior disorder as an additional suggested feature of LBD Although this study didnt include a control group Murray says it provides evidence that REM sleep behavior disorder should be included as one of the core features of LBD REM sleep behavior disorder overwhelmingly increases the risk of developing dementia with Lewy bodies she says The reason for this might be because areas in the brainstem involved in sleep are particularly vulnerable to Lewy bodies and begin to accumulate the proteins before other areas of the brain are affected And were talking   before According to Murray REM sleep behavior disorder can predate the development of dementia by up to  years Of course not all people who act out their dreams will develop dementia But Murray says that about half of people with REM sleep behavior disorder appear to later develop LBD Having a strong early signal for the disease could be useful These cases are in a sense a perfect example of people who one day may develop dementia but could be targeted early on explains Murray Although there is currently no cure for LBD there are   that can relieve some of the symptoms Also once a diagnosis of LBD has been made certain drugs can be avoided including antipsychotics which can worsen movement issues and confusion in patients with LBD And although it might be daunting to learn that youre at risk for developing dementia Murray says that its still beneficial to have the information You can discuss the options she says That way people have time to plan
