Near the corner of Tillary and Jay Streets in Brooklyn Michael Heimbinder stood near a blue mailbox head down poking at his smartphone A graph appeared a single line plotting ambient   exposure in the neighborhood Minutes later he ran over to an idling Honda Pilot and held a small black sensor to its tailpipe On his phone carbon monoxide levels predictably jumped off the chart A woman opened the car door and said Can I help you out Just sampling air Mr Heimbinder said He gave a quick grin and dashed on to a woman with a lighted cigarette Mr Heimbinder  who lives in Park Slope and runs a nonprofit organization called   is a pollution hunter Armed with a portable sensor attached with Velcro to his biceps he uses his smartphone to record minuscule fluctuations in air quality The system known as   allows him to create and share online colorcoded maps of neighborhood air quality Hardware components cost as little as   the whole thing is about the size of three smartphones Looking for hazardous air where federal authorities cant or dont hes bicycled around Newtown Creek and taken samples above the BrooklynQueens Expressway Youre not going to be able to tell the difference between clean air and moderately unhealthy air he said You cant see it By at least one metric the   outdoor particle pollution is among   Twothirds of those deaths occur in Asia  to  occur annually in the United States The Environmental Protection Agency collects data on carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide ozone particulate matter sulfur dioxide and lead at  sites in New York City The sites are part of a   and help the agency issue air quality alerts But air pollution except for ozone is not distributed uniformly across an urban environment Particulates vary from neighborhood to neighborhood even from one floor of a building to another Now scientists struggling to understand exactly where and how were exposed to air pollution are making use of the nuanced data captured by anyone with a lowcost mobile air sensor The EPA plans to include citizencollected data to supplement existing monitoring stations We get inquiries from people all the time and wed love to make use of their data said   a research chemist at the EPA These technologies really have exploded in the last five years  cellphonebased technologies wirelessly transmitted data  but we dont know how well theyre performing Dr Williams recently ran nine sensors including AirCasting through an   program to verify the data quality The agency is sharing the results with developers to help them finetune their sensors The socalled small sensor movement continues to expand The   released last year and measures outdoor carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide users can buy a monitor rather than building it themselves Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder   to monitor airborne emissions Others are developing creative ways to display information Last year two graduate students Xiaowei Wang and Deren Guler   giving a realtime readout of air pollution with flying blinking LED lights  almost like stars in the hazy night sky Researchers say the data can drive changes in everyday behavior Two years ago   a computer scientist at the University of California San Diego handed out portable   to  commuters A paper presented at Wireless Health  reported that participants using the sensors found   Bus riders probably among the lowest contributors to air pollution nonetheless received high exposures while waiting on busy streets the sensors found Passengers in public buses saw higher exposures too compared with those in automobiles Newer cars have cabin filters that remove ozone and nitrogen dioxide Once they saw the data Dr Griswold said many participants changed their habits They started walking different streets or driving with windows rolled up Mr Heimbinders group will call on AirCasting users to assess air quality around Newtown Creek the South Bronx and other areas crisscrossed with highways waste transfer facilities dry cleaners and other pollution sources that cant be detected in largescale monitoring Beyond prompting changes in daily commutes Mr Heimbinder said he expected environmental activists to take these observations to lawmakers and regulators I do believe in the power of the group to change policy he said If were measuring air quality then we can say Look we have real evidence here You have to do somethingÂ  Back inside a juryrigged calibration lab at the New York City College of Technology he listened as a student Leroy Williams explained a test of a new nitrogen dioxide sensor Mr Williams said the nitrogen dioxide levels had showed a sharp drop when he brought the sensor indoors That would make sense Mr Heimbinder said You got two bridges out there Until now the plumes of exhaust billowing from the bridges  from  vehicles a day  had been all but invisible
