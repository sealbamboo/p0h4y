Caffeine is pretty much everywhere Its in coffee and tea of course but   pops up in mints gum jerky and even maple syrup Dietary supplements containing caffeine are also wildly popular And that holds true for people in   who often have to   But how much caffeine is actually in these energy supplements Researchers from Harvard Medical School and from the military teamed up to analyze  supplements all in capsule form that are popular on military bases All the supplements which are widely available were purchased at a retail store  not a base commissary  so the results wouldnt apply just to military personnel The researchers found that some supplements dont reveal how much caffeine they contain and the ones that do often list an inaccurate amount When its appropriate for troops to use caffeine they should be using a carefully prepared product and not relying on mislabeled supplements says   the Harvard teams lead researcher At moderate levels caffeine is no big deal for most people and can even have some   When overdone however it can trigger problems including anxiety insomnia headaches tremors and heart problems Cohen and his colleagues used some whizbang chemistry tools highpressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to figure out exactly how much caffeine is the supplements Of the  supplements only nine had labels that accurately listed the amount of caffeine they contained The rest either didnt list an amount or listed an amount that was off the mark  in some cases wildly so As detailed in an   in this weeks issue of the journal   Cohen and his colleagues found that some contained twice as much caffeine as was on the label  upwards of  milligrams or as much as a ounce cup of   Other supplements contained only a quarter of the caffeine they claimed More than  milligrams of caffeine per day is too much according to   Cohen wouldnt name the  dietary supplements his team analyzed He says this was a small study that looked at just one sample for each supplement so its possible that his team just happened to choose capsules from a bad batch Cohen says he wants to do a larger more systematic analysis before he calls out a specific supplement maker Still Cohen says his teams early findings suggest that regulators may need to step into the largely unregulated dietary supplement market A lot of these products meet all legal requirements that currently exist today he says That strongly suggests that the regulations which are there to ensure that we know what were taking when we purchase the supplement are completely inadequate The research was funded with a grant from the Department of Defenses Center Alliance for Dietary Supplement Research
