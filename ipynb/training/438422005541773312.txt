Its hard to imagine a more devastating diagnosis than ALS also called   For most people it means their nervous system is going to deteriorate until their body is completely immobile That also means theyll lose their ability to speak So Carl Moore of Kent Wash worked with a speech pathologist to record his own voice to use later  when he can no longer talk on his own Most ALS patients live only a few years after diagnosis but Moore a former helicopter mechanic is the exception  he was diagnosed  years ago At the beginning he lost use of his hands and it wasnt until years later that he found that the symptoms were affecting his speech You can hear my threeshotsoftequila speech he says And it does get worse as I get tired So several years ago before that slur crept in he recorded hundreds of messages and uploaded them to the speech device hell someday rely on The machine looks like a chunky tablet computer and it would normally sound like a robot But now instead it will sound like Moore Its almost like preserving a piece of yourself he says Ive taken auditory pictures of who I am Moores banked messages range from the practical I feel tired to the absurd You know what Your driving sucks and somewhere in the middle Hey my butt itches Would you give it a bit of a scratch Moore is kind of a snarky guy  some of his messages cant be played in decent company Its a part of his personality that hes rescuing from the disease And its not just for his own benefit Message banking also helps his caregiver his wife Merilyn If its a computer voice I think its harsh she says whereas if its his own voice I can feel like hes actually speaking those words John Costello a speech pathologist at   is credited with inventing the clinical use of voice banking He says it can make a big difference in peoples quality of life If you wanted to say something like Youre the love of my life having that in synthetic speech is devastating Costello says One patients wife he says contacted him shortly after her husbands death She wrote to me that the work that we did was the only bright forward movement Everything was about loss except the possibility of communication The person helping Carl and Merilyn preserve that possibility is Roberta Kelley a speech pathologist at Seattles Virginia Mason Hospital She says ALS is really a relentless march toward disability and death But this lets people snatch something back from it It gives the patient something to do when they have no control over the disease she says Yet for all its benefits in Kelleys clinic only a fraction of patients actually do it The ones that dont do it cant deal with it she says They dont want to think about using an electronic piece of equipment to talk So most of them nod smile and do nothing Heartbreakingly many come back hoping to record their voices after its too late Carl on the other hand brings a mechanics pragmatism to the project and hes clearly having some fun too Besides letting him razz Merilyn for years to come the recordings will become an archive for her I see this also as a legacy which will feel like his presence with me even after hes gone she says So Merilyn wants to make sure Carl has banked the really important things  which raises a question Where among the witty barbs and the practical lines were the messages of tenderness of intimacy My conversations are mostly sarcastic he says She asked me before we left if I had the phrase I love you and I realized I didnt He says hell make more recordings at some point  sooner rather than later The trouble he says is his voice has already gone downhill Well see how it works out Im not comfortable with recording my voice as it is he says I think that its important that we capture you as you are now Merilyn says We love you as you are now just as much as eight years ago So I will record Yes dear  Later Carl dug back through his hard drive and discovered that he had indeed recorded himself saying I love you He added it to the device that will someday speak for him
