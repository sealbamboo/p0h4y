Each year as many as  people around the world die from venomous snakebites often because they live in remote rural areas and didnt get to a hospital in time to get treatment Toxins in the venom of snakes like cobras and   slowly paralyze their victims who ultimately die of suffocation A San Francisco emergency room physician says he may have the beginnings of a workaround that could fend off paralysis and save many of those lives Already hospitals sometimes use an intravenous version of the drug neostigmine to buy time if they dont have the right   But its a scary treatment for laypeople to have to use in the field In the IV form neostigmine is a very tricky drug says   the San Francisco physician An overdose will stop the heart Lewin is medical adviser to international research expeditions for the California Academy of Sciences so he has to worry about things like cobra bites He kept noodling about how neostigmine might be used safely outside a hospital On a camping trip in Mongolia Lewin was talking the problem over with longtime pal and mentor   an anesthesiology professor at the University of California San Francisco when they suddenly realized that a neostigmine intranasal spray might work Its been used to   some paralytic symptoms of   they realized and might be a safer way to reverse the paralysis of snakebite too But to test their theory they would need to partially paralyze someone  temporarily and under controlled conditions So they found a volunteer a healthy yearold male Lewin wouldnt divulge the volunteers identity to Shots but says You could say hes someone whose perspective Im very familiar with With emergency rescue treatments at the ready a team of anesthesiologists at UCSF began by infusing the very much awake and alert volunteer with a steady drip of mivacurium a curarelike drug similar to cobra venom Over the course of  minutes the doctors watched as the volunteers eyelids and cheeks began to droop  the same initial symptoms seen after a cobras bite His vision blurred Then he began to have difficulty swallowing By  minutes after the infusion started he was having trouble lifting his head At that point  and before breathing got too difficult Lewin rushes to say  the doctors gave the volunteer a carefully measured spritz of neostigmine through the nose It worked The drug safely reversed the paralysis within minutes The experiment was very safe and approved beforehand by UCSFs safety committee on human research Lewin says The volunteer was intensively monitored at all times by two anesthesiologists immediately before during and for five hours after the study he says A third doctor collected data They published their   online this week in the journal   The next step in addition to followup testing with actual venom in animals will be to test other drugs to see if they work better Lewin says Many snake venoms are complicated mixtures with a variety of effects and nasal neostigmine may not be the best solution ultimately We were just hoping with this to start the conversation he says Can you think of another catastrophic condition like this for which there is no outofhospital treatment at all Snakebite victims should still get to a trauma center as soon as possible after a bite The idea here isnt to replace antivenom Lewin says Nasal sprays with drugs like neostigmine would do only part of the job But they could buy people the crucial time they need to get lifesaving care
