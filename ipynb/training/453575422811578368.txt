A new analysis suggests that giving birth in a hospital is considerably safer than having a baby at home or in a  birthing center Researchers analyzed  data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from  to  on almost  million births including  nonhospital deliveries Their results   They examined both early death within seven days of birth and neonatal death within  days among singleton fullterm babies without congenital malformations No matter how they parsed the numbers babies born outside  hospitals had higher rates of death Over all babies delivered by midwives at home had nearly four times the risk for death compared with those delivered by hospitalbased midwives with the risk highest if the birth was the womans first With  home births per year in the United States this means about  additional neonatal deaths annually Babies delivered by midwives in freestanding birthing centers had more than twice the risk for death compared with those delivered by midwives in hospitals Compared with midwifeattended births in hospitals doctorattended births had higher mortality almost certainly because the most complicated births are generally handled by physicians When a birth was handled by others  policemen taxi drivers and so on  the death rate was four times that of hospital births The researchers write that these results almost certainly underestimate the actual neonatal death rates in home and birthing center deliveries because infants with complications are often transferred to hospitals and the CDC counts any subsequent death as a hospital outcome The lead author Dr Amos Grnebaum a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medical College strongly discourages giving birth at home  We need to make hospitals provide some of the amenities you have at home he said We need to make hospitals more like homes instead of making homes more like hospitals
