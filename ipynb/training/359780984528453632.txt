Breast cancer may be killing black women at a higher rate than whites because they are sicker to start with researchers reported on Tuesday Doctors and policymakers have known for years that AfricanAmerican women are more likely to die of breast cancer than white women Studies have offered all sorts of clues  there may be genetic differences there may be disparities in getting medical care black women may get inferior treatment and blacks may simply avoid doctors more This latest study done using a new method shows not only that the differences are still there years after experts first began to notice them  it also shows that black women are in poorer shape overall than whites when they are diagnosed They come in sicker with more advanced disease and more chronic conditions says Dr Jeffrey Silber of the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia who led the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association The disparity looks to be unchanged over the past few decades The findings dont surprise Karen Jackson founder and CEO of Texasbased   which tries to educate and motivate AfricanAmerican women about breast cancer After  years I have seen this over and over again Jackson who was treated for breast cancer  years ago told NBC News We know what the solutions are Our initiatives are geared to early detection Black women often fear a cancer diagnosis and are afraid that they are doomed to die anyway she said  Jackson who felt a lump for years before she was diagnosed says shes living proof that treatment works But women have to actively seek care and they have to be vocal about getting the right kind of care Many experts have suspected that a combination of mistrust and difficulty in getting good medical treatment underlie many of the disparities seen in health Blacks are more likely to die of a range of diseases from diabetes to prostate cancer Silbers team armed with a grant from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality set out to show what the differences really are They set up a very large study looking at women over  who are covered by Medicare They compared  black women  and older who were diagnosed between  to  to three different groups of  white patients We matched white patients to black patients Silber said The first group lived in similar places were the same age and diagnosed in the same year The white women lived three years longer than the black women on average Then the team matched the black patients to a group of white women who were not only the same age and diagnosed in the same year but who had similar tumors  the same stage the same aggressiveness and the same type  and who also other similar conditions such as diabetes and heart failure When we found whites who looked like like blacks on all those presentation factors the threeyear disparity went down to just a oneyear disparity Silber said in a telephone interview Finally they added in a third layer They found white patients who were the same age in the same socioeconomic group who lived in similar neighborhoods who had similar types of cancer and who also got the same type of treatment as the  black women  drug type same type of surgery and same type of radiation therapy The differences in life expectancy fell to just three months The disparity in treatment though real is not accounting for very much Silber said He says this shows the problem is that black women are showing up sicker in the first place  They are not getting the preventive care they need he said They are not coming in early enough Jackson agrees but she says her case shows its more than just a matter of seeing a doctor She knew she had a high risk of breast cancer because two aunts had it She started having mammograms at  and when she felt a mass in her breast a few years later she asked again and again about it The doctors said Dont worry  youre young Jackson said Her mammograms were clear But when she was  and still felt the lump she insisted on an ultrasound after yet another mammogram showed nothing The ultrasound showed a tumor and Jackson now  had surgery chemotherapy and radiation I went from furious to proactive says Jackson who lives in Houston and who was covered by her husbands private health insurance plan I had insurance I had mammograms and I still fell through the cracks And I thought what about women who arent getting mammograms So she started    Many AfricanAmerican women are afraid when they find a lump or other possible symptom of breast cancer Jackson says When you are in a fearful state you are not accessing things that are available to you she said That fear of dying immobilizes you We understand this Many women also dont realize they need regular mammograms  not just one Jackson says The study also suggests that black women are not getting other care they need They were less likely than the white women to have had a recent colon cancer screening or a cholesterol test Silber says We need to make certain that everyone in this country has access to adequate medical care and not just at the time they develop a cancer Dr Len Lichtenfeld Deputy Chief Medical Officer for the American Cancer Society said in a telephone interview We do need to reach out into communities and educate Lichtenfeld added We do need to make resources available We as a nation have to make the decision that this is simply not acceptable When people get angry about situations like this things will happen Dr Laura Kruper who helps direct the breast cancer program at the City of Hope cancer center in Duarte Calif says other factors matter too Can a woman take time off work to get this done Is she close to a facility Kruper asks I see lot of patients in my office who present with advanced cancers and they ask Oh I was supposed to get a mammogram every year Cultural differences also matter Kruper says I do have women who come in and say God is going to heal me she said Better doctorpatient relationships would help Silber says Efforts to increase mammography efforts to increase and improve communication between primary care physicians and patients would be useful he said
