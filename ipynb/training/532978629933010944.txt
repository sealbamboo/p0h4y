For her Thanksgiving celebration in Canada in October   hosts an entire family of glutenfree eaters Complicating her menu is the fact that she is the only true vegetarian at the table The celebration is a very different affair in my house but delicious nonetheless writes Ms Day Healthy food is a priority in my kitchen but so is delicious food Ms Day notes that navigating the world of vegetarian cooking and glutenfree cooking at the same time can be an adventure particularly around the holidays Her advice keep it simple She chooses naturally glutenfree and vegetarian foods like vegetables beans and some whole grains This delicious salad made with rice beets and kale and topped with a cider dressing resulted from an effort to create a heartyvegetarian dish for herself while at the same time offering a delicious glutenfree option that the whole family would enjoy She added the cider and flaxseed oil dressing because she liked the nutty taste with the black rice and adding a healthful oil to the dish Its jeweltones practically sparkle on a plate and the flavours are punchy yet muted enough to not overwhelm the other dishes she writes Being madeahead its ideal for the holidays I love to make it one or two days in advance really allowing the sharp dressing to permeate the inky black rice soften the kale and give a glorious gloss to the beets Serving this with goat cheese or feta would make it even more substantial  Ms Day writes that this elegant salad is now a staple on her family Thanksgiving table Its beautiful bold and makes those with food intolerances and preferences feel taken care of special and appreciated she writes Who wouldnt want that
