They believe in him Its hard not to after listening to the unassuming way he plans to change medicine  A pediatric neurooncologist Olson says he has spent too many years explaining why a surgeon may not remove all of a patients cancer or instead accidentally take part of a childs healthy brain  Thats why he and his team created Tumor Paint a product designed to illuminate cancer cells in the body helping surgeons distinguish them from healthy tissue  The key to brain surgery is to remove the bad stuff and leave the good stuff inside says Dr Rich Ellenbogen a neurosurgeon who worked to develop Tumor Paint with Olson However its not that easy While cancerous cells may glow on an MRI they look remarkably similar to healthy cells during an operation Only experience  and luck  guide surgeons as they try to remove the deadly areas   Take a few grams of tissue that belong safely in the brain then the patients wake up not as perfect as they went into the surgery Ellenbogen says   Ellenbogen and Olson knew they had to find a way to light tumors up during an operation  Digging through existing research Olson found a scientist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who was using venom from an Israeli Deathstalker scorpion to target brain tumors The venom seemed to bind to the cancerous cells without affecting the healthy tissue  Olson hypothesized that attaching a molecular flashlight of sorts to the venom would make it easier for surgeons to distinguish good cells from bad   The first six grant applications Olson submitted to the National Institutes of Health to test his theory were denied for being too overspeculative or overambitious he says Then a hospital administrator introduced him to Rhoda Altom  Altoms daughter Stewart then  had been diagnosed with a ganglioglioma a rare type of brain tumor in her left temporal lobe Doctors told Altom they would have to take out a large portion of Stewarts brain to make sure they got all the cancer cells  They kept saying Brain tumors arent colorcoded so we have to take our best guess  she remembers  Altom asked what was being done to find a better way to treat this cancer but no one had a satisfactory answer So she went to Seattle Childrens Hospital and offered to raise  million to get the research going  Pharmaceutical development is often a dogeatdog world Olson says Scientists clamor to be the first to identify new medications that can be sold to lots of patients to gain recognition and recoup the money their company has put into the discovery  It has to be a huge seller to make it worth it he says No company would make a drug that only affects rare diseases Gangliogliomas represent   Altom reached out to Olsons patients past and present and other parents who had lost children to brain tumors They held golf tournaments and sold greeting cards hosting hundreds of fundraisers to pay for the preclinical work on Tumor Paint in Olsons lab   Olson and his team were able to identify a small protein or peptide in the scorpions venom and use it to produce Tumor Paint They grew a brain tumor on a mouses back and injected the paint into a tail vein within an hour the cancer was lighting up Tumor Paint was   than an MRI and it didnt just work for brain cancer but breast skin prostate and colon cancers  Olson founded   in  to run human clinical trials and commercialize Tumor Paint The biotech company is on track to start enrollment for trials in Australia in December CEO Heather Franklin said  In a matter of  years surgeons will look back and say I cant believe we used to remove tumors by using our eyes and our fingers and our thumbs  Olson says  Olson is continuing his work with optides or optimized peptides Six months ago he launched   at the   Scientists there are using the drugs created by nature  such as scorpion venom  to find ways to fight disease  Olson uses a potato to explain how evolution has helped plants and animals create some of the best drug candidates around A potato is just a ball of starch underground right So is a pile of noodles  But while the potato can emerge after weeks unscathed a pile of noodles underground would be eaten by bugs in hours Potatoes Olson said have created a drug to protect themselves If he can harness the potatos DNA to create medicine it could potentially protect humans from disease  Project Violet will use crowdsourcing to fund its research Citizens can adopt drug candidates for  and name them as they go through the discovery process Each candidate is a variation of a protein made from a plant or animal  First and foremost Im a parent Olson says in a video about Project Violet that was a finalist in the   this year And when I know a child is going to die and the prescriptions Im writing might make them live a couple weeks longer but arent going to save their lives  theres nothing harder than that And that drives my research  His lab has an open policy  researchers share everything they learn in hopes of inspiring others Altom with other patient families recently presented Olson with a check for  to create a library of information from Project Violet that will be available to scientists around the globe  Were creating drug candidates  that could fundamentally change the world he says Were throwing motives of profit or biotech building to the wind Lets do whats right for the greatest number of people  When her daughter had her tumor removed some  years ago Altom waited anxiously in the hospital room for her to wake up When the child opened her eyes and began complaining about the tubes in her arm Altom burst into tears I thought it was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard  Stewart Carlson now  attends George Washington University She occasionally has trouble remembering verbal information but is otherwise a healthy happy young woman They got lucky Altom says Thats why she continues to raise money for research  I always tell Jim Olson that I want to be able to look him in the eye when someone has a brain tumor and say At least they didnt break their leg because well be able to diagnose and treat tumors so effectively
