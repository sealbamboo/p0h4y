The lighting in the NPR newsroom isnt doing me any favors Maybe its time to get some work done Then again cosmetic surgery makes people look only about three years younger and no more attractive according to a study that tries to add some objectivity to a very subjective field of medicine The researchers took before and after photos of  people who underwent facial cosmetic surgery at a private practice in Toronto The patients ranged in age from  to  Some had facelifts and necklifts others had browlifts or had their eyelids done Independent raters were given photos and asked to guess the ages of the people and rate their attractiveness on a  to  scale None of the raters had before and after photos of the same person so they couldnt compare surgerys effects on an individual The raters guessed the people were two years younger on average before surgery than they were in real life and five years younger after surgery There was no significant difference in attractiveness scores The   were published online in the journal   Three years of purchased juvenescence doesnt sound like such a great deal especially when a facelift can cost  to  once you add surgeon and hospital fees Thats at least  for each extra year of nipped and tucked youth So I called the studys lead author Joshua Zimm to learn more Zimms now an attending surgeon at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York and also has a   on New Yorks tony Upper East Side so he knows all about client expectations This study was prompted by a dearth of objective measurements in the literature Zimm says that made it hard for cosmetic surgeons to quantify the benefits of their art We think people will look younger but we dont typically tell people that because we dont want to create unrealistic expectations Instead he says a plastic surgeon will tell a prospective patient that they will look  more refreshed or less tired We dont usually use the buzzwords Youre going to look X percentage points younger or X percentage points more attractive  But wouldnt it be nice if they could Zimm says he and his colleagues were surprised that the improvements in age werent greater But that could be due to a number of factors he says including the fact that the people in the study had different procedures Youre not going to see as dramatic improvements in age or attractiveness with a browlift he explains in comparison to a lift of both the face and the neck I think that could have brought down our numbers One of the few other studies that tried to objectively quantify improvements in appearance found that people who had facelifts looked seven years younger Zimm and his colleagues plan to continue the research refining their study design The gold standard he says would be to compare results of multiple surgeons doing the same procedure Thats the ideal But in the meantime people contemplating a touchup are left with little more than those before and after photos in cosmetic surgery ads And how reliable are those Typically when you see these before and afters youre going to see the surgeons best results Zimm says Youre not going to see his average results Youre not going to see his mediocre results The ads can give people false hope Zimm adds given that the face the surgeon will have to work with may look nothing like the one in the ad Your surgeon should explain this all and set the stage for realistic expectations
