For Hanukkah season I decided to focus this weeks Recipes for Health on something other than vegetable latkes as I have done the last few years Instead I have given some thought to what the latke tradition is all about oil In fact in other parts of the world the notsohealthy Hanukkah tradition is not potato pancakes fried in oil but pastries fried in oil like doughnuts  I used plenty of oil in this weeks recipes but not as much as latkes require The theme here is skilletcooked vegetables For most of the dishes my oil of choice is olive oil as I instinctively turn toward the Mediterranean when I am working with produce However I can easily imagine all of these dishes reconfigured for an Indian palate with Indian spices and a neutral oil like grapeseed oil or ghee or both used as fats   I chose vegetables that will brown a bit in a hot skillet  winter squash and brussels sprouts carrots and potatoes  and in several of the dishes I sneaked in some greens that had been previously blanched or wilted in the pan They wont crisp up or caramelize but I love the way they enrich and contribute valuable nutrients to a recipe From time to time I throw in some red or black quinoa as well not as a main ingredient but almost as a garnish In one dish spaghetti squash served on a bed of spinach I used two different oils olive oil for cooking and walnut oil for drizzling  And just between us I took the leftover spaghetti squash mixed it with a beaten egg and some matzo meal and made some latkes
