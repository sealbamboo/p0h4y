To anesthesiologists laughing gas is no joke Nitrous oxide was one of the first chemicals used to make surgery and toothpulling painless Back in the s   a dentist in Hartford Conn did his best to popularize it as an anesthetic agent Despite some failed demonstrations early on use of the gas during surgery eventually became routine But is it safe There have been nagging questions about whether nitrous oxide during surgery   Use of the gas during operations has declined in recent years in part because of those concerns But its still a common ingredient in the mix that anesthesiologists give to patients Now theres some reassurance from a study out of Washington University in St Louis Researchers there looked at some factors that have been associated with heart trouble and how nitrous oxide affects them One of those factors is an amino acid called   which has been associated with a higher risk of heart problems Some people have lots of homocysteine in their blood because of their genes Breathing nitrous oxide also causes homocysteine to jump regardless of your genetic makeup contributing to worries about heart risks It turns out that vitamin B and folic acid another B vitamin can knock homocysteine right back down to size And its common for doctors to give patients a dose of one of those vitamins to counteract the nitrous oxide effect If youre still with me these doctors in St Louis decided to check patients   an indicator of heart damage found in the blood after they had surgery under nitrous oxide The doctors also kept track of cardiac problems that cropped up Half the  patients in the completed study got B vitamins and half didnt The doctors also checked patients for the genetic factors that raise homocysteine What happened Nothing much The vitamins worked to lower homocysteine after nitrous oxide exposure as expected But that didnt make a clinical difference in terms of troponin measured or heart attacks Patients who didnt get the B vitamins did no worse than those who got them In its entirety its a really negative study Washington University anesthesiologist   tells Shots And in this case thats a good thing The main result is neither the B vitamin treatment nor the genetic variant made any difference on cardiac events or troponin It just shows that you dont need to give patients B vitamins or worry about the genetic variant The   in the July issue of   Separately  patients got surgery without nitrous oxide and served as a comparison group Their troponin levels after surgery were about the same as those in the main study The rate of heart attacks in the group that didnt get nitrous was a little higher  about  percent compared with  percent in the group that got nitrous This comparison wasnt random so its not a clearcut win for nitrous however A more definitive answer to the question about nitrous oxides safety may come when the results of patient study called   are revealed later this year The study begun in  is the largest nitrous safety trial to date Researchers on that trial are looking specifically at patients undergoing major surgery who also happen to be at risk for cardiovascular disease A   about the Washington University trial by the Australian anesthesiologist Paul Myles says its a very good study that deserves our attention Still Myles leader of the ENIGMA trial cautions against taking too much solace from the results He writes that the anesthesiology community is deep in the zone of uncertainty and this reality needs to be acknowledged
