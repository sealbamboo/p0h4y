The American Psychiatric Association is about to release an updated version of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders The DSM helps mental health professionals decide who has problems such as depression anxiety and schizophrenia Psychiatrys new manual   has been nearly  years in the making During that time scientists have learned a lot about the brain Yet despite some tweaks to categories such as autism and mood disorders DSM is remarkably similar to the version issued in  There are lots of changes throughout the manual that reflect the research in the last  years says   a clinical psychiatrist at Columbia University who was involved in creating both DSMIV and DSM The  abandoned Roman numerals for the new manual But because that kind of research hasnt allowed for a paradigm shift the DSM is not a paradigm shift either First says Specifically DSM will continue to use symptoms as the primary way to decide whether a person has a particular disorder That may not sound odd until you consider whats happened in other fields of medicine like cardiology If you go to a hospital with chest pain these days chances are youll get a diagnosis based on tests of the electrical activity in your heart the enzymes in your blood and the blood flow through your arteries But if your problem is emotional pain your diagnosis will probably be based on a conversation So why is psychiatry still so lastcentury Scientists say it has to do with the nature of the brain itself When psychiatrists began work on DSM they expected to come up with a document that would signal a new era in mental health care First says We were hoping and imagining that research would advance at a pace that laboratory tests would have come out he says And here we are  years later and we still unfortunately rely primarily on symptoms to make our diagnoses Thats not ideal First says Not for doctors Not for patients Not for scientists The problem is that the new DSM is still classifying mental disorders based on their surface appearance not their underlying biology And the history of science shows that appearances can be deceiving Take hippos for example Early naturalists thought hippos must be related to pigs After all they look somewhat alike and have similar teeth But fossils and genetic studies showed that hippos closest living relatives are actually dolphins and whales So to avoid the hippo problem many areas of medicine have begun to look beneath the superficial appearance of an illness For literally centuries doctors have looked at diseases using signs and symptoms says   an oncologist who is chancellor of the University of California San Francisco So she says doctors would ask questions like Do you have a lump somewhere But now many scientists are concerned that this emphasis on the signs and symptoms of a disease could be seen as holding us back DesmondHellman says Instead shes been advocating something called precision medicine which tries to classify diseases in a way that indicates whats truly causing the problem A good example of this new approach is breast cancer DesmondHellman says Im a cancer doctor and had the incredible opportunity to work on revolutionizing how we treat breast cancer based on whats in your DNA thats signaling the breast cancer to grow she says And its a wonderful opportunity because if a patient has a breast cancer thats driven by something in the genome we can turn it off This revolution happened in part because cancer researchers looked beyond the old way of classifying tumors according to simply what body part they appeared in DesmondHellman says And something similar needs to happen in mental health because she says everything from autism to Alzheimers is classified in ways that clearly dont work today DesmondHellman adds that shes not criticizing psychiatrists or psychologists for using the DSM Its still the best option because there still arent genetic tests or brain scans that offer a better way to classify patients with mental disorders So why havent researchers developed simple lab tests for mental disorders Weve tried says   director of the National Institute of Mental Health You know weve actually looked  using brain imaging using various endocrine tests looking at a range of other kinds of biomarkers So far that has been found wanting For example researchers tried for many years to find a genetic test or a brainscanning technique that could identify people with depression That approach would make sense if scientists knew that all depression can be linked to the same underlying problem But what if it cant Insel says What if depression is like a fever Some people who have a fever have a bacterial infection some a viral infection some an endocrine problem Insel says a whole range of reasons why that would be your presenting symptom and a whole range of different treatments that you need for each of those causes So a few years ago the NIMH began moving away from research based on categories defined only by symptoms Instead its pushing an approach it calls   that emphasizes basic functions in the brain Researchers might get money to study circuits involved in fear or socalled working memory This sort of research has the potential to uncover problems in the brain that will change the way mental disorders are classified Insel says A biological thing that presents with depression in some people might present with psychosis or anxiety in others he says And so maybe what youll find is a problem that cuts across the current diagnostic categories Insel says findings like that are years off Maybe theyll get here in time for the next version of the DSM Maybe Michael First the psychiatrist who spent much of his career   says hes learned to be cautious about anticipating major advances in any problem that affects the brain Back in the s when he was writing a guidebook to DSMIV First says he made an unfortunate prediction about Alzheimers I stuck my neck out he says We said that by the time DSM comes out Alzheimers will be the first diagnosis that has a laboratory test That hasnt happened Even though scientists have learned a huge amount about the plaques and tangles associated with Alzheimers and even though hightech scans can reveal ever more subtle changes in the brains of people with the disease theres still no lab test thats good enough to diagnose Alzheimers First says migraine headaches are another brain problem still waiting for a lab test If you have a headache and you go to a neurologist even though they might run some blood tests the actual diagnosis of a migraine vs a cluster headache depends on the description of the symptoms he says So psychiatry is not unique In fact almost every specialty that deals with the brain has run into the same roadblocks facing psychiatrists The brain is very very complicated and it really hasnt yielded its secrets yet First says And that he says is the primary reason mental health isnt more like cardiology or oncology why psychiatrists and psychologists still rely on symptoms rather than lab tests The human brain is the most complicated thing in the universe It has nearly  billion neurons and many trillions of connections and its complex wiring changes all the time But the daunting complexity of the brain is no reason to give up on the DSM or the ability of mental health professionals to treat mental disorders First says When people walk into our offices they come for help not some explanation of the neurobiology of whats going on he says They want some relief of suffering and the DSM remains the most valuable tool for psychiatrists to be able to do that
