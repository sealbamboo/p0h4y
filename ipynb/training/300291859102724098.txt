By now youve no doubt heard that a surgeon in Florida Dr Adam Ostrzenski has claimed to have found the   of the   In a study published online in   Dr Ostrzenski details his finding of the disputed female pleasure zone deep inside the front vaginal wall of a recently deceased yearold Polish woman But while Ostrzenskis study has given rise to loud cheers of Finally in some quarters others have taken a more skeptical view of his findings A commentary on the study by three   experts including Dr Beverly Whipple coauthor of the groundbreaking  book   also published in  is pretty scathing in its critique We submit that the authors claim to have discovered the Gspot does not fulfill the most fundamental scientific criteria the experts write They go on to say that Ostrzenski is lacking the evidence to prove his claim and that In the absence of such evidence it is not valid for the author to claim more than that he has identified a possible anatomic constituent of whatever is the Gspot  a still scientifically unresolved issue So whats the deal here Is this the classic case of a man claiming hes found a womans Gspot only to be told Thats not it The truth appears to be well confusing The commentators in   appear to be willing to grant Ostrzenski that the structure he is calling the Gspot is possibly something significant But they also say his reducing the Gspot to one discrete anatomical structure betrays the rich complexity of what others have appreciated and characterized as the Gspot  a variable anatomical and functional zone of erotogenic complexity not a single structural entity In essense theyre saying what he may have found is just a part of the Gspot but not its entirety The commentators wariness about narrowly defining zones of female sexual pleasure is echoed in a   about Ostrzenskis study on Kinsey Confidential the sexual health and information website of the famed Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex Gender and Reproduction In the post doctoral candidate Kristen Mark warns against hype around the existence of the Gspot as the central pleasure point saying such focus could result in an increase in dodgy and dangerous medical procedures claiming to enhance womens Gspot function Mark also makes the very reasonable sounding point that instead of researchers desperately trying to hit the Gspot more emphasis should be placed on the diversity found in womens sexual pleasure and directed away from one anatomical structure being responsible for pleasure Still given the decadeslong debate on the Gspot and the fact that several sexual health experts including our own Dr Laura Berman not to mention women the world over swear it exists it seems unlikely the search will stop anytime soon
