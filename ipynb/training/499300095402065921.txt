Hospitals in Africa are almost always teeming with people In addition to patients waiting for care friends and relatives are usually gathered on the hospital grounds But in the Liberian capital Monrovia Ebola has silenced   It is completely shut Samuel Bowman  is the medical director of the facility When we met today outside his living quarters at the back of the hospital compound Bowman had just heard on the radio that Father Miguel Pajares a Spanish priest who worked at St Josephs and contracted Ebola had died in a Madrid hospital where hed been evacuated Bowman says St Josephs wasnt even supposed to treat Ebola patients but some ended up on its wards In the process our hospital director became infected by one of the patients Bowman says He has subsequently died And those who had direct contact with him They got infected Bowman counts off on his fingers those others infected A brother two sisters two of our staff nurses the social worker And a laboratory technician Liberia is ranked by the United Nations as the fifth poorest country on earth And its the poorest and smallest of the four countries that have so far been hit by the Ebola outbreak Liberia has registered almost  cases and has the fastest growing rate of infection Arguably it is the least prepared to deal with the deadly virus Bowman says the bed hospital had only a handful of the fullbody protective suits which have become the standard for treating Ebola patients They had so few Bowman says that they had to use them sparingly Founded in the s St Josephs touts itself as the oldest continuously operating hospital in the country It stayed open throughout the bloody brutal regimes and rebel wars of the s But unable to contain Ebola St Josephs shut its gates two weeks ago This was right after the controversial case of Patrick Sawyer a LiberianAmerican businessman Sawyer brought his sister to St Josephs for treatment and after she died of Ebola he flew to Nigeria sparking the outbreak there He also died of the virus The original closure of St Josephs was supposed to last a month Bowman says the idea was for the facility to regroup and the wards to be disinfected I asked him if the hospital has been disinfected Not yet he says I asked him who is supposed to do that Well he says the Ministry of Health is supposed We are still waiting While they wait Bowman has had to turn away pregnant women kids with broken arms and patients with diarrhea and malaria whom the hospital used to treat routinely Then there are his colleagues who are still being treated at the Ebola isolation unit of another Monrovia hospital Its quite hard he says Its hard for even those of us here doing nothing Many of us are not used to sitting idle Its distressing to see our workers being infected by the virus and to see that a number of them have died Even this morning he was making arrangements for another funeral of another staff member who died yesterday
