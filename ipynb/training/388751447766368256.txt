Not right away The only thing required of employers at the start is that they notify workers that the new health insurance exchanges have opened You may have received a letter from your employer to this effect  you probably dont need to do anything Starting in  large employers with  or more workers have a responsibility  but no mandate  to offer employees health coverage If they dont they may face fines but only if their workers go to health insurance exchanges and have earnings low enough to qualify for federal subsidies Stores and restaurants  less likely to offer health insurance in the past  may be most affected The coverage rule doesnt affect workers who put in less than  hours a week There are no responsibilities for small employers with fewer than  workers If they want to buy coverage for their employees the insurance exchanges represent a new option for them in terms of where to shop Certain employers with fewer than  workers are eligible for federal tax credits To qualify the company has to cover at least half of the premium for all of its employees and also have average wages of less than  For details on these tax credits   A number of employers have been overhauling the health benefits they offer employees citing rising costs There are two themes to what they are doing In trying to control their own spending employers often are shifting health costs to employees So the average annual deductible for an individual  what consumers pay before insurance kicks in  nearly doubled in the past seven years from  in  to  this year   the Kaiser Family Foundation But employers arent just making workers pay more Theyre trying to make them think more about healthrelated expenses and behavior Companies such as grocer Kroger Co   for particular drugs or procedures giving patients incentive to shop around for the best price   to workers who adopt healthy lifestyles Penalizing smokers with surcharges is one of the few discriminatory measures the health act allows Nothing in the Affordable Care Act says that employers have to cover parttime workers The law defines part time as someone who works less than  hours a week Some employers that have offered parttime workers minimal coverage   have dropped it on the grounds that those workers can now find coverage through the insurance exchanges Most workers in this situation will be pleased with the outcome Theyll likely find better coverage than what they had for less money Although depending on the situation some people may see their premiums go up  of employers holding back on hiring in order to stay under the employee threshold that triggers health insurance responsibilities There also have been reports of employers cutting workers hours to below  per week so that they dont count as fulltime While there is anecdotal evidence of both things happening theres no evidence that those cases have added up to a broader drag on the economy as a whole Some companies including UPS have decided to   if they have access to coverage at their own jobs The health law does not require employers to cover spouses but   that only a minority of companies have implemented a spousal exclusion However employers increasingly offer incentives to get spouses off their plans They may charge workers extra if a covered spouse has access to other insurance or they may pay bonuses when spouses are not on the company policy The health law requires employers who offer coverage to employees to also offer coverage to dependent children or pay a penalty COBRA is a transitional arrangement that allows you to stay on a former employers health insurance for up to  months after youve stopped working for them Its expensive You pay the entire premium  including any share the employer had previously paid on your behalf  plus a  percent administrative fee Whether your COBRA rate will go up depends entirely on what happens with your former employers health insurance plans If their rates go up so will yours Youll likely see a higher increase than your former coworkers however Thats because their premiums may be subsidized by the employer whereas yours are not Many people who might have used COBRA will find that   But pay close attention to when the enrollment period for the exchanges are Those dates are in our   People who enroll in COBRA and later decide they want to switch to an exchange plan generally wont be allowed to do so until the exchanges next annual open enrollment period An exception would be if they exhaust their COBRA coverage See other Frequently Asked Questions on the Affordable Care Act Additional coverage from NPR Member Stations
