Food labels have become battlegrounds Just last week voters in Washington state narrowly defeated a measure that would have required food manufacturers to reveal whether their products contain genetically modified ingredients Supporters of the initiative  and similar proposals in other states  say that consumers have a right to know what theyre eating But there are lots of things we might want to know about our food So what belongs on the label I went to four deep thinkers about food and asked them what theyd most like to see labeled Whats the most important thing to know about food if youre trying to be a healthconscious responsible consumer I started with   director of the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota On Twitter Foley is GlobalEcoGuy Foley was reluctant to give an answer at first simple labels can be misleading he said But eventually he came up with his top three label suggestions First deforestation yes or no he said In other words did people cut down trees to grow this food Thats been happening in Indonesia and Malaysia to make room for palm oil plantations According to Foley he cant think of a bigger hammer to the environment than deforestation Second Foley continued How much water did it take and from where Farmers around the world have been draining rivers and underground aquifers to water their crops And No  how much fertilizer did it take and did you manage to keep it from running off Fertilizer runoff from farms has choked lakes and estuaries from China to the Chesapeake Bay Of course the state of our environment certainly isnt the only thing to think about with food I just want to know that folks are getting paid a basic living wage says writer   For her book   McMillan went undercover and worked in the vegetable fields of California There are field workers who dont even earn a minimum wage she says Some workers get cheated out of their pay People have worried about this sort of thing with imported food she said It led to Fair Trade coffee and bananas and the presumption was you didnt need something like that for the US because we had labor laws that were enforced enough that anything in the US would have been produced under acceptable labor conditions And thats unfortunately no longer the case McMillan says This idea was echoed by   cofounder of the    Nierenberg calls it a food think tank Shed love to see food get a grade based on how farmworkers were treated as well as farm animals  something that made it clear to consumers that this was a product where we did our best to make it fairly justly and humanely Its important to keep it simple she says If a label is complicated people just get confused People are so bombarded with information particularly around food that they dont know what to choose and they dont really realize the impact of what theyre eating on their personal health Nierenberg says This is exactly the problem that my last big thinker wants to solve Michael Jacobson is the grand old man of food labels Hes executive director of the watchdog group   Twenty years ago we led the effort to get nutrition facts labels on foods Jacobson says Now theyre there Everybody loves them But they havent had much impact on the American diet So Jacobson now believes we dont need more fine print about sodium and sugar We need something that grabs peoples attention A label that would spur them to choose healthier foods Jacobson wants to put some sort of symbol or number right on the front of the package that gives food a grade Youd give food credit for all the good stuff in it such as vitamins and minerals Youd take away points for trans fat salt saturated fat and come up with a red dot or the number  or whatever Jacobson says this label should just focus on whether foods are good for you The other things  worker conditions environmental impact  may be interesting but I dont think you can turn a food label into an encyclopedia he says On the other hand it is possible with modern technology to make labels both small and encyclopedic Foley the Global Eco Guy says that his dream would be a bar code that you could scan with your smartphone to get details about everything in that package all the ingredients where they were grown and how Even if most people didnt bother looking up that information he says it still would be powerful If companies had to think about all those details and really disclose them more I think youd see some pretty dramatic shifts in how they operate It could affect everything that our food touches forests water wages and health
