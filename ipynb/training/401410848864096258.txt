Bit by bit over the past few decades scientists have been building a new understanding of the ways that air pollution threatens human health Much of their attention has been focused on lung diseases including cancers With good reason it turns out just last month the World Health Organization declared air pollution to be one of the planets    But cardiovascular disease is much more common than cancer Sadly there is now a pile of evidence sometimes startling that air pollution also plays a role in heart attacks and strokes The new studies suggest that air pollution not only worsens cardiovascular disease  but    Weve known for about  years that we see increased risk of heart attack and stroke in association with increased levels of air pollution said Sara Adar a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan The most recent data show that air pollution does more than just make you worse Scientists like Dr Adar have been studying   adrift in the cloud of unfriendly gases shrouding many of our communities Measuring  micrometers or microns or less these bits of material are so tiny that it would take about  of them to equal the diameter of a human hair  A series of studies has found that they penetrate deep into the lungs embedding in tissue and setting off a cascade of inflammatory effects  Researchers believe the inflammation also spreads into the circulatory system altering the way blood vessels function  Although air pollution is a longrecognized and regulated health hazard only gradually have researchers come to appreciate the threat of particulates In  C Arden Pope III a professor of economics at Brigham Young University published a paper based on the temporary shutdown of a nearby steel mill showing   He traced the illnesses to particulates in the air  Dr Pope originally had focused on air pollutions effects on the lungs but over the years he kept turning up increases in cardiovascular disease By  Id given up on the idea that this was just some anomaly in the study design he recalled in an interview Eventually he identified the culprit fine particles far smaller than those tracked in his original steel mill study  The deeper you dive into the data the more clearly you see the effect on cardiovascular disease Dr Pope said  Dr Adar and her colleagues have been tracking the damage at the microscopic level in the   MESA Air which has followed more than  people in six states for more than a decade It is funded primarily by the National Institutes of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency Researchers working with the project have contributed to an increasingly precise understanding of risks associated with fine particles that float in polluted air Dr Adar and her colleagues have shown for instance that increased exposure to pollutants after other factors are factored out can be directly linked to   and to a steady thickening of artery walls  Their most recent study published this year in PLoS Medicine described a nearlinear relationship as air pollution levels dropped   When exposure to air pollutants increased signs of damage increased  The MESA Air study also has reinforced a sense that vehicle exhaust may be unusually harmful Researchers in the United States and many other countries have linked traffic pollution to heart rate variability in a range of people  from vehicle drivers to bicyclists traveling congested roadways  A study published this year in Environmental Health found evidence of acute changes in heartbeats in people aged  to    Another recent study of bicyclists in Ottawa found that their   in ways unrelated to exertion  Theres increasing evidence that theres something about trafficrelated pollution in particular said Dr Joel D Kaufman an epidemiologist at the University of Washington in Seattle  Vehicle emissions are thought to include an unusually high proportion of very small or ultrafine particles allowing them to penetrate deeper into the body Researchers say there is also some evidence that the shape of these particles gives them an unusually high surface area which permits other contaminants to stick onto them As a result they may actually concentrate toxic compounds in polluted air  The evidence is pretty overwhelming that fine particles do harm said Dr Russell V Luepker a cardiologist and epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health a coauthor of two scientific reports on air pollution for the American Heart Association  But he added health choices  such as poor diet smoking and lack of exercise  and conditions such as hypertension still pose greater risks If we got rid of air pollution heart disease would not disappear Dr Luepker said   Researchers studying the health effects of air pollution are starting to look at ways that their findings can be used for greater protection Dr Adar and her colleagues are looking for ways to better identify and control the most dangerous vehicle emissions while other scientists are pondering everything from improved air purifiers to particleabsorbing barriers But one of the most effective responses is environmental regulation  Several decades of clean air regulations in the United States have had lifesaving effects A study published this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association estimated that there has been   including cardiovascular diseases in the United States since  Our public policy efforts to reduce air pollution are one of the most effective medical interventions in the last  to  years Dr Pope said
