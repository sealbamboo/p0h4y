Adolescents treated with the antidepressant fluoxetine  better known by its commercial name Prozac  appear to undergo changes in brain signaling that result in changed behavior well into adulthood says a new study Adult mice and rats who were administered Prozac for a stretch of midadolescence responded to daunting social and physical challenges with less despair than animals who passed their teen years unmedicated a team of researchers found But even as adults long separated from their antidepressant days the Prozac veterans reacted to stressful situations with greater anxiety than did the adult Prozac virgins The latest research published Wednesday in the Journal of Neuroscience offers evidence that treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  an SSRI antidepressant  has longlived effects on the developing brain It also zeroes in on how and where fluoxetine effects those lasting changes by modifying the cascade of chemical signals issued by the brains ventral tegmentum  a region active in mood regulation  in stressful situations Yet the new research raises more questions than it answers since the changes in adults who were treated with Prozac as adolescents seem contradictory Sensitivity to stress appears to predispose one to developing depression So how does a medication that treats depression in children and teens  and that continues to protect them from depression as adults  also heighten their sensitivity to stress These findings underscore the complexity of drug and intracellular manipulations in the immature brain the authors write Perhaps anxiety and depression  often treated as if they were indistinguishable  have a far more complicated relationship to one another than has been appreciated Perhaps they suggest the chemical signaling changes brought about by Prozac treatment have surprising and contradictory effects somewhere else in the brain Or perhaps the adolescent brain and the adult brain respond differently to stress so that a Prozac effect unseen in adolescence will become evident in adulthood Answering such questions should be urgent given that an estimated  of US children are expected to experience a bout of major depression  and that at last count in  some  of American adolescents were prescribed an antidepressant The current study was conducted by a team of researchers from Cal State San Bernardino Florida State University Mount Sinai School of Medicine University of Maryland and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Starting  days after the animals birth  the equivalent of midadolescence for such rats and mice  the researchers put large groups of undepressed animals first through a day regimen either of daily Prozac or a placebo and then returned them to live peacefully in their cages until they were adults  about  days old The researchers then put the mice and rats through a gantlet of psychological tests that reliably reveal the presence or absence of depression and anxiety in the animals In one that tests the animals response to social defeat a mouse or rat is housed in sight of and briefly exposed to a highly aggressive peer every day for  days then afforded the opportunity to socialize with a new more peaceable peer The resilient will gladly socialize the socially beaten will withdraw to a corner In another mice or rats are dropped into a bowl of water from which they cant escape The resilient keep swimming persistent in their efforts to escape The depressed quickly give up exerting only enough effort to keep their nose above water to breathe In both of those tests mice and rats treated with Prozac as adolescents proved significantly more resilient than those who got a placebo But in the elevatedplus maze which tests anxiety behavior rats and mice who had been treated with Prozac as adolescents showed themselves more sensitive to stress Dropped in a maze under lowlight conditions timid stressed animals tend to stay in enclosed areas where they feel more protected while bolder creatures strike out for the mazes open spaces In the current experiments Prozactreated animals showed greater anxiety and retreated to the mazes covered parts more than did those who had gotten placebo in their youth The researchers found that among mice and rats who exhibited more resilient behaviors and those treated with Prozac there was more evidence that a protein called brainderived neurotrophic factor was actively at work in the ventral tegmentum The work may help shed light on biomarkers that could predict an adolescents propensity toward depression and his likely response to antidepressant treatment And it certainly underscores that medicating depression in adolescence has longterm effects that can change an adults behavior in ways that are both positive and slightly worrisome
