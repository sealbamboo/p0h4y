Disease detectives are going through the painstaking task of tracking down people who could conceivably have been infected by a health care worker who came down with the mysterious MERS virus while traveling from Saudi Arabia to the United States The yearold man who is not being identified is the   of MERS in the United States Health officials say they are looking up everyone who traveled with the passenger on four separate flights as well as family members and everyone he may have been in close contact with in the US Is it worthwhile It probably wont turn up any cases the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says But its the best way to be sure the virus doesnt spread quietly and the agency has to do it The risk to the general public remains very low CDCs Dr Anne Schuchat told reporters Its out of an abundance of caution that we want to contact everybody on the flights Its going to be a big job On May  this person departed Jeddah Saudi Arabia and traveled by airplane to London England Schuchat said He flew from London to Boston then to Atlanta and finally to Orlando Thats a lot of flights and even though the CDC only checks people who may have sat close to the patient for a long time its still hundreds of people Were dealing with over  passengers just on the last three flights says Dr Marty Cetron of CDCs Division of Global Migration and Quarantine The flights were full he said Cetron who has led investigations into disease outbreaks from measles to tuberculosis bird flu to Lassa fever says its better to be safe than sorry with a new virus that people dont fully understand Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS  in  But its deadly killing a quarter of the more than  patients its infected so far That gets the attention of health officials And its a distant cousin of severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS which flashed around the world in  after starting in China SARS killed  people and infected  before it was stopped using painstaking methods such as tracking down anyone who might be infected before they could infect anyone else and using   There was welldocumented airplane transmission of SARS coronavirus among air passengers Cetron told NBC News CDC officials agree its very unlikely the Florida patient actually infected anyone else Even though he started feeling sick on the first flight he didnt feel terrible He had fever chills and a slight cough By the time the person arrived at their destination they were not ill enough to seek care until later on Schuchat said He didnt show up at the hospital in Florida until May  Theres no documented case of anyone having been infected with MERS via what health experts call casual contact  sitting next to someone on an airplane for instance This virus has not shown the ability to spread easily from person to person Schuchat said Its not nearly as infectious as a virus like measles which can spread through the air or even as infectious as flu which is transmitted before people begin getting sick and which can infect hundreds before doctors are even aware its circulating A full onefifth of the  reported MERS cases have been health care workers most of whom were intensively caring for MERS patients Others were family members who were tending to patients That said the first known case of MERS in the US an Indiana man told officials he did not remember having been in contact with any MERS patients at the hospital where he worked in Riyadh although MERS was being treated in that hospital That leaves open the possibility of some unknown means of transmission  bits of virus on a surface perhaps or transmission by people not showing symptoms So CDC is tracking down people on the flights to Boston Atlanta and Orlando while other health experts are working to find people on the flight from Jeddah to London On a case like this Cetron says that means going to surge capacity People are pulled in from other divisions and public health students who are working at CDC are drafted to volunteer Our basic strategy is to try and personally reach every individual either from the CDC operations center or sometimes we can get the state or local health departments to help Volunteers usually have a script to read that aims to get information without alarming the passenger Theyre then told what symptoms to be on the alert for and told what to do if they do get sick This time its an exceptionally complicated case CDC and international health officials are tracking down residents of six countries Some are still gone Cetron said They may still be traveling They may be in hotels They may be on vacation Its easier to find people from international flights because they must show their passports and the numbers are recorded US domestic travelers give far less personal information At the end of the process Cetron says CDC often tries to contact everyone once more to ensure they are all right They are being notified right now so there are teams making calls as we speak Schuchat added The flight was on May  Today is May  The incubation period for MERS we believe is often around five days with an outer limit of  days It is likely that if you already havent developed symptoms you probably arent going to A few people will also be asked for blood specimens to see if they may have been infected by MERS without getting sick That kind of information is very important for understanding how the virus spreads and how dangerous it is CDC has already logged more than  staff hours on this Cetron says We try to get people a day off every seven or so because it is really hard to sustain this kind of pace he said You never know how long a situation can last Theres the ontheground checking also This gets replicated in state and local settings Cetron said Relatives and other close contacts must also be found Hospitals have to do a reconstruction of the patients exposures to other patients and visitors until he got into isolation In the Indiana case officials said surveillance cameras and other tracking devices helped Staff have an ID that tells us where they are on the floor at all times said Dr Alan Kumar of Munster Community Hospital which treated the first US MERS patient It tells us when they entered a room how long they were in the room he added It gives the CDC a wealth of surveillance data Even though he sought care the patient in Florida is in good condition and improving said Dr Antonio Crespo infectious disease specialist and chief quality officer for Dr P Phillips Hospital in Orlando We are taking every precaution but believe the risk of transmission from this patient is very low since his symptoms were mild and he was not coughing when he arrived at the hospital The first US patient who has been released from the Munster hospital also does not appear to have infected anybody else Very close contacts such as family members will stay home voluntarily until the end of the longest potential incubation period And as was the case in Indiana  health workers who treated the patient before they took full MERS precautions will be tested and will also stay home until the end of the  days
