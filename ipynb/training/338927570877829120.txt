Uninsured Americans who are hoping the new health insurance law will give them access to weight loss treatments are likely to be disappointed Thats especially the case in the Deep South where obesity rates are among the highest in the nation and states will not require health plans sold on the new online insurance marketplaces to cover medical weight loss treatments like prescription drugs and bariatric surgery Dr Erin Cummins directs the bariatric surgery department at   in the state capital of Jackson She grew up in the Delta her husband is a cotton farmer and although shes petite and fit she understands well enough how Mississippians end up on her operating table You have to realize in the South everything revolves around food Reunions funerals parties  everything revolves around food Cummins says That longstanding food culture as well as other factors like inactivity and poverty have saddled Mississippi with the highest obesity rate in the nation Doctors here are no longer surprised to see somethings with diabetes hypertension sleep apnea heart disease and severe joint pain And the prevalence of severe and superobesity is growing rapidly For those patients bariatric surgery is considered the most effective treatment to induce significant weight loss Cummins describes the procedure Were restricting the stomach size to where a patient isnt going to eat as much Then we reroute the intestines a little bit and realign it to delay digestion so to speak to bypass it So everything a patient eats in a gastric bypass is not going to be absorbed After surgery many of the complications of obesity like sleep apnea and high blood pressure are reversed Multiple   that about  percent of diabetics can stop medication in the first year Medicare and about twothirds of large employers cover bariatric surgery in the US But the procedure is pricey  an average of   and many small employers including those in Mississippi dont cover it When the Affordable Care Act became law in  one goal was to erase those sorts of regional variations in access Our hope was that there would be a single benefit for the entire country and as part of that benefit there would be coverage for obesity treatment says   He is director of bariatric surgery at Stanford University Morton and has led national and state lobbying efforts to get insurance coverage for the surgery But amid worries that a uniform set of benefits would be too expensive in some states and sensitive to the optics of the federal government laying down one rule for all states the US Department of Health and Human Services changed course It decided instead to match benefits to the most popular small group plan sold in each state in essence reflecting local competitive forces Thats led to an odd twist In more than two dozen states obesity treatments  including intensive weight loss counseling drugs and surgery  wont be covered in plans sold on the exchanges Bariatric surgery wont be covered on the exchanges in Alabama Louisiana Arkansas Texas and Mississippi Thats where according to the Centers for Disease Control   Morton applauds the growing awareness around obesity prevention in the US but he says some  million Americans who are already severely obese still need medical treatment If they dont have insurance theyre not going to get the therapy Morton says We see cancer therapy covered routinely We see heart disease covered routinely Why is it that we dont see obesity coverage routinely Therese Hanna Executive Director of the   isnt surprised that obesity treatments are excluded on the insurance exchange in her state She says it all has to do with keeping cost down for many people who will be buying insurance for the first time With the discussions around what should be covered under the exchange within the state a lot of it had to do with balancing cost versus the coverage says Hanna Mississippians who buy insurance on the exchange Hanna says will likely be the cashiers cooks cleaners and construction workers that make up much of the states uninsured And even though many of them will qualify for federal subsidies the price of monthly premiums must be kept low If you try to include everything the cost would be so high that people wouldnt be able to afford the coverage so you defeat the purpose Hanna says The discussion in Mississippi she says has focused on providing care for things like high blood pressure diabetes and heart disease So we have a lot of needs to be covered other than obesity itself
