Brittany Maynard is dead The vivacious year old newlywed with the horrific lethal brain tumor   by taking an overdose of barbiturates prescribed by a physician in Oregon She did nothing illegal Oregon has had a law permitting the terminally ill to request a prescription of lethal drugs for  years The question many are now asking is whether she did something unethical The main arguments against permitting doctors to assist the terminally ill to die on their own terms are that it is not our place to decide when we will die  only God should do so that allowing assisted suicide will inevitably lead to abuses especially of the poor and disabled that there are better choices for the dying in the form of hospice and palliative care and that doctors should not kill None of these arguments is persuasive And if that is so   did nothing immoral when she took a lethal dose of pills The argument that only God may decide when we die is not one that I consider consistent with the view that God created us with free choice If you seek out medical care you are making choices about how long you will live If you drive too fast drink too much smoke to much or fail to get your kids vaccinated then you are making decisions about how soon death comes To see God as having to work through respirators kidney dialysis and heartlung machines to decide when you will die is to trivialize the divine Nor have there been abuses in Oregon or the other state that has had legalized physician assistance in dying for many years  Washington There is no movement to change the laws in these states There are no scandals revealed by police or media investigations of people being coerced or shamed into ending their lives In fact the loudest voices alleging abuses and worrying about slippery slopes come from those who do not live in either state Both Oregon and Washington have strict restrictions on who can get lethal medicines Those restrictions seems to have acted as handrails adequate to prohibit sliding down slippery slopes to abuse Hospice and palliative care should be offered to any terminally ill person Sadly that is not always available in America but both Oregon and Washington have made great strides to ensure that they are in those states Interestingly fewer than  in  terminally ill Oregonians ask for pills and a third of those never take them Doctors should not kill their patients But under Oregon and Washington law the patient has to ask for the pills and take them Brittany Maynard  not her doctor  chose a lethal dose of medicine If I am right and there is a case to be made for the morality of assisted dying for those who are competent terminally ill and who reject hospice as an option then will Brittanys death result in a bigger push to   in other states  Brittany shifted the optics of the debate over physicianassisted suicide A topic of keen interest to the middleaged and elderly suddenly got on the radar of those under  If they engage the subject as they did laws banning the use of marijuana and gay marriage then Brittany may well have the legacy she wanted  greater access for others to the choice she made for herself
