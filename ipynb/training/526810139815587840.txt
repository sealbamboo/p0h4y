First an acknowledgment Insomnia bites S Bliss a reader from Albuquerque comments that even taking Ativan he or she awakens at  am cant get back to sleep and suffers a state of sleep deprivation and eventually a kind of walking exhaustion Molly from San Diego bemoans confusion anxiety exhaustion depression loss of appetite frankly a loss of will to go on all consequences of her sleeplessness She memorably adds Give me Ambien or give me death Marciacornute reports that shes turned to vodka prompting another reader to wonder if Medicare will cover booze After several rounds of similar laments here and not only here insomnia is prevalent among older adults I found the results of   particularly striking What if people who report sleep problems are actually getting enough hours of sleep overall What if theyre not getting significantly less sleep than people who dont complain of insomnia Maybe theres something else going on It has always been difficult to ascertain how much people sleep survey questions are unreliable how can you tell when youve dozed off and wiring people with electrodes creates such an abnormal situation that the results may bear little resemblance to ordinary nightlife Enter the actigraph a wristmotion monitor The machines have gotten better smaller less clunky and more reliable said Linda Waite a sociologist and a coauthor of the study By having  older adults across the United States average age almost  wear actigraphs for three full days Dr Waite and her colleagues could tell when subjects were asleep and when they werent Then they could compare their reported insomnia to their actual sleep patterns Overall in this random sample taken from an ongoing national study of older adults people didnt appear sleepdeprived They fell asleep at  pm on average and awakened at  am After subtracting wakeful periods during the night they slept an average seven and a quarter hours But averages dont tell us much so lets look more closely at their reported insomnia What was surprising to us is that theres very little association between peoples specific sleep problems and what the actigraph shows Dr Waite said One question asked how often people felt rested in the morning The  percent who said they rarely or never did got only four minutes less total sleep than the  percent who reported feeling rested most of the time Its not enough to make any difference Dr Waite said Another question explored problems with falling asleep Those who said they rarely or never had trouble  percent fell asleep in an average  minutes Those who said they had trouble falling asleep most of the time  percent had to wait  minutes That nearly four minutes difference wasnt statistically significant It gets stranger What I asked Diane Lauderdale a coauthor of the new study and an epidemiologist who has studied sleep for a decade what might account for such disparities She listed several possibilities Because actigraphs measure length of sleep but not its quality maybe these older adults werent getting enough deep sleep or delta sleep the kind that makes teenagers hard to rouse but gets rarer with age Maybe those upset about awakening early have undergone a circadian phase shift sleeping earlier in the day to compensate It can be annoying to be awake at  or  but there can still be adequate sleep Dr Lauderdale said Or maybe the same phenomenon like waking up at night makes some sleepers miserable  so they report it as a problem  but hardly bothers others That time youre awake if youre full of anxiety may feel much more important than if you can pass the time calmly she said The researchers controlled for certain sociodemographic characteristics About  percent of the sample used   at least sometimes but this analysis doesnt incorporate that data In asking about feeling rested the researchers may be picking up older peoples views of their overall vitality a function of all kinds of mental and physical health Dr Lauderdale said In general these questions which seem specific are tapping into some underlying dissatisfaction with sleep  and perhaps with other elements of their lives None of these findings or possible explanations trivialize insomnia People who complain of it do have more health problems But less sleep doesnt necessarily correlate with higher mortality rates see   by the Chicago team With actigraph studies well probably learn more about sleep at all ages Dr Lauderdale predicted and it will be full of surprises Things we thought were related to sleep will not be I think well also discover that things we thought werent related to sleep are
