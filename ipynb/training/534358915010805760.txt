A surgeon who contracted Ebola working in Sierra Leone became the second patient to die of the virus in the U.S., less than two days after his arrival for treatment..  Martin Salia was in critical condition when admitted on Saturday to the Nebraska Medical Center’s biocontainment unit in Omaha after a medical evacuation from Freetown, Sierra Leone. He was the 10th Ebola patient to be treated in the U.S. and the second to die, after Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man passed away at a Dallas hospital on Oct. 8.
