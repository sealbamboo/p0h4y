When medical anthropologist Mary Hayden visits her colleague Yofet he tells her Mary you dont need to call before you arrive because I already know youre coming Yoset you see is a traditional healer in northern Uganda The spirit comes over him and tells him how to treat people Hayden tells Shots But recently Yosets practice has expanded beyond the ethereal He and about  other healers and herbalists are helping to track down the plague in Uganda for scientists here in the US We trained traditional healers how to spot the symptoms of the plague says   at the National Center for Atmospheric Research We gave them cellphones with the hospitals number programmed into it And we gave them bicycles so they could help get people to clinics Hayden described the project and its results so far to scientists at a   in Washington DC over the weekend Back in  Hayden and her collaborators at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were using computer models to   where the plague might appear in northwest Uganda The region records about    cases a year But a single infection can mushroom into hundreds more if the bacteria move to a persons lungs and start spreading through the air There was one major obstacle preventing the team from tracking the disease Many villages in rural Uganda dont have medical doctors or nurses to diagnose or treat the plague Most people are  to  kilometers from a health clinic Hayden says When you have the plague youre really sick and youre not walking  to  kilometers But many patients do go see their villages herbalist or healer like Yoset Hayden and her team trained them to spot potential cases of the plague and other severe diseases and then refer the people for modern medical care The witch doctors know they cant do anything for their patients when they have the plague Hayden adds But they dont want to see them die Its a winwin situation The CDCs network of traditional healers in northwestern Uganda has now referred more than a  patients to local hospitals Hayden says The system even helped the CDC stop a case of pneumonic plague the airborne form from spreading through a community Its been an awesome mechanism for enhancing surveillance Hayden says She hopes to expand the network into the Democratic Republic of Congo or even other parts of Africa Many people are surprised that the witch doctors are willing to work with me she says But in the end all it took was asking them  and respecting the work they do
