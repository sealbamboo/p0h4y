 If youre a   your chances of dying from sudden cardiac arrest during a race are extremely slim a new study indicates In the last decade one of every  runners who competed in a US marathon or halfmarathon died the researchers found And most who collapsed had underlying   The findings should reassure those who participate in the sport  and many do with more than  US finishes a year according to David Watt executive director of the American Running Association The study began in  led by Dr Aaron Baggish director of the Cardiovascular Performance Program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston The researchers analyzed the cardiac arrests suffered among competitors in marathons  miles or half marathons  miles through  Of nearly  million US distance runners  had a   meaning their heart suddenly stopped beating Forty occurred in full marathons and the average age of the stricken runners was  Men were at significantly higher risk than women Fortytwo of the cardiac arrests  percent were fatal found the study published in the Jan  issue of the   The average age of those who died was  compared with  for arrest survivors For the study yearly statistics on race participation provided by the trade association Running USA went into a database Researchers identified cardiac arrest cases through a combination of methods including public search engines and contact with race directors They interviewed racers who survived cardiac arrest or next of kin and looked at medical records and autopsy data This information was available for  of the  affected runners A condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was the definite or likely cause of death for  runners they determined The condition is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is essentially an overgrown heart muscle which usually comes from some genetic abnormality explained Dr Kirk Garratt clinical director of interventional cardiology research at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City Nine who died of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had additional heart conditions such as obstructive coronary artery disease congenital disorders and myocarditis an inflammation of the heart muscle One interesting finding prevalence of coronary artery disease was low Garratt said One runner died of heat stroke and another of hyponatremia which can occur when a person drinks too much fluid without taking in enough sodium Two were presumed to have died of arrhythmia an abnormal heart rhythm A key factor in survival was receipt of cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR from race bystanders said Baggish the cardiologist for the Boston Marathon Were actually going to be for the first time offering CPR training to runners this year who come to Boston for our marathon Baggish said Prompt defibrillation is also crucial said study coauthor Dr William Roberts a professor of family medicine at the University of Minnesota and medical director of the Twin Cities Marathon At that race youre always within a mile of a defibrillator he said Every year new races crop up especially halfmarathons Watt said And they attract a different breed of runner Todays runner is older slower committed to going to more events possibly not as athletic he said Some are experiential or social runners who come to bond race for charities or lose weight In the study men had a cardiac arrest rate of  arrests per  runners nearly double that of women but still extremely small Garratt had some reservations about the study methodology They went to a racing agency for the denominator Then they went to a variety of sources including Internetbased sources To make it worse for about half of the incidents they were unable to get complete clinical information he said Roberts acknowledged that their data didnt take marathon preparation into account How do we know how many people we lose with shorter training races he asked He said that with proper conditioning distance running is safe if you listen to your body if you dont try to push through chest pain or shortness of breath or if you dont ignore factors like very high cholesterol All runners whether theyre young or old should have a discussion with their doctors about their intent to run and in that discussion there should be a very clear assessment of risk factors Baggish said
