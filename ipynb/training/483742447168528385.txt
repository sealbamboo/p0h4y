The American College of Physicians said Monday that it strongly recommends against annual pelvic exams for healthy lowrisk women In fact the intrusive exams may do more harm than good for women who arent pregnant or dont have signs of problems a group of doctors   in the   When we heard that news here at Shots we were happily surprised No more stirrups No more stripping down below the waist or hearing those dreaded words Now youre going to feel a little pressure Sounds great Im canceling my annual visit now Not so fast Not all doctors agree about these new guidelines This recommendation will be controversial obstetriciangynecologist   wrote in an accompanying   with a colleague at the University of California San Francisco Pelvic exams have long been considered a fundamental component of the wellwoman visit Most pelvic exams are performed by OBGYNs and their society the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists still   annual pelvic exams for all women over age  The agency concedes that no evidence supports or refutes the annual pelvic examination  for the asymptomatic lowrisk patient And it recommends that each woman should discuss with her doctor whether a full exam is necessary the agency writes on its website So what in the heck is going on Should I get the pelvic exam this year To start figuring that out we spoke with   at Georgetown University School of Medicine who wasnt involved in the new recommendation When you go to the doctors office and put your feet in the stirrups she says the doctor uses the speculum to open the vagina and see the opening of the cervix Then she takes a sample of the cervix This is called the Pap smear and it screens for cervical cancer Theres no question that the Pap smear saves lives Mishori says That part of the exam is not under question Women still need to get that exam every three to five years the American Cancer Society   Its what comes next in the exam thats up for debate After the Pap smear the doctor puts two fingers up the vagina and the other hand on the outside of the stomach Mishori says The doctor then examines the ovaries and uterus with both hands This is called the bimanual exam and for decades doctors thought it could help detect ovarian cancer But studies havent shown that to be true Every society even ACOG agrees that the pelvic exam cant find ovarian cancer in women who dont have symptoms Mishori says Theres really no evidence to support doing these exams on a regular basis in women who have no symptoms Theres also no evidence that the bimanual exam cuts your risk of dying from ovarian cancer the American College of Physicians concludes On the other hand false positives can lead to unnecessary tests and other procedures  not to mention the extra cost of seeing a doctor every year instead of once every three to five years for a Pap smear as is currently   If a woman is having symptoms or signs of trouble such as bleeding discharge pain during sex or infertility the doctors association still recommends the pelvic exam Heres why the ACOG thinks the bimanual exam has value even if scientific data dont exist to support it What if you dont know you have symptoms or you think your symptom isnt serious enough to bring up with the doctor A doctor might discover hidden problems during the full pelvic exam a representative for ACOG told Shots in an email For example many women dont bring up urinary leakage with their doctors because its embarrassing or they think its a normal part of aging But its treatable the rep says And a gynecologist might be able to see signs of it during a full pelvic exam If the woman skipped the pelvic exam she might have missed the opportunity for treatment
