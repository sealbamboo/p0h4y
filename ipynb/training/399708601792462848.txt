Closing walkin centres may make it harder for people to see GPs  and risks sending more people to AE warns healthcare regulator Monitor   It reviewed the walkin centre service after the closure of  of the  in England in the last three years Monitor found the centres are popular with the public but critics fear they can mean duplication of services The government said walkin centres were one part of outofhours care Family GPs community services and pharmacists all have a part to play says Health Minister Lord Howe But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the decision to dismantle walkin centres was an act of vandalism and that patients were paying the price As part of its review Monitor surveyed just under  patients at  walkin centres When patients were asked where they would have gone if the walkin centre had not been available  said they would have gone to AE while a third would go to their own or a different GP The poll also found  had tried to contact a GP practice but found no appointment or none at a convenient time   And  did not even try to contact a GP because they did not think they would get an appointment Former Prime Minister Tony Blair announced plans to establish the first walkin centres in  to provide convenient access to basic primary care services without the need for an appointment As their name suggests patients can walk in and get seen Most are GPled though some are overseen by nurses Private companies such as Virgin and Care UK currently run around a sixth of the centres The Monitor review found that walkin centres were more likely to be used by those aged  with women slightly more likely to attend    Those that have closed have done so due to concerns they are not helping AE  Many contracts for walkin centres are up for renewal in  and the review found confusion about who should decide on their fate and said decisions had possibly been put off because of the upheaval in the NHS Some commissioners also felt they were paying twice for patients once with the GP they are registered with and a second time for their treatment at the walkin centre But Monitor said there should be careful thought about possible closures Catherine Davies Monitors executive director of cooperation and competition said Weve been told that one in five people would choose to go to an accident and emergency department if the walkin centre wasnt there for them While it is for commissioners to decide whether to keep a walkin centre open we need to make sure that the needs of patients are fully considered before decisions are taken The review suggests the payment system to be changed so GPs have more of an incentive to be flexible providing online or phone consultations improving receptionist skills extending hours or offering walkin appointments  It comes as the College of Emergency Medicine  has warned that more than half of specialist registrar posts in AE have been left vacant over the past three years with many doctors moving to other specialities or going abroad Downing Street said that David Cameron is getting personally involved in overseeing the NHSs response to expected pressures on hospitals in England this winter
