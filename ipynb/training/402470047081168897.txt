Patients with serious brain injuries are being let down by poor care the BBCs Newsnight programme has learned  Secretlyfilmed footage passed to Newsnight shows examples of patient neglect and ignored safety procedures Incidents include one healthcare worker cleaning a feeding and medicine tube with a pen nib and one patient marked as nilbymouth being given drinks NHS England told the BBC it is working to improve specialist rehabilitation for patients with such complex needs However one leading expert told Newsnight that some patients were not recovering as fully as they might because of these problems with their care Professor Michael Barnes a specialist in neurological rehabilitation medicine who chairs the UK Acquired Brain Injury Forum said There are some very good rehabilitation centres in this country but equally Im afraid there are units in this country that really dont provide proper coordinated rehabilitation at all  And yet thats what they are called And that I think is a sad reflection and something needs to be done about that  Every  seconds someone in the UK suffers a brain injury There can be many causes such as a bleed to the brain a fall an assault  often it is the result of a road accident  Following an injury of this sort the brain has to rebuild pathways to allow the person who has suffered the injury to relearn the things they once took for granted and that is why specialist rehabilitation and good care are so vital Grant Clarke had a massive brain haemorrhage last year at the age of  He was left severely disabled but during  weeks in hospital he made steady progress  His family believed with the right help he would be home within four months But they say his recovery was undermined by poor care and a lack of appropriate rehabilitation when he was transferred to the West Kent Neurorehabilitation Unit in Sevenoaks  He didnt have his teeth brushed Mr Clarkes partner Binny told us  He didnt have his armpits washed He was left in urine all the time Every time I went to see him he was wet to his armpits and cold  After raising her concerns on a number of occasions she decided to take the extreme action of installing a secret camera in his room She was shocked by the footage it recorded  Mr Clarkes injuries had left him unable to swallow and so a tube was inserted to bring food liquids and medication straight to his stomach The tube had to be cleaned with care to avoid infection but the secret filming shows a healthcare worker cleaning the top of it with the nib of a pen   Despite him being nilbymouth another healthcare assistant was seen giving Mr Clarke drinks of water five times over two nights And though he can barely speak his call bell was removed three times in  days Binny later discovered that only one of the nursing staff at the unit had training in brain injuries even though it was described as a specialist unit Following a complaint made by the family the healthcare worker who gave Grant the drinks was interviewed by police but they decided not to take action against him  The worker gave a letter to the police in which he expressed his regret for his actions He no longer works for the West Kent Neurorehabilitation Unit Mr Clarkes family made  complaints to the Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust Most were upheld  including the removal of the call bell and the use of a pen to clean the top of Mr Clarkes feeding tube  In a statement to BBC Newsnight the Trust said We remain appalled by what happened  It continues We subsequently created a robust action plan to address all concerns and adds that compulsory specialist training for all staff has now been introduced Mr Clarke who is now in another rehabilitation unit that is providing him with the care and support he needs is making progress and starting to spend time at home with his family But concerns of a similar nature have been raised by the family of Mark Courtney He had a severe asthma attack in March  that left him severely brain damaged  His family say they have experienced failings in basic care ever since He has been in four different placements in the last sixandahalfyears and I have found that not any of the placements are ideal his wife Chammelle told BBC Newsnight Mrs Courtneys concerns about her husbands care include unexplained cuts and bruises medication errors and a failure to position him correctly She believes patients in all of the facilities where he has been treated are at serious risk of harm Professor Michael Barnes says that investment in brain injury rehabilitation could save the state money in the longer term There is good evidence that although rehabilitation costs more money clearly than someone going home or going to a nursing home that money is recouped over two to three years by that person requiring less support from the state getting back to work and earning money Dr John Etherington is the National Clinical Director for Rehabilitation and Recovering in the Community at NHS England  He told BBC Newsnight This role bolsters a number of initiatives already underway which will start to enhance provision These include the establishment of a Clinical Reference Group to examine the commissioning of specialised rehabilitation services the development of regional trauma networks to review services  which has already led to service improvements  and a review of funding for long term conditions which is underway through the Year of Care initiative that will enable a more flexible and patient centred distribution of funding  We have also for the first time put in place a national specification for specialised rehabilitation to combat variation in services and ensure more equitable access across the country This work is vital to improving outcomes for patients  Watch Alison Holts Newsnight film in full on Monday  November  at  on BBC Two and then afterwards on the   and   website
