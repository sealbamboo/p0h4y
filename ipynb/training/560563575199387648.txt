If legislation banning smoking protects people from disease then the proportion of the world population covered by such laws is too low  just  according to researchers Smokefree legislation is associated with substantial reductions in preterm births and hospital visits for asthma the researchers wrote in the Lancet last week That conclusion combined with the benefits of such laws to adults is strong support for the recommendation of the World Health Organization to create smokefree environments wrote the researchers from the Maastricht University School for Public Health Hasselt University and the University of Leuven both in Belgium and Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston Estimates suggest that pediatric hospital admissions for asthma and preterm births decline by  after smokefree legislation is enacted making the public health effects of such bans considerable the researchers said At present worldwide more than  of children  about  million babies  are born premature each year The researchers found  studies from  to  that covered more than  million births and  asthma incidents Five of the studies concerned local smoking bans in North America and six concerned national bans in Europe About  million people die of smoking annually and  people die of secondhand smoke the researchers said The effects of inutero and earlylife exposures on health in childhood and later life is a growing specialty for researchers Because their lungs and immune systems are still developing they are at particularly risk to the effects of secondhand smoke they said Among the outcomes of early exposure to tobacco smoke are stillbirth preterm birth asthma infant mortality and respiratory infections And recent studies the researchers wrote have implicated childhood secondhand smoke exposures in the development of noncommunicable diseases in later life The researchers said some knowledge gaps remain including the effects of such legislation on lowincome countries And the researchers said there was a risk of bias in some of the  studies  with six of them having a moderate risk and one a high risk Twitter
