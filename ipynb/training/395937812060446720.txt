Every year after trickortreating for Halloween I used to hide my candy in a little paisley suitcase under my bed Just to be safe I even locked it so my dad would not devour the contents in one night My sister April and I loved waiting till my parents were asleep and then pouring out our loot on the big orange fuzzy rug shaped like a foot that adorned the middle of our bedroom That foot was where we would decide what we were going to eat and what we were going to swap After the negotiations were complete we carefully secured our treats locking the suitcase with a little gold key that I kept around my neck for safe keeping I just cant resist the ones with caramel nougat or crispy wafers my dad would say as he sneaked into our room begging for something anything  just one little bag of peanut M Ms But days before he had made me promise not to give in  even if he tickled me so hard that I felt as if I could not breathe The goblins are going to get you the goblins are going to get you he would repeat in an animated voice trying to wear me down so I would surrender my candy Feed me feed me he begged inhaling the candy aroma left behind on an empty wrapper he found on the bedroom floor I knew he would be furious with both himself and me the next morning if I did not hold up my end of the bargain In my house food and affection were inextricably tied My father a successful advertising executive usually weighed around  pounds but his weight could often fluctuate a hundred pounds on either end as he tried and failed almost weekly to attempt the latest fad diet My mother meanwhile was a finicky eater who rarely sat down to family meals  I remember Halloween being an especially difficult holiday for my dad who had spent six months at Duke Universitys Fat Farm where he had lost  pounds avoiding sugar salt and fat Before that diet he would sometimes gobble three candy bars in a row There is nothing like the smell of real milk chocolate he would say reminiscing about his favorite candy bars Butterfingers Kit Kats and Three Musketeers  My dad called Halloween a fabulous marketing trick not only for the candy companies but for the diet industry The holiday set up candy lovers to indulge for days gorging on buckets of leftover candy Once the candy was gone the guilt set in and the candy eaters began looking for quick solutions to make up for the binge Sales of bagged candy treats were soon replaced by sales of diet sodas pills and weight loss shakes Despite my dads lovehate relationship with Halloween I loved it For me trickortreating was about more than the candy It was a chance to pretend to be Raggedy Ann a wild alley cat or a devil  anyone but me I was just as happy to receive stickers or coins for my UNICEF box as a candy bar The fun was about being with my friends carving pumpkins running up and down the streets and contemplating for weeks what my costume would be I loved ringing doorbells chanting Trick or Treat smell my feet give me something good to eat  I waited with anticipation for the doors to open and see who was going to answer and what they would drop into my plastic orange pumpkin The more unexpected the better My favorites were always the nonedible prizes like plastic spider rings or the Silly Putty eggs or big red wax lips When I went to my friend Monicas house in the West Village where we would go for an afterschool party before the big Halloween parade I marveled at how all my friends transformed themselves and how much detail her dad put into decorating their house Halloween at Monicas came with scary jackolanterns ghosts projected on the wall a bowl of smoking red punch that filled the room like fog and orange cobwebs with hanging spiders that dangled in every doorway They even had creepy music and a big caldron where we bobbed for apples We snacked on Deviled Eye Balls Dead Man Finger Sandwiches and Black Snake Spaghetti I admired the creativity of their menu and I was in heaven smelling the pumpkin seeds roasting the warm apple cider simmering and chocolate zucchini muffins baking The smell of home cooking always reminded me of my grandmother Beauty For as long as I can remember Beauty taught me how to appreciate the aromas of food and feel nourished when something warm and homemade was served to me Sometimes that included sweets like her homemade peanut butter fudge or chocolate turtle crunchies I always preferred Beautys homemade treats to the kind that came in wrappers at Halloween except for Now  Laters which I adored For me Halloween candy served as a way to barter In sixth grade you could trade something rare like a Charleston Chew or a Sugar Baby for a Wacky Pack Sticker or a Matchbox car Each candy had a different value based on who you were trying to trade with I would swap most of my bag trying to get a rare collectable such as a Ghostess Fright Pie or a Skimpy Peanut Butter sticker to decorate my notebook At night I would listen to the sounds of my father in the kitchen  the opening of the refrigerator door drawers banging and cabinets creaking Taking the key off my neck I would check my candy stash at night planning for the next days bartering When I was finished I pushed the little suitcase back under my bed My dad was always amazed how I could trade my candy away But he never seemed to realize that candy was not what I craved
