The tantalizing aroma of freshly baked brioche is hard to resist while a virtuous loaf of whole wheat often lacks that same allure Blame it on the ferulic acid See wholewheat bread contains all parts of the wheat including the bran but white bread does not That bran in the wheat bread contains the aforementioned ferulic acid which overrides the compounds that give white bread its mouthwatering smell according to new research Much nudging from the health police has convinced more people to eat wholegrain bread but just   eat a wholegrain food at least once in two weeks according to the Whole Grains Council Clearly our hearts and our palates still belong to white My children they cut off crusts from wheat bread Why asks   codirector of the Flavor Research and Education Center at the University of Minnesota He knows hes not the only parent whos noticed that whole wheat can be a tough sell But unlike the rest of us Peterson has the chops to figure out what makes for whole wheats lack of appeal His lab baked up whole wheat and white bread removed the crust right when it came out of the oven and froze the crust in liquid nitrogen After that Peterson and his colleagues ground the frozen bread crust in a mortar and pestle added solvent distilled the liquid and ran it through a series of gas chromatographs and sniffers Crust was chosen because its the part of bread that browns the most and browning is a major part of flavor The white bread crust gave off chemicals that smell like corn chips potatoes caramel and flowers while the whole wheat produced malty earthy cucumber fatty smells Which would you choose for toast To combat some of these issues manufacturers often add salt and sugar to wholegrain bread But that takes away from its nutritional value Indeed some products labeled whole grain have more sugar and calories than products that dont sport that label a recent   in the journal   found Products with the Whole Grain stamp which is a common symbol on food packages these days were higher in fiber and lower in trans fats than some other foods but had more sugar and calories compared to products without the stamp Researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health found that products that met the American Heart Associations standard  requiring a  ratio of carbohydrates to fiber  were healthiest overall The Whole Grains Council which developed the stamp took some issues with Harvards conclusions Its designed to address whole grain content and nothing more says   director of food and nutrition strategies for Oldways and the Council And she noted Wholegrain consumption went up  percent in the first three years after the stamp was introduced in  Read the groups full response   Still more of us could stand to gain from the welldocumented health benefits of whole grain so figuring out how to make it yummier while still being healthy would be a big plus for the many people who have yet to make the switch In Petersons quest for better wholegrain taste he found that ferulic acid in wheat bran blocked production of acetylpyrroline a molecule that helps produce a warm browned smell we associate with white bread If I were to give you this compound in pure form its very discernible Peterson told The Salt Its a very nice baked note Chefs call that nice baked note the Maillard reaction after a Frenchman who realized a century ago that its what gives grilled steak and browned bread its rich flavor NPRs Joe Palca gives the lowdown on   and how deliciousness can come from heating a mixture of sugars and amino acids Bitter taste is also a problem for wholewheat bread Peterson has looked into that too and says the problem is not in the flour but in   created in fermentation and in the Maillard reaction In the past bakeries have tried different forms of flour to reduce bitterness but Peterson thinks the solution lies in tweaking the proofing and baking process instead Removing ferulic acid from wholewheat bran isnt the answer Peterson thinks he speculates that it may have health benefits You have to look at the whole picture and keep the good elements together He hopes that by figuring out just what makes wholewheat bread taste and smell the way it does will help food manufacturers how to keep the nutritional goodness of whole grains without losing the rich brown smell of freshly baked bread Petersons   was published in the
