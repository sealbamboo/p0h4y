Youve heard about the Wheat Belly diet right Well technically it doesnt exist Dr William Davis points out that the word diet does not appear on either the cover of his bestselling Wheat Belly book published in  or on the followup Wheat Belly Cookbook which was published last month and already tops bestseller lists And that omission is intentional Davis said Wheat Belly is about stripping your plate of a substance that contributes to heart disease causes joint pain inflammation foggy thinking bloating and much more Davis said Losing weight he added is simply a nice aside The cardiologist believes wheat is the single biggest contributor to the countrys obesity epidemic in part because aggressive breeding methods and genetic manipulation have turned it into what Davis derides as a Frankenwheat One of its most troubling side effects Triggering uncontrollable carb cravings the doctor said The advice to cut your fat and eat whole grains is the worst advice you can possibly pass on to people I say Eat more fat Eat as little grains as possible Grains really dont belong in the human experience I didnt go looking to demonize wheat I told my patients to stop eating wheat products as part of treatment because many were suffering from diabetes or were prediabetic But theyd come back in three to six months and they were  to  pounds lighter And theyd say The pain in my wrist and shoulder is gone My irritable bowel syndrome symptoms are gone I only did it for blood sugar But I thought What in the world is in wheat besides its potential to raise blood sugar Why would their asthma go away Why would someones food obsession disappear So many things happened In the beginning I had no idea why I had to see it thousands of time before it got drilled into my head We are treating the consumption of modern wheat Only we call it hypertension Obesity Arthritis Acid reflux  You take out the wheat all that goes away You could argue that wheat is perfectly crafted to exert maximum damage to multiple organs I tell people just try it for  days Its an exceptionally common observation for people to come back to me and say I feel  years younger For one youll have a dramatic increase in energy  and you experience what I call youthful sleep Thats where someone can clang pots and pans and you wont wake up People lose weight theyre more flexible theyre lighter on their feet Memory improves Skin improves The puffy look around the eyes That improves When you lose the wheat you lose several pounds the first week Part of that is fat weight but also water weight What humans have been doing for  million years is consuming animal meat vegetables nuts fruits and the like  When we added grains  years ago more or less theres an observation of dramatic downturns in health  We are meatconsuming omnivores who made a mistake by this detour into grains Modern times made it much worse by changing grains on us And agribusiness has decided Lets just put wheat in everything from tomato soup to salad dressings Why is wheat in tomato soup When you make tomato soup at home do you put wheat in it No I know this sounds conspiracyish but Ive got to believe that at some level some very smart people have realized that wheat triggers binge eating How else can you justify that wheat got into everything Were told that Americans are diabetic and overweight because were the most gluttonous and lazy people in the world But thats not true Many have just been getting seriously bad advice They are exercising cutting their calories doing all the things they are supposed to do and there is this destructive thing in their diet that they are told to eat more of Not only is that advice  to eat more grains  ineffective its destructive You have people who are saying Im doing everything right Ive cut my fat and cholesterol I dont eat junk food or fast food I exercise an hour a day or an hour and a half a day and Ive gained  pounds  They are doing what appears to be right and yet they are desperately frustrated But they have failed to make that fundamental distinction Its not about calories Its not about fat Its not about exercise Its about this destructive appetitestimulating food in your diet There is so much to eat Real foods Vegetables fruit meats organ meats and so on And when you are eating real foods you can eat all you want The hardest part for most people is giving up bread And its not enough to just go glutenfree I tell people You dont have to give up sandwiches The cookbook has several recipes for breads including focaccia pretzels walnutraisin bread cheddar cheese biscuits brownies and pie crusts made with wheat substitutes such as almond coconut and garbanzo bean flours I tell people just go cold turkey and try it for  days What do you have to lose
