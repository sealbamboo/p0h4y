   is rare and biologic changes after a woman gives birth may prevent the development of pain after birth according to two new studies In the first study researchers interviewed more than  women within  hours of giving birth Only  percent of the women who had pain when they delivered still had pain six months later and only  percent still had pain a year later according to the study which was published in the January issue of the journal   The study suggests there may be a protecting mechanism that is active around the time of childbirth to prevent chronic pain from physical injury Dr James Eisenach professor of obstetric and gynecologic anesthesia at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in WinstonSalem NC said in a news release from the American Society of Anesthesiologists In our accompanying lab study we analyzed the sources of this natural protection in hopes we may be able to develop   from happening after other types of trauma or surgery similar to vaccines to prevent infectious diseases said Eisenach who is editorinchief of   The lab research conducted in rats suggested that elevated concentrations of oxytocin the socalled love hormone in the brain and spinal cord after birth protected mothers against the development of chronic pain Experts note however that results from animal research are not always replicated in humans Oxytocin in the brain is considered important to motherbaby bonding trust love and social engagement Eisenach said These results suggest the surge in oxytocin around childbirth may also speed recovery from the pain caused by childbirth In an accompanying editorial Dr Cynthia Wong of Northwestern University in Chicago pointed out that both studies provide important new information toward understanding the development of chronic pain after childbirth And Wong added understanding whether and how pregnancy protects against the development of posttraumatic chronic pain is not only important to women who give birth and their children but may also provide therapeutic targets for future prevention and treatment of chronic pain in other populations
