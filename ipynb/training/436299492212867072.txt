When it comes to using mammograms as a tool to screen women for breast cancer how do you define success At a minimum youd want to know that women who get mammograms are less likely to die of breast cancer than women who didnt get the tests So the   published last week in the British Medical Journal was rather inconvenient for the diehard fans of mammography The study sorted nearly  women into two groups About half of them had mammograms and the other half didnt Those who had the screening tests were more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer You might expect this to be useful by catching cancers at an earlier more treatable stage But it didnt turn out that way After tracking these women for up to  years the researchers found that women who had mammograms succumbed to breast cancer at the same rate as women who didnt get the tests The American College of Radiology  the medical group that represents the doctors who read mammograms  pounced on the study right away In   the ACR called the study incredibly flawed and misleading Taking its results seriously would place a great many women at increased risk of dying unnecessarily from breast cancer it warned As my colleague Monte Morin reported the authors of the study said they   But the accusations from highprofile radiologists have kept coming Now an expert on preventive medicine and screening is fighting back In an  published online Wednesday on CNNcom   of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice explains why the ACRs two main arguments against the Canadian National Breast Screening Study study are wrong First the radiology group claimed the Canadian results could not be trusted because the women were screened with secondhand mammography machines that were operated by technologists who were not taught proper positioning producing subpar breast films read by radiologists who had no specific training in mammographic interpretation Welch sums up the ACR critique like this Canada is a Third World country Not only is this not true he writes its disingenuous Thats because the clinical trials that radiologists cite in favor of mammography are even older than the Canadian study In fact one of the trials most favorable to screening  the Health Insurance Plan of New Yorks  dates from two decades before Canadas in the early s when mammography technologies were primitive Welch writes The ACRs other complaint is that the Canadian trial stacked the odds against mammography by assigning women with large incurable cancers to the group that got the mammograms This guaranteed more deaths among the screened women than the control women according to the ACR statement Once again Welch isnt buying it Critics have made this allegation before and its so serious that Canadas National Cancer Institute initiated a   As reported in the Canadian Medical Assn Journal in  the investigators found no evidence of a deliberate attempt to conceal the alterations Nor is there any evidence of cheating in the data Welch explains If the Canadian researchers were shunting the sickest patients into the mammogram group then there were would be more deaths among women who had mammograms than among women who didnt But there werent The rate of death in the two groups was exactly the same every year for  years Welch writes Welch has coauthored many studies about mammography and he says theres a good explanation for why mammograms dont seem to be helpful as a screening tool the tests find small unimportant abnormalities that are labeled cancer but are not destined to cause them any problems he writes Also   have erased much of the advantage of finding cancers early Though some radiologists have accepted the growing evidence that screening mammography is flawed members of the old guard are still quick to attack the studies that dont fit their worldview Welch writes He has some advice for those people Grow up Its time to stop the unfounded allegations Welch writes on CNN It might be standard procedure for politics but not for science Too much energy has been devoted to discrediting the Canadian study and not enough to understanding it    and like   on Facebook
