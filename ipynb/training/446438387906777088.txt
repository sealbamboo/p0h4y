This is a laughing matter  but a medical situation thats the farthest thing from funny for afflicted extroops In a survey of more than  veterans who showed signs of traumatic brain injury  percent said they struggle with a littleknown neurological condition that causes them to lapse into uncontrolled fits of laughter or crying according to a US Department of Veterans Affairs survey released Wednesday Called pseudobulbar affect PBA the condition occurs in some  million Americans who have had strokes brain injuries or been diagnosed with Parkinsons or Alzheimers diseases But the surprisingly high portion of veterans who revealed they too experience unwanted bouts of giggles or tears may mean that hundreds of thousands of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are grappling with the stigmatizing malady said a VA brain expert Thats probably very accurate said Regina McGlinchey director of the VAs Translational Research Center for Traumatic Brain Injury and Stress Disorders based in Boston She will present the findings Friday at the Tenth World Congress on Brain Injury in San Francisco More than  million US troops served in the two wars Between  and  percent of those men and women sustained TBIs the VA estimates The data suggests over half of these people are having symptoms of PBA And it really exacerbates their problem with reintegration into society and may facilitate greater isolation McGlinchey said These are veterans and service members who are very proud very confident and theyre not going to be out in social situations and not be in control of their emotions Thats one thing I am extremely concerned about Crying jags seem slightly more common than laughing spells Some people endure both The frequency and length of the outbursts vary among individuals McGlinchey said The VA study was sponsored by Avanir Pharmaceuticals Inc which markets Nuedexta a drug specifically approved to treat PBA There are no known triggers for the emotional eruptions which often run opposite to what a person is feeling internally McGlinchey said Thats one of the most fascinating but also debilitating aspects of PBA because really what youre looking at is a disassociation between someones emotional experience in the moment and what their emotional expression is she said These acts of laughing or crying are completely uncontrollable They can just happen
