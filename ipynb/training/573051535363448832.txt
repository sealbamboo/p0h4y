Less than  of the m allocated by the government for emergency care in England this winter ended up directly in AE departments according to a survey of senior clinicians working on the   frontline  which commissioned the research published on Wednesday said the results suggested the cash was not spent in a way that would improve emergency services with some of it even being used to pay off trust debts   issued an unusually strong response to the report accusing the college of propounding blatant inaccuracies while the Department of Health called the figures nonsense  But college president Dr Clifford Mann said the failure to invest funds efficiently had contributed to four of the most challenging months ever directly harming patients and frontline staff  It is so disappointing that our survey shows that the significant investment the government made to tackle the winter pressures has not reached the AEs it was supposed to help said Mann This report is an indictment of current decision making and investment in acute and emergency care Patients and frontline staff deserve better and will be incredulous at the failure to adopt best practice and squander money on admission avoidance schemes that have selfevidently failed  This report should act as a catalyst to ensure the same mistakes are not made in   In future it would make much more sense to release funding directly to hospitals for investment in AEs For the Ignoring the Prescription report the college contacted the clinical lead from each of the  emergency departments across the UK in January Of  senior emergency department consultants in England who responded to the winter funding question  said their department had received none of the funding with  saying they did not know if they had received any of it  Responses included that the funding had been incorporated into the trusts financial bottom line or used to offset an increase in expenditure in July The consultants were also asked about whether   drawn up by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine the   the   and the   last year had been put into effect in their hospital  None of them have been fully implemented by the majority of emergency departments according to the survey results which suggested that  of AEs are not being supported by fully functioning sevenday services and less than a third have an appropriate skill mix and workforce in place to deal with their patient volumes and case mix An NHS spokesman said Hospitals report theyre spending over m on extra services this winter in AE and for their emergency patients And most hospitals say they have brought in colocated GP services  said this recommendation had been implemented fully while  said it had been partially as the report suggests  Whats more most people recognise that as well as spending in AE departments patients also need wellfunded primary community and social care to help them stay out of hospital in the first place A Department of   spokeswoman said the cash had paid for  more doctors nearly  more nurses and  more beds both inside and outside of hospitals to relieve pressure across the whole of the NHS The Royal College of Emergency Medicine said the true amount spent on staff and equipment in emergency departments was held by trusts and that it had submitted freedom of information requests to try to ascertain these figures
