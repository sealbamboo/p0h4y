Mark Siddall the curator of the division of invertebrate biology at the American Museum of Natural History has spent most of his career studying   to block the coagulation of blood from their prey It is he discovered a deftly targeted toxicity  Actually leeches are very good at sucking out blood without any help he told me The real issue is that they may consume eight times their body weight of blood in a single feeding And what they dont want is for the blood to clot inside them  The leeches got him thinking about the often unexpected ways that animals use poisons The result is a new book Poison Sinister Species With Deadly Consequences which abounds with stories of lethal encounters often involving scientists  interspersed with creepy drawings by Megan Gavin of animals crawling across the pages  Poisonous compounds are like yin and yang dark and light Dr Siddall said Theyre often medicinal on the one hand lethal on the other That something is poisonous doesnt make it bad its what we do with it I spoke with him about the toxic natures of snakes and spiders frogs and fish bees and even birds Our conversation  has been condensed and edited   Was there a particular incident that inspired you to write the book  I dedicated the book to my friend Joe Slowinsky who died of snakebite in Burma And it was his story that really got me started on the book In  Joe was a snake biologist who had recently become a curator for the California Academy of Sciences He was trying to look at biodiversity of snakes in Burma He reached into a bag to remove a small snake hed collected and it bit him  It was only after that he realized it was a     Couldnt he be saved with antivenin  They did keep him alive for several days but they couldnt get him out of the wild in time  Its tragic but its also not entirely surprising Joe was a snake biologist and he handled snakes People tend to be afraid of snakes on sight but the fact is the vast majority of people killed by snakes are people who are handling them Unfortunately that includes innumerable scientists  There was the one researcher in Honduras in the s who was bitten a number of times before he died as I remember  Douglas March He was working for the United Fruit Company now Dole and they had a problem with snakes in the banana plantations So he set up two serpentariums so that they could house snakes and use their venom to make antivenin   As I say in the book he was bitten more than a dozen times and survived those bites so maybe he got a little too confident Then he was bitten by a   And that is a very dangerous snake It uses a very complex cocktail of venoms that contain enzymes that liquefy tissue Then the venom is spread to other muscles as the blood vessels are also destroyed There are compounds in the venom that prevent clotting so you get not only tissue liquefaction but massive blood loss   Doesnt that seem kind of over the top   Well one theory is that the more complicated you make your cocktail of venoms greater probability that the attack will succeed And we know that many of these venoms are designed for defense and increased in response to threat  For instance    which lives in Oregon has high levels of tetrodotoxin a powerful neurotoxic compound in its skin  It turns out that the newts are preyed on by garter snakes that have responded by evolving resistance to the original amounts of poison  The newts have responded again by increasing the levels of the toxin in their skin We might think of it as over the top but theres usually a very good reason  Are these newts dangerous to people  I tell a story in the book of a young Oregon man who went out drinking with his friends and after a number of rounds they dared him to swallow his pet newt He did and he died of cardiac arrest And that tells us that theres enough tetrodotoxin in a single rough skinned newt to kill a grown man  Then its helpful if you know something about natural poisons  Were more afraid of what we dont know than what we do So this kind of knowledge can help you figure out when to be careful 
For instance the big scorpion scene in the movie War Inc uses an emperor scorpion with enormous pincers which really doesnt make any sense Scorpions that have big pincers to defend themselves arent very venomous because they dont need to be But theres a lot we dont know Do you remember when the crocodile hunter Steve Irwin died after he got too close to a stingray and the barb went into his heart When I started doing some research I discovered that he wasnt the only person to take a stingray strike to the chest Most didnt survive and thats not surprising because stingrays also have a venom that liquefies flesh  But I have been wondering do they also have the ability to aim  Im struck by the risktaking behavior of scientists in your book in studying these compounds   Some of it is risktaking and some can be credited to the principle that its easier to ask for forgiveness than permission You cant be fired for having done it to yourself  Chuck Myers who used to be a curator here developed a rather effective assay in the s which was to touch his tongue to the back of a frog  He was studying poison frogs in Latin America When his tongue went numb he knew hed found something  I dont see that so much as risktaking I see it as evidence of the deep and uncontrollable thirst for knowledge that natural history scientists have So you pick up the snake You let the black widow bite into your hand And you start working on the answers  It strikes me that the story of poisons is also a story of evolution  Poisons are part of a living experiment happening in these incredible biological reactors that we call animals and plants As much as I think we should be retaining biodiversity for aesthetic regions if we look at it from a human health viewpoint then this is chemistry we really want to preserve These are exquisitely adapted systems We dont want to lose them
