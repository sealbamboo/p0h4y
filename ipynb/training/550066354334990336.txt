Deaths due to influenza and pneumonia have hit "epidemic" levels in the U.S. as flu activity became widespread in 36 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.. The fewest deaths – 42 – were in the area that includes Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska.. At least 2,643 people have been hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed cases of the flu since Oct. 1, the CDC reported. That works out to a hospitalization rate of 9.7 hospitalizations per 100,000 Americans.. But the risk wasn't the same for all age groups. Senior citizens had the highest hospitalization rate, at 38.3 per 100,000 people. They were followed by children under the age of 5, who were hospitalized at a rate of 13.4 per 100,000.. The CDC's surveillance continues to show that the other strains picked for the North American vaccines were on target, including the H1N1 virus A/California/7/2009 and the influenza B viruses Yamagata/16/88 and B/Victoria/02/87.
