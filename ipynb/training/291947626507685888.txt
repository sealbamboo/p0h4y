 Blacks who live in highly segregated residential areas have higher lung cancer mortality rates than their white counterparts even after accounting for socioeconomic status researchers found While the overall lung cancer mortality rate was  percent for blacks versus  percent for whites per  population between  and  each additional level of segregation was associated with a  percent increase in lung cancer mortality for blacks and an associated decrease in mortality for whites according to Awori J Hayanga MD MPH of the University of Washington Seattle and colleagues Adjusted lung cancer mortality rates among blacks were  percent per  population in counties with the least segregation and  percent per  population in counties with the highest levels of segregation they wrote in the January issue of   Blacks are disproportionately affected by lung cancer and bear the highest incidence and mortality rates the authors noted in their introduction adding that the explanation for this disparity remains uncertain Although previous studies have found that lower socioeconomic status low income and inferior insurance status have been associated with poor health outcomes this is the first study to our knowledge to examine the specific effect of residential segregation on lung cancer mortality using data inclusive of the entire US population they wrote To see if segregation might play a role in the relationship between race and lung cancer mortality the authors conducted a populationbased study using data from the  Area Resource File and the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results program to conduct a populationbased study Two separate models were used to examine the association of blackwhite residential segregation and lung cancer mortality which included smoking rates county income levels population density county proximity to an urban center and whether the county was considered rural and was adjacent only to other rural counties Blacks living in counties with the highest levels of segregation had a  percent higher mortality rate than those residing in counties with the lowest level of segregation the investigators noted This increase was not observed among the white population and in contradistinction the mortality rate was  percent lower among whites living in the most segregated counties when compared with those living in the least segregated counties The results showed a strong association between residential segregation and higher lung cancer mortality among blacks whereas segregation was associated with a modest protective effect for whites they concluded These findings persisted even after accounting for smoking prevalence and socioeconomic status challenging the construct that segregation served as a proxy for socioeconomic status If the results were just due to few healthcare resources being available then lung cancer mortality would be expected to be similarly increased for both blacks and whites in highly segregated neighborhoods they observed Clearly there are other factors as yet undetermined that contribute to this disparity The authors recommended prioritizing various public health initiatives  including   and early cancer screening programs  in highly segregated areas adding that access to screening and expedient referral to specialist care should be optimized to ensure that the benefits of early cancer screening are realized A limitation of the study was the use of crossanalysis which prevented the authors from making causal inferences at the individual level The study results point to the value of desegregating a community David C Chang PhD MPH of the University of California San Diego noted in an invited commentary The influence of these social policies on patient outcomes also highlights the importance of physician collaboration with nonphysician professionals such as legislators and policymakers Source
