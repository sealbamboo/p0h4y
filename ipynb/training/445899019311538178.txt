A report into alcoholrelated brain damage ARBD should serve as a wakeup call Alcohol Concern Cymru said It highlights the condition known as ARBD which it says is poorly understood by the public and the health service leading to underdiagnosis Symptoms include confusion memory loss and difficulty reasoning as a result of heavy drinking The charity is using the report to raise awareness to help develop improvements in prevention and help Alcohol Concern Cymru director Andrew Misell said Most of us know that alcohol can damage our liver but the fact that it could undermine our longterm brain function is much less well known  Staff on the front line have been seeing younger people and other people who dont fit the stereotype of a homeless dependent drinker coming in with ARBD  Once again our willingness to see alcohol problems as someone elses problem confined to an extreme group of obvious drinkers is keeping us from seeing the elephant on our doorstep We hope this paper will be a wakeup call for all of us who drink The charity says ARBD can be treated successfully if recognised early on as it is not a progressive illness although it does not give any hard figures about the extent of the problem in Wales  However it points out that a separate report in  examined the need for specialist accommodation to be provided for  to  people with ARBD in south Wales whereas in north Wales a privatelyowned unit in Colwyn Bay provides two self contained homes for up to  residents The charity hopes its report will inform the Welsh governments   which provides a professional consensus on what treatments are most effective
