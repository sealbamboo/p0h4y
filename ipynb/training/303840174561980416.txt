 Figuring out when to be   or that can leave womens heads spinning Screening guidelines have been changing for an array of cancers and sometimes even the experts dont agree on what screenings need to be done when But for cervical cancer there seems to be more of a general consensus on which women need to be screened and at what ages those screenings should be done The main cause of cervical cancer is the human papillomavirus HPV according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HPV is very prevalent and most people will be infected with the virus at some point in their lives according to Dr Mark Einstein a gynecologic oncologist at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City But its only in very few people that HPV will go on to cause cancer Einstein explained Thats what makes this type of cancer very amenable to screening Plus it takes a long time to develop into cancer Its about five to seven years from infection with HPV to precancerous changes in cervical cells During that stage he said its possible that the immune system will take care of the virus and any abnormal cells without any medical intervention Even if the precancerous cells linger it still generally takes five or more additional years for cancer to develop Dr Radhika Rible an assistant clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California Los Angeles agreed that HPV is often nothing to worry about HPV is very very prevalent but most women who are young and healthy will clear the virus with no consequences Rible said It rarely progresses to cancer so its not anything to be worried or scared about but its important to stick with the guidelines because if it does cause any problems we can stop it early Two tests are used for cervical cancer screening according to the American Cancer Society For a Pap test the more familiar of the two a doctor collects cells from the cervix during a pelvic exam and sends them to a lab to determine whether any of the cells are abnormal The other test called an HPV screen looks for evidence of an HPV infection The cervical cancer screening guidelines were updated last spring Einstein who was on panels that helped define the guidelines said that more than  professional groups led by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology as well as consumer groups assessed available data on cervical cancer screening and agreed on how the guidelines should be updated For many women the takeaway message was that fewer screenings were being recommended They could start later than what had been suggested and the idea of an annual Pap test for everyone was being replaced with a longer interval perhaps three to five years between screenings For most women the guidelines now recommend The guidelines apply only to healthy women however That means that anyone whos had an abnormal Pap test or has had a procedure to remove abnormal cervical cells as well as women who have a compromised immune system should discuss their specific screening needs with their doctor Also women still are being advised to have an annual pelvic exam The annual gynecological exam is important for preventive health and discussing other concerns with your provider such as family planning and as you get older menopause symptoms and other concerns Rible said Besides preventive screenings a vaccine is available to protect against some strains of HPV Because sexual activity is the main way that HPV is transmitted the vaccine is recommended for girls and boys at age  or  before theyve become sexually active But its also recommended for people  to  years old even if theyve been sexually active and even if theyve been infected with HPV Even if someone has had HPV they probably havent been exposed to all of the strains covered by the vaccine Einstein said Getting the vaccine though doesnt replace the need for screening he said Its still important to follow the screening guidelines because not all strains of HPV are covered by the vaccine
