Some NHS hospital trusts in England are still counting on large government bailouts the BBC has found And a senior health analyst believes there will be a significant increase in the number requiring help this year But he warns the interim support  which totalled more than m to  trusts last year  could run out The government said any interim financial support depended on trusts sticking to a strong recovery plan Nigel Edwards chief executive of the Nuffield Trust  an independent research group on healthcare in the UK  said despite an expected rise in demand for the money a lack of spare cash in the health system was likely to prevent such funding being distributed to the same extent in the future  Mr Edwards told Radio s PM programme that the NHS had had the means to provide the bailouts because it had been underspending its budget But with the extra finances now almost completely spent he said there could be a case for rationing future bailouts The government says its financial support to trusts is factored into planning for how the overall budget is used  from regulators show NHS trusts in England ran up a combined deficit of m in the first quarter of   Last week NHS Englands chief executive Simon Stevens repeated his warning of a bn annual deficit by  By then the NHS will need an extra bn a year according to a new fiveyear plan Caroline Walker finance director at the Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust explained that it was having to rely on interim support from the Department of Health She said If this hospital was a private company we would have not been trading for three years now The trusts financial situation is now stable  it is not deteriorating  but it is not getting any better either which is largely the consequence of a Private Finance Initiative project to build Peterborough City Hospital Ms Walker explained the trust had received just over m in interim support during the last financial year  a significant percentage of its turnover and a figure it would almost certainly need this year next year and the year after that She rejected the idea that the support  which hospitals in deficit are not required to pay back  was rewarding failure Management changes have been made in the past so failure has been recognised she said Monitor our regulator has supported the trust in the conclusion that the management or the board of this hospital cant save m per year Ms Walker said trusts had to go through stringent checks before receiving assistance We have had to submit our annual plans and our monthly and weekly cashflow forecasts many many times to clear this funding she explained The BBC contacted some of the trusts which had received some of the larger payouts during the last financial year Most said they would  or hoped they would  receive this same support or other kinds of permanent financial help again this year  Some other trusts which did not receive any interim support in  but have fallen into deficit told the BBC they were hoping to get some this time round Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it had already received more than m since April and would be given a further m over the next five months The government says it has increased the NHS budget by billions of pounds and expects NHS trusts to have a strong grip on their finances It says when it provides help the aid is dependent on the organisations developing and keeping to a strong recovery plan So far in this financial year the government says it has paid around m of interim support to four trusts but with experts saying more than ever will require help trusts might worry whether there will be enough bailout money available to go around
