A gene associated with Alzheimers disease appears especially dangerous to women and may be one reason that more women than men are diagnosed with the disease The gene known as APOE increases the risk of developing Alzheimers in both sexes But a   published Monday in the   found that the gene had only a minimal effect on men while in women it nearly doubled the risk of developing Alzheimers or a related condition called   We believe that there is an increased risk for Alzheimers in women and it may be that APOE is playing a sizable role in this says   one of the studys authors and head of the Stanford Center for Memory Disorders Women make up nearly twothirds of the  million people in the US diagnosed with   One reason is that women are more likely than men to live long enough to develop the disease But there have been hints that factors beyond longevity could be contributing to the disparity Greicius says Studies dating to the s have   that one of these factors could be the   gene About  percent of the general population carries the gene but about  percent of people diagnosed with Alzheimers have it The gene variant is just one risk factor for Alzheimers but scientists say it seems to be an important one Greicius and his colleagues reviewed medical records of more than  older people Some had the APOE gene some didnt The records  many of them part of a data set funded by the National Institute on Aging  showed which people developed Alzheimers disease over a three or fouryear period And when it came to the subset of people who carry the APOE gene Greicius says there was a clear pattern Men with the gene were only slightly more likely to develop Alzheimers while women with the gene faced  times the risk compared with other women The finding is important for researchers of Alzheimers who will need to figure out why the gene affects women more than men Greicius says But until theres a way to slow or stop the disease he says theres still no compelling reason for most people to find out whether they carry the gene The current study does not settle the question of whether women as a group are more likely to develop Alzheimers than men who are the same age says   a psychiatric epidemiologist at the Mayo Clinic But it does add to the evidence that risk factors for Alzheimers can be different for men and women something we havent really looked at very closely she says For example researchers are only beginning to understand the role of the hormone estrogen in Alzheimers Mielke says Some studies have suggested that when a womans estrogen levels decline after menopause her brain becomes more vulnerable to Alzheimers What is interesting in relation to this paper is that animal and cellular studies suggest that there is an interaction between APOE and estrogen Mielke says So that may possibly be explaining the findings were seeing here in humans Someday understanding how Alzheimers is different in men and women could lead to different drugs or preventive treatments Mielke says But at the moment she says the advice remains the same for men and for women concerned about the disease We say whats good for your heart is good for your brain she says So exercise controlling hypertension cholesterol eating right doing physical activities are all important for your cognitive function
