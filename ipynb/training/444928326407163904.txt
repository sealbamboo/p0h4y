It has been more than a week since Malaysia Airlines Flight  disappeared and despite a massive search effort the whereabouts of the plane and the  people on board are unknown The airline has told the families and friends of those missing to expect the worst But its tough for families to grieve without knowing the answer to a crucial question Could my loved one still be alive Dr Pauline Boss works with people in this kind of situation Shes the author of   and a professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota She says the families and friends of the missing are experiencing an ambiguous loss Its the most painful kind of loss there is right now because you have no assurance of the fate of your loved one she says People suffering with this kind of loss often blame themselves says Boss A large part of her job is to remind them that the situation is not their fault But even as a grief counselor Boss says there is a limited amount she can do to help Grieving  and healing  simply take time They arent going to move forward right now Right now theyre in a survival mode she says The only way Ive found that families of the missing move forward is if you allow them to hold the paradox that ambiguity causes At one moment theyll say I think theyre at the bottom of the sea At another moment theyll say I think perhaps theyre alive on an island somewhere That is normal That is natural and typical reactions from ambiguous loss Sometimes the ambiguity surrounding the loss persists for a lifetime or even across generations says Boss How one deals with that ambiguity depends in part on culture The problem is that those from very cando cultures from very masteryoriented cultures are used to having answers to all problems And this is a case where youll never have an answer she says If that is the case that you never have an answer the only option left is to learn to live with the ambiguity Embracing that can be painful says Boss but it is ultimately a good thing for those suffering loss They become more resilient and stronger for it They are aware now that life will not always go their way she says Even if people can personally accept not knowing the fate of their loved ones they can still experience the social isolation that often comes with the grieving process Society is really rough on the families of the missing They dont understand quite what to do and unfortunately what people tend to do therefore is stay away Boss says Please dont stay away from these families But there isnt much you have to say to them Your presence will be support enough in many cases
