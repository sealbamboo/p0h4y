In April CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr Sanjay Gupta traveled to Conakry Guinea to report on what was being done to treat patients and contain the outbreak  It took only moments to feel the impact of what was happening here Gupta   There is a lot we know about Ebola and it scares us almost as much as what we dont know Ebola outbreaks usually are confined to remote areas making it easier to contain But this outbreak is different patients have been identified in  locations in Guinea Sierra Leone and Liberia Officials believe the wide footprint of this outbreak is partly because of the close proximity between the jungle where the virus was first identified and cities such as Conakry The capital in Guinea has a population of  million and an international airport  People are traveling without realizing theyre carrying the deadly virus It can take between two and  days after exposure for someone to feel sick  The symptoms at first mimic the flu headache fever fatigue What comes next sounds like something out of a horror movie significant diarrhea and vomiting while the virus shuts off the bloods ability to clot  As a result patients often suffer internal and external hemorrhaging Many die in an average of  days Doctors Without Borders also known as Mdecins Sans Frontires is the only aid organization treating people affected by the virus Since March they have sent more than  staff members and  tons of equipment and supplies to the region to help fight the epidemic Still they warn its not enough Despite the human resources and equipment deployed by MSF in the three affected countries we are no longer able to send teams to the new outbreak sites The good news is that Ebola isnt as easily spread as one may think A patient isnt contagious  meaning they cant spread the virus to other people  until they are already showing symptoms Inside the isolation treatment areas in Conakry  doctors focus on keeping the patients hydrated with IV drips and other liquid nutrients Health officials have urged residents to seek treatment at the first sign of flulike symptoms  There is no cure or vaccine to treat Ebola but MSF has shown it doesnt have to be a death sentence if its treated early Ebola typically kills  of patients This outbreak the death rate has dropped to roughly  Gupta describes the scene outside an isolation ward in Guinea Before the doctors go into the isolation ward Gupta says they stop in a separate tent beforehand to gear up Healthcare workers dressed in scrubs and thick white rubber boots They slipped on blue latex gloves then a thick yellow impermeable suit followed by a mask then a white hood with another mask built into it A pair of large clear goggles went over the hood and then a large white apron It has to be this way for these doctors and nurses who knowingly expose themselves to Ebola Gupta wrote But you have to wonder what goes through the minds of the patients seeing these rubberclad aliens looming in front of them MSF says theyll continue to isolate and treat Ebola patients in West Africa with the resources they have available but they urge a massive deployment by regional governments and aid agencies to help stop the epidemic World Health Organization officials say theyre planning highlevel meetings for the Minister of Health in the subregion July  to discuss the deployment of additional resources and experts to the area  The outbreak will be considered contained after  days  twice the incubation period  with no new Ebola cases
