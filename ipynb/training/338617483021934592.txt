When Neeley Wells was diagnosed with stage four ovarian cancer her daughter Dylan was only  months old The doctor told Wells she had two weeks to live That was  years ago In some ways for me its a little like Groundhogs Day Ill think maybe this is my last spring break And then Ill think yeah but Ive already thought that  times For me as a person theres not a lot of value to trying to figure out what the endgame or the endtime is Wells talks with   host Rachel Martin about what its like living with a cancer that refuses to go into remission Its been great and amazing and I truly think that in my battle if theres one variable thats made a difference  its my daughter Shes empathetic and helpful and loving but shes also resentful of the cancer And since I was sick on Mothers Day and spent the day in bed and two days later she said Im just feeling kind of bossed around  bossed around by the cancer I wish on Mothers Day that we had gone for a bike ride like any other family Its funny because I thought to myself the last thing I would want to do  in any health circumstances  is go on a bike ride Its not me But she has created what her world would look like if only The most freeing thing has been that when my hair has fallen out Ive been bald That has been really freeing  and sometimes really hard There are people who I think feel ashamed on my behalf which I dont And its also been really beautiful People making eye contact A waitress at a local Portland restaurant just said I dont know exactly what youre going through but I can tell youre going through something and Im going to buy your breakfast this morning Which is of course about tons more than paying for breakfast The funny thing is that I have more hair then Ive had for years but Im a little bit more sick than Ive been And so as people say Im so glad youre better I usually just say Thank you It was very scary for me when Dylan entered kindergarten because I was no longer the primary source of language that she was going to hear about cancer And I didnt want her to start being told that everybody died of cancer and that it was terrible  Society does kick out really really informally all these like Oh its like a cancer tearing through our world or Oh you have cancer Im so so sorry  how long do you have And people would say things like that in front of her And also its probably damaging to me to be asked that question at the grocery store When she was in about kindergarten and people would ask her questions I told her that I didnt think that she was beholden to always tell people the truth And that she could even come up with some great outrageous lies if she wanted to Like Why is your mom bald Whats wrong with your mom Just because somebody asks a question or verbalizes something that they are supposing I do not have to fill them in on the answer And I think thats been helpful for me
