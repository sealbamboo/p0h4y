Were always looking for new angles on health news And now were trying a new angle on Shots a podcast This is an experiment so I should ask for your informed consent Are you prepared for some unorthodox audio from an inkstained wretch still working on the transition to online journalism from print If so click away The podcast starts with a segment about retail health clinics I preview the results from the latest   on the subject with the help of some friendly people who stopped to chat in Washingtons Columbia Heights neighborhood After that I check in with   a bioinformatics guru at Johns Hopkins about a recent study that found a daily multivitamin appeared to slightly reduce the risk of cancer in men  and older Salzberg who writes the   at   is skeptical Recently I   that found some unintended consequences from public ratings for doctors It turns out that doctors in states that require quality reports about the use of angioplasty to treat patients having heart attacks use the procedure less often than cardiologists in states without those reports Harvards   a health policy researcher explains why that could be a problem Finally NPRs Julie Rovner and I talked about her reporting on how consumers use quality ratings for hospitals And she explores whether Gov Mitt Romney would be able to follow through on his promise to undo the federal health law if he becomes president Some thanks are due Travis Larchuk produced the podcast David Schultz pitched in too The multitalented Adam Cole whipped up the theme music And Eliza Barclay helped make it all possible by running Shots last week If you have feedback on the podcast leave a comment or send a response   Thanks for listening
