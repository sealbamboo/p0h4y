For decades the Barbie doll has been slammed by parents for promoting an unhealthy female body image Playing with a Barbie doll for just a few minutes may cause girls to limit their career ambitions psychologists   last month So why do we keep offering girls bonethin dolls like Barbie and the popular   crew asks artist   He thinks its time for a Barbie to get real Lamm has   nearly half a million dollars to produce a Barbielike doll with the proportions of a real teenager He designed the doll using the   of the average yearold given by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Then I smoothed out some of the details Lamm  tells Shots I just wanted her to look like a typical young woman walking down the street But I left the actual dimensions ambiguous because I dont want to set a new standard Lamm says he was inspired to create the doll for his cousin Shes so beautiful but she was afraid to put on a bathing suit because she thought she was fat And of course shes not he says But then when I look at the dolls in the store she has to select from theyre almost these mythical things To have Barbies physique the average young woman would need to grow about  inches trim  inches from her waist and slim her neck by a half a foot the artist   Heres the bad news for parents seeking healthier alternatives Right now Lamms doll exists only as a digital design But he has been working with a former vice president at Mattel to construct a prototype With the funds he raised hes starting a company   to produce the first edition of the dolls  which have already sold out Dont worry though Lamm wants to make a whole series of the dolls with a variety of ethnicities and healthy shapes I see there being a bunch of dolls to represent all of us he says He also plans for the dolls to wear less makeup than Mattels Barbie and have more realistic clothes I think the doll is fantastic says psychologist   at Oregon State University who led the recent study on Barbies impact on girls career ambitions Scads of studies have looked at how media images of unrealistic body shapes negatively affect girls selfesteem and body satisfaction Sherman says But only a handful have focused on Barbie From a scientific perspective we dont know very much about how Barbie affects girls she says Parents and philosophers have had a lot of opinions on Barbie but there are very few studies that use Barbie in a scientific way  To start filling in that gap Sherman and her colleagues ran a small study in which they gave  girls ages  to  a Barbie or a   to play with for five minutes They then showed each girl photos of job situations such as firefighting piloting a plane or teaching They asked each girl which jobs could be done by boys or by herself After playing with Barbie the girls said that boys could do about  more jobs than themselves But girls who played with Mr Potato Head didnt distinguish between jobs for boys or themselves Sherman and her colleagues   in the journal   Of course with such a small study its hard to draw conclusions about girls in general We dont know what  girls from around Corvallis Ore tell us about the billions of girls in the world Sherman says But girls play with Barbie hours a day That cumulative impact couldnt be smaller than what we saw It would be good to give girls and parents other options Sherman says Barbies proportionality was styled after a German sex toy she notes and it hasnt changed much in over five decades Shes had some nips and tucks over the years so far But the huge bust skinny waist have stayed the same
