Troy and Alana Pack had spent the day at their neighborhood Halloween party in Danville a suburb of San Francisco Tenyearold Troy went as a baseball player and yearold Alana was a good witch In the afternoon they changed out of their costumes and set out for a walk with their mother Destination BaskinRobbins Alana she liked anything with chocolate says their father Bob Pack Troy for sure bubble gum ice cream because he liked counting the bubble gums that he would get Bob Pack stayed home His family made it only half a mile down the road before his phone rang I received a call from a neighbor screaming thered been an accident And I raced down there An impaired driver had veered off the road and hit Troy and Alana headon Pack was doing CPR on Troy when the paramedics arrived I remember telling them I love them and hang on Just praying that they could hang on he says Troy and Alana were pronounced dead at the hospital In the months after their death Packs wife Carmen found solace in her Catholic faith Bob Pack was angry I think for me to get through I needed action he says and I needed to take action for justice for Troy and Alana and also for doing something that I thought maybe I could change to benefit others in the future That was nearly  years ago Pack quit his tech job to become an advocate Over the past decade he has helped write seven bills in Californias Legislature None of his efforts have been bigger than the one hes working on for the November election Proposition  a patient safety initiative Its complex and has three distinct proposals The first proposal aims to curb socalled doctor shopping Investigators in the Pack case found the driver who killed his children was abusing prescription narcotics She had gone to numerous doctors saying that she was under different pain  neck pain back pain leg pain elbow pain Pack says They in my view recklessly wrote prescriptions for her for thousands of pills Pack set out to help the state build a database where doctors can see how many times a patient has been prescribed serious narcotics like Vicodin or Oxycontin The result is the   or CURES database Proposition  would make it mandatory for doctors to consult the database California would become one of nine states requiring doctors to check before prescribing painkillers to firsttime patients After passing similar laws both Tennessee and New York saw a significant drop in the number of narcotics prescriptions written Studies have verified the correlation but they acknowledge that drug abusers may be turning to street drugs such as heroin instead Many doctors in California like the database Some have called it indispensable But they dont like being told how to practice medicine The problem with the current way the ballot measure is written is it makes it mandatory to have that database checked says   president of the California Medical Association He says technical glitches have made the database unreliable Many doctors are also unhappy about another big piece of the measure a proposed change to the cap on pain and suffering awards in medical malpractice lawsuits After his kids died Bob Pack wanted to sue the doctors who prescribed drugs to the driver I set out and talked to about eight lawyers he says They all turned him down They told him a  state law limited the malpractice award he could get to  That meant puny attorneys fees The case wouldnt be worth the lawyers time My reaction was What Thats not democratic Thats not America Pack says We all have the right to the court system The law that set the cap is called MICRA the   passed with the intention of keeping medical liability insurance costs low Several other states followed suit Californias law caps only noneconomic damages or pain and suffering awards Economic damages  for medical expenses or lost wages  arent capped But economic damages were no help for Pack Children have no jobs no lost wages And his children had no ongoing medical bills So the victim gets victimized a second time Pack says He gets no accountability or justice through the legal system Some states have ruled such caps on pain and suffering awards unconstitutional Pack thinks Californias noneconomic malpractice award should at least be adjusted for inflation Proposition  would raise the cap from  to  million and provide an annual adjustment for inflation in the future But the CMAs Thorp sees a big problem That will encourage additional lawsuits in the system He argues more lawsuits will cause malpractice insurance premiums to go up and those costs could drive doctors out of California Youll start to see it become more difficult to recruit doctors to California he says The third proposal in the proposition has been the centerpiece of the Yes on Prop  campaign inspiring   of airline pilots and police officers dancing through the stalls of a public restroom Adding doctors to that list seemed like an easy sell Early polls indicated voters strongly favored the idea  many thought it was already law In fact if Proposition  passes California would be the first state in the country to require drug testing of doctors Proposition  would give the Medical Board of California a year to set up a system to test doctors for drug and alcohol use both randomly and within  hours after an unexpected patient death or serious injury at the hospital Doctors groups say that goes too far This approach is too heavyhanded and too inappropriate says Thorp He says hospitals already have systems in place to suspend doctors who show up to work intoxicated The two campaigns have fought back and forth over just how much of a problem there is with impaired doctors Regardless Proposition  author Pack says not enough is being done The medical board has no authority and no mandate to be able to find out who these guys are and weed them out or get them help he says But the focus groups revealing voter support for the idea of doctor drug testing were convincing That has opponents calling the provision nothing more than a political gimmick The only reason that was added to the proposition is because it polled well with voters says Thorp Theyre just hiding the fact that theyre trying to increase the cap on noneconomic damages so that the payouts to trial attorneys can increase Doctors and insurance companies have amassed  million to fight Proposition  making this the most expensive campaign of the fall election Theyre outspending lawyers  to  on ads aimed at swaying voters toward a no vote None of them even mentions doctor drug testing Early polls showed strong support for the measure   percent But   to  percent support in midSeptember Twentynine percent of voters said they hadnt yet decided
