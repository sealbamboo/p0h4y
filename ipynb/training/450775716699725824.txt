Scientists have grown living muscle in the lab that not only looks and works like the real thing but also heals by itself  a significant step in tissue engineering Ultimately they hope the labgrown muscle could be used to repair damage in humans  So far trials have tested this out in mice The results of this early work are described in the journal    The Duke University researchers say their success was down to creating the perfect environment for muscle growth  welldeveloped contractile muscle fibres and a pool of immature stem cells known as satellite cells that could develop into muscle tissue In tests the labgrown muscle was found to be strong and good at contracting and was able to repair itself using the satellite cells when the researchers damaged it with a toxin When it was grafted into mice the muscle appeared to integrate well with the rest of the surrounding tissue and began doing the job required of it  They say more tests are needed before they could move the work into humans  Lead researcher Nenad Bursac said The muscle we have made represents an important advance for the field  Its the first time engineered muscle has been created that contracts as strongly as native neonatal newborn skeletal muscle UK expert in skeletal muscle tissue engineering Prof Mark Lewis from Loughborough University said A number of researchers have grown muscles in the laboratory and shown that they can behave in similar ways to that seen in the human body However transplantation of these grown muscles into a living creature which continue to function as if they were native muscle has been taken to the next level by the current work There is great hope in the scientific community that stem cells which can transform into any type of tissue will transform regenerative medicine  Scientists have already made minilivers and kidneys in the lab using stem cells Others have been looking at mending heart muscle with stem cells  But cures and treatments are still some years away
