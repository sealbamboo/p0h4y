 Californias biggest chicken producer has been accused of poisoning people with salmonella bacteria After an outbreak last fall the US Department of Agriculture   to shut down three of the companys plants Since then though the company has   its rates of salmonella contamination dramatically Some food safety experts are now saying the whole poultry industry should follow this companys example The company is also taking the lead in figuring out a food safety mystery How in the world do tests detect salmonella frequently on cutup chicken parts but not on whole chicken carcasses Foster Farms recently gave me a small peek inside its antisalmonella campaign Bob OConnor a veterinarian who has worked at the company for the past  years drove me to a ranch near the town of Merced in Californias Central Valley Its an enormous operation with dozens of long narrow chicken houses lined up on dry bare dirt Foster Farms owns and operates this complex as it does most of its chickenraising farms Other major poultry companies rely on contract farmers an arrangement that has drawn much   Inside one of the houses thousands of little chicks are walking around on the floor Theyre  days old cute and apparently healthy But OConnor says theres a lot that you cant see I cannot look at this flock of birds and say to you that these birds have salmonella in their gastrointestinal tract he says Yet in most cases its safe to assume that some do Scientists have tested some flocks of chickens in the US and Europe and found salmonella in anywhere from  to  percent of all live birds Thats disturbing because people eventually will eat them Fully cooking chicken does kill the bacteria But if salmonella on raw chicken gets on your cutting board and then contaminates say some carrots it can make you really sick For years now the poultry industry has been struggling to limit the presence of salmonella These chicken houses for example are designed to keep out wildlife like mice or wild birds that carry the bacteria When chickens are slaughtered the carcasses are washed with antimicrobial solutions According to USDA regulations no more than  percent of the chicken carcasses coming from a chicken plant can test positive for salmonella Foster Farms  which turns out millions of pounds of chicken meat every week  usually does much better than that We had  percent on most of our carcass sampling for the past three or four years says OConnor The companys executives thought they were doing really well Then last summer the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found   that chicken from Foster Farms had caused a wave of salmonella infections More than  people had gotten sick Inspectors from the USDA arrived at Foster Farms plants and this time they went much further than the standard safety test Instead of just testing whole chicken carcasses they took samples of what most consumers actually buy the cutup parts such as breasts thighs and wings What they found is now shaking up the whole poultry industry Their tests showed salmonella on about  percent of those cutup chicken parts  a former associate commissioner for foods at the Food and Drug Administration says this pattern has been discovered at other poultry companies too Whole carcasses are largely free of salmonella but then the bacteria appear on nearly a quarter of the chicken parts Its a mystery that the poultry industry is now trying to resolve What happened says Acheson Did this bug come in from the environment Did something contaminate it during the process  the equipment the workers something weird like that Or were we missing it the first time Probably we were missing it Acheson says Heres one theory for how When those whole carcasses are tested theyve just been chilled to  degrees But in the next stage of processing when theyre cut up into parts they warm up about  degrees That warmth may release salmonella that was trapped in skin pores of the chilled carcass If any salmonella bacteria are present the process of cutting up the carcass may spread the microbes around contaminating lots of chicken parts No matter how the salmonella got there though Foster Farms had to figure out a way to get rid of it because the USDA was threatening to close three of the companys plants We had  hours to respond to that to come up with a plan to control salmonella prevalence on parts says OConnor Foster Farms brought in outside safety advisers including Acheson the former FDA official who now works as a consultant to food companies Together they embarked on a search for the cause of their problem They tested slaughtered chickens and picked up a clue Birds that grew up on some farms were much more likely to carry salmonella than birds from other farms This is why OConnor has brought me to this farm near Merced This particular farm seemed to have more prevalence for salmonella he says So the company started testing everywhere for salmonella Some experts thought the bacteria might be invading the chicken houses from outside carried by mice or wild birds or beetles The company tested for salmonella on the dirt near the houses and in the green irrigated fields nearby Those are vineyards right there OConnor says gesturing toward one field Those are almond orchards over there Thats where we went We literally dragswabbed through that orchard through that vineyard But they discovered that the farther they moved from the chicken house the less salmonella they found The contamination in fact was concentrated in the houses It seems that once salmonella bacteria got established inside those houses they stayed infecting each new flock of chickens that came to live there So the interventions that we did for broilers were to really focus on cleaning up the houses themselves OConnor says The whole entire house was soaped down Then you disinfect it And then you let it sit We let these farms sit for about six weeks without any birds in them Foster Farms did a lot of other things too It made sure that the breeding hens in their hatcheries were salmonellafree because if those hens have salmonella their offspring will too The company put more money into vaccination and spent more time washing equipment in processing plants It took months but it made a big difference The share of chicken parts that tested positive for salmonella fell from  percent to less than  percent Acheson says thats really good Its setting a new safety standard for the whole industry Others like Seattle attorney   who makes his living suing companies when their food makes people sick say its not good enough The standard is its still OK to have a pathogen on your product that can sicken and kill your customers And as long as thats the way it is were always going to limp from outbreak to outbreak to outbreak he says Marler says the USDA should take the same stand against salmonella that it did against another dangerous microbe diseasecausing E coli When the USDA declared these E coli bacteria illegal adulterants in food the meat industry complained but it also found new ways to prevent them from poisoning people It used to be  percent of my law firms revenue and now its nearly zero Its a success story says Marler Eliminating salmonella altogether would be difficult  its much more common in the environment than diseasecausing E coli So for now the USDA is asking companies to reduce salmonella contamination but its not requiring chicken meat to be completely salmonellafree
