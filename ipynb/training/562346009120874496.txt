e in the UK are justifiably proud of our NHS with about  of us regarding our health service as   But sometimes our obsession with how to improve it can appear somewhat myopic with an overfocus on internal change that can blind us to other approaches from around the world that are already achieving better outcomes for patients This was brought home to me on a recent visit to Shanghai which deals with more than  million episodes of care a year While we in the west still regard China as playing catchup Shanghai is a glittering model of modernity  indeed its almost a glimpse into the future Think airconditioned underground skyscrapers and a savvy smartphoneaddicted population The health service of this hectic booming megacity of  million people has had to keep up So on my trip to the Shanghai Peoples Number One Hospital I got a taste of how a service that operates without an effective primary care system manages to deal with so many patients To cope the hospital is run as a production line for health Rows of endoscopy suites cater for patients and productivity per suite is twice that of UK hospitals Consultants are expected to see all the people who turn up on the day  most without a prebooked appointment  and soon they can be ushered into a nearby operating theatre very often with family members sitting in a huge waiting room just outside the theatre doors Now Im not saying the UK could or should adopt the Shanghai approach to patient demand But this method certainly helps them to deal with their particular circumstances with a very high patienttoclinician ratio China surprised me in other ways too For example they already have national electronic patient records for the whole country to cope with mindboggling patient numbers  something the UK is still grappling with despite numerous costly initiatives over the years And China isnt the only country thats blazing a trail for others We might also want to take a leaf out of the Danes book for their approach to implementing standards for healthcare technology and hospital reconfiguration the Australian funding approach which ensures universal access to care and regulates the private insurance sector to prevent older citizens or those with preexisting conditions being discriminated against or the Norwegian approach to healthcare data sharing and clinical registries   The point here is that theres a whole world out there to learn from We look outside the UK for new technology such as robotic surgery or pharmaceuticals we read journals and papers in our area of specialisation from across the globe However its very rare for the nonclinical leaders in our hospitals  finance directors chief executives and so forth  to sit down and consider the big clinical and policy issues on a national basis let alone an international one And rarely do we get clinicians and hospital management in the same room debating and exchanging views  At Dr Foster weve set up a network of executives and clinicians from progressive hospitals around the world called   which delves into healthcare data to examine differences in outcomes internationally to spot where this can be attributed to clinical practice or policy Its generating a string of international collaborative research programmes which are providing new insight into how different systems are performing relative to each other So for example at our recent conference in London we heard from Prem Chana from the   at Imperial College London His study on emergency laparotomy  a highrisk surgical procedure that involves making an incision to provide access to the abdominal cavity  showed big variations in day mortality rates between England the US and Australia Englands rate was the worst and this is thought to be due to the fact that healthcare systems in the US and Australia provide more robust and efficient pathways of care for emergency patients Meanwhile on stroke care   told us how England which had among the highest mortality rate in  saw a dramatic reduction in stroke deaths over the following five years  an improvement not seen in other countries So as we fixate on the future direction of the   and how we can get the best results for patients with the most efficient use of resources we would do well to lift our eyes occasionally There may not be one perfect health system but its component parts are out there today in hospitals around the world We just need to find them If we examine whats out there already we might save ourselves from reinventing the wheel
