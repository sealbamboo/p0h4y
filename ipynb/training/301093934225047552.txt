Lets say your yearold granny is feeling creaky One of her hips has been giving her trouble and her doctor tells her its time to get it replaced with an implant Theres a catch Grandma isnt old enough for Medicare and she doesnt have health insurance She does however have a stack of cash in the bank and is willing to pay for surgery right away So how much will it cost her Who knows Seriously Researchers from Iowa called  toprated orthopedic hospitals across the country using a script based on Grandmas predicament They asked for the lowest price everything included for a total hip replacement The researchers also asked two other hospitals in each state and Washington DC for good measure Getting an answer wasnt easy Of the top  hospitals only  or  percent provided a bundled price that included fees for both the doctors and the facilities But that response looks terrific compared with how the other hospitals did The researchers were able to get a bundled price estimate from only  or about  percent of the other  hospitals they queried The researchers were able to piece together prices in quite a few instances by contacting doctor groups when hospitals provided only their fees Even after incorporating those figures however total pricing information was available for only  percent of the top hospitals and  percent of the others The prices obtained varied widely from a low of  to more than  The findings were just   by   Why couldnt more hospitals comply Some said a doctor would need to see a patient before an estimate could be given Others said they didnt give out prices over the phone Some just said there was no way they could do it Our calls to hospitals were often greeted by uncertainty and confusion by the hospital representatives about how to assist us the researchers wrote It is sobering to compare our experience with the best practices we have come to expect from other service industries Buying a car used to be like this an   points out A  hip replacement looks a lot like a  Buick But a   that required dealers to post sticker prices on vehicles began a long road to fuller disclosure about prices and specifications that have changed the marketplace for automobiles Now its time for hospitals and doctors to do a better job the authors of the editorial write There is no justification for the inability to report a fee estimate or a fold price variation for a common elective procedure they declare As a matter of fact they argue the health care business is even worse off than the car business was Many doctors and hospitals dont know the price of their products unlike car dealers Still theres hope the editorialists say The history of the automobile industry shows that information asymmetry is treatable they write Health care will need to travel down a similar path It is time we stop forcing people to buy health care services blindfolded  and then blame them for not seeing
