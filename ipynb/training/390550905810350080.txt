If you hit the drivethrough chances are that the cashier who rings you up or the cook who prepared your food relies on public assistance to make ends meet A new analysis finds that  percent of fastfood workers are enrolled in or have their families enrolled in one or more public assistance programs such as SNAP food stamps Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program CHIP Thats right With a median wage of  per hour for frontline fastfood jobs  cooks cashiers and crew  workers are taking home a paycheck but its not enough to cover the basics according to the authors of   The taxpayer costs we discovered were staggering says coauthor Ken Jacobs of the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California Berkeley The combination of low wages meager benefits and often parttime hours means that many of the families of fastfood workers have to rely on taxpayerfunded safety net programs to make ends meet Jacobs told me by phone The report finds that the fastfood industrys low wages combined with parttime hours and lack of health care benefits creates demand for public assistance including  billion per year in Medicaid and Childrens Health Insurance Program CHIP benefits Add on another billion for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program SNAP formerly known as food stamp assistance Earned Income Tax Credit payments a subsidy to lowwage workers amount to about  billion per year Contrary to the assumption that the typical fastfood worker is a teenager living with his or her parents the report finds that the vast majority of frontline fastfood workers are adults who are supporting themselves  and  percent are the main wage earners in their families   of the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign a coauthor of the paper says in a   about the study He says about a quarter of those working these jobs in fastfood restaurants are parents supporting children at home The report was funded by   a group campaigning for higher wages The analysis comes as a campaign for  per hour wages has garnered significant attention around the country Over the past year workers in cities nationwide have temporarily walked off their jobs to protest low wages But some more conservativeleaning economists say raising wages would do nothing to curtail the taxpayer spending on public assistance programs I dont think raising the minimum wage to  an hour would solve that problem   a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute told me during a phone interview He describes himself as a centerright economist Strain says raising wages to that level would have unintended consequences Namely fastfood companies would slow down their hiring And this would lead to more workers looking for jobs  and potentially needing to rely on more public assistance Strain says the  billion taxpayer bill is not necessarily problematic I think the system seems to be working the way it is  not that its working perfectly he says adding In general the government is making sure these peoples basic needs are met which is an appropriate role of government At the same time Strain argues fastfood businesses are paying their workers wages that they judge to be equal to the value these workers are adding to the production process If we were to raise the minimum wage to  an hour I think most economists including me would argue that that would result in a lot fewer workers since fastfood companies would slow down on hiring Ken Jacobs disagrees I think theres very good evidence on whats happened when wages have been improved for lowwage and fastfood workers Jacobs says He points to a fastfood company   as an example of an employer that pays higherthanaverage wages yet is still profitable And Jacobs says some municipalities are raising minimum wages such as San Jose Calif where the minimum wage is set to increase   in January of  And there are proposals in states including   to phase in hourly minimum wage hikes as well Jacobs argues that its possible that employers may see a small decline in profits but when wages are raised you do find a significant decline in turnover of workers which is costsaving for employers
