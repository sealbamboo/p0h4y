The yearold man showed up in Dr Mary Malloys clinic with sadly disfiguring symptoms His hands elbows ears and feet were blemished with protruding pustules and tuberlike welts some so painful it was hard for him to walk He suffered from a rare genetic condition called dysbetalipoproteinemia which caused his cholesterol levels to soar so high that pools of fatty tissue seemed to bubble up under his skin But there was something else about this patient He was missing a gene that when present in one form greatly increases the risk of developing Alzheimers disease Dr Malloy who codirects the Adult Lipid Clinic at the University of California San Francisco and her colleagues saw an opportunity to answer an important neurological riddle Does the absence of the gene  named apolipoprotein E or APOE after the protein it encodes  hurt the brain If a person with this rare condition were found to be functioning normally that would suggest support for a new direction in Alzheimers treatment It would mean that efforts  already being explored by dementia experts  to prevent Alzheimers by reducing eliminating or neutralizing the effects of the most dangerous version of APOE might succeed without causing other problems in the brain The researchers who reported their findings on Monday in the journal JAMA Neurology discovered exactly that They ran a battery of tests including cognitive assessments brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analyses The mans levels of betaamyloid and tau proteins which are markers of Alzheimers gave no indication of neurological disease His brain size was unaffected and the white matter was healthy His thinking and memory skills were generally normal This particular case tells us you can actually live without any APOE in the brain said Dr Joachim Herz a neuroscientist and molecular geneticist at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center who was not involved in the research So if they were to develop antiAPOE therapies for Alzheimers we would not have to worry about serious neurological side effects Apolipoprotein E the protein made by the APOE gene helps transport cholesterol In the blood Dr Malloy said it guides different proteins containing cholesterol into the liver In the brain it chaperones cholesterol from neurons to a storage area while they are changing she said and then returns the cholesterol to neurons The APOE gene has several forms and one of them the APOE variant is the biggest known genetic risk factor for the most common form of Alzheimers People with one copy of APOE about  percent of the population have up to five times the risk of developing Alzheimers compared to people without that variant and they develop the disease earlier People with two copies about  percent of the population have up to  times the risk About  percent of people with two copies will develop Alzheimers by the time they are age  Another form of the APOE gene E is very common but poses less risk A third variant E is rare and is the least dangerous Dr Herz who wrote an editorial about the study said that the protein made by APOE slows the process of clearing betaamyloid buildup in the brain leading to the accumulation of the plaques associated with Alzheimers Proteins made by the other gene variants APOE and APOE clear amyloid more quickly and in the absence of any APOE the turnover is fastest he said So it makes sense that a person with a fastclearing form of APOE or none at all would have a very low risk of Alzheimers Several experts are working on ways to reduce APOE or increase APOE in the brain and the results have been promising Dr Steven Paul a professor of neuroscience at Weill Cornell Medical College has found that by using gene therapy to implant mice with APOE we reduced plaque quite effectively and quite quickly even in mice that also had APOE he said Dr Paul who is head of research and development at Voyager Therapeutics said he is now studying the effect in monkeys If all goes well in a year or so we could be thinking seriously about doing this in humans Research led by Dr David Holtzman chairman of the neurology department at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis found that when mice with amyloid plaques were given a monoclonal antibody that reduces APOE the mice developed fewer plaques and cleared some of them from their brains Decades ago before the link to Alzheimers was known reports on a handful of people without APOE suggested that aside from the physical side effects of astronomical cholesterol levels they appeared otherwise normal But the yearold man a pipefitter who lives in Californias Central Valley and is married with three children is the first documented case of an APOEless person whose brain health has been rigorously tested He was not further identified to protect his privacy This finding is important Dr Holtzman wrote in an email It shows that it is unlikely that APOE is key for normal brain development or function as there are other proteins that can compensate in its absence The fact that Dr Malloys patient is relatively young makes the results a little less strong because amyloid accumulation in people destined to get Alzheimers may not begin until later in life But Dr Herz said based on what we know now I would say this patient will most likely never accumulate amyloid Dr Malloy is working to treat the mans cholesterol problem which has barely improved despite medication and a healthy diet Dr Paul and others said antiAPOE therapies would have to target broad areas of the brain without crossing the bloodbrain barrier and circulating to the liver They consider that a quite realistic goal Things are developing incredibly rapidly these days said Dr Herz who is not involved in creating the new therapies Im very confident that we will find approaches that address these issues
