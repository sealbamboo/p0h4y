Its not the first study that finds the lowly aspirin may protect against the deadliest kind of skin cancer but it is one of the largest And it adds to a   suggesting that cheap common aspirin lowers the risk of many cancers  of the colon breast esophagus stomach prostate bladder and ovary The new study in the journal   looked at melanoma in  postmenopausal Caucasian women Lightskinned people have the highest risk of this cancer Over a year period women who took aspirin at least a couple of times a week had a  percent lower risk of developing melanoma Were really excited aspirin could be used as a potential preventive agent for melanoma Dr Jean Tang of Stanford University Medical School the studys senior author tells Shots In terms of cancer prevention a lower melanoma risk by  percent is very large and significant Tang says women who regularly took aspirin for five years or more had a  percent lower risk Theres nothing else that I know of that has as large an effect as what were seeing with aspirin Tang says Most women in the study took regular doses of aspirin not baby aspirin Interestingly women who took other socalled   painkillers such as   and   did not have a lower risk of melanoma  a point whose possible significance well come back to in a moment Tang says the study accounted for the womens sun exposure and other lifestyle factors such as smoking that increase the melanoma risk The data came from the yearold federally financed   But this study merely observed whether women chose to take aspirin or not and then correlated that with whether they got melanoma This kind of observational study doesnt prove anything We would have to do a large clinical trial randomizing women to receive aspirin versus placebo following them for plus years Tang says She acknowledges that type of goldstandard study isnt likely to happen because its just too expensive to do So this study like so many others leaves open the question What should anybody do I know you want to pin me down and say should women go out and take aspirin for melanoma the Stanford researcher says In somebody whos at high risk for melanoma I would say that taking aspirin is a good idea She says high risk means anybody whos already had    either melanoma or less dangerous kinds either is an indicator of how much sun damage the skin has had People who sunburn easily and dont tan so much are also at higher risk of melanoma But opinion is split on whether the evidence is strong enough to justify regular use of aspirin to prevent melanoma  or any type of cancer Thereve been about eight studies that have looked at melanoma and about half of them find slightly lower risk and half find no connection at all says Eric Jacobs an epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society You look at the totality of the evidence and right now its rather mixed Jacobs says its important to remember that aspirin is a real drug with real side effects It can cause serious and even fatal stomach bleeding even at low doses But Dr Randall Harris of Ohio State University thinks its reasonable for people to take some aspirin for its anticancer effects Hes used Womens Health Initiative data to show that aspirin may reduce the risk of breast cancer You dont need to take too much Harris tells Shots You just need to reset the inflammatory mechanism in my opinion And so you can get by with just a couple of tablets a week Thats what I do  been doing it for a long time Harris is pretty convinced that aspirin prevents cancer by damping down a master gene called   that controls inflammation But Jacobs thinks something else is going on He thinks aspirin may   blood components that promote clotting We know that activated platelets release substances that can encourage cancer growth and development Jacobs says The antiplatelet effect could explain why the new study did not find a reduced risk of melanoma from antiinflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen These NSAIDs dont inhibit platelets the way aspirin does Scientists lack of understanding about how aspirin may exert an antitumor effect is a caution against its widespread use as a cancer preventive agent But skeptics like Jacobs agree with enthusiasts like Tang and Harris on one point The worst thing Tang says would be for people to think I can take aspirin and that justifies me doing indoor tanning That is not the right message Tang says one reason melanoma is   is that so many of them love those
