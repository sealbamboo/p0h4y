Facebook is taking its campaign to boost organ donations to Canada and Mexico this week four months after   The feature allows Facebook users to tell their friends and family that theyre registered organ donors It also directs people who arent signed up as organ donors to the official registries where they live Hows it working so far Between May  and middle of September around  Facebook users posted their donor status on the site according to numbers Facebook provided to Shots It shows the enormous potential of social media saiid   an attorney and a senior fellow at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement said Its no longer theoretical Sadler has been on the front lines of organ donation for decades Along with his twin brother   he helped develop the laws that made organ donor cards legally binding documents The lawyer Sadler said Facebooks new feature has the potential to revolutionize the field of organ transplantation because large numbers of people will be expressing publicly what they want to happen to their organs after they die People are more prone to be influenced by their friends or family than by activists or public health officials But in   recently published by the Hastings Center Sadler argued that much more needs to be done to realize the power of social media networks like Facebook He cited data from   the official organ donor registry in the state On a normal day around  people in California register with Donate Life In the  hours following Facebooks announcement on May  almost  registered However those numbers came back down just as fast as they shot up By May  the number of Californians registering with Donate Life was back to its usual level For social media campaigns like Facebooks to work people need to be continuously prompted Sadler said This is not a top of the mind thing that people think about he told Shots Im not surprised that it didnt have the staying power only because the prompts and the cueing werent repeated There werent reminders Facebook said its already working with   and other organizations to help them make better use of the social network But Sadler said the genie is already out of the bottle in terms of the explosive power social media can have on organ donation If you really use these tools and techniques it can go viral he said I hope it catches on in the next year and we look back and think  was the year when we woke Americans up and started a social epidemic that isnt just a short term phenomenon
