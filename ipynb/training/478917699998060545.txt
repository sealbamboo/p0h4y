The US government is looking for newborns infected with the AIDS virus The National Institutes of Health says it will launch a trial probably next week in which newborns infected with the virus are treated with a strong triplewhammy of HIV drugs to see if the babies can be cured The trial is inspired by the case of the socalled Mississippi baby who made international headlines when doctors said theyd completely cleared her of HIV with a threedrug cocktail similar to the type used to treat adults Now age  the little girl is likely cured says Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID We cant find any virus in her many months after the therapy has been stopped Fauci told NBC News That doesnt even happen with adults treated for years One of the many ways the AIDS virus is transmitted is during birth An infected mother can infect her baby But giving both mother and baby a few doses of two HIV drugs  AZT and nevirapine  can reduce this transmission by  percent Unfortunately HIV infection is so common that even  percent represents a lot And many pregnant women including women in the United States get so little prenatal care that they dont even know they are infected until they are actually giving birth and its too late to protect the baby Only half of women infected with HIV get the medications they need to protect their babies the  In   babies were born with HIV in the  states where monitoring is done the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says Thats what happened with the She was a little premature and so stayed in the hospital Within  hours of birth she was retested and had clear evidence of HIV infection Unusually she then got a cocktail of three drugs at a dose normally reserved for more advanced cases It worked really well  pushing her virus down to whats called undetectable levels The baby and her mom who doctors have never named got regular care and treatment from Dr Hannah Gay at University of Mississippi Medical Center until she was  months old Then like so many children she disappeared off the doctors radar screens The mother brought her back briefly at  months but disappeared again but she missed at least eight months worth of drugs When Gay caught up to her again the baby was still well despite having received no treatment More remarkably tests showed the virus had not come back In    was born in Long Beach Calif to a woman who doctors knew was not taking her HIV medication The infant was treated immediately and the virus is now barely detectable To know if these cases represent real cures or are just flukes researchers will have to do controlled trials testing many babies Fauci says the NIAIDfunded study will looks for  newborns and their mothers in the US South America Africa and elsewhere I dont think there is going to be a problem recruiting in this case Fauci said The babies are going to get treated within  hours of birth Instead of the brief lowdoses of AZT and nevirapine that newborns get to protect them from infection these babies will get a threedrug cocktail and in higher doses that normally given infants We dont anticipate any problems because babies get treated for HIV frequently Fauci said Only one person  the socalled Berlin patient Timothy Brown  has been cured of HIV infection Brown had a bone marrow transplant for leukemia and the donor happened to have a genetic mutation that makes immune cells resist HIV infection The transplant replaced his own infected cells with healthy AIDSresistant cells and he remains free of the virus more than five years later But two other men who also got bone marrow transplants and who had hoped they were cured had their hopes dashed last December when the   Fauci and others think newborns might be different The human immunodeficiency virus is so hard to fight because it infects the very immune system cells that are sent to attack it Then it hides out in the body Drug cocktails can suppress the virus but once they are stopped the virus comes back from its hiding place This hiding place called a reservoir may be the memory Tcells that the immune system makes to recognize previous intruders An infant doesnt have any memory cells yet Fauci said It might be that a babys nave immune system gives the virus nowhere to hide so the HIV drugs can completely wipe it out Doctors running the trials in babies will be looking for evidence of this
