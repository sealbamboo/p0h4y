Theres no question that alcohol is a factor in the majority of sexual assaults on campus And alcohol is abundant and very present at most colleges today In fact federal health officials say   of college students drink And about half say they binge drink This means more than four drinks for women and more than five drinks for men within a twohour time frame Everybodys drinking to get drunk says   a pediatrician and director of the Adolescent Substance Abuse Program at Boston Childrens Hospital Kids tell me this is how they socialize with friends Levy says that whats happening on college campuses is an unfortunate collusion of the brains biology with a hardtoresist environment Though yearolds are legally considered adults their brains are sort of stuck in adolescence Levy says not fully developed till the mids So at  the when students typically enter college the part of their brain in charge of seeking reward and stimulation is in full gear But heres the tricky part The part of the brain that could put the brakes on impulsive behavior is still immature and not fully functioning When people in this age group drink Levy says theyre more likely to do risky things even though their judgment is impaired and some of those things may be dangerous Theyre more likely to drive a car more likely to go for a swim and frankly more likely to have sexual contact And college students drink a lot more than their peers who are not in college Levy says Weve created a situation in which there is an expectation that drinking  heavy drinking  is just part of the college experience Its an experience many teenagers just arent prepared for Last year Alexa was a freshman at a West Coast college She agreed to discuss her drinking experiences with us but because drinking alcohol isnt legal for her or for her classmates under  we agreed not to use her full name Alexa didnt drink or party in high school So it was a real shocker she says when she got to college and alcohol was everywhere You just step out your door and theres a whole community right there its easy theres no challenge to it she says And parties where drinking games abound No problem there either In college Id say theres probably a party five days out of the week she says And even if its not a party Alexa says kids drink in their dorm rooms while playing board games or cards At first she just wasnt interested But then she felt other students viewed her as unapproachable even judgmental And thats not how she wanted to come across So she started going to parties started drinking and got drunk a number of times My decision to fit in backfired on me in the sense that when I did become inebriated I didnt act how I usually act present myself in a way which Im proud of I was just loud obnoxious and probably a bit too honest with people I was just meeting and yeah Im not proud of that Even so Alexa says she was on the luckier side She didnt pass out go to the hospital or get alcohol poisoning But plenty of students do More than a halfmillion people between the ages of  and  get injured   each year according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Federal health officials say more than  die every year from alcoholrelated unintentional injuries including motor vehicle crashes Studies consistently find a link between alcohol and sexual assault on campus Drinking by men increases the odds that they will perpetrate a sexual assault and drinking by women increases their vulnerability One  found a woman was  times more likely to be assaulted if she had had four or more drinks Harvard epidemiologist   wanted to know why some teenagers become binge drinkers in college while others dont She conducted a national   of college freshmen The largest single factor that predicted the uptick of binge drinking for freshmen coming to college was the price they paid for a drink it enormously increased their risk And in most college towns Weitzman says the price is right Its cheap The way the bars compete is through volume discounts they make alcohol very cheap at the perdrink level The bar makes money through volume she says And that bargain price had a lot more to do with whether kids drank than publichealth information about the dangers of alcohol Hence ladies night Twoforone night Specials that appeal to young kids with fake IDs or who may not be carded to prove theyre  and legally able to drink But those effects arent inevitable Weitzman says When colleges partner with local communities to put rules in place and enforce them college drinking decreases In one   Weitzman looked at  universities with high binge drinking rates When the schools and communities asked bars to reduce marketing and promotions that appealed to young people worked with police to close down wild parties and prohibited alcohol ads in student newspapers things changed Students actually drank less and reported fewer hangovers missed classes or academic problems Vandalism went down So did drunken driving and injuries Its not clear whether sexual assault was reduced because so many cases werent reported Weitzman says the findings suggest that communities absolutely have the power to change the environment around them And following the lead of designated drivers with slogans like friends dont let friends drive drunk she suggests strategies like friends dont let friends get out of control
