The way we walk is not just the way we walk The strolling pace of men and women may give away some clues about our romantic partnerships and friendships according to a study published Wednesday in the online journal  Men slow their pace for female romantic partners more so than for women they dont know And when they walk with other men dudes are practically racing according to the study Women on the other hand hardly varied their pace for their beau or guy friend but when walking with each other they slowed down appreciably Reproductive success may underlie the difference  women who can conserve energy and the men who help them do so will have greater chances of producing and caring for offspring according to anthropologist Cara M WallScheffler of the University of Washington Seattle who led the study By men slowing down the female reproduction is protected and thats not something that is trivial WallScheffler said There is so much data that when women are able to reduce the amount of energy they spend walking they have more children Studies have shown that daily walking distances can influence the interval between births and the survival rates of offspring in foraging societies Men generally tend to have a higher optimal speed than women due to differences in size and mass A woman trying to keep up with a man would be burning calories that could prove costly in a challenging environment such as the African bush or Australian outback In indigenous huntergatherer populations  groups who are walking huge amounts  we see females walking together with other females and we see men tending to walk by themselves or maybe with one other individual WallScheffler said Thats typical crossculturally Apparently the same appears true of American college students  of whom walked around a track at a public park for WallScheffler and her fellow researcher Janelle Wagnild a biologist at Seattle Pacific University The men and women  among them romantic partners friends and strangers  walked in various combinations of two and by themselves while researchers measured their speeds Results confirmed that men made more accommodations for their romantic partners than for anyone else but also showed that females would increase their pace for male friends And they all appeared to do so unconsciously WallScheffler said So if US college students arent under the same strains as huntergatherers why would they behave this way Could this behavior be a remnant of some evolutionary selection I definitely think there is an evolutionary outcome WallScheffler said Whether or not selection has acted on this behavior so that we still see it among men today  I dont know if I could go that far
