Schools that do random drug testing say it helps students say no to illegal drugs while critics say its an invasion of privacy But feeling good about school may affect students drug use more than the threat of testing A survey of high school students found that the possibility that they might face drug testing didnt really discourage students from alcohol cigarettes or marijuana But students who thought their school had a positive environment were less apt to try cigarettes and pot Those students were about  percent less likely to try smoke pot and  percent less likely to light up a cigarette than students who didnt feel that their school was a positive place the survey found And the trend held true more or less regardless of demographic or geographic factors Researchers from the University of Pennsylvanias Annenberg Public Policy Center looked at  high school students across the country The students were initially interviewed in  as part of the more general   A year later researchers followed up and asked participants whether they had tried alcohol or smoked cigarettes or marijuana The   was published Monday in the    an author of the study who directs Annenbergs Adolescent Communication Institute says he wasnt surprised by the results In a school with a good climate the kids will respect what the teachers say more he tells Shots The key Romer says is that students need to understand why a school has certain disciplinary policies It basically boils down to how much respect everybody feels toward each other he says Proponents of   say it can act as a deterrent or as a way to identify students in need of help The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the practice twice in  and   But the court limited its use to students participating in competitive extracurricular activities A school that has a positive climate might also practice drug testing Romer said  the two arent mutually exclusive But this study suggests that administrators concerned about substance abuse might want to try programs that encourage a more respectful school climate before turning to drug testing This study is by no means conclusive It doesnt distinguish between schools that implement randomized drug testing and those that only test students suspected of drug use And it doesnt look at whether other drug education programs might have influenced the results These findings reinforce previous research that casts doubt on the effectiveness of drug testing as a deterrent A    from the University of Michigan found that in schools with drug testing students were more likely to turn from marijuana to other illicit drugs One thing that neither a drug policy nor a positive environment seemed to affect was underage drinking It suggests to us that alcohol may be so accepted now in high school culture Romer says that kids think if youre at a party you should be able to drink
