Anybody who has ever worn a cast knows that it can really cramp your style You itch After a while you stink At times it seems like the cast needs even more care than you do Keep it dry or else Other than the addition of garish colors of fiberglass there hasnt been much innovation in cast technology in what seems like forever But down in New Zealand designer   is bringing the latest in D printing to orthopedics The idea which we first saw   by   seems simple enough A person shows up at the ER with a broken bone The doctor assesses the damage with an Xray and then makes a D scan of the limb With a D printer the doc prints out a madetoorder cast called the Cortex and snaps it into place The patient gets a superheroish exoskeleton that is sleek breathable durable and perhaps best of all showerready Shots spoke with   board member of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons who was intrigued by the new design I applaud the innovation  not too much has been done to improve the cast over the last  years he says While praising the creativity Dobbs is skeptical about how useful the Cortex cast would be in the real world It has applications to minor injuries where less stability and protection is needed but it cannot be used for the management of fractures that need to be set he says When fixing a fracture Dobbs says he first sets the bone and then immediately applies a cast This could get complicated with the Cortex if you consider that the scanning and printing of the cast could take quite a while However Dobbs does point out that this is a pretty stylish alternative to the Velcro brace that people often wear for the last two weeks of the healing process In order for this cool concept to be sold as an honesttogoodness product in the US it would have to pass muster with the Food and Drug Administration While casts typically fall in the   its not clear if the radical new design of the Cortex would draw closer scrutiny One thing we do know for sure youd have a hard time getting friends to sign your Cortex
