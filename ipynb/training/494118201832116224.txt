The facial features most associated with approachability were related to mouth shape For example those who were smiling appeared more approachable than someone who was frowning  Attractiveness was linked strongly with eye characteristics larger eyes for example were considered more youthful And dominance was associated with eyebrow height cheekbones and other stereotypical masculine features  However the researchers noted that all attributes had multiple cues and no particular area of the face is essential to making these snap judgments It is fascinating and a bit worrying to see how readily our first impressions of people are influenced by their appearance in photographs explained Tom Hartley one of the researchers who is a neuroscientist and psychologist at the University of York He went on to write in an email that different images of the same person could give different impressions based on pose or expression Lighting and camera position can also play a role which is important to recognize as people move to more online interactions where a profile picture might be the source of a first impression  And that first impression can be easily be wrong Hartley says  So he says be wary of which pictures youre attaching to a resume CV or online dating profile as it could give off an unintended impression  Based on data from the study if you want to seem more approachable and youthful in appearance select images with a front view instead of a side view Smiles and head tilts are favorable Eyes should appear as large as possible And avoid facial stubble unless you prefer to appear dominant
