A federal judge vacated a 33-year-old injunction that had barred the government from releasing Medicare information on individual doctors to the public.. Dow Jones & Co., The Wall Street Journal's parent company, challenged the injunction in 2011 after the Journal published a series of articles showing how the information could be used to expose fraud and abuse in the $549 billion health-care program for the elderly and disabled.
