In early March  Erin Izumi a woman in her s from Tacoma Wash underwent robotically assisted surgery to treat endometriosis The operation at St Joseph Medical Center dragged on for nearly  hours  Ten days later Ms Izumi was rushed to an emergency room where doctors discovered that her colon and rectum had been torn during the operation She was hospitalized for five weeks undergoing a series of procedures to repair the damage including a temporary colostomy according to her attorney Chris Otorowski But even though medical device manufacturers and hospitals are   to a database maintained by the Food and Drug Administration within  days of learning about an incident no report about the case was made in  Hospital officials declined to comment and a spokeswoman for the manufacturer said itÂ became aware of the incident only when Ms Izumi filed a lawsuit It disputed the claim and settled the case in May  That was not the only lapse in reporting problems with robotic surgical equipment a new study has found The equipment called the da Vinci system is made by Intuitive Surgical Inc of Sunnyvale Calif It has been on the market for more than a decade more than a million procedures have been performed with it Between January  and August  thousands of mishaps were reported to the FDA In the vast majority of cases the patient was not harmed but among the reports were   according to a study published last week in The Journal for Healthcare Quality Yet by combing news reports and court records researchers at Johns Hopkins were able to find examples of botched operations that were not reported to the agency They concluded that adverse events associated with the da Vinci were vastly underreported It is fairly well known that reports made to the FDA represent only the tip of the iceberg of surgical complications and adverse drug reactions said Diana Zuckerman the president of the   and an expert on the safety of medical devices who was not involved in the study The consequence is that little is known of the real disadvantages of the equipment and the injuries and deaths it may cause even as robotic surgery is widely marketed to consumers Dr Zuckerman said In a statement Angela Wonson vice president of corporate communications at Intuitive said that the new study gives the misleading impression that Intuitive Surgical has systematically failed in its obligation to timely report known adverse events to the FDA On the contrary she said We take this requirement very seriously and make every effort to account for all reportable events  even those from several years prior The new study follows a series of reports critical of robotically assisted surgery Documents surfacing in the course of legal action against Intuitive have outlined   and raised questions about the quality of training provided to surgeons as well as the pressure on doctors and hospitals to use it  even in cases where it is not the physicians first choice and she has little handson experience Nevertheless robotic surgery has grown dramatically increasing more than  percent in the United States between  and  About  da Vinci systems which cost  million to  million have been purchased by hospitals according to Intuitives investor reports The expansion has occurred without proper evaluation and monitoring of the benefits said Dr Martin A Makary an associate professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins and the senior author of the paper This whole issue is symbolic of a larger problem in American health care which is the lack of proper evaluation of what we do Dr Makary said We adopt expensive new technologies but we dont even know what were getting for our money  if its of good value or harmful Part of the problem is that the reporting mandate has no teeth Dr Makary added In health care one fifth of the economy we have this haphazard smattering of reports that relies on voluntary selfreporting with no oversight no enforcement and no consequences FDA officials said in a statement that the agency has issued warning letters in the past when facilities have failed to report and that the agency can take further regulatory actions like injunctions or imposing civil financial penalties A  study found that  percent of surgeons surveyed anonymously said   while using the da Vinci system Dr Makary noted Women were more likely to be harmed during the robotic procedures Dr Makary and his colleagues found Nearly onethird of deaths that were reported to the FDA database occurred during gynecologic procedures and  percent of the injuries were associated with hysterectomies Any time there is a serious problem with the da Vinci it should be reported Dr Zuckerman said Its the FDAs job to figure out whether this is a problem related to the device or a doctor error
