The less weight a woman gains during pregnancy the less likely she is to have a boy an analysis of data on more than  million births over  years has found  Over all  percent of babies born are boys But Kristen J Navara an endocrinologist in the Poultry Science Department at the University of Georgia found that the amount of pregnancy weight gained and the proportion of males born go up together When mothers gain  pounds roughly  percent of babies born are boys At  pounds gained about  percent are boys and at  pounds about  percent are boys Above  pounds the correlation disappears The   The reasons are unclear but Dr Navara said that male embryos and fetuses have higher metabolic rates and may require more nourishment to develop successfully Low maternal weight gain may therefore be more detrimental to boys than girls More than  million women in our study gained fewer than  pounds during gestation  this  comes out to approximately  missing males Dr Navara said For women who are older she added we do tests around  weeks to find chromosomal problems and we incidentally discover the sex Maybe its worth doing that for everyone so that we can optimize the conditions necessary to survival
