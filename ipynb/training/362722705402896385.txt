Children with an autism spectrum disorder spend about twice as much time playing video games as kids who dont have a developmental disability according to a new study Researchers also found that children with an autism spectrum disorder or attention deficithyperactivity disorder ADHD are at an increased risk of gaming addictions compared to children without the disabilities  What we found is that it looks like addictive gaming was largely driven by inattention Christopher Engelhardt one of the studys authors from the University of Missouri in Columbia told Reuters Health  Previous studies have found that children with an autism spectrum disorder or ADHD spend more time playing video games and are at increased risk for gaming addictions than other children write the researchers in the journal Pediatrics  No single study however has looked at the three groups to see whether shared features of autism and ADHD  such as inattention or hyperactivity  seem to drive video game use  For the new study Engelhardt and his colleague surveyed the parents of  boys between the ages of  and  years old Of those  had an autism spectrum disorder  had ADHD and  were developing normally  Overall they found that kids with an autism spectrum disorder played  on average   hours of video games per day Children with ADHD spent about  hours per day playing video games and normally developing kids played about  hours per day  Kids with an autism spectrum disorder or ADHD were also more likely to have a video game system in their rooms according to the researchers  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children not spend more than two hours in front of a screen per day  The researchers also asked the parents to answer questions about the types of video games their children played the most about their gaming behavior and their symptoms of hyperactivity and inattention  While typically developing kids tended to pick firstperson shooter or sports games children with autism and ADHD were more likely to play roleplaying games  although the latter finding could have been due to chance Roleplaying games have been linked to video game addiction in previous studies  The researchers did find that children with an autism spectrum disorder or ADHD were more likely to exhibit symptoms of video game addiction or problematic video game use compared to kids with typical development  Overall they found the number of hours a child spent playing video games and inattention were linked to video game addiction  Among people with autism the score on problematic video game behavior was driven by inattention and roleplaying video games and not hyperactivity Engelhardt said  The study however cant say autism spectrum disorders or ADHD cause children to play more video games or become addicted to them Also the number of parents surveyed may have limited the researchers ability to detect some differences between the groups  What does seem to be the case is that the average amount that youre playing does seem to be related to problematic video gaming Engelhardt said
