Look at this guy He is halfsmiley halffrowny I drew the mouth carefully to make it equal parts sad and happy But when you look at him  take him in whole  would you say hes having a good day or a bad day Most people would say good day He seems a little more smiley than not Thats because says science writer   when we look at somebody the left side of that persons face is more emotionally powerful and determines the overall emotional tenor So if his left side is happy and his right side is sad left wins  the whole face feels happyish What is equal is made unequal Its as if when I look at you instead of taking you in with one visual gulp Im scanning your face from left to right and the left side feels more dominant Why would that be Well when you look at someone your right brain is doing most of the work Thats the side of your brain that specializes in faces and is extra good at reading emotions But  as you probably know  your right brain operates mainly through the left side of your body So when you look at someones face your right brain pulls in information from the left of your visual field Which means you will notice more read more and remember more about the left side of that persons face His right side matters less If you were to see a photo of that person later and cut it in half youd think Oh this guy looks more like his left side Thats because your brain tricked you to think that way In his     Sam Kean says this habit of looking left has profoundly affected the world of art  especially portrait painting People who sit for artists he says seem to have a sense that the left side of their face is going to pack more emotive power and make a bigger impression than the right side This is almost certainly not a conscious thought but if you look systematically at enough paintings youll see a clear telltale pattern In portrait after portrait you find that subjects instead of looking dead on at the viewer   they will face slightly sideways to give their left side more exposure Mona Lisa is a famous example She or was it Leonardo decided to turn her face ever so slightly exposing more left cheek How big is the showusyourleft bias Well if sitters behaved totally randomly youd expect to see the three basic options equally often  percent would face the audience  percent would turn left  percent would turn right But when scholars looked thats not what they found   of  portraits painted in Europe from the th to the th centuries found that roughly  percent showed the sitter favoring the left side of the face  men  percent of the time women  percent   looked at  objects from the stone age to the present and found that after the early Greeks there was a consistent leftprofile bias When it comes to Jesus suffering on the cross the tilt is dramatic Jesus head is shown facing left   of the time The showusyourleft bias Sam writes held no matter whether the artists themselves were left or righthanded We dont know if the artists told their models I want you to look to the left or if the sitters chose this posture to display their more expressive side But the bias seems universal Sam writes He points out that when the sitter turns the left eye moves toward the center of the canvas like this   which then puts most of the sitters face on the left side where says Sam the facehungry right hemisphere can study it There are exceptions of course Leonardo da Vinci who painted Mona Lisa often went the other way and produced lots of rightfacing portraits Selfportraits it seems often face right But Sam says Artists tend to paint selfportraits in the mirror which makes the left half of the face appear on the right side of the canvas So this exception might actually confirm the bias Curiously Sam found that prominent scientists at least in their official portraits for the Royal Society in England usually face right Perhaps they simply preferred to seem cooler and less emotional  more the stereotypical rationalist A skeptic might say this is learned behavior You go to art school or become an apprentice  the boss turns his subjects to show more left cheek so you pick up the habit So thats what this is a habit And maybe a Western habit Western languages after all read left to right In Arabic the language and the faces might go the other way Sam considered this but he found surveys of portraits in Egypt where texts read right to left turned up a healthy majority of leftfacing portraits as well What about childrens drawings Kids havent been exposed to adult paintings museum art cultural cues  they just grab crayons and draw Do they draw faces looking left They do says Sam Most kids  especially the righties  draw people facing left Overall culture probably influences the direction of portraits somewhat he wrote but most artists naturally highlight the left side This analysis left me thinking When you imagine an artist and model sitting quietly in the studio it looks so quiet so  dull But if Sams idea is right the two of them are actually doing battle The artists right brain is looking at the models left side The models right brain is murmuring paint my left but whats left to the painter is right for the model so the two of them are pushing at each other the model twisting to her left giving the artist less of what the artist wants the artist presumably focusing on what the model is showing less and less of What looks so serene is perhaps a ruthless tug of war the artist saying Give me more left the model saying Im giving you left  but its  Art I always knew it was a sweaty business
