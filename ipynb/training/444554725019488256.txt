When it comes to avoiding unhealthy food it might be that out of sight means out of mind  The more fastfood joints people encounter around their homes and workplaces the likelier they are to be obese according to a study published Thursday Researchers from the University of Cambridge found that the people who are most exposed to fast food were almost twice as likely to be obese as those who were least exposed The idea seems commonsense But up to this point its really just been based on a hunch says Thomas Burgoine the studys lead author and a research associate at the UKs   The researchers surveyed nearly  adults who live in Cambridgeshire County England about their eating habits They also looked at the number of fastfood and takeout joints around the participants homes commuting routes and workplaces The results   in the  While the findings suggest an association between peoples food environments and their chances of being overweight they dont prove that one directly causes the other But   tells The Salt the research does suggest that policies restricting the number of fastfood joints in a neighborhood might be on the right track For example since  Los Angeles has had a   on the opening of new fastfood outlets in South LA a neighborhood that suffers from alarmingly high rates of poverty and obesity Burgoine says that the number of fastfood restaurants in many neighborhoods both in the US and the UK have skyrocketed over the past few years As I was doing the research I really got to thinking about my food exposure and my travel from where I live on one side of Cambridge to the other says Burgoine whose research focuses on the interaction between obesity and environment And the dining options around our workplaces can be especially significant Burgoine says A quick burger or takeout is especially appealing to people rushing to feed themselves during a limited lunch break The study found that on average people were exposed to  percent more fast food at work than at home Of course access to fast food is only one reason that people might reach for unhealthy foods Studies have shown that everything from peoples income and upbringing to the layout of their local supermarket can affect their choices But the researchers found that the risk of obesity increased with the density of fastfood joints even after controlling for demographic factors like age income and education and the amount of calories that participants burned through physical activity Still this study doesnt show whether limiting the number of fastfood restaurants in a neighborhood will affect peoples risk of obesity in the long term It also doesnt look at whether the availability of healthier choices played a role Changing the food environment even with evidence like this isnt likely to be the answer by itself Burgoine says But it might be one part of a wider solution
