While the Ebola outbreak continues to rage in West Africa it is also unfolding  in a virtual sense  inside the computers of researchers who study the dynamics of epidemics Policymakers look to these simulations to get a sense of   They also can use them to run experiments to see which public health measures should take priority Ive spent a lot of time doing computer models of disease transmission but rarely does it involve something in Africa Africa is often overlooked says   a computational epidemiologist at Virginia Tech So when a defense agency called him a few weeks ago and asked him to model the Ebola outbreak he was excited by the challenge Lewis started plugging data into his computer He uses the official numbers of how many people have died or gotten infected even though those are probably underestimates And he says health officials really dont have a handle yet on other important stuff thats going on  like how many infected people stay at home versus go to a hospital or how burial practices spread infection Some of those factors are the ones that are hard to measure he says Youve got to choose how much of this complexity you care to explicitly represent Whats more they cant assume this will play out like past Ebola outbreaks  those hit much smaller populations in more isolated rural areas Despite all this uncertainty Lewis says his models have been able to predict the course of the epidemic so far At the moment these models  at least for Sierra Leone and Liberia  we arent putting in any mitigating factors Were just letting these things run unthrottled Lewis says And theyve just been surging up And theyve been unfortunately accurate in the last couple of weeks in terms of the number of cases coming out He says if you just kept this simulation going on and on it shows Ebola spreading across the continent But this scenario hes constructed doesnt include all the public health measures starting to ramp up now We know in the real world there are efforts being directed out there there are resources being allocated says Lewis Until we understand that better and can incorporate that into the model I dont think its very useful to speculate out past a week or two Some computer simulations focus on the risk of Ebola spreading to other countries   at Northeastern University creates those models using information about air travel and other kinds of transportation His work suggests that Ebola could find its way to African nations like Ghana Gambia and Senegal There is a tangible risk of spreading in the region to other countries says Vespignani probably in the ballpark of  to  percent in the next few weeks He notes poor countries might have trouble keeping an imported case from spreading And the larger this outbreak gets the harder it will be to contain So while his model currently suggests that the risk of Ebola reaching the US or Europe in the next six weeks or so is very small  just a small percentage  that could change if the outbreak in Africa continues to grow Vespignani says we need to extinguish the fire so that Ebola doesnt really become a threat to the rest of the world in the next months Given that all this modeling is as much an art as a science different groups working on the problem have been comparing notes Theyve also been fielding calls from government officials and policymakers  who heads up the unit at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention thats been creating computer models of the outbreak says that people always ask him the same two questions How many people are going to die and when is this going to end He tells them too much is unknown to give any reliable answer Mostly he says the models just illustrate the need for old triedandtrue methods for disease control such as quickly identifying patients and isolating them Modeling wont stop this disease says Meltzer We know how to stop this disease Its fairly simple and its a matter of getting the simple activities and practices in action  in place on the ground Thats the struggle now he says Because while its easy to change a line of computer code in a simulated epidemic and say reduce a transmission rate by  percent its a lot harder to do that in the real world
