Two herdsmen in the country of Georgia have been infected with a brandnew virus scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday The newly identified virus is a second cousin to smallpox And like smallpox it causes painful blisters on the hands and arms Other symptoms include a fever swollen lymph nodes and overall weakness CDC scientists   at a meeting in Atlanta We consider this family of viruses very important because smallpox could be used as a bioterrorism agent says disease detective Neil Vora who led the team that made the discovery The virus doesnt yet have a name Vora says because so little is known about it We havent found any evidence of humantohuman transmission so far Vora tells Shots But how many people are getting sick Are animals getting sick We dont know  We dont know if it has caused any deaths Both of the men who caught the virus fully recovered But related viruses such as   can be deadly for people with suppressed immune systems And   had a fatality rate of about  percent before the illness was eradicated in  Since then widespread vaccinations for smallpox have stopped And this immunization gap seems to be opening the door for other viruses in the family  known as    to resurface Vora says When you vaccinate a person with one of these viruses it protects against other viruses in the family Vora says Since smallpox vaccinations stopped theres some indication that other  orthopoxviruses have started to increase in their incidence because theres less immunity Four other viruses in that family infect people cowpox monkeypox vaccinia and smallpox All but smallpox generally infect animals  cows cats or monkeys  then jump to people opportunistically Both of the infected Georgian men caught the new virus from dairy cattle At first local health workers thought one man had anthrax  anthrax infections of the skin are   in rural parts of that country But when tests came back negative the public health department contacted the CDC for help Vora and his team quickly figured out they were dealing with a poxvirus But it turned out to be one that had never been seen before The discovery brings up the question of what other viruses might be circulating out there that are even more closely related to smallpox and cowpox Vora says Although smallpox was eliminated in the wild stores of the virus still exist in a few American and Russian laboratories And theres growing concern that it could be used for   Last year the US government spent about  million on a relatively new smallpox medicine in case the virus was deliberately released in a bioterrorism attack That   could treat about  million people
