Walk through a health food store and youll find amaranth sorghum quinoa  heritage grains that have been staples around the world for generations Americans are just discovering them Theres another ageold grain that grows right here on the Great Plains millet The millet plant is droughttolerant and nutritionally it competes with quinoa the proteinrich South American grain that American farmers   to grow Millet though hasnt quite taken off like quinoa has thanks in large part to perception and production issues On the surface millet has many things going for it Its glutenfree appealing for   and high in protein And it can be marketed to locavores Colorado   about half of the nations millet with the rest largely coming from South Dakota and Nebraska But then theres millets image problem Most shoppers if theyve heard of it at all equate millet with bags of birdseed Its not exactly the first choice when picking out a side dish It is a perception thats still out there but its actually a different millet than what were raising for human consumption and so were working very hard to introduce millet for food says Jean Hediger a farmer who runs an informal coop of millet growers based in Nunn Colo When it comes to millet Hediger says many consumers think bird feeder not dinner plate Despite the birdseed issue millet is gaining momentum with consumers Hediger says Her sales have increased significantly over the past few years But last year the farmers hit a huge setback when the usually droughttolerant millet withered under exceptionally hot and dry conditions Some farmers lost up to  percent of their crop Last year was a disaster says Hediger You know all of a sudden our sales are doubling and tripling  its really terrific  and then our buyers call and we say Well we had a drought we cant get access to the crop and theres just a limited amount  That limited amount drove up prices for millet threefold making it even tougher to compete on grocery store shelves Introducing new products is very tough says Tim Larsen who does marketing for Colorados Department of Agriculture Larsen took on millet as a pet project a few years ago after realizing the grains potential Millet is already eaten widely across Asia and Africa but only in small pockets in North America Unlike almost every other crop grown in the country no trade association exists to market millet Instead its just a loose group of farmers with support from state agriculture officials promoting millet which makes it tough to break into new markets The grain needs adventurous chefs and tastemakers to promote it to really take off Larsen says One cook whos taking a liking to millet is Amie Arias She runs the   a veganfriendly food truck in Denver On warm nights she serves a dessert that includes puffed millet They are a chocolatehazelnutbutterRiceKrispiemillet treat says Arias Many customers who come to her van have never heard of millet or are surprised to find it in a dessert I have to explain it and sometimes people are little apprehensive that its not going to taste so good in a Rice Krispie treat but they expect something just sweet and millet doesnt usually fall into those categories Arias said Sweets are always the best kind of introduction to any kind of food because most people enjoy them and theyre not afraid to try them And maybe next time she says theyll try eating millet without it covered in chocolate and topped with a scoop of ice cream
