The NHS has removed all but one of  patient reviews of a healthcare trust from its website after BBC Newsnight found the system was open to abuse Newsnight found that last year  of patient reviews   of   about Nottinghamshire Healthcare Trust on NHS Choices had come from staff accounts Some  of those from staff accounts did not declare a conflict of interest Staff often help patients to post reviews but the trust acknowledged it needed to be clearer who wrote them The reviews were originally posted to independent feedback website Patient Opinion but syndicated to appear on the NHS Choices website Most of the reviews posted without staff declaring a conflict of interest were from staff accounts that had declared themselves on other occasions when posting on behalf of patients Any data that notes when a staff member has posted is automatically stripped out on NHS Choices A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust said We acknowledge that postings need to be clearer about who is writing them and we are working on a solution for this internally and with Patient Opinion  We have created a public website so that anyone can see what is being said about our services because we want to be open and honest about the feedback we receive Patient Opinion said it supported trusts to help people with mental health problems learning difficulties the elderly or those without internet access to post reviews We absolutely accept that it must be clear to everyone when a story has been added by staff on behalf of a patient or carer We have updated our site so that we can now show this correctly for past and future stories However it added that it had no reason to doubt the legitimacy of reviews posted by staff The single review left on NHS Choices about the trust which was not syndicated from Patient Opinion has the title seriously let down and awards one star out of five The anonymous review posted last year reads I have been let down by the service at every opportunity when I was at my most desperate  The removal of the trusts reviews from NHS Choices comes as NHS England prepares to roll out its own patient feedback site Care Connect The issue of potential system abuse is not unique to Nottinghamshire but the trust was frequently flagged up during the Newsnight investigation Analysis of  reviews submitted to Patient Opinion last year found that  had been posted from computers connected to the NHSs secure computer network Reviews linked to NHS computer networks were critical of a trust or hospital in one in  cases compared with one in four across all reviews   Data released to Newsnight also showed that six of the most recent  reviews submitted to Care Connect originated from hospital computer networks  Sixteen reviews posted to Care Connect from computers connected to the NHS network had an average score of  out of five stars compared with the overall average of  out of five stars The NHS is currently piloting Care Connect across  healthcare trusts The system was due to be rolled out across the country by the end of the year but the NHS has since dropped that ambition Care Connect will enable patients to submit reviews of care both online and by traditional means and to leave a starrating of hospitals against criteria such as cleanliness and involvement in decision making Gary Walker a former United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust chief executive who became an NHS whistleblower told Newsnight Your data has already shown that staff in the NHS are reporting data  thats wrong  and the data theyre reporting is skewing the results and that has to be wrong so its making the data the public sees almost meaningless The original plan behind all of this was to try and improve the quality of services I dont think thats being achieved at the moment Patient Opinion already gives reviewers the option to indicate that they are NHS staff a family member carer friend or volunteer but Care Connect does not Neil Churchill director of patient experience for NHS England told Newsnight that the vast majority of comments on Patient Opinion were coming from patients carers or their families He said the NHS was leading the world in the use of patient feedback We cant guarantee that all reviews are coming from patients and families but we are very sure that the vast majority are he insisted He said what happened in Nottinghamshire was a very interesting experiment to help vulnerable patients to have a voice He added These reviews were coming from learning disabilities services they were coming from secure hospitals they were coming from older people in mental health wards and what staff were doing was writing up their feedback for them and posting them on Patient Opinion
