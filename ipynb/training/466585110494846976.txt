The deadly and mysterious MERS virus which arrived in the United States for the first time this month is not yet a global health emergency the World Health Organization said Wednesday But the spread of the virus  its now confirmed in  people and was reported in a traveler to the Netherlands for the first time Wednesday  is a situation of concern and urgency WHO said Its killed  people WHO experts urged Saudi Arabia the main source of the infection to   and to cooperate with experts to study it and understand it better Most urgent is the need to strengthen and improve infection practices in hospitals WHOs Dr Keiji Fukuda told reporters after a meeting of WHOs International Regulations Emergency Committee We saw many examples where infection control practices have broken down But theres no evidence the virus has changed in a way that makes it easier to catch It spreads from one person to another but not very well and usually only with close and prolonged contact Genetic tests and close looks at who has been infected and how suggest its still not very transmissible Fukuda said Thats one reason the committee has not declared an emergency And careful hygiene should go a long way to control the virus he said Wearing gloves at the right time wearing masks at the right time  washing your hands he said We dont think there are esoteric methods needed to control this infection Fukuda says the WHO has the attention and for now the cooperation of countries such as Saudi Arabia where MERS is most common Some people call them teachable moments Fukuda said I think this is one of the moments we have before us WHO and other experts agree that studies are desperately needed on how much of the population is infected with MERS especially in Saudi Arabia where the vast majority of cases have been MERS is a coronavirus in the same family of viruses as many common cold viruses and its possible that people can be infected and get symptoms no worse than a sniffle And while camels have been identified as a carrier of the virus most patients have had no contact with camels so doctors are asking how the virus gets into people I am hopeful that given the new shared sense of responsibility and urgency that we will get to see these studies go forward Fukuda said Right now we dont have a good handle on what is the route for the virus to go from somebody who is infected to somebody who is not infected One question  is it carried on droplets of mucus or saliva that people might cough out Whether it remains on the surfaces of walls or buildings or utensils in hospitals certainly I dont know that information right now Fukuda said  MERS virus was first seen in  and most cases are linked to the Arabian Peninsula although its now been seen in  countries including the newly reported case in the Netherlands Saudi Arabia has seen a big jump in cases in the past few weeks and hospital officials around the world are on alert because some of the clusters are clearly happening in hospitals Both of the men who carried MERS to the US worked in hospitals where MERS patients were treated  one in Jeddah one in Riyadh Experts have noted that both men showed up in US emergency rooms without warning others that they might have MERS despite frequent warnings that anyone who has serious respiratory symptoms and who has recently been in the Middle East should think MERS right away and take precautions against infecting anyone else Fukuda said Saudi hospitals are working hard to control MERS but experts saw some clear groups  for instance health workers wearing gloves which is good but not always changing them in between patients Sometimes a worker would wear the same mask all day instead of changing masks between each patient Awareness may be different from hospital to hospital Fukuda said Theres no specific treatment for MERS Patients get whats called supportive care  intravenous fluids oxygen or a breathing tube if needed and pain medications The first US MERS patient has fully recovered and been sent home from the hospital in Indiana where he was treated Theres no evidence he infected anyone else The second is in isolation in a hospital in Orlando Twenty healthcare workers who treated him before they knew he had MERS are also in isolation although experts doubt they were infected Two health workers who treated the patient  and but test results released Wednesday show they   Family members and people who were exposed to the Florida patient in the hospital there are also being watched and tested just in case And health officials are   on four flights the traveler took to get to Orlando from Jeddah
