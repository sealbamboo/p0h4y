A few months ago I was on a Manhattanbound D train heading to work when a man with a chunky noisy newspaper got on and sat next to me As I watched him softly turn the pages of his paper a chill spread like carbonated bubbles through the back of my head instantly relaxing me and bringing me to the verge of sweet slumber  It wasnt the first time Id felt this sensation at the sound of rustling paper  Ive experienced it as far back as I can remember But it suddenly occurred to me that as a lifelong insomniac I might be able to put it to use by reproducing the experience digitally whenever sleep refused to come Under the sheets of my bed that night I plugged in some earphones opened the YouTube app on my phone and searched for Sound of pages What I discovered stunned me 
There were nearly  million videos depicting a phenomenon called autonomous sensory meridian response or ASMR designed to evoke a tingling sensation that travels over the scalp or other parts of the body in response to auditory olfactory or visual forms of stimulation The sound of rustling pages it turns out is just one of many ASMR triggers The most popular stimuli include     performing repetitive mundane tasks like   or   and roleplaying where the videographer usually a breathy woman softly talks into the camera and pretends to give    for example or an eye examination The videos span  minutes on average but some last more than an hour For those not wired for ASMR  and even for those who like me apparently are  the videos and the cast of characters who produce them  sometimes called ASMRtists or tinglesmiths  can seem weird creepy or just plain boring Try pitching the pleasures of watching   guy slowly and silently assemble a computer for  minutes  Two of the most wellknown ASMRtists   more than  subscribers and   more than  subscribers said that although they sometimes received lewd emails and requests many of their followers reached out to them with notes of gratitude for the relief from anxiety insomnia and melancholy that their videos provided Some say the mundane or monotonous quality of the videos lulls us into a muchneeded state of serenity Others find comfort in being the sole focus of the ASMR actors tender affection and care Or perhaps the assortment of sounds and scenarios taps into pleasing childhood memories I grew up falling asleep hearing the sounds from my fathers home office A computer engineer he was continually sorting through papers tapping keys  and assembling and disassembling PCs and MACs 
 Dr Carl W Bazil a sleep disorders specialist at Columbia University says ASMR videos may provide novel ways to switch off our brains  People who have insomnia are in a hyper state of arousal he said Behavioral treatments  guided imagery progressive relaxation hypnosis and meditation  are meant to try to trick your unconscious into doing what you want it to do ASMR videos seem to be a variation on finding ways to shut your brain down So far it seems to work for me Like many insomniacs I have over the years tried natural remedies like valerian root or melatonin vigorous exercise regimens and strong sleeping pills like Ambien and Lunesta But sleep rarely came Nothing has worked as well and consistently as watching a man in an ASMR video   and his   But locating the neurological underpinnings of this trippy sensation wont be easy Many of the scientists I reached out to shied away from the subject saying the area is pseudoscience with a lack of published studies  Bryson Lochte a postbaccalaureate fellow at the National Institute on Drug Abuse who looked into ASMR for his senior thesis as a neuroscience major at Dartmouth College last year has submitted his paper for publication in a scientific journal Mr Lochte said  We focused on those areas in the brain associated with motivation emotion and arousal to probe the effect ASMR has on the reward system   the neural structures that trigger a dopamine surge amid pleasing reinforcements like food or sex He compared ASMR to another idiosyncratic but wellstudied sensation called musical frisson which provokes a thrilling ripple of chills or goose bumps technically termed piloerection over ones body in emotional response to music Mathias Benedek a research assistant at the University of Graz in Austria  who coauthored two studies on emotionprovoked piloerection says ASMR may be a softer quieter version of the same phenomenon Frisson may simply be a stronger fullblown response he said And like ASMR the melodies that ignite frisson in one person may not in another Robert J Zatorre a professor of neuroscience at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital at McGill University who has   said that the upshot of my paper is that pleasurable music elicits dopamine activity in the striatum which is a key component of the reward system in the brain Writing in The New York Times last year in an article titled    he notes  What may be most interesting here is   this neurotransmitter is released not only when the music rises to a peak emotional moment but also several seconds before during what we might call the anticipation phase Perhaps the everyday experiences that ASMR videos capture  whispering crinkling opening and closing of boxes  evoke similar anticipatory mechanisms sparking memories of past pleasures that we anticipate and relive each time we watch and listen The whole topic is still very much unknown Mr Lochte said I would be very interested to see what other traits correlate with ASMR sensitivity whether it is an inherited attribute and what sort of physiological effects the sensation has on the body All of these questions will be easy to answer with quick followup studies Our study we hope will help lay the groundwork
