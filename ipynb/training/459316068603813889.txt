Sevenyearolds are happier when they are allowed some sweets snacks and television time rather than none at all suggests a study of childrens wellbeing Children who enjoyed school PE a lot were more likely to feel positive than those who didnt like it Nearly  children were surveyed as part of a study by   Researchers said a healthy lifestyle had a longerterm effect on wellbeing The study funded by the Department of Health looked at many different factors which have an impact on childrens happiness or how much they worry It found that sevenyearold children were happiest when they got on well with siblings had fun with family members at weekends and had parents who did not shout or smack them Children were more likely to feel unhappy and worried if they lived in a deprived area There was no difference in how worried or happy they felt whether they had one parent or two However when researchers looked at how healthy eating and healthy behaviour affected happiness in children they found an inconsistent picture On the one hand enjoyment of PE lessons was positively associated with child wellbeing but a healthy diet was not For example children who regularly ate snacks such as biscuits and cakes were just as likely to report being happy as children who did not report eating such snacks Wellbeing was lower among children who never watched television and among those who watched it the most while wellbeing was higher among those who watched television but for less than an hour a day The study said Being happier and lacking worry does not mean never having sweets snacks and television In fact there was some indication in the results that higher wellbeing was more likely when these were enjoyed in moderation  The influence of a healthy diet and plenty of exercise on wellbeing was likely to be more complex and longer term it added It said establishing positive health behaviours at an early age could lead to healthier outcomes in later life such as a normal BMI   body mass index  and fewer chronic health conditions which could contribute to higher wellbeing at that stage of life The data for the study was gathered from the Millennium Cohort Study of  children and their parents born in  and surveyed in  In a separate survey of  to yearolds wellbeing which forms party of the same study researchers found a similar relationship between some aspects of healthy eating and happiness  Young people who reported eating fast food or takeaways at least once a week reported feeling happier on average compared with those who ate fast food only occasionally or never  But it is possible that eating this type of food as a family or social activity can have a positive impact on children and young peoples wellbeing Jenny Chanfreau senior researcher at NatCen Social Research said there were still many strong arguments for promoting healthy behaviour among children Not least that behaviours learnt early in life may continue into adulthood and unlike among children adults who eat more fruit and vegetables do have higher levels of wellbeing The studys finding that children who said that they liked PE a lot had much higher odds of happiness than children who said that they like it a little or not at all could be important for primary schools it said Making PE lessons playful and fun is both good for child wellbeing and may contribute to establishing positive health behaviours for later in life the study said
