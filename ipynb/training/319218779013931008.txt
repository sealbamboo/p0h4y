Polio is on the verge of being eliminated Last year there were just over  cases of polio and they occurred in just two remote parts of the world  northern Nigeria and the rugged AfghanPakistan border region A new  billion plan being pushed by the World Health Organization strives to eliminate polio entirely phase out vaccination campaigns and secure polio vaccine stockpiles in case the virus somehow manages to reemerge If the effort is successful polio would be just the second disease in human history after smallpox to be eliminated by medical science Weve never been so close to eradication as we are now says Hamid Jafari the director of   at WHO A quarter of a century ago there were roughly  polio cases a year worldwide By  that number had dropped to  and last year it was down to  The new   aims to bring the number of new wild polio cases down to zero by  and eradicate the virus entirely by  It targets wild polio from normal transmission and the handful of socalled vaccinederived cases which are caused by the vaccine The plan calls for an orchestrated global transition from the oral vaccine which contains live polio virus and thus can cause vaccinederived polio paralysis to an injected vaccine made from dead virus Jafari says previous attempts to wipe out polio have stumbled because they lacked global coordination or adequate funding And the biggest risk to the new plans success is if it is not financed up front In the s polio was spread all around the globe Terrified parents in the US wouldnt allow their children to go swimming in late summer out of fear that theyd catch the incurable condition Slowly polio has been eliminated from one part of the world after another Now it continues to spread only in isolated parts of Nigeria Afghanistan and Pakistan The WHO UNICEF and the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation among others have been pouring resources in to attack polio in these three countries Even though polio appears to be backed into a corner Jafari says it still has the potential to spread Even as recently as  we had an outbreak in China as a result as importation from Pakistan that killed many adults he says Earlier this year the sewage sampling in Cairo detected wild polio virus that originated in parts of Pakistan The areas of Pakistan Afghanistan and Nigeria where polio remains a problem are also areas torn by violence As recently as February    in the northern Nigerian city of Kano  who works on vaccinedelivery programs for the Gates Foundation says these incidents are unfortunate but he points out that polio has been eliminated in other places during times of conflict In specific places like Somalia Sudan El Salvador  it was during active conflict polio was stopped in those countries he notes Mallya says whats really impressive is that India hasnt reported a new case of wild polio in more than two years He says the new strategic plan incorporates many of the techniques and tools that were used in India to finish off the virus
