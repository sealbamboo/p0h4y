According to the nurses note the patient had received a clean bill of health from his regular doctor only a few days before so I was surprised to see his request for a second opinion He stared intently at my name badge as I walked into the room then nodded his head at each syllable of my name as I introduced myself  Shifting his gaze upward to my face he said Im here Doc to make sure I dont have anything serious Im not sure my regular doctor was listening to everything I was trying to tell him I smiled To hide my embarrassment  I had walked into the exam room to listen to this patient but my mind was a few steps behind as I struggled with thoughts about the colleague whod just snapped at me over the phone because she was in no mood to get another new consult my mounting piles of unfinished paperwork and the young patient with widespread cancer whom Id seen earlier in the day Thoughts about my new patient jumbled in the mix too but they came into focus only after I had pushed away the fears that I might have neglected to order a key test on my last patient that Id forgotten to call another patient and that I was already running behind schedule That relentless inner conversation came to mind this past week when I   on   in the current issue of The Annals of Family Medicine   has revealed that unrelenting job pressures cause twothirds of fully trained doctors to experience the emotional mental and physical exhaustion characteristic of burnout Health care workers who are burned out are at higher risk for substance abuse lying cheating and even suicide They tend to make more errors and lose their sense of empathy for others And they are more prone to leave clinical practice Unfortunately relatively little is known about treating burnout But   the ability to be fully present and attentive in the moment as a possible remedy A   can help doctors become more focused more empathetic and less emotionally exhausted  But two important questions remain unanswered How does mindfulness affect patients And who really has the time to enroll in training courses that can take several weeks or longer The studies in The Annals of Family Medicine attempt to answer those questions  In   researchers first assessed the baseline mindfulness of  doctors nurses and physician assistants by asking them to respond to statements like I tend to walk quickly to where I am going without paying attention to what I experience along the way I find myself listening to someone with one ear doing something else at the same time and I forget a persons name almost as soon as Ive been told it for the first time Then the investigators recorded the clinicians interactions with more than  patients and interviewed the patients to gauge their level of satisfaction After analyzing the audio recordings and the patients responses the researchers found that patients were more satisfied and more open with the more mindful clinicians They also discovered that more mindful clinicians tended to be more upbeat during patient interactions more focused on the conversation and more likely to make attempts to strengthen the relationship or ferret out details of the patients feelings  The less mindful clinicians on the other hand more frequently missed opportunities to be empathic and in the most extreme cases failed to pay attention at all responding for example to a patients description of waking up in the middle of the night crying in pain with a question about a flu shot Significantly the most mindful doctors remained efficient They accomplished just as much medically for their patients as their least mindful colleagues despite all the extra conversation with patients about experiences and relationships  We clinicians are not always fully present for patients because our minds are always working said Dr Mary Catherine Beach lead author of the study and an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University But when we dont listen failing to let patients say what they need to say or ask what they need to ask we end up giving explanations that are too long and complicated and responses that they dont need or want  For many doctors its not the lack of interest that prevents them from incorporating mindfulness into their clinical practices its the time required to complete a standard training course The courses require a significant commitment ranging   to a    In the   another group of investigators looked at the effects on  physicians of a mindfulness course that required only one weekend and two followup evening sessions a couple of weeks apart Even after such an abbreviated course the researchers found decreased levels of burnout anxiety depression and distress among the doctors And nearly a year later those salutary effects persisted even without any mindfulness training booster sessions We tried to get the training down to the bare minimum and as userfriendly as possible said Dr Luke Fortney lead author of the study and an integrative and family medicine physician who is part of the Meriter Medical Group at the McKee Clinic in Madison Wis We didnt want to exhaust the doctors with another burden Dr Fortney and his colleagues filled the condensed course with techniques adapted for busy clinicians like the two feet one breath technique in which a doctor just before entering an exam room stands in front of the door and concentrates on breathing and the feeling of his or her feet on the ground as a way to help focus on the moment They also created a   that reinforces key points and offers helpful advice in the form of short videos brief audio recordings and easytodigest tables  While more work needs to be done these two studies add to the growing body of research supporting mindfulness training as a way to improve the health of both doctors and their patients Mindfulness gives doctors permission to attend to their own health and wellbeing Dr Beach said But it also allows doctor to help patients by listening more talking less and seeing what the patients need
