Robert Vondracek has had multiple sclerosis for  years His speech is starting to slur and hes been having more trouble getting around and when he heard about a controversial stem cell therapy that might help he got excited I heard about the stem cell treatments being done right here in Phoenix said Vondracek  It shocked me because it was not approved in this country I didnt think The therapy was offered by an Arizona plastic surgeon who gives the stem cell treatments in the same clinic where he does cosmetic procedures But when Vondraceks neurologist heard about his interest in the therapy which would cost  per treatment He went crazy said Vondracek He strongly advised Vondracek against it Plastic surgeons other doctors and naturopaths at more than  clinics round the country are charging thousands of dollars for a controversial procedure called stem cell therapy to treat a range of disorders including neurological diseases like MS and Parkinsons The procedure has angered many neurologists and prominent researchers who say these doctors are preying on vulnerable people and capitalizing on the huge but still unrealized potential of stem cell research which they say is years away from producing an approved treatment for neurological diseases Peddling snake oil in the guise of stem cell therapies is really a threat to legitimate research said Dr George Daley director of the Stem Cell Transplantation Program at Boston Childrens Hospital past president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research and a professor at Harvard Medical School Finding cures is hard it takes sometimes decades its extremely expensive and its not something that we can just wish and hope for he said It can only be achieved through very very hard work The stem cell therapy usually involves using liposuction to extract a patients fat before separating out the stem cells using a centrifuge The stem cells are then injected into the patients blood stream the same day intravenously Prices for this and similar treatments range from  to  per session The treatments have been popular in Europe and Asia for years but until recently were unavailable in this country But in the past few years stem cell therapy clinics have cropped up in the US and their numbers are increasing due to the franchiselike expansion of groups like the Californiabased Cell Surgical Network We are growing said Dr Mark Berman a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon who was one of the Cell Surgical Networks founders He said he trained two doctors to perform the procedure just this week Dr Steven Gitt  the Phoenix plastic surgeon whose services Robert Vondracek ultimately decided not to use is also a member of the Cell Surgical Network Gitt says he makes certain to tell his patients the procedure is not a cure and informs them they are participating in a study Were doing it ethically and honestly We are gathering good data and we are contributing and we are helping said Gitt in a recent interview with NBC News He stressed that the procedure is safe and he knows of no patient who has been injured by it Gitt said that  to  percent of the people who receive the treatment have a positive outcome meaning their quality of life is improved When asked for neurological patients who had a positive outcome to interview he suggested NBC News speak with Libby Aira whose yearold daughter Darian was hit by a car and suffered a traumatic brain injury eight years ago Darian is unable to communicate We did the stem cells and just a few hours later she reached for a glass of water on the right side her affected side said Libby She couldnt grasp or hold it but just that intention of reaching for it was something we hadnt seen Since then weve seen very slow little things No big major steps  I want her walking  but now I see that happening in the future said Libby But the neurologist who dissuaded Robert Vondracek from receiving stem cell treatment accused doctors who offer the treatments with lining their pockets The only people who are benefitting are the clinics said Dr Virgil DiBiase He said that dozens of patients have called him about the treatments which they find advertised online and that the costs they cited sometimes topped  Legitimate treatments are not marketed through YouTube or slick websites Whats a plastic surgeon doing treating a neurological disease he asked Dr Daley director of the stem cell program in Boston said it was dramatically premature to charge patients for a therapy we dont yet know is safe or effective Im concerned that this this may actually be the pedaling of unproven treatments but masquerading as research said Daley Our ability to know whether any of these interventions would work in actual MS patients is going to require rigorous clinical trials and a lot more hard work he said Dr Gitt said he is performing the procedure to help his patients and that he makes  percent or more of his income from his plastic surgery practice What really excited and has continued to excite me about this field is that I kind of feel a little bit more like an old time real doc in that Im really making amazing changes for people said Gitt Gitt said that he and other doctors using the technique are conducting a pilot study to identify those conditions which will merit more vigorous prospective doubleblind randomized type studies and go from there He said pharmaceutical companies and universities are not funding the procedure and that is why patients have to fund the study themselves Berman said the research scientists who are critical of the procedure are missing the forest for the trees We are finding out stuff those guys will never find out because theyre stuck in the lab said Dr Berman who provided a handful of stories of people who have dramatically improved after the treatment He also countered critics who challenge the ethics of using a treatment that has not been sanctioned by federal regulators or charging patients to participate in a study Were not flying under the radar and Im not apologizing to anyone he said Were doing investigative work We have a huge online database And were learning as we go along Berman said his patients all know theyre part of an investigative study and everybody signs informed consent He plans to apply for something called an Investigational Device Exemption from the federal Food and Drug Administration Under FDA guidelines the procedure used by Berman and Gitt is not regulated because the cells are minimally manipulated arent combined with other genetic material and the patient gets only his or her cells reinjected According to the FDA the value of stem cells for most new applications is largely unproven which can mean that patients forego effective therapies and instead are treated with unproven stem cell therapies The safety of stem cell therapies for a variety of uses has not been assessed said a spokesperson for the agency Even stem cells isolated from a persons own tissue can present  risks when put into an area where they are not performing the same biological function that they were originally The agency said it is committed to supporting the development of new products to address unmet medical needs including new applications for stem cellbased products It is important to understand that while the FDA works to make lifesaving treatments available to patients quickly and efficiently said the spokesperson the FDA is committed to assuring both the safety and the efficacy of the products it approves for use in the United States The FDA is concerned that the hope that patients have for cures which are not yet available may leave them vulnerable to unscrupulous providers of stem cell treatments which have not been evaluated for safety and efficacy and could potentially be harmful
