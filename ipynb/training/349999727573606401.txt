Until  Lyme disease was almost unknown But in the decades since a Yale rheumatologist first described an unusual cluster of arthritis cases in Lyme Conn the disease has become the most commonly reported tickborne illness in the country Acute symptoms of Lyme disease commonly include a bullseye rash followed by flulike symptoms As journalist Michael Specter explains in The Lyme Wars   for   as the number of cases has increased so has the controversy surrounding some diagnoses The tests for Lyme disease are poor Specter says the symptoms inconsistent and the treatments not always effective Twentyfive percent of those people who get bitten never have a rash or sometimes never see it Specter tells  s Terry Gross If you get bitten on the back of your head youll never see a bullseye rash If left untreated the disease can spread throughout the body in some cases causing debilitating pain Much of the current debate about Lyme disease Specter says stems from the question of how to treat patients who have pain or other symptoms that persist after treatment The phrase I dont know is not something easy for some doctors to say But when it comes to Lyme disease Specter says that might be the most apt description of current understanding When you turn exurbs into suburbs and suburbs into something even more populated you have all sorts of little animals And mice just love these developments You cannot delight a whitefooted mouse more than by cutting the woods up into little patches  because its an easy ecosystem for them to survive in There are lots of places to burrow lots of food lots of hosts  it is convenient You dont have a lot of hawks flying around eating them Its just a kind of nice relatively safe way to spend your life as a whitefooted mouse I wrote this piece for a simple reason which is that during the presidential campaign Mitt Romney visited one of these special Lyme doctors who is very controversial and made a statement about how Lyme is a terrible epidemic  chronic Lyme The organized medical world doesnt recognize chronic Lyme and it seemed a little like pandering to Northern Virginia where Mitt Romney wanted to get some votes So I wrote a very brief blog post for   website on this and I got about  million pieces of hate mail And I figured there must be something more to this I mean it was really something Ive covered a lot of extremely contentious issues in my life but that was really  So I just went to my editors and said I think we need to do this And Im glad I did because it is an interesting issue These ticks dont just carry Lyme disease They carry at least four other pathogens and some of those pathogens may be more damaging than Lyme disease but we dont know enough about all of them yet One of them is called Babesia Its sort of like a malarial infection Its in the same tick you can get it at the same time as Lyme The same is true with anaplasmosis And if youre getting two or three infections at the same time you may only be getting tested for one And theres a really good reason to believe that your immune system is struggling even more brutally  trying to deal with these two similar but different things  than if it was just one thing So thats a complication that wasnt on the top of peoples minds until the last couple of years  These ticks are kind of remarkable First they get on you and they spread some antihistamines and some other little numbing medications so that you dont notice the bite Then they excrete something called cementum which is sort of like a glue so that they can fasten onto you Then they get their jawbones in there and go for a ride They often spend five to seven days on a deer or a mouse Usually its less on humans but it doesnt need to be five to seven days for them to transmit bacteria that cause Lyme disease I check myself like  times a day One of the problems  Ive never gotten over this  Ive been writing about medicine for a long time and Im always convinced that every illness I write about I have There have been a lot of those  Up in Hudson County where I have a place its hard to have a dinner with people where the word tick doesnt come up  I have a big backyard People come over we have a cookout and their kids are running off barefoot into the woods and Im like No Dont do that Its ugly out there   Chronic Lyme is a vague term that means you have the symptoms that linger for a long time And the symptoms are often terrible pain flu symptoms maybe arthritis terrible headache problems They are problems that are extremely common in the general public And when you dont have any Lyme test thats positive or you dont live in a Lymeendemic area its very difficult for people to take you seriously when you say that you have chronic Lyme People with these symptoms have something  something is going on I dont think even the most hardhearted physician the chronic Lyme folks think all physicians are hardhearted believes that theyre making up their pain These patients in pain want to grasp onto something Its a lot more comforting to say I have this problem than I have terrible pain I cant get rid of it No one can diagnose it and I dont know what to do So the chronic Lyme world has kind of a parallel universe It has a special medical organization  the International Lyme Disease society  doctors that kind of treat chronic Lyme and focus on chronic Lyme Its not a syndrome thats recognized by organized medicine And frankly organized medicine has been a little recalcitrant but on this I kind of have to agree with them If you dont have any evidence of a disease its really hard to say that you have the disease
