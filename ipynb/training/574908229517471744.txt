Rates of cervical cancer vary substantially from state to state and health experts hoped that the HPV vaccine would help even them out But new research shows that hasnt happened  at least not so far As of  some of the states with the highest incidence of cervical cancer also did the worst job of vaccinating girls against   the virus that can lead to cervical cancer according to a study presented Tuesday at a health disparities   organized by the American Assn for Cancer Research For instance the incidence of cervical cancer in Arkansas was  cases per  women while only  of girls in the state began the threeshot regimen for the HPV vaccine In Florida there were  cervical cancer cases per  women and only  of girls started taking the vaccine Mississippi had  cases per  women and only  vaccine uptake On the flip side  of girls in Massachusetts got at least one HPV shot and only  women out of  developed cervical cancer the thirdlowest incidence among all the states and the District of Columbia Nationwide doctors diagnose  cases of cervical cancer per  women and  of girls get at least one dose of the HPV vaccine Californias cervical cancer incidence is similar to the national average at  cases per  women but the vaccine is more popular with  of girls initiating coverage First introduced in    protect against the most common cancercausing strains of human papillomavirus The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the vaccines for all girls and boys when they are  or  years old  before they encounter the virus through sexual activity Three doses of the vaccine are given over an eightmonth period In addition to cervical cancer HPV can cause vaginal or vulvar cancers in women and penile cancer in men Both men and and women can get anal mouth or throat cancer from HPV as well The virus also causes genital warts The authors of the new study relied on data from the CDCs   and the   database maintained by the CDC and the National Cancer Institute The researchers found that vaccination and cancer rates tended to move up and down together but that relationship wasnt strictly onetoone Consider the contrast between Utah and Vermont Both states have extremely low rates of cervical cancer   and  cases per  women respectively But in Utah only  of girls start the HPV regimen while the corresponding figure in Vermont is  The researchers from the University of North Carolina and Ohio State University found other links to HPV vaccine acceptance among girls In general states with higher proportions of nonLatino blacks had lower vaccination rates while states with higher proportions of wealthy residents had higher vaccination rates The researchers also examined data on HPV vaccination among boys but found no statistical link with HPVrelated cancers The takeaway for public health officials is to focus on boosting vaccination rates in areas where cancer incidence is higher the researchers concluded The current pattern of HPV vaccination especially among girls may not be adequate to reverse the current  disparities in HPVrelated cancer incidence and mortality
