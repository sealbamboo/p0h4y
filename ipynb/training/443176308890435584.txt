For the first time a test that detects  types of lipids or fats circulating in a persons blood has been shown to predict accurately whether he or she will develop the memory loss and mental decline of Alzheimers disease over the next two to three years A screening test based on the findings could be available in as little as two years said the researchers who identified the blood biomarkers The effort to identify predictors of Alzheimers disease that are reliable easy and inexpensive to detect was described Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine Blood biomarkers for Alzheimers could make it possible to identify those at risk before they develop symptoms the authors suggested While no treatments for Alzheimers have proven effective in slowing or reversing its progress the authors declared that earlier detection may open new treatment options Interventions to head off or slow cognitive decline before it is evident might be more effective than intervening later when dementia has already set in The researchers  from the University of Rochester Georgetown University and UC Irvine  did not start with a list of possible biomarkers but recruited  subjects at least  years old The team scoured their blood for possibilities while waiting to see which subjects would develop dementia symptoms Fortysix subjects were diagnosed with Alzheimers disease upon entry into the study And  went on to develop mild Alzheimers or amnestic mild cognitive impairment a condition that often progresses to fullblown Alzheimers The researchers compared the blood of  of those  subjects with that of  matched subjects who had developed no cognitive abnormalities The analysis allowed them to identify measurable differences between the groups in  different lipids The  lipids identified as harbingers of Alzheimers appear to be the result of the breakdown of neural cell membranes a process that accelerates as the disease takes hold Once they had the list of revealing lipids the study authors gathered  of their recruits  who had developed early Alzheimers in the course of the study and  who had not Blinded to the subjects status the researchers tried to see if they could use the lipids panel to sort the subjects correctly on the basis of their blood tests alone They found they could do so with over  accuracy Thats an accuracy level on a par with tests that measure the cerebrospinal fluid for evidence of abnormal proteins that are a hallmark of Alzheimers disease But because a blood test would be much cheaper and less invasive than a spinal tap it would make screening large populations of people far more practical Among the issues still to be sorted out how revealing the lipids blood panel would be in a larger and more diverse population of patients and how sensitive and specific such a screen would be Many tests are able to identify  of people who are sick with a particular disease theyre highly sensitive but they also falsely identify many as sick who are not theyre not very specific If patients test positive for impending Alzheimers many may accept treatments that are expensive and risky in a bid to head it off As a result its important to establish that the lipids test does not have a very high false positive rate
