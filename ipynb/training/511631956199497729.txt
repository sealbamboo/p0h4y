Tomorrow President Obama is scheduled to announce a new US plan to help stop the Ebola outbreak in West Africa We offer two perspectives on what the president should say One is from   executive director of   which has been on the ground in Africa since the first cases were identified this year The other is from   an infectious disease physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who studies how to prepare health care systems for pandemics Delaunay who spoke to NPR last week doesnt hold back I have to say that we are quite exhausted and angry about the situation she says We believe that what an NGO nongovernmental organization like MSF Medecins Sans Frontieres her organizations name in French does a state can do at even larger scale This is all we are asking We really just want to stand in solidarity to the Liberians the Sierra Leoneans and the Guineans And in the face of this outbreak we are really calling for additional capacity Speaking of the role that the United States could play she says that thousands of people at US laboratories are trained in working in highly contaminated environments  and could offer guidance to health workers in Africa The most urgent need at the moment is to set up isolation units so that people who are sick do not contaminate the rest of the population she says It is not technically complicated It involves very basic organization to manage patient safety to feed them to provide them with water to manage waste She favors military participation in the antiEbola efforts What is critical in order to make this care successful is to have a strict monitoring a strict supervision a good chain of command This is key And this is why we do value the role of the military in this intervention and we would actually wish that there would be much greater mobilization of military assets and personnel because they are much better equipped than any nongovernmental organizations to put in place those kind of very strict and solid supervision from A to Z From a practical standpoint Dr Adalja suggests that the US provide the basics portable hospitals personal protective gear gowns gloves masks eye protection and other scarce medical supplies like thermometers We know people are resorting to reusing thermometers He also believes the US can help educate African healthcare workers on the proper way to wear personal protective equipment to minimize the risk of exposure The thing with Ebola is its not a very complex disease to treat Dr Adalja notes Basic measures such as controlling infection isolating patients tracing others with whom they may have had contact and promoting hygienic burial have brought past outbreaks to a halt The same he says should be done this time
