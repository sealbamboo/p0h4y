On Tuesday the BBC followed tweets put out by three busy ambulance call centres  North West Ambulance Service West Midlands Ambulance Service and East of England Ambulance Service  under the  giving a revealing snapshot of the highpressure work of ambulance crews At the end of the day we put a series of questions to Jess Parsons a call handler for the West Midlands service Answer Waste of time  either the chap who ordered an ambulance earlier and didnt need it because the patient was just pd or perhaps the woman who at the bus station who hung up on me  we still needed to send a rapid response vehicle so that we could be sure but we could have done it on the phone if shed talked to me  obviously tied up a resource that could have been doing rather more Most rewarding  I would say the stroke case or the cardiac arrest Answer Sometimes the crews will inform  call centre staff but once in hospital care we are unable to get individual updates Answer Falls make up for around  to  of our calls though that can rise when it is icy   While some of them can be simply people tripping over and injuring themselves eg a fractured hip we need to be mindful that it is not because the patient has had a heart attack  or even a cardiac arrest Answer Clearly we get rather more alcohol related calls on a Friday and Saturday night for obvious reasons   It is difficult to put an exact figure on how many calls are alcoholrelated   we dont specifically record that as we often have no proof that it is alcohol that is the cause  Some medical conditions produce a not dissimilar response from the patient eg head injuries often make patients very violent  On a Saturday night is the patient aggressive because of booze or the head injury or both  In regard to inappropriate there are undoubtedly some calls that people should be accessing other parts of the NHS and that is why we think  has real potential as a way of signposting patients to the most appropriate place for the type of help they need   Weve just taken over the bulk of  in the West Midlands and this is an area we are working on really hard to help integrate the services much more closely  Our statistics show that only about  of  calls are truly life threatening  our primary role Roughly  to  will require some form of help from the NHS just not necessarily the ambulance service Answer Pressurised is perhaps not the right word  it can be intense at times   When its really busy you need to give  to each call while being aware that there could be other people waiting to get through  Just need to be really focused on the job at hand Answer Friday and Saturday night into the following morning are particularly busy The only Q we never say that word in the ambulance service time is possibly in the early hours of a weekday morning but even then it keeps ticking over Answer At the end of the day the staff get on and do what needs to be done  If possible we will always try and provide the patient with dignity whether that is clearing people away from the location or moving them onto the ambulance but in the case of the very tragic incident on the bus you dont have time to worry about that  every second counts in those situations and you just need to get on with providing the best care you possibly can Answer Not as often as you might think given the West Midlands is the second most ethnically diverse region in England   The vast majority of people who call us use English and want to use English  We only need interpretation services about once every couple of shifts or so Answer Youd be surprised how often children stick a whole variety of items into their ears nose and mouth  Crazes dont usually have an effect on  calls but school holidays do  not sure whether they are bored or just experimenting
