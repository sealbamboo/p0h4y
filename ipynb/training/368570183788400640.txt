Thanks to Broadway Patina Miller is in the best shape of her life Ms Miller  is front and center in one of the highestenergy shows on Broadway the circusinspired revival of   about a forlorn prince on a search to find meaning in life In her role as the Leading Player for which she won a Tony Award in June Ms Miller swings from perilous heights in a trapeze sings while dancing and hula hooping and helps lead the cast through a dizzying array of acrobatics To prepare for the role Ms Miller who is from South Carolina paid close attention to her diet She also ran intervals twice a week and followed a weightlifting routine at Mark Fisher Fitness in Manhattan where we recently caught up with her to talk about her routine and watch one of her workouts  Your role in Pippin is an intensely physical one Tell us about it  Its a very physical show Everyone on the stage is doing things that look very crazy from the audience You have people flying and hanging in the air dancing and crawling around sliding on the floor So everyone is in tiptop shape  Do you have a favorite number in the show  I would say that Glory is a favorite number of mine Its a scene that comes very early on where Pippin decides that he wants to go off to war Its sort of stylizing the war and the beauty and craziness of it Its this big metaphor and its very physical We have an acrobatic number where everyone is singing and dancing and being thrown in the air Its a small stage and theres a lot going on  How did you prepare for the physical aspect of this role  Early on in the process I talked to Diane Paulus the director about how we wanted to approach my role as the Leading Player Immediately we started talking about the characters center of movement which is very low and to the ground Its very pelvic heavy So I worked on changing my center of movement and I started working out As the Leading Player who is in charge of this big troupe I wanted to have a sense that I could be dangerous as well as inviting and sexy So I wanted to work on my body to help with the role and many months later it has paid off and Ive got some guns  What has your exercise routine been like  When I got the role I knew that I wanted to go on a very strict diet I wanted to get lean for the role I wanted to put on muscle but I didnt want to get bigger One of the trainers here worked with me and gave me a program I was doing a lot of pushups dead lifts and pullups I went through some rigorous training Then I left to go to Boston and they gave me a program that I could follow by myself four times a week  Do you mean four hours a week of weights and then cardio as well  I was working out four times a week and on other days I was doing interval running to help with the fat loss  Do you have some favorite exercises  I love doing pushups  tons of pushups and pullups and bicep curls I also do dead lifts which is something I used to be frightened of in the gym  Do you think a lot of women are intimidated by the weight room  I do because we are worried about bulking up But I learned that with the way were physically designed thats not going to happen You would have to take some serious steroids to get really bulky  I mean I do tons of deadlifting and I never thought I would be doing anything like that because I thought only power lifters and really big guys do those kinds of things But now I know its really good for your butt and your thighs and you dont have to lift a ton The heaviest I ever lifted was my body weight and I do six or so at a time You have to lift so many to bulk up I think thats where women get scared They think negatively about weights when really you should actually be doing that instead of the machines to get a good workout  Are you using mostly dumbbells or do you use the bars  I use the bars and I use the dumbbells I use all the equipment In this gym they dont have workout machines There are weights and there are kettlebells and ropes I do a lot of exercises where Im using my own body weight  Tell us about your diet  When I started my trainer put me on a calorie diet when I wasnt performing on my off days when Im resting and not working out But on the days when I was working out it was a calorie diet with  grams of protein You need the protein to lean out your muscles and to get the right amount of fat So I stayed on a very strict calorie count which seems kind of low but you can find ways to still be satisfied on a lowcalorie diet Also I was able to add in a bit more calories because I was working out and doing the show  Are you still lowering calories  Right now I try to stay in the  to  range of calories  What would you say to someone looking to improve his or her exercise routine  Not everyone can afford a trainer and an annual gym membership but there are always ways to work out I like to go on YouTube and look at fitness videos and I found this really cool site called   Its a husbandwife duo who offer workouts that are very indepth Its free and its all laid out for you I go on there sometimes when I cant go to the gym So I have my entire workout on my computer screen in my living room and Im pumping it out  At the Tony Awards you wore a stunning dress that showed off your arms Do you have any special arm exercises  I love working out my arms I wanted to get definition in my arms for the role because I knew that I was going to be sleeveless and I wanted to look badass I love doing body weight rows on the bar and pullups I also do a lot of bicep curls  high volume small weights  People have said   Who would win in an arm wrestling match  I dont know about Mrs Obama but Im pretty competitive I would probably take her down She has a lot of spunk so it could go either way But I have to root for myself  Has your devotion to fitness changed any other aspects of your life  When you take control over your fitness and your health and you see results it makes you feel more confident Its been a long journey for me I come from a family of diabetes and different health problems and I dont want that for myself So I take care of myself and I try to encourage my family members back home to do the same The feeling that you get from being in control of your health and the way you look is a feeling like no other
