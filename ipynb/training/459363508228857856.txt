Internal emails obtained by CNN show that top management at the VA hospital in Arizona knew about the practice and even defended it Dr Sam Foote just retired after spending  years with the VA system in Phoenix The veteran doctor told CNN in an exclusive interview that the Phoenix VA works off two lists for patient appointments   Theres an official list thats shared with officials in Washington and shows the VA has been providing timely appointments which Foote calls a sham list And then theres the real list thats hidden from outsiders where wait times can last more than a year  The scheme was deliberately put in place to avoid the VAs own internal rules said Foote in Phoenix They developed the secret waiting list said Foote a respected local physician The VA requires its hospitals to provide care to patients in a timely manner typically within  to  days Foote said   According to Foote the elaborate scheme in Phoenix involved shredding evidence to hide the long list of veterans waiting for appointments and care Officials at the VA  Foote says instructed their staff to not actually make doctors appointments for veterans within the computer system Instead Foote says when a veteran comes in seeking an appointment they enter information into the computer and do a screen capture hard copy printout  They then do not save what was put into the computer so theres no record that you were ever here he said  According to Foote the information was gathered on the secret electronic list and then the information that would show when veterans first began waiting for an appointment was actually destroyed  That hard copy if you will that has the patient demographic information is then taken and placed onto a secret electronic waiting list and then the data that is on that paper is shredded Foote said So the only record that you have ever been there requesting care was on that secret list he said And they wouldnt take you off that secret list until you had an appointment time that was less than  days so it would give the appearance that they were improving greatly the waiting times when in fact they were not Foote estimates right now the number of veterans waiting on the secret list  to see a primary care physician is somewhere between  and     I feel very sorry for the people who work at the Phoenix VA said Foote Theyre all frustrated Theyre all upset  They all wish they could leave cause they know what theyre doing is wrong But they have families they have mortgages and if they speak out or say anything to anybody about it they will be fired and they know that Several other highlevel VA staff confirmed Footes description to CNN and confirmed this is exactly how the secret list works in Phoenix  Foote says the Phoenix wait times reported back to Washington were entirely fictitious So then when they did that they would report to Washington Oh yeah  Were makin our appointments within  within  days within the day frame when in reality it had been six nine in some cases  months he said In the case of yearold Navy veteran Thomas Breen the wait on the secret list ended much sooner We had noticed that he started to have bleeding in his urine said Teddy BarnesBreen his son So I was like Listen we gotta get you to the doctor  Teddy says his Brooklynraised father was so proud of his military service that he would go nowhere but the VA for treatment On September   with blood in his urine and a history of cancer Teddy and his wife Sally rushed his father to the Phoenix VA emergency room where he was examined and sent home to wait  They wrote on his chart that it was urgent said Sally her fatherinlaws main caretaker The family has obtained the chart from the VA that clearly states the urgency as one week for Breen to see a primary care doctor or at least a urologist for the concerns about the blood in the urine  And they sent him home says Teddy incredulously  Sally and Teddy say Thomas Breen was given an appointment with a rheumatologist to look at his prosthetic leg but was given no appointment for the main reason he went in    No one called from the VA with a primary care appointment Sally says she and her fatherinlaw called numerous times in an effort to try to get an urgent appointment for him She says the response they got was less than helpful  Well you know we have other patients that are critical as well Sally says she was told Its a sevenmonth waiting list  And youre gonna have to have patience    Sally says she kept calling day after day from late September to October She kept up the calls through November But then she no longer had reason to call  Thomas Breen died on November  The death certificate shows that he died from Stage  bladder cancer Months after the initial visit Sally says she finally did get a call  They called me December  Hes dead already            Sally says the VA official told her We finally have that appointment We have a primary for him I said Really youre a little too late sweetheart  Sally says her fatherinlaw realized toward the end he was not getting the care he needed  At the end is when he suffered He screamed He cried And thats somethin Id never seen him do before was cry Never Never He cried in the kitchen right here  Dont let me die  Teddy added his father said Why is this happening to me  Why wont anybody help me Teddy added They didnt do the right thing Sally said No They neglected Pop Foote says Breen is a perfect example of a veteran who needed an urgent appointment with a primary doctor and who was instead put on the secret waiting list  where he remained hidden Foote adds that when veterans waiting on the secret list die they are simply removed  They could just remove you from that list and theres no record that you ever came to the VA and presented for care  Its pretty sad Foote said that the number of dead veterans who died waiting for care is at least   Thats correct The numbers actually higher  I would say that  theres more than that that I know of but s probably a good number  CNN has obtained emails from July  showing that top management including Phoenix VA Director Sharon Helman was wellaware about the actual wait times knew about the electronic offthebooks list and even defended its use to her staff In one internal Phoenix VA email dated July   one staffer raised concerns about the secret electronic list and raised alarms that Phoenix VA officials were praising its use I have to say I think its unfair to call any of this a success when Veterans are waiting  weeks on an electronic waiting list before theyre called to schedule their first PCP primary care physician appointment the email states Sure when their appointment is created it can be  days out but were making them wait  weeks to create that appointment  The email adds pointedly That is unethical and a disservice to our Veterans Last year and earlier this year Foote also sent letters to officials at the VA Office of the Inspector General with details about the secret electronic waiting list and about the large number of veterans who died waiting for care many hidden on the secret list Foote and several other sources inside the Phoenix VA confirmed to CNN that IG inspectors have interviewed them about the allegations  CNN has made numerous requests to Helman and her staff for an interview about the secret list the emails showing she was aware of it and the allegations of the  veterans who died waiting on the list to no avail  But CNN was sent a statement from VA officials in Texas quoting Helman  It is disheartening to hear allegations about Veterans care being compromised the statement from Helman reads and we are open to any collaborative discussion that assists in our goal to continually improve patient care Just before deadline Wednesday the VA sent an additional comment to CNN It stated in part We have conducted robust internal reviews since these allegations surfaced and welcome the results from the Office of Inspector Generals review We take these allegations seriously The VA statement to CNN added To ensure new Veterans waiting for appointments are managed appropriately we maintain an Electronic Wait List EWL in accordance with the national VHA Scheduling Directive The ability of new and established patients to get more timely care has showed significant improvement in the last two years which is attributable to increased budget staffing efficiency and infrastructure Foote says Helmans response in the first statement is stunning explaining the entire secret list and the reason for its existence was planned and created by top management at the Phoenix VA specifically to avoid detection of the long wait times by veterans there  This was a plan that involved the Pentad which includes the director the associate director the assistant director the chief of nursing along with the medical chief of staff  in collaboration with the chief of HAS The Phoenix VAs off the books waiting list has now gotten the attention of the US House Veterans Affairs Committee in Washington whose chairman has been investigating delays in care at veterans hospitals across the country According to Rep Jeff Miller chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs what was happening in Phoenix is even worse than veterans dying while waiting for care Even as CNN was working to report this story the Florida Republican demanded the VA preserve all records in anticipation of a congressional investigation In a hearing on April  Miller learned even the undersecretary of health for the VA wasnt being told the truth about the secret list It appears as though there could be as many as  veterans whose deaths could be related to delays in care Were you made aware of these unofficial lists in any part of your look back asked Miller  Mr Chairman I was not replied Dr Thomas Lynch assistant deputy undersecretary Veterans Health Administration  Congress has now ordered all records in Phoenix secret or not be preserved That would include the record of a yearold Navy veteran named Thomas Breen
