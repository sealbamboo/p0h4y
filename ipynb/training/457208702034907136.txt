Its a sunny afternoon at Kellys Collective a medical marijuana dispensary in Los Angeles and Nikki Esquibel is getting stoned But you wouldnt know it The yearold who has a medical prescription for marijuana is smoking pot with a handheld vaporizer or a vape pen Its sleek black and virtually indistinguishable from a highend ecigarette Thats the point says Esquibel I use it mostly around my neighborhood Its easy to hide The vapor coming from the device doesnt even have much of an odor Discretion it turns out makes for good money While   have been grabbing the headlines the vape pen industry has been quietly ballooning And its reshaping the business and culture of marijuana The latest versions of ecigarettes contain a batterypowered heating element that vaporizes a liquid containing nicotine Vape pens for pot use the same mechanism but the devices are optimized to vaporize the active molecules in concentrated marijuana oils not nicotine And just as with ecigs theres no fire or smoke Pot users are flocking to the pens One out of three reviews on   the Yelp of the pot world is about vaping marijuana The pen doesnt carry the stigma or notoriety of a bong or joint says Todd Mitchem an executive at Open Vape which sells its products on the West Coast and in Colorado We are getting people buying vape pens who wouldnt normally come into a marijuana dispensary he tells Shots Now all of a sudden they have an alternative to smoking pot he adds Two years ago Chris Folkerts was selling vape pens out of the trunk of his car Today his company   has  square feet of prime real estate in central Los Angeles You could never get your mom to hit a bong he says But your mom would potentially hit a G Pen My mom did My grandmother did too And I have godfearing Christian grandparents from the Midwest When they tried it I knew I was on to something Most vape pens dont actually vaporize the marijuana plant Theyre loaded with marijuana concentrates or hash oil a viscous yellow resin chemically extracted from the plant In many places that extraction often occurs in somebodys kitchen  which can be   And the concentrates can be strong Really really strong Marijuana flowers can   up to about  percent THC the psychoactive chemical that makes you feel high But the concentrates can contain up to  percent THC Esquibel says she almost fainted when she took her first hit Those high THC levels worry   executive director of the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws a nonprofit lobbying group working to broadly legalize marijuana use Between the fact that you can potentially pass out with a single inhalation or you can have such property damage and potential bodily harm just producing it  these issues of the vape pen definitely need to be addressed he says This is a screaming call for regulation if there ever was one Most states such as California that allow the sale and use of medical marijuana dont have rules on the books about marijuana concentrates or about vaping the substance California is considering a   on concentrates while Colorado and Washington allow them The sale and use of vape pens is legal in every state And what about the health effects of vaping pot compared with smoking it The problem is that right now its hard to tell how much THC you are actually getting when you take a puff of one of these things says   who studies marijuana laws and policies at the University of California Los Angeles The risk of getting wrecked is a lot higher And given that the output of vape pens doesnt have the telltale marijuana smell Kleiman is also concerned about what the rising popularity of the devices means for parents and teachers For them this will be a nightmare he tells Shots If I am running a school or a house and I have a nose I can tell if my kids are smoking pot But if theyre using a vape pen forget about it
