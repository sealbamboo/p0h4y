Dr Daniel Geynisman felt as if he had abandoned his patient a sickening sensation  A yearold man with metastasized gall bladder cancer had developed intractable pain before the doctor went away on vacation By the time Dr Geynisman returned the patient was enrolled in hospice he died soon thereafter The oncologist never saw him again The sudden termination of a close doctorpatient relationship is a common wrenching scenario I can tell you it happens all the time and it breaks the heart of patients and families and oncologists said Dr Diane Meier director of the Center to Advance Palliative Care at Mount Sinais Icahn School of Medicine in New York City  In an article published recently in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Dr Geynisman   with this sort of estrangement He referred to his patient as MM but the mans actual name was Paul Rieger He was a math teacher in the Chicago Public Schools who loved to golf and fish and who was married to his college sweetheart Dr Geynisman saw the couple every two or three weeks  and sometimes more often  during the last year of Mr Riegers illness   In a phone interview the doctor described his patient as very accepting very calm very kind a gentle soul   From the beginning the Riegers made clear what they wanted from their physician I distinctly remember during our first meeting they said they were looking for someone who would be with them through the end throughout the whole journey Dr Geynisman said  Yet it was routine for oncologists at University of Chicago Medicine where the doctor was then working to stop seeing patients when treatment ended The model was you get to know the patient and their family you treat them aggressively but when the time comes that you dont have any more therapy to offer you make a referral to palliative care or hospice and the patient goes under their auspices Dr Geynisman said Dr Otis Brawley chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society and professor of oncology at Emory University offered another reason oncologists sometimes disappear from their patients lives in these circumstances Its a way of protecting yourself from the devastating feeling that youre letting this person down and your inability to keep them alive is a professional failing he said That isnt to say its justified No physician should ever say theres nothing more I can do said Dr Timothy Moynihan medical director of the Mayo Clinic hospice who wrote a response to Dr Geynismans article noting that   as the physician of record Theres always something more we can do for the patient  if only to be there and listen to their stories and deal with their pain and suffering  Dr Geynisman said he had never received training about how to interact with a patient whom he could no longer help But he felt terrible about not calling Mr Rieger before his death and vowed this would never happen again Do patients and their families want me the primary oncology physician to be around for the last phase of their lives he wrote in his article which inspired dozens of emails from fellow oncologists across the country  Do I ultimately break my pledge to patients as I prematurely end my journey with them when there is no longer active therapy to offer them The answer is yes suggested Dr Meier of Mount Sinai  Very often one of the major sources of emotional and spiritual suffering among patients who are nearing the end of life or a prolonged illness is the abandonment they feel when they stop being cared for by a physician to whom they have become attached she said Dr Meier told the story of a New York City oncologist who gave impeccable care to a woman with lung cancer keeping her alive for almost seven years Dr Meier began caring for the patient as well when the oncologist turned away from addressing her questions about death What exactly is likely to happen  Will I be in pain During a home visit three weeks before this woman passed away Dr Meier asked her what was on her mind She said I am really upset this doctor has not called me or come to see me It was taking up most of her emotional energy   With the patients permission Dr Meier called the physician whose response was Theres nothing I can do for her  Dr Meier had to explain She loves you She wants to thank you That got through the oncologist made a visit and the patient died a few days later Mrs Rieger has stayed in touch with Dr Geynisman during the year since her husbands death she doesnt blame the physician in any way He was our guiding light and he never disappointed us she told me Dan made the whole year so bearable because I knew there was someone there for us The doctor she noted never let more than  minutes lapse before answering an email He was the one person who knew our cancer journey better than anyone else Mrs Rieger said He became so important to us He touched our souls  Currently Dr Geynisman is an assistant professor of medical oncology at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia Im committed to being there through the end with all my patients though I still havent figured out the best way to do that he said   To his patients he puts it something like this Im still your physician and no matter what happens Im still here for you
