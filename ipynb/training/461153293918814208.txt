My fatherinlaw had been fishing from rowboats without incident since early childhood But in August  at age  alone on a Minnesota lake he apparently fell out of the boat and drowned He couldnt swim a stroke yet never wore a life jacket I checked the statistics at the time In a state with more than  lakes of  acres or more plus  fishable rivers half the adult population did not know how to swim Things are somewhat better today but not enough The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that  percent of adults cannot swim the length of a yard pool meaning they probably could not make it to shore if they got into trouble in a natural body of water You might think children are the most vulnerable to drowning Not so While drowning has declined over all from  to  according to new data from the CDC children and young adults account for the drop Among adults ages  to  drownings   More than  percent of those who drown each year in the United States are adults and the percentage of drownings in lakes rivers and oceans rises with age Nearly  percent of drowning victims are boys or men Fear of the water keeps many adults from learning to swim And they may pass this reluctance on to their children perpetuating a vicious cycle But it doesnt have to be this way says Christopher Pompi a civil engineer in Adams Mass As a young adult Mr Pompi spent time on the Jersey Shore but he could not join his friends in the water because he didnt know how to swim With the help of the   the charitable arm of   Mr Pompi finally overcame his fear at age  and learned to swim He had realized that if anything happened to his son in the water he would have been unable to help He took the plunge under the remarkable tutelage of Bill Meier the aquatics director at Bard College at Simons Rock and a swim coach who teaches volunteer instructors how to turn landhuggers into competent swimmers seemingly in no time In eight to  lessons I was swimming in the deep end Mr Pompi told me In six months I went from not being able to do  bobs in the water to swimming like I was a young kid Bill brought me to the point where I felt safe in the water and competent to help if anything happened Now  Mr Pompi said he feels secure enough to have installed a pool at home where he and his three children can enjoy the water together If youre not a capable swimmer you need to become one he said You never know when youll need it Of course swimming is also a great fitness activity that one can pursue into the ninth decade or beyond It is gentle on the joints and can also be therapeutic For the last eight months Ive been doing the backstroke for half of my daily minute swim to stabilize what had been progressive   But an elderly friend with   who was told by her doctor that swimming was the best thing for her back had to admit that she didnt know how Swimming can also help people maintain fitness when injuries prevent them from pursuing their usual physical activities I first started swimming regularly yearround in my s when I injured my back and was unable to run cycle or play tennis The Swimming Saves Lives Foundation awards grants financed by membership fees and donations to more than  local programs across the country to provide free or lowcost swimming lessons for adults The goal is to enable adults to swim at least two lengths of a pool with confidence and hopefully instill a desire to continue swimming said Rob Butcher executive director of US Masters Swimming Adults who cant swim are often embarrassed to say so and thus may be reluctant to sign up for a course But think of how good it would feel to master a skill that has long eluded you Mr Meier recalls a yearold woman who thought shed never be able to swim In just half an hour the instructor had her doing laps and she was ecstatic he said Its almost a miracle to see how fast people can go from being afraid of the water to be able to swim laps Mr Meier travels widely to teach volunteers among the organizations  members how to instruct adults regardless of their level of competence and confidence in the water He has prepared an page manual to help instructors teach all levels of students from those too afraid to get out of the car in the pool parking lot to those who can swim but need to improve their strokes Most challenging of course are the very fearful who may require  hours of instruction to become confident in deep water One of the foundations beneficiaries   has licensed instructors in more than a dozen cities with the training patience and commitment to teach extremely fearful adults While understandably these intensive longer courses are not cheap Miracle Swimming says its students have fun while learning to swim snorkel even scuba dive Lessons start with a very gradual introduction to the water allowing each student to progress at his own pace Lessons for adults are widely available Simply search online for adult swimming lessons to find the options in your area Â
