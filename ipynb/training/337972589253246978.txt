Australian researchers studied  women average age  without a history of stroke surveying them every three years for  years Using a wellvalidated depression scale they found that about  percent were depressed at each survey The study   found  strokes over the study period Being depressed nearly doubled the risk for stroke even after the researchers accounted for other risk factors like age education high blood pressure diabetes heart disease smoking alcohol intake physical activity and body mass index A study published in  on the same subject found an increased risk of only  percent but the average age in the study was  years older and at least one analysis found no increased risk at all in people over  The study adds to the evidence around depression and increased risk of stroke And its possibly even stronger in younger women said the lead author Caroline A Jackson an epidemiologist at the University of Queensland But its important to remember that this is a relatively small study and it needs to be explored in a much larger population
