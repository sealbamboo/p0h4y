After winning the Tour de France last Sunday Vincenzo Nibali was tested for a bunch of performanceenhancing substances But Nibali and his fellow competitors were welcome to have several cups of coffee or cans of Red Bull before their ride into Paris caffeine is not on the World AntiDoping Agencys   Still the drug is definitely a performance booster Just in the past few months studies have shown that caffeine   hit the ball harder and jump higher   and   in a K time trial A large body of research shows caffeine helps in pretty much every kind of endurance exercise giving a performance advantage of  percent to  percent says   an exercise physiologist at St Marys University in Twickenham UK and an author of the recent cycling study Of all the legal supplements an athlete could take it has the biggest effect on performance he says The suspicion is that caffeine increases the frequency or size of neural transmissions and suppresses pain he says Its not clear that it speeds very short sprints  Glaister is studying that  but it can help in any burst of activity that lasts longer than about a minute he says Athletes see a benefit with a dose of between  to  mg per kg of body weight which means that if a pound cyclist were drinking an average cup of coffee hed get a lift after drinking about two to four cups Many brands of coffee have a lot more caffeine than the   though It takes  to  minutes for caffeine levels to peak in the body and provide the biggest benefit Glaister says But if just enough caffeine might make you pick up the pace a bit too much is a   Ingesting more than the recommended amount doesnt bring further improvements in performance Glaister says and even nondangerous doses can cause anxiety sleeplessness and restlessness in some people Worse large amounts of the drug can be dangerous and even deadly Its pretty hard to unintentionally get to a toxic dose by drinking coffee soda or even taking caffeine pills but its easy to run into trouble with the powdered pure caffeine thats sold online Following the May overdose  r in Ohio the Food and Drug Administration   about powdered caffeine saying its impossible to accurately measure it with your standard kitchen equipment  teaspoon is equivalent to  cups of coffee Too much caffeine can speed the heart and cause seizures and death the FDA says The NCAA   on acceptable caffeine levels in athletes but the World AntiDoping Agency   from its banned list in  The agency still monitors levels in athletes to track general usage patterns   the drug is metabolized at different rates by different people making it tough to rely on a pee test to determine exactly how much an athlete has consumed And given caffeines presence in so many products its just too difficult for athletes to avoid the drug in the real world even if they arent trying to cheat Its ubiquitous says Glaister
