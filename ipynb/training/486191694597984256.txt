We women are all too aware that as we get older the risk of having a baby with genetic disorders goes up All of a womans eggs are primed up and ready to go before we are born But the ones we ovulate later are more prone to genetic errors than the earlier ones As a friend of mine surmised We age so you kind of think our eggs would too For a long time doctors have thought that was because the eggs formed earlier are better than those formed later They call it the productionline hypothesis But they now think they were wrong about that It doesnt look as though the firstformed eggs are any better than the laterformed eggs says   a chromosome biologist at Washington State University and a coauthor on   that was published last week in the   Birth defects and genetic disorders are often caused by   which happen when either the moms egg or the dads sperm contains the wrong number of chromosomes Proteins called crossover proteins help chromosomes sort themselves out The chromosomes are like dance partners says   a doctoral student and lead author on the paper and these crossover proteins help them correctly pair up If those dance partners arent connected it is just as likely that they will pull to the same side of the ballroom as to the opposite side of the ballroom he says When the chromosomes arent matched in pairs that can lead to trisomy or one extra chromosome as in   or monosomy just one chromosome as in   To find out if the egg cells that develop later are more prone to chromosomal abnormalities than those that develop first Rowsey counted the number of crossover proteins in the egg cells of fetuses with different gestational ages We saw that there is an extraordinary amount of variation between eggs and between females he says but they do not vary by time That is the egg cells of younger fetuses had about the same number of crossover proteins as the egg cells of older fetuses He looked at fetuses between  weeks and  weeks in gestational age So then why does the risk of birth defects increase as women get older Its more likely that theres no one maternalage effect on eggs Rowsey says There are many different factors that come into play and we have to explain them all The proteins that bind chromosomes together may degrade over the years that the egg is waiting in a womans ovary Rowsey says The number of eggs that women have is also depleted over time so there might be fewer good ones to choose from Whatever the causes the   is undeniable The rate of chromosomal abnormality appears to be hardwired into our species says Hassold The only thing that moves the dial is maternal age
