Consumer groups are stepping up pressure on animal producers and their practice of giving antibiotics to healthy animals to prevent disease In two new reports the groups say theyre worried that the preventive use of antibiotics is contributing to the development of antibioticresistant bacteria which get harder to treat in humans and animals over time This week   released a   looking at bacteria on turkey meat that are resistant to medicines used for humans Scientists there tested  samples of raw ground turkey meat that they purchased at grocery stores around the country They conclude that turkey meat that came from turkeys raised organically without antibiotics was significantly less likely to harbor resistant bacteria compared with meat from conventional turkeys that were given antibiotics We think these findings underscore a very important government recommendation that we dont need to feed healthy animals antibiotics every day to promote their growth and prevent disease says Urvashi Rangan director of the food safety and sustainability group at  The findings came on the heels of a   from another consumer advocacy organization the Environmental Working Group which analyzed data collected by the federal governments   It also documented high levels of antibioticresistant bacteria in storebought meats The Food and Drug Administration   with this EWG analysis saying it came to misleading conclusions But meanwhile the agency has weighed in on the complex problem of antibiotic resistance by calling for the  of antibiotics in foodproducing animals One way FDA is working to address this issue of resistance is to phase out the use of antibiotics in food animals for growth promotion and feed efficiency says Jalil Isa a spokesman for the agency FDA believes these drugs should be used only in situations where they are necessary for ensuring animal health and done so under the oversight of a veterinarian The most recent   from the FDA show that about  million pounds of antibiotics each year are purchased for use in farm animals Thats about   than what doctors prescribe to people Around  percent of those drugs arent used to treat sick animals according estimates by the Union of Concerned Scientists Instead farmers administer them at low doses to help animals grow faster and prevent infections Diana Goodpasture of Akron Ohio knows what its like to be sickened by a strain of salmonella bacteria thats resistant to antibiotic treatment In June  after she ate a turkey burger that she had grilled she became so sick that she was hospitalized for five days It was terrible it was the worst thing I ever experienced in my life Goodpasture tells The Salt She was infected with   that was resistant to three types of antibiotics ampicillin streptomycin and tetracycline The tainted meat was part of a massive   briefed several government agencies on its findings which were released April  on bacteria in ground turkey meat In an email the FDAs Isa says the report leaves out information that would have been helpful such as details about which types of bacteria were found to be resistant to which antibiotics The FDA acknowledges that it overlooked   in the report that does include the details on which bacteria were resistant to individual antibiotics The   meanwhile says it believes turkey producers are using antibiotics judiciously  and that their practices help keep turkey flocks healthy They point out that in general the antibiotics used most in raising turkeys are not the same antibiotics that are relied upon to treat people NTF President Joel Brandenberger says animal agriculture is only one piece of the puzzle in the problem of antibiotic resistance but he recognizes FDAs efforts to work with producers to restrict their use of the drugs The National Turkey Federation has been cautiously supportive of FDAs strategy says Brandenberger According to poultry scientist   at Penn State University the poultry industry has already stopped using a lot of the drugs that are still used to treat infections in humans like ciprofloxacin And he says when the industry does use the same drugs that doctors prescribe to sick people  drugs like tetracycline  its usually only to treat animals that are truly sick not to prevent disease The industry has really cut back on the number of drugs used for routine prevention of disease in healthy animals because of some of the concern about resistance Hulet says But   with the Pew Campaign on Human Health and Industrial Farming says its impossible to confirm whether the poultry industrys claims are true because there are no publicly available data on how the drugs are actually used So far all we really have is trust and no way to verify says Hansen Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have proposed new legislation that would restrict the use of antibiotics in food animals and eight classes of antibiotics for human use only We need to take action to confront this growing public health crisis before routine infections like strep throat become fatal Democratic New York Rep Louise Slaughter author of the   said in a statement
