Whether they admit it or not many if not most scientists secretly hope to get a call in October informing them theyve won a Nobel Prize But Ive talked to a lot of Nobel laureates and they are unanimous on one point None of them pursued a research topic with the intention of winning the prize Thats certainly true for   She hasnt won a Nobel Prize but many are whispering that shes in line to win one for her work on something called    a tool for editing genes The idea came when she and her colleagues at the University of California Berkeley were in essence trying to figure out how bacteria fight the flu The goal was really more of a basic science question Doudna says It turns out bacteria dont like getting the flu any more than the rest of us do Bacteria have special enzymes that can cut open the DNA of an invading virus and make a change in the DNA at the site of the cut  essentially killing the virus As Doudna was studying a group of these enzymes she realized something The enzymes had what amounted to a short template inside that could attach to a specific string of letters in the viral DNA What if she could modify the template so that it could recognize any DNA sequence not just the sequences in viruses I thought wow if this could work in animal or plant cells this could be a very very useful and very powerful tool she says Whats more with CRISPRCas you not only can recognize a viral sequence  you can modify it too You can take it out or you can change it or you can add to it says Doudna Thats incredibly valuable because its been a frustrating time for biomedical researchers The Human Genome Project gave them what amounts to the genetic book of life The question is what do you do with that information Youve got the book says Doudna And you can see theres a word thats incorrect on page  but how do I get there and erase that word and fix it Until now the tools for fixing or replacing a gene in animals were cumbersome if they worked at all CRISPRCas changes that by allowing scientists to work inside cells making changes in specific genes far faster  and for far less money  than ever before The implications for medicine could be enormous Lets say two people who are each carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene want to have children but dont want to risk having a child with the disease Doctors already can use   to create an embryo one day they might also be able to use CRISPRCas to then fix the damaged gene Its also possible to imagine treating blood disorders like sickle cell anemia that are caused by a single gene You can envision removing blood cells from a patient doing the editing and putting those cells back into the patient Doudna says In addition to the positive uses of CRISPRCas Doudna acknowledges there is a dark side Genetically modifying human beings brings to mind images of Frankenstein monsters And the technique could be used for trivial or even harmful uses Once the discovery is made its out there says Doudna Anybody with basic molecular biology training can use it for genome editing Thats a bit scary Her work with CRISPRCas comes at an interesting time for Doudna Yes shes had a successful career in research but as the years wore on shed started to have a nagging worry that her science wasnt solving any societal problem wasnt making peoples lives better Now with this new tool she thinks theres good likelihood that it will
