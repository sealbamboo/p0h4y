School shootings unnerve Americans but the number of children injured or killed in those tragic events is just a fraction of the young people harmed by firearms each year in the United States a new study finds  Injuries from firearms send more than  kids to the hospital annually an average of  per day Among those admitted to the hospital  percent die from their injuries according to the study published in Pediatrics Monday  Thats more than  children injured badly enough to be hospitalized said Dr John Leventhal the studys lead author and a professor of pediatrics at the Yale School of Medicine All are unnecessary hospitalizations because preventing gun violence is something that can actually be done In addition to children hospitalized for gun injuries another  die before they can make it to the emergency room meaning guns hurt or kill about  American children each year Leventhal said Previous research has tracked hospitalizations of Americans due to firearms but the new study is the first to look just at children  Studying the  Kids Inpatient Database KID which tracks pediatric hospital stays the Yale researchers discovered  children under age  had been hospitalized for firearm related injuries with  of those patients dying The data in KID has been gathered since  as part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services with  the most recent release  Most of the injuries  resulted from assaults while  were from accidents and  the result of suicide attempts The most common types of injury were open wounds at  percent and fractures at  percent Brain injuries were more common in the younger kids most of whom were hurt in accidental shootings  Brain and spinal cord injuries accounted for oneseventh of the injuries The aftermath of those types of injuries can be devastating Leventhal said Earlier studies which looked at child mortality related to firearms found about  deaths a year experts said   This study reinforces what we know from the mortality data said Daniel Webster director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research We have an extraordinary health burden in our youth associated with firearms injuries In that the US stands out Webster said When you look at firearmsrelated mortality in the United States compared to other high income nations our rates are roughly fold higher he said This is a very unique and abnormal problem that such a wealthy nation should have such high mortality and morbidity in youth related to firearms The new study highlights the critical effect that firearms are having on childrens health and safety said Patrick Tolan a professor of education and psychiatry at the University of Virginia and director of the YouthNex the U Va Center for Positive Youth Development Its clear that this needs to be a part of the conversation about firearms Theres been such a strong focus on whether somebodys liberty might be fettered The high number of accidental injuries especially in the youngest children underscores the need for parents to keep guns locked in a safe place that is separate from where ammunition is stowed and secured Leventhal said   One change that could make a big difference Webster said is to make it illegal for anyone under  to own a handgun In order to drink beer legally you have to be  he said While you have to be  to purchase a handgun from a dealer if youre an yearold you can go to a private seller and legally purchase a handgun in  out of  states If you look at homicide as a function of age youll see that there is a peak between  and  Webster said So for this very high risk group of  to year olds we think its too dangerous to drink beer but in  states they can legally possess as many handguns as they like We have weak laws and for that we pay a dear cost
