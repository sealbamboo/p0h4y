How do you tell the difference between someone who needs to be taken to jail and someone who needs to be taken to the hospital It can be a delicate situation to decipher and its been a big   in Connecticut since the Newtown shootings of  Lance Newkirchen a regular patrol officer in the town of Fairfield is also specifically trained to respond to mental health calls On a recent weekday he headed out in his patrol car for a followup call Were going to go meet with a father whose yearold son  two days ago at  oclock in the morning  through his depressive disorder was having suicidal thoughts Newkirchen explains Fairfield has  officers and  are trained like Newkirchen Theyre part of whats called a   a program that Fairfield implemented about three years ago The departments target is to train  percent of its force The Fairfield team is one of about    a fraction of the  state and local   in the country In Fairfield police say they want to make sure families have as much support as possible They also want to make sure police have as much information as they can in case they ever have to go back They know theyre dealing with someone who is depressed Newkirchen says For instance he continues officers might know that theyre dealing with someone who may have a samurai sword collection in their basement They know that theyre dealing with someone whose parents are divorced and the father is very antipolice and the mother is propolice Its the kind of information that makes it easier for cops like Newkirchen to do their jobs There are many such details Newkirchen says that if gathered in a first visit can later give an officer responding to an emergency call as hes walking up the front walk  percent of the information he needs to be effective Inside Newkirchen talked through a brochure of services  people and agencies that can help the family out if needed And he went through a twopage list of questions about the sons diagnosis Newkirchen says doing this job means being a good listener But it doesnt mean being soft or forgetting police tactics It just means adding to them a few more skills Its easy to interview the person who just stole four tires from BJs and get that person to admit whats going on Newkirchen says But its incredibly difficult to get someone who believes they have an assignment from the FBI to really admit that they dont and that they do need help and its time to go and talk to somebody at the hospital So thats the skill set A few weeks ago Newkirchen and  or so officers from across the state gathered for the first day of a fiveday Crisis Intervention Team seminar Such workshops touch on everything from making suicide assessments to talking to people on the autism spectrum They also discuss forging partnerships with community mental health providers and understanding deescalation techniques The characteristic of your work that sets you apart from every other professional is that you never know what youre walking into says   of Yale School of Medicines Law and Psychiatry division Baranoskis first goal is to give the officers she trains an understanding of various types of behavioral health issues Psychotic illnesses for instance are the ones that make a person unable to tell the difference between thought and reality To illustrate she confesses something many people feel when giving a public talk  shes nervous and worried about how people will react But she knows those are her thoughts and no one elses As long as I know Im thinking it I have a choice on how to change my behavior Baranoski says But if I were mentally ill  particularly if I had a mental illness that interfered with what we call reality testing  I think Because youre staring at me youre thinking Im stupid  This training is an eyeopener for thirdyear officer John McGrath You know protocol for a police officer is always Protect yourself  McGrath says To be able to learn what theyre thinking and whats going on in their mind kind of gives you a better perspective of whats going on and what youre able to do to further protect yourself and to protect them Newkirchen says that the training these officers are getting is extremely practical He probably gets two or three calls related to mental health in an eighthour shift He says not all calls go as well as the visit with the family of the man who was suicidal but a lot of them do I would say  percent of the time the calls we get are calls like this  where we are making I think a huge difference We wont be back and that family has a very different sense of what we do as police officers Late Wednesday night Connecticut lawmakers passed a bill ensuring that all police in the state can get some kind of training like Newkirchens
