It came as a surprise to many people when Vermonts governor recently devoted his entire    to what he called a fullblown heroin crisis While it may not fit Vermonts bucolic image the states addiction problem has long been acknowledged And as the state has expanded treatment its also been coming to grips with one of the most difficult and emotional aspects of the issue addicted mothers Between  and  the number of babies with symptoms of opioid exposure tripled Now treatment programs in Vermont which were once meager and disjointed are more numerous and accessible As she swaddles her healthy dayold baby at DartmouthHitchcock Medical Center a young Vermont mother   who wants to remain anonymous because she comes from a small town  is more relieved than most Not long before she became pregnant she hurt her back A friend gave her some prescription painkillers It didnt take long to go from This is all right to take sometime to Ive got to do it every day and Im puking and having withdrawal symptoms if Im not doing it she says Most pregnant Vermont women addicted to opioids seek treatment This mother was one of the first to go to a new DartmouthHitchcock clinic that reflects a shift in how mothers like her are being cared for From a location in a renovated mill the clinic offers treatment group counseling and psychiatric services and works in partnership with doctors at the hospital Before the clinic opened those services were scattered uncoordinated and often hard to access Nursemidwife Daisy Goodman says finding treatment for the women was especially frustrating Our patients if they were brave enough to come forward  and it takes an enormous amount of courage to come forward and ask for help  were then being told theres really nothing we can do to help Goodman says The clinic in bordering New Hampshire gets nearly half of its funding from Vermont Treating addiction in pregnant and new mothers is especially challenging says Vermont Health Commissioner   because it requires so many different systems working together well the social service system the health care system the substance abuse system and even to some extent the correctional system Each of those systems makes its own demands on a mother in treatment Theres daycare and transportation to arrange for a crowded schedule of appointments at different locations For more than a decade a program at Fletcher Allen Health Care in Burlington Vt has tried to bring them all together Thats one of the keystones  trying to get everything all in one place says Marjorie Meyer an obstetrician at Fletcher Allen These women dont have very organized lives Meyer says the other key is communication Thats done at regular meetings where health care providers social workers and state agencies compare notes on each mother Programs like this arent unique but they are the exception While we recognize its the ideal way treat this population in reality I dont think a lot of that is happening Dr Lauren Jansson pediatric director at Cap Pediatrics a drug treatment program for pregnant and parenting women in Baltimore The stress of raising a newborn and factors like poverty and family dysfunction increase the risk of relapse soon after a child is born Vermont providers say that period in a mothers life needs more attention As she prepares to return home with her newborn the mother at Dartmouth Hitchcock says she worries about relapsing I do she says The stresses of a new baby and also the stresses of being a mom of three It used to be a coping mechanism for me It was like my mom time time for me She hopes the new DartmouthHitchcock program will help her stay clean
