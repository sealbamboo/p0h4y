The researcher was presenting her findings to a room full of geriatricians at the American Geriatrics Society annual scientific meeting last week in Orlando Fla So a slide revealing one particular statistic didnt cause an audible gasp or murmur Talking to geriatricians about endoflife treatment practically defines preaching to the choir as a member of the audience told me later Among other kinds of doctors or the public this number might be more surprising Dr VJ Periyakoil a geriatrics and palliative care specialist at Stanford University was talking about her survey of nearly  physicians who were completing clinical training at two universityaffiliated medical centers She and her colleagues wanted to learn more about the attitudes of young doctors towards advance directives So the researchers asked what choices they would make for themselves if they were terminally ill Their reply  percent would choose a donotresuscitate or no code status An allowmetodie status in other words Doctors see a lot Dr Periyakoil told me later that day Resuscitation attempts are so aggressive  likely to break an older patients ribs but    that after witnessing several you know too much and youre much more wary she said Perhaps readers here remember a muchcirculated web essay by Dr Ken Murray a retired family practitioner called   He claimed that his fellow physicians largely reject the sort of hightech care they routinely dispense to their patients Dr Murray wrote persuasively about the attitudes of people he knew but he had no data demonstrating that these opinions were widely held Only later did a reader point him to a survey of older doctors all Johns Hopkins graduates who had reached their late s or s who felt similarly But here is evidence from the Stanford study that even at the beginnings of their careers doctors in many medical specialties resist the common do everything endoflife attitude In some ways this group doesnt precisely mirror American physicians in training as a whole It included more women for instance  percent compared to  percent of doctors in training nationally This sample was more ethnically diverse too Only about half Caucasian compared to  percent nationally and more heavily Asian with fewer AfricanAmericans and Latinos And the doctors thinking did vary by ethnicity and gender the study showed Over all they had favorable attitudes toward advance directives but women were significantly more favorable than men Doctors who were white or AfricanAmerican were more in support of advance directives than were Asians or Hispanics Medical specialties mattered too Emergency physicians pediatricians obstetriciangynecologists and those in physical medicine and rehab had more favorable attitudes toward advance directives Radiologists surgeons orthopedists and radiation oncologists were less favorably inclined Yet for their own future care they achieved striking near unanimity with that a  percent preference for avoiding resuscitation and associated heroics if they had an illness that would soon kill them Dr Periyakoil who called her presentation Do Unto Others concluded with a slide that read Why do doctors continue to provide highintensity care for terminal patients but may personally forgo such care themselves at the end of life Its a really good question
