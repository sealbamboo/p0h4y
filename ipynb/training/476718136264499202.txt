Scratching their heads on how to encourage high-tech, export-led growth, the brightest minds in the U.K. government came up with the “patent box” in 2010.. Under the rules, U.K. companies can apply a lower rate of corporation tax against profits earned from domestically developed and registered patents—a tax rate of 10% versus the headline corporate rate of 21%. The new rules came into effect in April 2013.. In announcing the patent box, the U.K. followed the lead of other European countries including the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium, all of which were already offering lower rates than 10% through their own national schemes.. Now, those tax breaks could be under threat.
