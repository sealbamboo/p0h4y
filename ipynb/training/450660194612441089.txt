One long period of Obamacare handwringing in Los Angeles County will end Monday as the window for residents to enroll in mandatory healthcare coverage comes to a close But less than  hours later county elected officials will be confronted with another politically sensitive facet of the nations healthcare overhaul how to manage roughly a million people many of them poor or undocumented who will remain uninsured either because they arent eligible or failed to enroll Unlike some other counties in California which are sidestepping the issue and leaving the problem largely to nonprofit free clinics Los Angeles has committed to providing residents without coverage some system of governmentsupported medical care But the debate over what that care will look like  and how it will be funded  is only now getting started The county plans to set up a managedcarelike system for some uninsured residents but advocates question whether the effort to get patients assigned to community clinics  and out of emergency rooms  will be enough They plan to gather Tuesday before the county Board of Supervisors weekly meeting and push for additional funding to expand the program People want to sign up said Tom Holler coexecutive director of One LA a coalition of churches synagogues and nonprofits that has been working to increase access to healthcare Thats why we have to ask the county for more money Researchers at UCLA and UC Berkeley have estimated that  million to  million Californians will remain uninsured five years after the Affordable Care Act is implemented Anthony Wright executive director of the advocacy group Health Access California said that a third to onehalf of LAs million uninsured wont have documentation of legal residency That means they wont be eligible for federally subsidized healthcare programs such as MediCal and Covered California Counties take widely varying approaches to care for the uninsured Some like Fresno contract with private hospitals while others run public hospital systems Some limit outlays to existing state and federal funding and required local matching contributions Others such as Los Angeles devote additional money to the services Counties also have different income and legal residency eligibility requirements for patients to receive nonemergency healthcare In February state Sen Ricardo Lara DBell Gardens introduced a bill to make coverage available throughout the state to immigrants in the country illegally Critics argue that providing such services encourages immigrants to settle illegally in the state and county These are selfinflicted wounds said Ira Mehlman a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform a Washingtonbased organization that seeks to stop illegal immigration County hospitals are overwhelmed with uninsured people and theyve been forced to come up with more money to accommodate these people  largely because theyve encouraged them to come in Wright said Los Angeles Countys size and its large numbers of immigrants in the country illegally make it an important laboratory for counties trying to figure out how to serve the uninsured Many patients without medical coverage show up at county clinics and emergency rooms needing to see a doctor said Dr Mitchell Katz director of LA Countys Department of Health Services That relatively costly healthcare is paid for with a combination of federal state and county funds Katz said making it difficult to determine local government costs In addition the county pays  million a year from its local general government budget to run a program known as Healthy Way LA Unmatched that reimburses partner community clinics for caring for about  uninsured patients Katzs department plans to relaunch that program this fall as a managedcaretype system that will be made available to those not covered by the Affordable Care Act or private insurance and whose income is less than  of the federal poverty level or  for a household of one The new plan will issue membership cards to participants and assign them to a medical home  a nonprofit community clinic  that will coordinate their primary care Clinics taking part will be paid a predetermined rate for each patient they take on Katz said That should provide an incentive for them to treat patients more efficiently  keeping track of those who are chronically ill to keep them healthy and cutting out unnecessary and expensive visits to clinics and emergency rooms he said Primary care is one of the few interventions that has been shown to save money Katz said Doctors dont order as many tests or hospitalize patients as much when they know them Katz is scheduled to update supervisors on the countys implementation of healthcare reform and coverage of those who remain uninsured at Tuesdays board meeting He said is not seeking funding increases for Healthy Way LA Unmatched Our goal is to keep the pool of money about the same and the number of patients about the same Katz said Im not saying Gee I want you to give me a lot more money Im saying Im going to do a better job with the amount of money and the number of people I have Advocates are lauding the countys new managedcaretype program as a first step toward health coverage for all but are concerned that it wont be enough to meet the need The Department of Health Services and the community clinics have not yet determined the flat rate that those providing medical services to the uninsured will receive But assuming a reasonable rate Holler said from our perspective the current funding wont go far enough
