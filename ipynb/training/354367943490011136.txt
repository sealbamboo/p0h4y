The Major League Baseball season is now half over and some fans are already starting to think about the World Series in October October is also a big month for the Obama administration Thats when millions of Americans can start signing up for new health insurance policies through health exchanges established in each state under the Affordable Care Act Polls show most Americans still dont understand how theyre supposed to do it The White House and its state partners are eager to let them know Theyre trying to recruit baseball teams and other sports franchises to help It worked before Back in  the Boston Red Sox won the World Series sweeping the Colorado Rockies in four games Its also the year that Massachusetts started requiring nearly all residents to have health insurance  and the Red Sox helped to get the word out about it The team let the state set up booths at games to explain the new law to fans and the   ran ads during Red Sox broadcasts Red Sox fan Amy OLeary remembers it well I think it made sense People feel like they know the players she says I think that sports teams in general can be messengers of good information to a wide variety of people Now that other states are opening health insurance marketplaces theyre trying the same strategy People who care about being healthy our young adult population are big watchers of the sports shows and we know they are going to be an important population for us to reach says Myung Kim outreach director for Colorados   Colorado is focusing on young people because a lot of them are uninsured And for the Affordable Care Act to work they need to buy into the system Young people who probably wont use much health care are expected to balance out older sicker people who will So the state is   during Rockies baseball games that show people buying a health policy and then celebrating as if theyd just won a sporting event The voiceover in the ads says Connect for Health Colorado because when health insurance companies compete theres only one winner You But while Colorado follows Massachusetts lead on advertising its new insurance marketplace it is one of only  states independently setting up their own exchanges The federal government is fully or partially at the helm of the insurance exchanges in all the other states It could be tough to get through to young people who may not value having health insurance We also know that theyre most heavily marketed to so its really hard to break through to this group says Mandy Cohen with the federal Department of Health and Human Services We know we had to put an extra emphasis on the  to yearold cohort But when the White House   to pro baseball NASCAR and other sports organizations to discuss marketing partnerships some Republicans called a foul The National Football League   on the idea of helping to market the exchanges Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy   saying they risk damaging their inclusive and apolitical brands by promoting the federal health care law That didnt happen in Boston We didnt have negative feedback says Charles Steinberg a Red Sox executive In American democracy we debate issues and we come to resolution and we pass laws And those laws are designed to benefit the people So when you can be a communicator of the laws of the land you believe that youre helping people Still the White House as of now has canceled at least some of its meetings with sports leagues about potential partnerships In Colorado the ads running during Rockies TV broadcasts havent stirred up any controversy But they might not be home runs either The same night OLeary was in Boston Joan Ringel was at the Rockies game Shes seen the ads on TV and says its hard to even tell what they are for You wouldnt know that that is Colorados exchange for the Affordable Care Act Ringel says I didnt think they explained clearly that people need to pay attention to the exchange when its time to sign up
