Doctors should disinfect their stethoscopes after every examination because the instruments are heavily contaminated by bacteria a study says  Stethoscopes were found to carry as many bacteria as the palms of doctors hands and only doctors fingertips were dirtier University of Geneva researchers said stethoscopes may contain thousands of bacteria including MRSA Doctors should clean stethoscopes regularly to cut down on transmission The study published in an issue of   said the hands of healthcare workers were still the main source of bacterial transmission in hospitals but stethoscopes also appeared to have a major impact Lead researcher Dr Didier Pittet director of the infection control programme at the University of Geneva Hospitals said the instruments were transmitters of bacteria By considering that stethoscopes are used repeatedly over the course of a day come directly into contact with patients skin and may harbour several thousand bacteria including MRSA collected during a previous physical examination we consider them as potentially significant vectors of transmission Dr Pittet added From infection control and patient safety perspectives the stethoscope should be regarded as an extension of the physicians hands and be disinfected after every patient contact Dr Clare Taylor a council member from the Royal College of General Practitioners and a GP in Birmingham said doctors were more aware than ever of the importance of maintaining hygiene standards to protect patients  She said I regularly clean my own stethoscope with alcohol wipes and ensure I wash or sanitise my hands after every patient Its part of our role to ensure we do everything we can to prevent the spread of infection The University of Geneva research team carried out tests for bacteria on the diaphragm or metal circular end of a stethoscope which is put against the skin to listen to the bodys internal sounds and the tube connecting it to the earpieces They also measured bacteria levels on four areas of a doctors dominant hand  the back of the hand fingertips and two regions of the palm  They did this after each of  patients had been examined Three doctors carried out the examinations using a sterile stethoscope and sterile gloves While the doctors gloved fingertips were found to be most heavily contaminated by bacteria the stethoscope diaphragm was more contaminated than all other areas of the doctors hands and the tube of the stethoscope carried more bacteria than the back of the doctors hands When researchers looked for levels of MRSA contamination   in particular they found similar high levels of bacteria on stethoscopes and doctors hands They did not isolate any other bacteria The study said further research was needed to understand how stethoscopes could best be disinfected More work is also required on how long bacteria survive on stethoscopes and how they are transmitted on to a persons skin the Geneva team added The British Medical Association said there was no evidence of infections coming from stethoscopes
