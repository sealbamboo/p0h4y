Mosquitoes that transmit dengue fever are spreading across the US But outbreaks of the disease are only occurring in some areas and scientists are trying to find out why Marty Baum was watching TV at home with his girlfriend Robin Pitman one Saturday night in August when he was struck down by a fever so severe he could barely stand I was sweating my brains out and shaking so bad I couldnt control myself said the yearold man from Jenson Beach Florida  If I get the flu I have a clue a day or so ahead of time  maybe a swollen gland or an achy joint But the thing that scared me that night was that I had no idea what may have caused this I went from feeling great to running a fever of F C he said Within days an acute pain had developed behind his eyes  It felt like somebody was pushing on my eyeballs he said  And then the rash started I had to scratch myself with a hairbrush to relieve the itch It was all encompassing and just miserable Blood tests soon confirmed that Mr Baum and Ms Pitman had dengue fever  also known as breakbone fever  a mosquitoborne virus  Dengue fever is a tropical disease that affects  of the worlds population Around  million people become infected every year It is rarely fatal  However some victims develop dengue haemorrhagic fever which causes bleeding and low blood pressure These health issues contribute to an estimated  deaths a year  Scientists are particularly concerned about the emergence of the virus in Jenson Beach Florida It means that dengue fever is spreading north from Key West where one of the earliest outbreaks in the US was recorded in  Previously there had been no outbreaks of the fever in Florida for decades The virus is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito which usually lives in tropical regions But scientists believe that climate change has made them more prevalent across the southern states of the US An unexpected number of the mosquitoes have recently been recorded in Californias Central Valley and in the San Francisco Bay Area Not all of these regions have experienced dengue fever outbreaks however Scientists are trying to find out why In findings presented at Novembers annual meeting of The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene experts studied two cities  miles apart  Key West and Tucson Arizona The mosquito Aedes aegypti can be found in both cities but Tucson has not experienced an outbreak of the illness Mary Hayden a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research NCAR in Boulder Colorado said that differences in climate may be affecting the mosquitoes life span The dengue virus needs at least eight days to incubate inside the mosquito she said  It may be that the temperatures in Tucson are so hot she said and the relative humidity is so low that the mosquitoes may not be able to survive in that climate long enough for the virus to cycle within them The findings are not conclusive she said but they appear to be the most likely explanation why people in some areas with the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes get dengue fever  while people in others do not If climate plays a role it would have implications for mosquitocontrol programmes But scientists also need to know more precisely where the mosquitoes live  Mosquitoes that infect people with the West Nile virus lay their eggs in ponds and sewers for instance These areas can be treated with insecticides  But the Aedes aegypti mosquito lives near people The insects are found in water that collects in gutters flower pots even in the folds of tarpaulins These areas are harder to treat with insecticides Scientists are hoping that highresolution satellite images will help detect such habitats and allow them to create a map of mosquito populations The information will be combined with weather and climate data to assess the number of mosquitoes that are capable of carrying dengue  You can see fairly detailed aspects of areas that are difficult to survey from the ground said Paul Bieringer a scientist with NCARs National Security Applications Program The project is one of many tools being used in the US to control mosquitoes and to stop the spread of illness  In Key West authorities are planning to introduce genetically modified male mosquitoes containing a gene that stops normal development Their offspring will inherit the gene It alters the way their cells function and causes them to die before reaching adulthood Some residents are concerned about the safety of releasing geneticallymodified insects into the wild however  This is very exciting technology but when you are dealing with a genetically modified organism there are a lot of things that should be looked into said Key West resident Joel Biddle who contracted dengue fever in  Im concerned about dengue  I wouldnt want anybody to get it But Im very concerned about opening up a Pandoras Box that could be as dangerous or more dangerous than dengue According to the website of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District geneticallymodified insects have already been used to control pests in the US There is nothing inherently dangerous about the process according to the website Like most people who get the fever Marty Baum and Robin Pitman have recovered But they  like others who live in the area  are worried If they come down with the fever again the consequences could be far more severe because their immune systems are weakened  We have to be really careful said Mr Baum
