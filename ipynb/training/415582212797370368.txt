My hopes are that people will see and hear about this epic mission and open their eyes a little bit Black said on day eight of his challenge Las Vegas isnt all about the sparkling lights and big hotels and casinos In the shadows and down the alleys that surround the Strip people are hungry Black first came to CNNs attention   who was in Las Vegas and read about his campaign  Black spent Thanksgiving Day on the street  He woke up went to church and ran all day After completing his daily marathon Black came home for a Thanksgiving meal of salad and protein shakes    Hes not complaining He says he started this challenge to draw attention to impoverished people who go hungry on a daily basis You drive around any city in the United States and theres always someone somewhere holding a sign or digging through a garbage can for something to eat he says Its great that everyone donates a turkey at Thanksgiving but this is something bigger than just Thanksgiving An estimated   is considered food insecure meaning people do not know when or from where their next meal will come Thats above the national average of  for  according to   Nationally some  million households are considered food insecure Matt Muldoon chief development officer at Three Square Food Bank says Southern Nevadas continued poverty is due in large part to the triple whammy that occurred in  home foreclosures bankruptcies and high unemployment  The economic recovery  if theres any going on in the country  has really not entrenched itself here Muldoon says Though Black has never participated in an official race he often runs marathon distances The most he has ever run in one day is  miles When Black pitched his idea Muldoon knew he could trust Black to complete this challenge to raise money and awareness for the food bank  The first observation I made about Jay was that he was very calm Muldoon says And with that calmness was a very big aura of confidence that he could physically accomplish this feat Each day Black woke up at  am He went to the kitchen for an energizing shake then took a hot shower and got ready to run another  miles  But it wasnt always easy Because he wasnt racing it took Black five to six hours to complete the distance each day He usually ran outside but often had trouble finding an open road to run on He also suffered from a shin injury and a stress fracture but it didnt stop him I kind of look at my body as an engine he says Unless doctors say you cant go any further then were going to get to the finish line When he first told his friends that he would complete  marathons in  days they had mixed reactions  Some of my friends said You are nuts How is your body going to handle it And then I told them why I was doing it he says They would start off dumbfounded but they would always walk away inspired Even though Black was confident he sometimes worried he might not be able to cross the finish line If he got seriously injured there was no other plan than to quit But all doubts vanished when Black ran along the Las Vegas Strip We ran into a lot of homeless people downtown and once you tell them what youre doing they get a little sparkle in their eye he says And they thank you Thats probably one of the most gratifying parts of this whole thing  knowing that I have an opportunity to tell these people that we havent forgotten about them Black set out with a mission to raise both financial donations and nonperishable food items for the food bank  Muldoon says he didnt want to peg Blacks efforts to a specific dollar amount In fact Muldoon hasnt even kept track of the amount of money raised during the challenge If I am focused on just the dollar amount then Im missing the purpose of exactly what hes trying to accomplish here he says Black started with a goal of  He raised a total of  All of his proceeds will go to the Three Square Food Bank Because of the food banks efficiencies Muldoon says each dollar can be turned into three meals  To commemorate his achievement the Clark County Board of Commissioners in Nevada declared December   Jayson Black Day For the first time in my life I feel truly blessed Its not really a sense of relief its a sense of accomplishment Black said after finishing We dont have any specific plans yet but well wrap up  with a big bow and then well get a team together and start thinking about next year Though Blacks mission came to an end Monday he wants people to know they can make a positive contribution in their own communities no matter where they are located  You dont have to run  marathons in  days to make someone smile he says You dont have to do crazy epic stuff Any one of us can make a difference
