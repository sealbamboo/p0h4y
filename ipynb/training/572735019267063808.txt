urved walls with no sharp edges bedrooms built a little below ground level to diffuse outside noise and a structure that allows for gradual transition from light to dark  these are among the bespoke features of Bessemer Close a collection of specialised homes soon to be built for people with autism The six bungalows tailored to the unique needs of people with highlevel autism are being built by Cherwell district council in Bicester They are part of a new wave of innovation in specialised housing provision for vulnerable people reflecting an emerging focus in recent years on improving the lives of residents in ways that arent possible in mainstream housing  In BideforduponAvon a specialised home for up to nine adults with learning disabilities is already up and running Murray House has nine individual apartments with a large and bright communal space designed to foster an atmosphere of interdependence that reduces the need for outside support and combats feelings of isolation There are still far too many people living in institutional settings and this particular project has proven how good design can give choice where none existed and enhance the lives of people with support needs who benefit from bespoke living space says Glyn Davies special projects manager for   which developed Murray House after winning a bid from Warwickshire county council  Both Bessemer Close and Murray House were awarded significant funding   and  respectively  in July  by the Department of Health from its m   Cassh which has been allocated to specialised housing projects in England for groups such as older people and people with mental health conditions  The idea is to encourage construction of a wide range of housing options to help people live independently for as long as possible The first block of money is funding more than  homes for vulnerable and older people According to Davies it allows organisations such as Creative Support to take on more innovative projects for which funding is normally difficult to find   for the second phase of the Cassh fund which will make a further m available for such projects In  just  of the total budget went to housing for people with learning disabilities mental health problems or physical or sensory disabilities with the bulk of funding spent on homes for older people This time round priority will be given to those that focus on support for adults with mental health conditions although no specific target has been set Kevin McGeough head of corporate strategy at the Homes and   Agency HCA which delivers the fund said he will welcome a variety of bids but could not say how much funding would go to projects for people with mental health conditions This time we want a wider range of provision but we cant force people to bid or invent projects We need to see quality schemes that will work in the long term and cant allocate funding purely based on the user group The HCA hopes to combat the issue of vulnerable people being forced to move hundreds of miles away from their families because local provision for their needs doesnt exist Assessment criteria for the funding focuses on local strategic priorities as well as value for money viability and suitability for the intended user Demand for specialised housing is increasing with an estimated shortfall of   even with the continuation of Cassh funding And McGeough suggests the situation could be even worse because demand has not yet been quantified   Given that the first phase of Cassh funding was oversubscribed by  McGeough acknowledges that there is not enough money to cope with growing demand This is just a starting point in terms of need he says It is a significant step in the right direction but we cant solve all of the problems with it  The HCA has seen massive cuts to resources with its affordable homes programme budget slashed from bn in  to bn in  but McGeough says significant portions of this budget are allocated to specialised housing  However the HCA is unable to confirm how many people the Cassh fund will help Not setting a target for the latest funding round stresses McGeough is to avoid setting specific targets that might discourage bidders from focusing on value for money Local authorities have until the end of May to bid for funding
