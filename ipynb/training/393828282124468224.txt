When I make a wrong turn the womans voice in my GPS says Route recalculation Then she tells me how to get back on track How I wish this electronic tool could be adapted for men whose wives have breast cancer Imagine a device that would help us correct course when we try our best to support the women we love  and inevitably mess up As a breast cancer husband who did just about everything wrong when my wife was diagnosed I would have been very grateful for a little backseat driving Lets consider some examples My wife Marsha has just had a mammogram A radiologist rather callously informs her Sure looks like cancer to me A threeday weekend looms before she can see a surgeon and get more information My wrongheaded instinct is to cheer her up Marsha loves books so surely shell be happy if I take her to a book festival Thatll get her mind off the cancer bombshell But as we walk around she looks sadder than Ive ever seen her Route recalculation Honey I can see this isnt what you want to do right now Tell me what would be helpful We can go home we can sit and cuddle we can watch some mindless TV we can gulp talk about how youre feeling Then shut up and listen Another time were running from doctor to doctor listening to treatment plans I figure its my job to pick the best plan  a husband is supposed to take care of his wife right Route recalculation Be her sounding board not her boss Your wife might ask you What did you think of that doctor What do you think about that chemo regimen Tell her what you think Ask her questions But then step back and remember that its her decision not yours One surgeon says to Marsha I can see youd always worry about recurrence so Id recommend a double mastectomy Marsha had always thought she would say Off with my breasts if it meant saving her life Now she is mourning this possibility I try to make things better saying Honey Ill love you with or without your breasts Marsha responds Howd you feel if they wanted to cut off your penis Me thinking to myself What the   Spousal Route Recalculation Dont take her cutting remark personally Admit it you cant possibly imagine how she feels Medical route recalculation Marsha sees another doctor who says that lumpectomy plus radiation offers comparable survival odds for Marsha and thats the route she chooses My wife tells me I dont have to come to the doctors office with her So Im going to listen right Route recalculation She may be trying to spare me because she feels guilty imposing on my time Tell her What the heck Im coming anyway Ill remind you of the questions you want to ask Ill write down or taperecord what the doctor says Detour One breast cancer survivor told me My husband isnt very good with doctors he has a demanding job as a truck driver and I could bring my sister to the appointments She and her husband agreed on this arrangement and it worked out fine for them Im exhausted My job is as demanding as ever Im doing more household chores because my wife is dealing with cancer and then there are all the doctors visits Dare I take any time to unwind No sirree That would be  selfish Route recalculation Caregivers need a break too Honey is it OK if I go for a bike ride shoot some hoops hang out with my pals I ask Marsha is very understanding For a little while I can run away from cancer And when I get back home I feel a little calmer a little more myself And Im a better caregiver Im in the mood for love But my wife is in the middle of cancer treatments Do I dare come on to her Maybe I should just hold back Route recalculation Theres nothing wrong with propositioning your wife Maybe shes in the mood too Or maybe she just wants you to hold her massage her back whisper I love you in her ear And if shes   in the mood well as my wife teases Too bad for you But at least she knows I havent lost that loving feeling And who knows maybe one day soon shell be ready for an intimacy route recalculation
