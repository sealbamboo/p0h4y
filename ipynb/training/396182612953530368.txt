In a barn outside Manhattan Kan researchers from Kansas State University are trying to solve the riddle of bovine respiratory disease Theyre sticking plastic rods down the noses of month old calves collecting samples of bacteria This bacteria   lives in most cattle explains   one of the research leaders Sometimes for reasons that arent well understood those bacteria make cattle sick When that happens or when it just seems likely to happen cattlemen deploy antibiotics Apley hopes to find out among other things whether those antibiotics actually work as advertised If they dont he says its an easy decision to not use them Farmers save money and meat industry critics who want farmers to use fewer antibiotics are happy too Its a winwin for everyone Unfortunately when it comes to antibiotics on the farm its not always a winwin And when theres a fight veterinarians are right in the middle of it pushed back and forth by conflicting loyalties To understand those pressures I paid a visit to veterinarian   in Abilene Kan Henry is a leading swine specialist Pork producers rely heavily on veterinarians like Henry for advice They dont want to spend money on drugs if they dont need to says Henry Now you have to juxtapose that with a tremendous amount of pressure from pharmaceutical companies to move product Those companies aim advertising campaigns at farmers and veterinarians alike Henry says he dismisses it but others are influenced As a result farmers sometimes use more drugs than they should In addition many veterinarians have a financial interest in such decisions They resell antibiotics to farmers Theres some margin in there for the veterinarian so theres some incentive for the veterinarians to sell more says Henry In Denmark the government took away that incentive in  it stopped veterinarians from earning profits on such sales The next year antibiotic use   by almost  percent The Danish government also banned sales of one antibiotic that year which may account for part of the decline Since then Denmark has passed other regulations limiting antibiotic use in agriculture But Henry says he still trusts veterinarians more than any regulations by government to make sure antibiotics are used wisely When veterinarians enter the profession in fact they swear an   to protect animals and also promote public health But they soon develop other loyalties too  above all to farmers who in turn are driven by the need to earn a living Antibiotics can make meat production more efficient Some drugs are used to make animals grow faster Others reduce the risk of liver abscesses in feedlot cattle that are eating energyrich diets of corn Mike Apley the veterinarian at Kansas State says those things matter when your clients are struggling to stay in business The cost of production is a reality in food animal medicine and food animal production he says Critics of the meat industry though say using antibiotics this way is irresponsible Anytime antibiotics are used it increases the likelihood that bacteria will evolve resistance to them Such drugresistant bacteria can migrate raising the risk of infections that doctors cant treat as easily  a veterinarian and former official at the Food and Drug Administration says its not acceptable to increase that risk just to produce meat more cheaply Even if theres not clear evidence of harm right now its unwise to wait until its too late when there are literally bodies in the street We have got enough science to know that we need to act says Blackwell who also is a leader of the   and a critic of methods used by meat producers Blackwell says antibiotics should only be used to fight disease and only at therapeutic doses sufficient to kill virtually all diseasecausing bacteria Kansas States Mike Apley for his part says hes ready to stop advising meat producers to use any antibiotic if hes convinced that it could harm people But he says the scientific evidence so far doesnt persuade him thats hes doing anything risky I want to fully support human health he says But at the same time I dont want to remove valuable tools when that removal will not have a benefit for human health He pauses You know were really  Its tough Its tough Its tough because of scientific uncertainty and also because veterinarians serve two masters public health and food production
