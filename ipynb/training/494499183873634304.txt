What do the parents think Thats always a crucial question when it comes to vaccinating kids And its particularly important in Pakistan which is one of the   in the world where the polio virus is still making kids sick Health workers in Pakistan are trying to convince millions of parents to allow their children take the polio vaccine But the program faces vehement  and at times    opposition So researchers at the   recently did a poll to find out if parents are part of the problem The results surprised them Imagine youre a parent in northwest Pakistan You live in a remote village perhaps in a mud hut on top of a mountain Every few weeks some strangers carrying vials of a clear liquid come knocking on your door Frankly if someone came to my house and said You know you dont know me from Adam but Id like to vaccinate your child I wouldnt let them says   of the World Health Organization But eradicating polio worldwide depends on these parents in Pakistan saying yes Strangers showing up at your door isnt the only hurdle to getting children vaccinated In Pakistan the Taliban threaten to kill parents who immunize their kids More than  vaccinators have already been killed in the past two years There have been health worker attacks and there have been bans on polio campaigns for two years now says   of UNICEF a cosponsor of the vaccine poll So theres this climate that were working in The result of those bans a surge in polio cases in Talibancontrolled regions About  kids have been paralyzed this year in the two regions where the polio vaccine is banned North Waziristan and South Waziristan The message to parents from all this Dont even think of opening your door for a vaccinator And its not just in the regions controlled by the Taliban Rumors about the vaccine are common across Pakistan the Harvard poll found The vaccine is not halal for example Guirguis says Or that its not made with ingredients that they feel comfortable with Theres also the belief that the vaccine is a Western plot to sterilize Muslim children or worse that the vaccine gives kids AIDS On the plus side only  in  parents nationwide thought the rumors might be true the Harvard poll found And even in the   or FATA only about a third of parents thought there might be something to the tales But researchers say these rumors can still be a problem People dont necessarily have to believe them in full says Harvards   who ran the poll But you worry about that kind of atmosphere of misunderstanding about the vaccine Thats because of another challenge facing the polio eradication effort With other vaccine initiatives its enough to reach a good majority of kids But when it comes to polio health workers are trying to wipe this disease off the planet So even reaching  percent of kids isnt good enough says UNICEFs Guirguis Polio is a  percent program she says You need to find every child living in the most farflung area living in the most conflictaffected area And vaccinators dont need to reach kids only once or even twice They need to convince parents to vaccinate their child at least four times in a single year Thats what it takes to get full immunity with this vaccine And when vaccinators keep showing up some parents start to get exasperated the WHOs Bari says So this is one of the few services theyre seeing come to their door for free she says And yet its coming over and over which is something thats hard for them to understand Polio is a big priority for the international community But its become rare enough even in Pakistan that a lot of parents havent ever seen it Its not really on their minds The Harvard poll found that many parents dont think polio is that serious  that the paralysis it causes is curable It isnt And yet for all of these obstacles when vaccinators can get to homes in the FATA region parents there arent turning them away The poll found that among parents who confirmed that a vaccinator reached their door  percent said that yes their child did get the vaccine
