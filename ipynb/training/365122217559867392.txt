I continued to attend school as I was able and with great interest began to study the human body  anatomy and physiology especially I learned everything I could about kidneys and dialysis and later the immune system  At  years old my kidneys completely shut down and I began peritoneal dialysis I was one of the younger patients to perform this type of dialysis on myself as it requires learning sterile techniques  A few months later I was placed on the waiting list for a transplant By December  of that year a kidney became available I took the offer immediately even though it would mean missing Christmas  I spent the holidays in the hospital then experienced three rejection episodes within the first six weeks after transplant The last one was so severe that doctors recommended removing the kidney surgically or trying an experimental new drug that might kill me Because surgery had been very painful I chose the new drug The side effects almost killed me but after two days in intensive care I got better  A few days later even the kidney began to recover  Over the next few years we carefully monitored the kidneys function always concerned that one day my immune system would reject the kidney again and destroy it completely But  years later this kidney has helped me go through high school college medical school a year surgical residency training program  working  to hour weeks  and a twoyear transplant fellowship at times going without sleep for two to three days at a time  Two things allowed me to excel through this illness My faith that God would make everything work out and my unshakable determination to become a transplant surgeon myself  Everyone I encountered discouraged this career choice  Its too hard You wont get enough sleep and Why dont you try to get a normal job where you work  hours a week were frequently heard I could never seriously entertain these suggestions Instead I studied as hard as I could and last summer accomplished my goal of becoming a transplant surgeon  Naturally it helped tremendously to have a supportive family and mentors along the way  To anyone suffering from an unexpected illness or disability things seem hopeless in the beginning as if all dreams and hopes of a future have come to an end But if you can find a goal that is exciting and work towards that goal living life becomes a joy again  Ultimately many others benefit from your perseverance  So dream big
