We're determined to make 2013 the year we stick to our health and fitness goals by taking small, simple steps toward ditching empty calories and finding ways to keep exercise fun. (We listed 52 "paths to fitness" . ). Now we hope you'll join us by sharing your suggestions by using #LATFit on Twitter and Instagram, or via e-mail.. Here are a few suggestions we've gotten so far from readers, and you'll find more online at . .. • Richie from Huntington Beach emailed us about his "first space" rule: "When pulling into a parking area for a supermarket or other store, park in the first space available. ... This gives you more steps to the store ... and avoids getting caught in mini traffic jams as you circle around and try to find a close-in space. ... Carry your bags back to the car for added exercise [and then return your cart to the store for even more steps.]". • Ngoc Hoang of Los Angeles tweeted this tip for staying on track, which sounds like a sure-fire way to reward yourself for a job well done: "Every 100 miles @ the gym, I get a massage or something pretty.". • Several readers wrote to tell us their favorite workout was a bicycle ride around Southern California. (One reader said that when he has trouble getting out of bed on a cold winter's morning for a ride, he gloats that much of the rest of the country is socked in by sleet and snow — and then hops out of bed, thankful he's not one of them.). Several cyclists also wanted to know the location of the glorious stretch of open road we used on the cover of last week's Saturday section. The image was captured just north of Azusa heading south on the San Gabriel River bike trail.. How are you staying on track in 2013? We want to hear all about it.
