Scientists say they have new evidence that autism begins in the womb Patchy changes in the developing brain long before birth may cause symptoms of autism spectrum disorder ASD research suggests The study in   raises hopes that better understanding of the brain may improve the lives of children with autism  It reinforces the need for early identification and treatment says a University of California team US scientists analysed postmortem brain tissue of  children with and without autism all between two and  years of age They used genetic markers to look at how the outermost part of the brain the cortex wired up and formed layers Abnormalities were found in  of the children with autism compared with only about  of children without The changes were dotted about in brain regions involved in social and emotional communication and language long before birth they say The researchers from the   and the   in Seattle say their patchy nature may explain why some toddlers with autism show signs of improvement if treated early enough They think the plastic infant brain may have a chance of rewiring itself to compensate The finding that these defects occur in patches rather than across the entirety of cortex gives hope as well as insight about the nature of autism said Prof Eric Courchesne a neuroscientist at the University of California San Diego Dr Thomas Insel director of the National Institute of Mental Health said If this new report of disorganised architecture in the brains of some children with autism is replicated we can presume this reflects a process occurring long before birth This reinforces the importance of early identification and intervention Carol Povey director of   Centre for Autism said the study shed light on a complex and often misunderstood disability Better understanding of the early brain development of children with autism could help us find new and more effective ways to support the estimated  people living with the condition across the UK she said  Autism can have a profound and devastating impact but the right support can make a huge difference
