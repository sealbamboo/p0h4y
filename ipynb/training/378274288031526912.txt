Public health officials in Florida are once again scrambling to contain an outbreak of dengue fever a disease spread by mosquitoes Until  when it surfaced in Key West the tropical disease hadnt been seen in Florida in more than  years Now there are concerns dengue may establish a foothold in the state Mosquito control is always important in Florida but in July it became urgent in Stuart a quiet community on the states Atlantic coast Bob Washam of the Martin County health department says he heard about cases of a disease that seemed related but that doctors couldnt identify Initially the physicians felt that it might have been a chemical or something like that because three people were sick Washam says Testing showed that it was dengue fever So far health officials have turned up  cases of the disease in Martin County and neighboring St Lucie County All of the cases seem to have been contracted in a few neighborhoods in Stuart On a treelined street in a neighborhood of small cottages Gene Lemire with Martin Countys mosquito control department is checking one of his traps These other mosquitoes could be our little diseasetransmitting mosquitoes he says Well have to take them back to the lab The species Lemire is looking for Aedes aegypti is the one most likely to carry the dengue virus He says they lay their eggs on the sides of containers and the eggs hatch once water covers them And then he says they come out as an adult ready to bite somebody In Rio a community overlooking the St Lucie River Lemire points out potted plants boats tarps and other containers  all potential breeding areas For the past month his crews have been going door to door emptying water from buckets and dropping larvicide tablets into larger containers in an effort to control the mosquito When diagnosed and treated dengue is rarely fatal But it is debilitating and accompanied by a high fever rash and joint pain so severe that its been called breakbone fever They got it right says Marty Baum Baum and his girlfriend both contracted dengue and have since recovered Theres absolutely no comfortable way to be If you lie still it hurts If you move it hurts He thinks they got it from mosquitoes in her backyard one evening At  oclock at night watching a Miami Dolphin football game I was fine A  oclock my fever was  and I was almost convulsive with shivers Its not unusual for travelers to the Caribbean Africa or Latin America to return home with a case of dengue acquired overseas But in Stuart dengue spread to the local mosquito population says Dr Aileen Chang an expert on dengue fever at the University of Miami Health System And those mosquitoes have infected others with the disease Its an outbreak similar to one seen in Key West in  and  Only about a quarter of those infected with dengue become sick enough to see a doctor So far health officials havent been able to identify the person who brought dengue to the area In Stuart  and everywhere theres a dengue outbreak  officials find themselves in a race against the disease They have to work to educate the public and control the mosquito population before it spreads more Dr Chang has been advising health authorities in Stuart and judging from the numbers of cases coming in she believes this particular outbreak may have peaked But its not likely to be the last she says The temperature and weather patterns are changing Were seeing more dengue throughout the entire world she says So now having it creep up to Florida the most southern part of the US is not that surprising
