Medical experts are meeting today and tomorrow at the World Health Organization in Geneva to figure out how to test potential Ebola drugs in Africa In addition to determining which experimental drugs should be the highest priority the experts are sorting through some difficult ethical issues In short theyre trying to figure out how to design tests that will provide the fastest and most trustworthy answers  and yet minimize the need for comparison groups who wont be offered the experimental treatments Practice in the United States has set an unrealistic standard When American health care workers fell ill with Ebola in Africa they flew home and received medical care vastly better than what Africans were getting including experimental therapies We still have no idea whether those treatments made any difference in their recovery says   a bioethicist at Johns Hopkins University The patients also got exquisitely highquality supportive care which undoubtedly made a huge difference The result was that US medical researchers learned very little about the various experimental drugs dispensed to those few individuals In order to understand the value of these potential medications scientists need a scientific study The standard way to do this the world over is to provide some people with the potential drug and a comparison group with a placebo  the socalled sugar pill Martin Friede whos in charge of WHOs work on Ebola drugs says some in West Africa find that strategy objectionable There are other ways to come up with a comparison group  not as rigorous as using placebos but still potentially useful especially if a given experimental drug has a powerful effect This can be done through historical records it can be through comparing whats being done in other sites Friede says There are various mechanisms of doing this Those are under discussion this week at the meeting in Geneva But scientists know the farther they stray from the most rigorous standards the less likely they are to get rapid clear results What we do not want are trials that are conducted where at the end of the study we are unable to say whether the drug is safe or not or whether the drug is effective or not Friede says Numerous research groups are planning trials using a variety of strategies For example scientists at Oxford University say they arent going to use placebos in their trials US scientists arent drawing that bright line Theyre hoping to start tests with Liberian health researchers early next year This study initially would almost certainly be a randomized control trial says Dr   at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases That means not everyone will get an experimental drug The study will however offer everyone who enrolls a higher standard of overall medical care than they would ordinarily receive so in theory everyone will benefit  unless the experimental drug proves to be harmful People always think about investigational drugs as being wonder drugs miracles  theyre going to make the patient better Lane says when in point of fact some of these agents can have pretty serious side effects Some people could actually be harmed by the treatment Without a control group you wouldnt know that  or you wouldnt know it until a large number of patients might potentially have been harmed Lane says All of the experimental drugs have had at least basic safety testing but theres almost no experience in giving them to people who are sick with Ebola Scientists have been considering other ideas to minimize the number of people who are in a comparison group One idea is to have a small comparison group and a large treatment group Another idea is to give people varying doses and see whether people who got more drug did better I think this is a time as is often true in deep ethical challenges where thinking a little bit outside the box might be the answer that works best for everyone Kass says After all this isnt simply a testtube experiment Clinical trials involve real people and they need to agree to participate or the studies wont go forward
