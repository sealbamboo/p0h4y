GP leaders say there is a crisis of confidence about a new NHS datasharing scheme involving medical records From April a giant database Caredata will be rolled out in England with nonidentifiable records to help aid medical research and the monitoring of performance  But the Royal College of GPs accused NHS England of failing to make the case for the project NHS England has said concerns about privacy are misplaced The warning comes after patient watchdog Healthwatch England said last week that the scheme should be delayed as patients had been left in the dark The central database will enable experts to assess diseases examine new drugs on the market and identify infection outbreaks as well as monitor the care patients get Information is already available about what happens in hospitals but it has been difficult to link those records with information on what happens to patients when they are under the care of GPs However concerns have been raised about the prospect of keeping all the information in one place with campaigners saying that it could lead to privacy problems and data breaches There is a proposal  to be discussed next month  that could give access to nonNHS bodies including private firms Meanwhile NHS England has started a mass mailout to every household explaining the project and giving people the chance to opt out But Prof Nigel Mathers from the Royal College of GPs said the communications strategy had been inadequate We are very concerned that with just seven weeks to go before the national rollout the public have not been properly informed about the benefits of and the safeguards surrounding the Caredata programme The inevitable result of the failure to make the case for the scheme is the crisis of public confidence that we are now seeing We urgently need a renewed national push by the authorities to ensure that patients are fully informed in clear terms about the benefits of the scheme what their rights are and what their rights to opt out are Many GPs remain uncertain about the safeguards that will apply He said the college still remained supportive of the initiative in principle but the government and NHS England needed to act immediately to restore public confidence A spokeswoman for NHS England said Were absolutely committed to ensuring the public are aware of the benefits of this initiative and their rights to optout  This is why we have sent a leaflet to every household in England We have also provided leaflets and posters to every GP practice articles in all the major newspapers information on the NHS Choices website information via social media a video animation as well as information cascaded via  patient groups and charities
