For the millions of people with allergies spring can mean months of antihistamines nasal steroids and avoiding nature So we were intrigued when we came across the concept of nasal filters  tiny devices that claim to block pollen and other allergens from ever entering nasal passages The devices are sort of like contact lenses you can put up your nose Some are adhesive while others clip on to your septum And though a quick trip to a drug store close to NPR didnt turn up any several varieties are   These little contraptions even had their  minutes of fame when the inventor of an adhesive version was   on the reality show Shark Tank But do they work Researchers in Denmark say their version has shown success in a small clinical trial Their study found that the filters reduce throat irritation and runny noses in allergy sufferers compared to a filterless placebo device Most people in the study said they stopped noticing the device after wearing it for an hour And the patients didnt tend to switch to breathing through their mouths while they were wearing the device It needed to have excellent breathability And it needed to be comfortable to wear says Peter Sinkjaer Kenney a medical student at Aarhus University in Denmark and the developer of   The   were published in the   But this clinical trial only included  patients and the researcher also plans to sell the devices so hes hardly a disinterested party Still allergists say the nose filter is an intriguing idea I think over all its a good concept says   an allergist from Georgia Even though the nose filter idea has been floating around since the s there hasnt been any consensus on their value as a medical treatment Nish told Shots My impression is maybe these filters are not quite ready for prime time yet Nish says hes never recommended nasal filters to any of his patients That was true with two other allergists we spoke to as well We dont really use it in our practice says   an assistant professor of medicine at National Jewish Health in Denver Colo And allergists arent taught about nasal filters in their training Hoyte says shed want to know more before recommending the devices But we dont discourage it if patients choose to use it
