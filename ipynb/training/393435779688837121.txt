Over the past few months a number of headlines in The New York Times have stumped me Of course those werent actually the headlines The Times had written But why am I staring at the word Tornadoes and reading Tomatoes  Looking at Cuts and reading Cats  Interpreting the abbreviation Wall St as Wall Saint After three cycles or  sessions of chemotherapy I seem to be dealing with a weird sort of dyslexia    Chemo brain is a phenomenon that patients have described for quite some time as a thick mental fog resulting from chemotherapy For quite some time too physicians discounted chemo brain as a figment of patients imaginations Now however the American Cancer Society terms it a mild cognitive impairment that for most people only lasts a short time Doctors were skeptical about chemo brain because many factors can induce mental glitches Forgetfulness trouble concentrating memory blanks inattention word loss retention problems and disorganization can result from aging sleeplessness depression fatigue anxiety low blood counts the onset of menopause and other medications    Isnt it curious though that chemotherapy often accelerates aging causes sleeplessness and depression promotes fatigue and anxiety lowers blood counts causes the onset of menopause and requires powerful secondary medications to deal with its side effects We seem to be caught in a dupe  oops I mean a loop PCCI or postchemotherapy cognitive impairment after being attributed to patients hangups finally became the subject of serious research while I was undergoing treatment Such investigations therefore could not yield pragmatic solutions quick enough to help me locate my car in the parking lot or my keys maybe inside it While I was going through chemotherapy the phrase mild cognitive impairment did not pertain to the stupefaction I experienced at forgetting a close friends name I found myself bewildered about what task had led me to my university office and then lost on the way home I had to enact a convoluted guessing game to get my husband to provide the word egg On more than one occasion it became apparent that one of my daughters was confiding in me but about what  From that time on I got hooked on two aids many people use to survive with a minimum of mortification First on my computer and iPhone I have an elaborate calendar listing not only events that must be attended or tasks that must be accomplished but even menus and their ingredients I study it hourly so I will remember what needs to be performed purchased or produced  when and for or with whom   Second I always have a small pad in my purse another by the side of my bed another next to my computer another in the kitchen Often I scribble suggestions or snippets of conversation so  if they are decipherable  I can mull them over later and learn to remember the information they convey in a new if more laborious manner      Because of the cumulative effect of chemicals sometimes those aids do not help A few years ago I suffered the bane of chemo brain most intensely toward the end of six infusions of Taxol and Carboplatin when a fuzzy hesitancy spiraled into blank enervation I could not think to think stand to stand or feel to feel Vacancy morphed me into a zombie or humanoid I felt somehow exiled from myself a mishap never mentioned in the cheerful brochures on chemotherapy displayed in oncology waiting rooms   A friend of mine now on the same drug combination weeps while considering suicide although she is taking an antidepressant Its the chemicals stupid she has to keep reminding herself Even when Carboplatin alone was later prescribed for me I had trouble reading I tried but when I turned the page I became convinced that either there was a page missing or I had skipped a page My eyes would roll over a paragraph without being able to snag on a sentence  sort of a hindrance for an English teacher    These days while I take a targeted drug the aftereffect of chemo brain persist in milder forms making my reading quite stimulating  but for the wrong reasons As I study a recipe calling for   teaspoons of salt I wonder how to measure  fourths I am regularly surprised by discussions of kidney   instead of kidney stones    instead of digestion issues the   sex drive and   rather than complications after surgery   As a selfidentified chemosabe in my support group assures me at least the recognition and naming of chemo brain prove we are not completely crazy
