Americans atrocious eating habits start incredibly young according to a new comprehensive analysis of foods sold for infants and toddlers About onethird of dinners made for toddlers contained at least one kind of added sugar researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found So did  of breakfast pastries and cereal bars for this age group Even  of juices and other drinks marketed for infants and toddlers are spiked with added sugar In addition  of toddler dinners were judged to be high in sodium with an average of of  milligrams of sodium per meal The Institute of Medicine   that toddlers consume no more than  mg of sodium a day Among  types of savory snacks for infants and toddlers  a category that includes crackers some types of rice cakes and minihot dogs sold in jars  the average concentration of sodium was  mg per  grams of food In comparison salted potato chips intended for adults have about  mg of sodium per  grams the researchers noted in their   which was published Monday by the journal Pediatrics With foods such as these on the menu its not surprising that  of American kids between the ages of  and  are considered either overweight or obese Children who are obese or who eat too much sodium face an increased risk of high blood pressure which can carry over into adulthood and make them vulnerable to cardiovascular disease among other health problems So the researchers from the CDCs   and its   set out to get a better handle on the amount of sodium and sugar in prepared foods designed for the nations youngest eaters They scoured a   that includes nutrition information on more than  prepared foods They also walked the aisles of WalMarts Targets Costcos and supermarkets in the Atlanta area to find additional products for their analysis Altogether they included  food items for infants and toddlers in their sample Some of their findings were reassuring For instance among  infant vegetables fruits dry cereals dinners and readytoserve items that combined mixed grains with fruit all but two were considered low in sodium In addition more than  of the  fruit vegetable soup and dinner items for infants had no added sugars But after kids turned  and graduated to toddler foods the options worsened Cereal bars fruit and dry fruit snacks for this age group were still low in sodium but most contained at least one type of added sugar The most common of these was fruit juice concentrate  an ingredient that some parents might assume is a healthful part of the food according to a pair of pediatric gastroenterologists who wrote a commentary that accompanies the study Early life exposures to sodium and sugar can set taste preferences and determine health trajectories wrote   and   of the University of Buffalo The study authors noted this too and expressed concern that the offerings for the youngest eaters would set them up for a lifetime of poor eating habits Pediatricians should advise parents to limit the amount of juice they give their children and steer clear of sugarsweetened beverages and highcalorie snacks with little to no nutritional value they wrote The Bakers went so far as to suggest that parents cook from scratch instead of feeding their kids processed foods The data on sodium and sugar came from the   that appear on food packages These arent necessarily accurate because the US Food and Drug Administration allows the figures on the label to be off by as much as  the researchers noted
