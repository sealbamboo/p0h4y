Fecal transplants are gaining ground as a highly effective treatment for recurrent infection with the intestinal bacteria  But the yuck factor of the procedure continues to deter physicians from offering it to patients who could benefit said a practicing gastroenterologist who has come up with a solution to the problem a gelatin capsule filled with the highly compacted fecal matter of a patients family member There is no smell We basically have a little cubette of microbes and we pour it into the capsules said Dr Thomas Louie of the University of Calgary in Alberta Canada Louie said that so far he had treated  patients with a regimen of fecal transplant pills and all but one had suffered no recurrence of the stubborn and painful intestinal infection Louie reported on his innovation at the ID week meeting of infectious disease researchers and clinicians in San Francisco this week His report came against the backdrop of rising incidence of the infection largely among the hospitalized elderly and those with chronic diseases as well patients who take antibiotics As many as  patients a year in the United States suffer from chronic   infection and about  a year die of it Since  Louie said he had performed fecal transplants by enema in his office as a treatment for recurrent   But in  a light dawned on me I would turn it into pills he said To do so Louie would continue to solicit stool from a donor related to the patient and to subject that donor to a rigorous battery of tests ensuring against the transfer of bloodborne diseases or pathogens But instead of turning that stool into a slurry and then shooting it into a patients rectum he would filter the bulky undigested food from the mix distill the remaining community of bacteria and compact it by applying pressure as high as  times the force of gravity to the mix The resulting solids can then be poured into a gelatin tablet designed to dissolve slowly in a patients gut and begin to release its contents in the lower small bowel about an hour after they are taken Louie initially gave the pills to patients over four days at roughly  pills a day But as refined his treatment protocol he said patients had responded well to a single day of treatment in which they swallow a couple of dozen pills on an empty stomach and then go home and have lunch As the capsules contents begin to establish themselves in the bowels of patients who have often struggled with diarrhea and intestinal cramping for months the normal good bacterial outcompete the   Louie said Weve sort of reestablished diversity in the bowels so therell be thousands of bacteria in the gut and that keeps   under control Louie said he had had many requests to disseminate the process he used adding that had been entirely open about it As for the yuck factor that hangs over the highly effective treatment for recurrent   infection Louie called it something we got from the schoolyard when we were  or  But he added we need to get over it
