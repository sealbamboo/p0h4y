US President Barack Obama has said there is no excuse for the glitches that have plagued the rollout of an element of his  healthcare law  At the White House Mr Obama said that despite their problems the insurance enrolment websites were enabling people to sign up for affordable coverage Those attempting to sign up for health insurance have reported persistent issues since the  October rollout Mr Obama said a tech surge was under way to fix the snags The websites issues have been overshadowed by the recent partial government shutdown in which Republican lawmakers attempted to gut the law through budgetary brinkmanship In Mondays Rose Garden event Mr Obama conceded that  hasnt worked as smoothly as it was supposed to work The number of people whove visited the site has been overwhelming which has aggravated some of these underlying problems Mr Obama added Theres no sugar coating  the website has been too slow people have been getting stuck during the application process and I think its fair to say that nobodys more frustrated by that than I am  He said that notwithstanding the websites problems there was massive demand and the homepage had been visited nearly  million times since its launch Precisely because the product is good I want the cash registers to work I want the checkout lines to be smooth said Mr Obama And theres no excuse for the problems and these problems are getting fixed He was joined at Mondays event by people who have successfully enrolled during the first three weeks Janice Baker a Delaware business owner who was the first person in her state to enrol for coverage through the exchange website introduced Mr Obama She said she had a number of frustrating attempts to use the site but kept trying as she had been rejected from insurance plans previously because of a preexisting condition Ms Baker said she expected to save   a month with the policy she had signed up for on the exchange  The website is supposed to be a clearinghouse for uninsured Americans searching for medical coverage  The site acts both as a check on whether applications qualify for government subsidies for private insurance as well as being the first enrolment step for specific plans The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the exchanges will be the gateway for providing health coverage to an estimated seven million Americans during the first year  The White House has said almost half a million people have applied for healthcare through both federal and staterun exchanges since  October Exchanges run by individual states do not appear to have been plagued to the same extent by malfunctions White House officials initially blamed the glitches on the heavy volume of visits to the site but they recently conceded the flaws were larger and involved software and system design issues The Department of Health and Human Services which runs the exchanges   it had already begun to make improvements But the administration has offered few details on who was being brought in from outside the government and the specific causes of the ongoing glitches Passed in  the Affordable Care Act commonly known as Obamacare has rolled out in multiple steps including coverage requirements on insurance companies and future tax penalties for those who remain uninsured  Republicans unanimously oppose the law and have worked to undermine it since it was enacted  Republicanled state governments have used their authority to frustrate its implementation Republicans in Congress have repeatedly attempted to repeal the law or eliminate its funding most recently by refusing to pass a budget in an attempt to force Mr Obamas hand A subsequent day shutdown of the federal government ended with no major concessions from Mr Obama Obamacare costs too much and its not working the way they promised Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday  Its time for the president to consider delaying this rushed effort Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has also been criticised by Republican lawmakers for declining an invitation to testify about the snags on  October  But a spokeswoman for the health department said the secretary would testify at some point White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Monday there had been for many months and years now a concentrated concerted effort by critics of Obamacare to undermine it Theres clearly some joy being taken in some quarters by the experiences that some Americans have had frustrating experiences that theyve had in trying to get information about affordable health insurance Although the law remains divisive   suggests only  of the public favours a complete repeal
