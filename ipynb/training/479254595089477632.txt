Rise and shine, everyone. The middle of the week is upon us. Have heart, though. You made it this far, so why not hang on for another couple of days, yes? And what better way to make the time fly than to keep busy. So grab that cup of stimulation – our flavor today boasts the aroma of blueberries – and get started. Meanwhile, do keep us in mind if you hear anything interesting. Have a smashing day... Meanwhile, here are some doings… In a first for the pharmaceutical industry, the EU’s European Investment Bank has agreed to provide about $100 million to UCB to develop various drugs in return for milestone payments if the candidates progress. Despite denials, Cipla remains the subject of takeover speculation because it makes a juicy target. And Pfizer has signed a cancer immunotherapy deal with Cellectis that gives the big drug maker exclusive rights to develop products against 15 biological targets.
