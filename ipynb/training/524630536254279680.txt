This month reports have come out that Laurie Holden an actress from   TV show had volunteered to be part of a   in Colombia to entrap a local trafficker who sold girls as young as  into sex slavery Holdens job was to keep the girls distracted while the sting honchos were paying  and secretly filming  the trafficker Last week a British court awarded   to a deafmute Pakistani girl who was brought to England at age  or so and kept as a slave by a wealthy couple in Salford and repeatedly raped for nine years  an American activist in Kenya is currently speaking out about the practice of enslaving children in Nairobi brothels These three stories help prove Andrea Matolcsis point Shes the trafficking officer for   a global organization that fights for the rights of women and girls She says that trafficking in humans for sexual exploitation and other reasons really is happening in every single country The victims are often seeking to escape poverty The result is an industry that generates yearly illegal profits of  according to an International Labor Organization report Matolcsi spoke with Goats and Soda to give some perspective on the issue It takes various forms of exploitation for labor for organs to be harvested for forced criminality and begging At Equality Now we focus on sexual exploitation Thats prostitution but also pornography and lap dancing various parts of the sex industry Its where organized crime generally takes victims from poorer countries to betteroff countries People in betteroff countries have the money to pay for them And theres a demand for them in the sex industry If there were not very very many people  the overwhelming majority of them men  paying for sex with women and girls and boys there wouldnt be demand for them Trafficking wouldnt be so profitable It would generally be what we think of as the Mafia  at least that is the situation in Europe The Taliban also buys and sells women and girls as have ISIS and Boko Haram Yes we are aware the Taliban is engaging in sex trafficking It is possible they are engaging in other forms of trafficking as well India Thailand the Philippines I would say the traffickers there are mainly locals But again this is something that happens all over the world American kids from a neglected household or in foster care are vulnerable to exploitation Theres little oversight I think for global figures youre looking at millions If you look at one country look at the United Kingdom The authorities recognize a couple thousand victims But figures are very tricky Its an illegal activity and hard to get figures on Authorities do have difficulty identifying victims If someone is kept indoors its more difficult to identify them than individuals in street prostitution There are various routes One could just be deception Sometimes adults and young people are told theyll be given a job in another country in a caf or restaurant and theyre forced into prostitution It could be with threats against their family Sometimes theres an initiation by rape They rape the victim until the victim is not resisting any more Or the trafficker could say How else are you going to feed your family Poverty and economic coercion are very powerful You dont have to be chained to a radiator to become a sex slave Pimps can sometimes begin what looks like a romantic relationship with a woman and get her to go abroad or to another city in her country and say For our common future we need a bit of money will you do this for me once or twice And it turns into months and years Were advocating for what we call the Swedish or the Nordic model Its a set of laws and policies that decriminalizes people in prostitution but criminalizes the purchase of sex The police must look for victims   perpetrators And the Swedish model mandates services for people in prostitution They are people with very complex needs They have issues around housing trauma drug addiction The reason people think they can get away with this is that they can Theres a feeling this is a highprofit lowrisk endeavor The more they see a clampdown  a trafficker given  years not just a twoyear sentence  that will act more and more as a deterrent One great activist is Rachel Moran from Ireland whos written a book called   Theres a myth that the men driving this industry of paying for sex are lonely alcoholic men who dont have access to sex She talked about how many times shes been in a car and theres a baby seat in the back Half of men who pay for sex do have partners When buyers call up the first question is Whats the youngest girl they can give me Theyre not talking  Theyre talking    Rachel and others have recounted experiences where if they would say their age and it would be  or  that would make the guy finish much quicker No it was a turnon that she was a child
