 Until now scientists could only identify a sign of brain damage  called tau protein tangles  during an autopsy Considered a hallmark of Alzheimers disease tau tangles also occur in a devastating brain condition caused by head trauma In a new study researchers describe how they pinpointed signs of tau in five former National Football League players who are still alive The issue of sportsrelated concussions and brain injury in athletes would enable doctors to alert players to the possibility of devastating longterm damage before it occurs For the new study researchers gave the explayers a radioactive chemical that binds to tau tangles in the brain so that affected areas light up on PET scan imaging tests All the players had high signals in the brain in areas that other studies of autopsy in chronic traumatic encephalopathy patients have found high concentrations of tau said lead study author Dr Gary Small a professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the University of California Los Angeles Seau who died by suicide last May at age  was found to have tau tangles in his brain during an autopsy according to a Jan  statement from the US National Institutes of Health The NIH concluded that he had suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy a condition associated with   The new UCLA study appears online Jan  in the   Because of the studys small size and design its far from definitive and will have to be verified by more extensive research Small noted The study participants who included a linebacker a quarterback a guard a center and a defensive lineman were what we call a convenience sample Small said We reached out to contact the NFL players association and other groups to find individuals who had cognitive thinking or mood symptoms All the players had suffered at least one concussion and had symptoms including depression dementia and problems with memory and thinking ability One of the five players who is in his s just has signs of normal aging Small said All the study participants received an intravenous injection of a radioactive chemical called FDDNP which binds to tau protein in the brain UCLA holds a patent on FDDNP Its a very small chemical that has a radioactive label attached to it and the PET scanner acts as Geiger counter and measures its radioactivity Small explained Dr Howard Derman medical director of the Methodist Concussion CenterNantz National Alzheimers Center in Houston who was not involved in the study discussed the implications of the new research At present he said In terms of what we can do for patients its not much We can use more sophisticated imaging We use PET scanning all the time but PET scanning with an isotope that binds to brain plaque and tangles  its the isotope that adds a new dimension Derman said that if proven to work by further research the method might be useful to give athletes guidance If you took an athlete and followed him sequentially after   you might want to say its time to think about retiring Im more than cautiously optimistic  but its only five players Derman said Study author Small said that theres a lot of overlap between Alzheimers disease brain aging and traumatic brain injury We know NFL players have a fourfold greater likelihood of dying from Alzheimers disease than people in the general population He said the ability to detect tau in living players offers us the hope that we can identify individuals before theres a lot of symptoms and try to protect the healthy brain rather than try to repair damage once its done However with little effective treatment available to treat Alzheimers the value of having that early knowledge might be unclear While were waiting for science to catch up weve done a lot of research in the area of healthy lifestyles to protect the brain  physical and aerobic conditioning proper diet stress management Small said For people with memory problems learning ways to compensate for their cognitive decline is very important
