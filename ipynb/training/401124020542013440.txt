What does it mean to be enrolled in Obamacare? The administration says nearly 27,000 people signed up for coverage through HealthCare.gov in the first month. But that number includes people who picked a plan but haven't made a payment yet. The insurance industry says someone is enrolled only after the first premium payment. Using that standard, the enrollment numbers would be even lower. But the law's defenders say it's unrealistic to expect enrollees to pay three months before their coverage begins.
