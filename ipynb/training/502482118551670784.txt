Richard Dawkins the atheist writer has caused a stir on Twitter claiming it is immoral to allow unborn babies with Downs syndrome to live But what do the relatives of people with Downs syndrome think about the comments The Oxford professor posted the message on Twitter in response to a user who wrote she would be faced with a real ethical dilemma if she became pregnant and learned that the baby would be born with Downs syndrome Abort it and try again Dawkins tweeted in reply It would be immoral to bring it into the world if you have the choice  His comments have caused anger online and have been dismissed by charities but he insists his views are very civilised tweeting These are fetuses diagnosed before they have human feelings  For Caroline White   the comments are offensive What saddens me most and what cant be denied is he backs up his argument by saying its what the majority of women do anyway she says Yes it is Its what most women do Women who like him like me most probably grew up in a time of exclusion A time where disabled people and people with Downs were labelled and then hidden away never given the chance to integrate reach their full potential or form meaningful relationships with their wider community  Dawkins defended his comments on the social media website saying I do not for one moment apologise for approaching moral philosophic questions in a logical way Theres a place for emotion  this isnt it In a   that his posts may have offended those who know and love someone with Downs syndrome stating that he has sympathy for those who thought he was saying that their loved one had no right to exist  I would never dream of saying to any person you should have been aborted before you were born he writes   But for many especially the relatives of people with Downs syndrome the comments have caused anger and upset One mother who has a child with the genetic condition wrote  I would fight till my last breath for the life of my son No dilemma And another user tweeted What do we do when were all physically and mentally perfect Congratulate ourselves on eradicating the need to help each other For Anthony Ozimic communications manager of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children SPUC Dawkinss comments raise the argument about when human life begins All unborn children whether disabled or not are equal members of the human family and therefore have an equal right to life with the rest of humanity he says As a scientist Dawkins should know better than to deny that human life begins at conception As a former foetus I am against abortion in all circumstances But in a subsequent blog post outlining what he meant by his tweets Dawkins writes that he supports those philosophers who say that an adult a child and a baby should all be granted the rights of a person An early fetus before it develops a nervous system should not he concludes     For Caroline White who wants attitudes to change towards Downs syndrome she says she is relieved and happy that she didnt know Seb had the condition when he was born  I cannot imagine my life without Seb she says He breathes so much energy into our typical family But I only know that now now that I have him now that I know him I could never have known this when I was pregnant having never met anybody with Downs and my mind full of outdated stereotypes
