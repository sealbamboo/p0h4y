A large review of studies concludes that taking iron supplements during pregnancy reduces the risk for maternal anemia and for having a baby with low birth weight The   involving almost two million subjects Some of the studies tested iron alone and others iron in combination with folic acid which is routinely used to reduce the risk for birth defects Over all the researchers found a significant inverse relationship between the dose of iron and the risk for maternal anemia in the third trimester For every increase of  milligrams of iron up to  milligrams there was a  percent decrease in the risk for anemia In addition in  trials of iron against placebo the use of iron was associated with a birth weight increase of one and a half ounces on average But there was no evidence for an association of iron supplements with preterm birth or duration of gestation The review was published in the journal BMJ The authors write that the results should be interpreted with caution because of variations in the studies methods Still the lead author Batool A Haider a doctoral candidate at the Harvard School of Public Health said If a mother is found to have anemia during pregnancy she should be advised to take iron supplements and she should take them regularly
