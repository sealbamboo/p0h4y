OMAHA  Mom is doing makeup for the opera and Dad tags along Beverly Sills has been brought in for the role of Lucia di Lammermoor and she has packed the house Mom draws wrinkles on a tenor while Ms Sills is called to the stage The page is growing urgent Shell miss her entrance if she doesnt show up soon A crew member blows by and says they found her in the green room apparently smitten to the point of distraction by a big strapping cowboy my father   Mom would scold later on their drive home He went to the opera with her for years and even though he dreaded it  the horrible seats the suit and tie the story he couldnt understand  he never let on Except to us kids When they announced that they were headed to the opera he would make a face as if he were about to undergo a spinal tap But to her he remained willing enthusiastic even It was one of the things I loved most about their love the emotional concessions they made I will not only go to the opera with you but I will be happy about it so that your joy can flow uninterrupted  A year before he dies Mom goes to the opera with an old friend and I stay home with Dad We dont leave him alone anymore Without Mom hes terrified  Mom around here somewhere he asks I tell him shes at the opera He looks at the window then back at me Is Mom around Its a beautiful evening and I ask him to walk outside with me We look at the yellow rose bush the bleeding heart and the rhododendron His face lights up Look at that he says over and over Isnt that real pretty He bends over the irises as uncertain as if he were on a cliff leaning out to retrieve a balloon Did you see this one here he asks  When he was well and we kids would show him something interesting or beautiful his famous question was always What does it do And we would say Oh Dad it doesnt   anything Its just beautiful  Now he is as intoxicated by this old garden as someone who has never seen a flower in his life He doesnt lock up in the face of beauty He doesnt repeat get stuck in a loop He doesnt ask where he is Sometimes I think if I could always have beauty on hand for him he might be OK  I understand getting stuck Lately Ive been unable to sleep Im sober but I dont feel like being sober anymore doing the work of it Nor do I feel like doing the work of being an addict I circle around this neural cage for hours  I cant know what his mind feels like but I keep trying to understand how it operates Ive seen images of brains with Alzheimers  the frazzled neurons the motheaten hemispheres  and I cant imagine trying to think react and remember in this decimated geography  Beauty pulls him into a brand new place Beauty doesnt require you to remember it doesnt even require you to be you  We walk around the house to the front and I show him the peonies pink and white obscenely luscious He looks at them and nods He looks out at the street at the cars speeding by He looks over at the neighbors house at a car full of young men in the driveway with their windows down the bass so loud it rattles our screen door I show him the hydrangea He nods without looking at it Im losing him I can tell Lets sit down I say He does tentatively still the reluctant good sport He and Mom have sat on this porch for decades but without her every move he makes even this appears foreign and halting The chair is uncomfortable to him he sits awkwardly on the edge He looks at the men in the driveway next door he looks at the traffic moving too fast He is at the opera and he doesnt understand the story I point to the huge American chestnut in our front yard and tell him there used to be a swing on that branch that it had been my favorite place that he had hung it there He looks up at the branch I expect he says as though it sounds like a reasonable fatherly thing to do He tests his memory more against probability than against the actual contents of his mind The question is no longer whether he remembers but whether something seems plausible  Have you been inside he asks I look at him and try to think fast There are answers that comfort and answers that increase his confusion Im aware Im taking too much time Yes I say Have they kept the place up he asks interested Yes Its great I tell him Lots of room Woodwork I suddenly run out of things to say You know anything about the people who live here My routine strategy is to go along with whatever narrative hes stumbled upon but there comes a point when that tactic can create a new knot of confusion You live here I tell him With Mom He looks at me as if I havent yet answered the question Youve been here lets see  years The tone I have chosen is Isnt that an interesting fact Im careful to siphon out any bit of surprise anything that smacks of youshouldknowthis I know he absorbs tone if not information My fathers sense of safety in this moment rests on my ability to absorb my sadness my surprise and sound as if everything is fine  Have you been inside he asks again  When he was well his brain ticked along incessantly always hooked into a problem real or invented On holidays when even Dad was required to go to church he would sit there and count things  rafters fixtures tiles pews statues people  and on the walk home give a full accounting Mom would listen to him smile and then raise her eyebrows at us kids as if to say Well isnt that impressive  I dont recognize his mind now I dont know where it goes how it works  but I have to try to figure it out So that I can help him feel peace So that I can help us both  He wakes up in the middle of the night and wants to go home Its his greatest desire day after day to go home Its no comfort that he is home He cant trust this because what he sees around him no longer corresponds to his memories Home is certainty a fixed point where in the brutal tide of entropy nothing changes Without memory there is no home  At the end of my drinking I longed for home and felt it nowhere because I had no home inside myself The only certainty I had then was that I could not stop drinking when I started I could dance sing have sex And I could count on the holes in my memory the next day I lay in bed aching and parched with the terrible awareness that whole hours had slid into these black holes like rainwater into the gutter And all the answers I wanted went the way of the hours Where did I leave my car What happened last night  The cat greets us at the door Hey kitty Dad says and I feel a small flood of relief I find a nature program on television and we sit down to watch I need a break He loves the vibrant green leaf filling the screen and he loves the little green worm that the leaf has trapped with its invisible sticky hairs Weve watched programs like this together for as long as I can remember me with equal parts fascination and terror For every gazelle leaping expertly across a plain theres a weak one getting picked off by a lion When I got upset Dad would say Its just nature Bec Natures a bitch This was his version of comfort I know he believed that if I could master my emotional responses I could do anything Instead I showed great promise for being overly sensitive prone to weeping Nothing like him Now we are watching a slowmoving water buffalo surrounded by Komodo dragons They are circling in Its hard to tell if the water buffalo is clueless paralyzed or indifferent to whats coming The four dragons wait watch advance with fluid precision  Just as the water buffalo is about to get the business as Dad would say he turns to me perhaps to deliver the natureisabitch lesson again Instead he says You know anything about the people who live here I dont I tell him I used to
