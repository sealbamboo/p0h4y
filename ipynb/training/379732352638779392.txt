An inspection at the Chobani plant linked to a recall of moldy yogurt and more than  consumer complaints yielded no report of significant objections federal health officials said Monday  Food and Drug Administration inspectors visited the Twin Falls Idaho production site on Sept  but did not issue whats known as an FDA Form  an official documentation of problems that could lead to harm  But that doesnt mean the case is closed more than two weeks after the Greek yogurt maker issued a nationwide recall because some retail cartons were bulging bubbling and spoiled and some consumers said it made them sick  FDAs investigation in the Chobani Greek yogurt recall is still ongoing and the agency cannot provide specific details at this time FDA spokeswoman Tamara Ward said in an email to NBC News  As of Monday FDA had received  complaints from consumers associated with Chobani yogurt including reports of cramps nausea headache and diarrhea after eating the recalled yogurt Ward said However that reflects only filed reports and does not mean that the product actually caused any illnesses the FDA says  Chobani officials have said that they detected the mold Mucor circinelloides in samples of yogurt The mold typically causes spoilage in plants but doesnt pose harm to most people except those with compromised immune systems food safety experts said  Don Schaffner a professor of food science at Rutgers University told NBC News that fruit could have been the culprit  Im guessing the source may have been a fruit filling that let the organism into the plant and then poor sanitation allowed it to spread to the implicated products he wrote in an email to NBC News  A spokeswoman for Chobani Amy Juaristi didnt respond to questions about the fruit filling but said that the company was working hard to clear up the problem after the Sept  recall That came about a week after the company launched a voluntary withdrawal to pull products off retail shelves nationwide  We identified the specific line at our Idaho plant where we discovered the issue and increased our already stringent quality assurance procedures including sanitation she told NBC News in an email We are working closely with our suppliers and have taken corrective actions designed to prevent this issue from happening again  FDA typically issues written inspection reports called Form s when there are significant observations that any food drug device or cosmetic may have been adulterated or are being prepared packed or held under conditions in which they may become adulterated or harm human health  Lessserious observations are not listed on a Form  but are discussed with a firms management so that they understand how uncorrected problems could become violations Ward saidÂ
