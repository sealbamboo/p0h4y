Official serving sizes are finally catching up with modern eating habits A ounce soft drink would now be a single serving and so would a whole cup of ice cream under a major revamp of the familiar food label being released Thursday Federal health officials are proposing the first changes to food labels in more than  years and they plan to bow to the reality that Americans do indeed guzzle down those giant bottles of soda in one go and that half a cup of ice cream just plain doesnt cut it We have a right to understand whats in the food were feeding our families first lady Michelle Obama said Thursday at the White House You as a parent and as a consumer should be able to walk into a grocery store pick an item off the shelf and tell whether its good for your family By law the label information on serving sizes must be based on what people actually eat not on what they should be eating the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement Administration officials say about half of Americans really try to use the food labels and its only fair to tell them how many calories are in a container not just how many are in a notional serving For certain packages that are larger and could be consumed in one sitting or multiple sittings manufacturers would have to provide dual column labels to indicate bothper serving and per package calories and nutrient information FDA says Examples would be a ounce bottle of soda or a pint of ice cream This way people would be able to easily understand how many calories and nutrients they are getting if they eat or drink the entire package at one time Theyll also reflect changes in thinking about what makes us fat  with less emphasis on total fat and more on overall calories The FDA also proposes making food companies put clearly on the label whether theres added sugar in a product And the calorie count will show up in really big font The goal is to address the obesity epidemic With twothirds of Americans overweight or obese its time to help people realize more clearly what they are putting into their mouths Obama administration officials say The changes are being announced as part of the fourth anniversary of Mrs Obamas Lets Move initiative So this is a big deal and its going to make a big difference for families all across this country she said The new proposed label would make the calorie and serving sizes more prominent and it would swap out details on how much vitamin A and B a product has in it instead requiring levels of vitamin D and potassium which are important to control blood pressure for bone heath and for a strong immune system Iron and calcium will still be listed The administration estimates the total cost to the food industry would be  billion Theres no timetable for the changes to take effect A day public comment period opens Thursday Officials said any changes would be phased in gradually The new labels will reflect the latest science While in the s fat was blamed for making people fat studies published since then have made it clear that sugar and other processed carbohydrates are just as much to blame While continuing to require Total Fat Saturated Fat and Trans Fat on the label Calories from Fat would be removed because research shows the type of fat is more important than the amount the FDA said Some things wont change The calorie percentage will still be based on a recommended  calories per day diet And some serving sizes will shrink Yogurt is labeled to reflect an  ounce serving but most people eat it in ounce cups so the labels will show that For  years consumers have come to rely on the iconic nutrition label to help them make healthier food choices said FDA commissioner Dr Margaret Hamburg To remain relevant the FDAs newly proposed Nutrition Facts label incorporates the latest in nutrition science as more has been learned about the connection between what we eat and the development of serious chronic diseases impacting millions of Americans
