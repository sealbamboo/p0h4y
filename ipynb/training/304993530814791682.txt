Its a moment many parents dread  sitting down to talk with their kid about drugs What should they say Will the conversation have any effect And should they mention their own youthful indiscretions Parents can get advice from the family doctor or pediatrician and places like the   formerly the Partnership for a DrugFree America though theres not been much evidence to back up the recommendations Weve been going on what we think is the best says   an assistant professor of communication at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign A survey of middle school students conducted by Kam and a colleague finds that these conversations are indeed worth having But how parents address their own past drug use might be having unintended effects When it comes to addressing their past parents shouldnt lie But use of drugs isnt something they should volunteer either Kam says She draws that conclusion from the survey of  sixth seventh and eighthgraders in Illinois Kids who said their parents had talked to them about drugs were more likely to have antidrug attitudes But those who parents conversations had included their own past drug use were more likely to say that using drugs wasnt such a big deal The   appears in  There could be explanations for it Kam says Kids might be interpreting it as Mom and Dad used and theyre still here  Those children might think that their parents wont disapprove too much if they also give illicit drugs a try The findings didnt surprise Dr Sharon Levy director of the   at Boston Childrens Hospital It really works when parents talk to their kids about substance use she says But they need to be clear In my clinical experience a lot of times kids are really confused about their parents advice about substance abuse What makes a difference I would encourage parents to clearly tell their kids they dont approve of using and that there are consequences Kam says She recommends advising children on how to avoid offers of illicit substances establishing family rules and talking about other people who got in trouble from using And having just one big talk about drugs is probably not the best way to approach the subject Kam says She recommends making the antidrug message the topic of an ongoing conversation that can be carried out in casual circumstances like in the car The conversations should start as early as fifth grade before the child is likely to get offered drugs or alcohol or cigarettes says Tom Hedrick senior program officer and founding member of the Partnership at Drugfreeorg The earlier kids first try these substances the more likely they are to run into trouble Early intervention can head off serious addiction down the road he says And if a child asks about a parents past he says the parents should remember that its not about them its not about what they did Levy says parents should emphasize why you think your kids shouldnt try  even if you did And they shouldnt feel hypocritical for not disclosing all the details Its fine to have your opinion change over the years to say youve made mistakes in the past she says
