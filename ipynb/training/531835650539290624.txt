
 American women face conflicting advice about whether to be screened for breast cancer at what age and how often The decisions they make are often more strongly influenced by fear or a friends experience than by a thorough understanding of the benefits and risks of mammography In  the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women  to    and that biennial screening of women younger than  be considered case by case There is no good evidence on whether women older than  should be screened the task force said Yet screening rates have not declined Under the Affordable Care Act free screening mammography is available to all women every one to two years But is this really free in the fullest sense of the word Many experts cite hidden costs  financial medical and emotional Before deciding to have a mammogram  every year every two years starting at  or  or not at all  you should consider the possible risks and whether they are outweighed by the expected benefits Full disclosure Fifteen years ago a sonogram revealed an early invasive cancer in my left breast The cancer was not seen on the mammogram but had I not gone for one that sonogram would not have been done to see why I had pain in my breast There is no way to know whether my cancer would have disappeared or would have eventually claimed my life but once I knew it was there a decision to have it removed was inescapable Despite the controversy about annual mammograms I still advocate them But it behooves every woman to be aware of the arguments for and against annual screening Too few are equipped to evaluate what Dr Lisa Rosenbaum a national correspondent for The New England Journal of Medicine   considerable uncertainty and complex tradeoffs Although expert groups have issued guidelines based on reviews of the scientific evidence disagreements among them persist the result of differing professional perspectives financial concerns and assessments of the medical consequences Despite the task force guideline the   the American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging continue to recommend yearly mammograms starting at  for women at average risk for breast cancer The college maintains that screening   since  though advances in treatment have certainly played a role But a recent review of the available evidence by researchers at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston suggested that regular screening   So what are the downsides of regular screening A falsepositive result  a suspicious image on mammography that turns out to be nothing  is a major one If a yearold woman is screened annually for a decade she has   somewhere along the way according to Dr H Gilbert Welch and Honor J Passow of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice The woman receiving a falsepositive diagnosis may need only a repeat examination which may show the initial result to have been wrong But if that too looks suspicious a biopsy must be done which happens to  percent of women screened The lesion might turn out to be benign still the patient has endured considerable anxiety inconvenience and expense And what if the biopsy reveals a malignancy Then the patient faces another possible consequence of screening overtreatment There are lingering questions about whether every cancer detected really warrants treatment and how extensive the treatment should be Some cancers dont progress some may even disappear on their own and others may grow so slowly they would not become a problem during the remaining years of life But doctors cannot tell with certainty which cancers are safe to leave untreated Dr Rosenbaum cited a survey in which more than  percent of women knew mammography could result in a falsepositive diagnosis but only  percent   Even among those who had a falsepositive result more than  percent still believed that mammography could not harm a woman who ended up not having breast cancer she said The seemly contradictory responses are part of the tangled nature of emotions and values that women bring to mammography Dr Rosenbaum wrote One study of women in their s found that advising them to delay screening until they were  only strengthened their desire for screening Some believed the task force guideline was an attempt to lower insurance costs and   Decisions relating to breast cancer are often based more on emotion than reasoning Unrelenting publicity by wellmeaning organizations has frightened many women who are inclined to accept more risk than they might in say screenings for heart disease  which actually kills more women than breast cancer And too many have seen firsthand the devastation breast cancer can wreak Breast cancer remains the most common cancer among women and the secondleading cause of cancer deaths among women many of them in the prime of life Clinicians often struggle to balance their responsibility to base recommendations on evidence with their respect for what patients want Defaulting to patient preference in the face of uncertainty has become the moral high ground Dr Rosenbaum wrote But it is as much our job to figure out how to best help our patients lead healthier lives as it is to honor their preferences To which I would add It is the job of patients at least to consider the risks before deciding to be screened whether for breast cancer prostate cancer or colon cancer
