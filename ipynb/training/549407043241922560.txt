Sometimes it comes from excess air trapped in your digestive tract Other times it feels like a basketball is stuck in your abdomen or your entire midsection has been flooded with water Whatever   feels like to you one things for sure its uncomfortable And though bloat rarely signals something serious and typically goes away after several hours eased up by moving around drinking water and just waiting it out a distended middle can make you feel lethargic clumsy and suspecting youll never be able to button your jeans again Welcome back your   by saying goodbye the habits that are prone to puff you up The pace of life has us all in a hurry but if that leaves you wolfing down your meals be warned besides food youre also swallowing gasproducing air which   Trapped air isnt the only bloat trigger here When you eat in a rush you dont chew thoroughly and that leads to larger food pieces sitting in your gut waiting to be fully digested explains New York City nutritionist Stephanie Middleberg RD of Middleberg Nutrition Another speedeating danger you lose track of how much youre consuming and stuffing yourself makes your stomach feel well stuffed Instead of eating on the run carve out at least  minutes for a slower sitdown meal Thats how long it takes your brain to register fullness signaling that its time to put your fork down so you dont overdo it Even the healthiest sammies tend to be   A recent USDA study discovered that the sodium content in the typical sandwich can chew up  of your sodium allowance says Janet Brill PhD RD a Philadelphiaarea nutritionist and author of   And a  CDC study listed the top sodiumloaded foods many of which were sandwich staples Bread and rolls ranked as the numberone source of sodium in the typical American diet and deli meat was number two with cheese not far behind says Brill The CDC recommends keeping sodium intake under  mg and you can stay within that number and prevent sodiuminduced bloat by alternating your sandwich habit with other foods or forgoing the bread and wrapping it a crisp piece of romaine lettuce Packed with essential vitamins kale has a welldeserved reputation as a trendy salad superstar Thing is this cruciferous vegetable contains so much hardtobreakdown fiber and an indigestible sugar called raffinose that consuming it raw in a smoothie or salad may bring on gas and puffiness says Middleberg Kale is not the only veggie offender other cruciferous greens like Brussels sprouts and broccoli have the same effect Cut down on the bloating by eating less kale and   you do eat by steaming or roasting it suggests Middleberg You still get the nutrients but cooking helps soften the fiber and shrink the volume of kale you consume so it doesnt take up so much gutbusting room in your small intestines Coffee beverages  these days all kinds of adultfriendly drinks are designed to be sipped through a straw But as convenient as straws are they force you to suck in lots of extra air and that makes you feel like an inflatable ball says Middleberg It doesnt make a difference how slowly or deeply you sip youre taking in the air already trapped in the upper part of the straw and its impossible to avoid Whenever you can sip your drinks from the rim of the glass Once again the culprit here is sodiumits used as a preservative for tons of processed convenience foods You know that crackers and chips are sodium bombs but even healthylooking items such as soups salad dressings cereals and tomato sauce can have crazyhigh amounts of sodium that easily lead you to exceed the  mg daily recommended limit Read more about   Its a good bet that pretty much any product that comes wrapped in a package contains more sodium than youd think and youre unlikely to even taste the salt says Brill Dodge the bellybloating effects by reading labels and going for packaged foods that contain less than  mg per serving And of course try to cut back on the processed stuff and fill your plate with naturally lowsodium or sodiumfree fresh fruits grains and veggies  such as aspartame and sucralose have been added to everything from diet beverages to gum and candy But the low or no calories come at a cost While the FDA has recognized zerocal sugar substitutes as safe theyre serious bloat inducers Artificial sweeteners hang around your stomach a long time because your system doesnt digest them well or at all Makes sense considering that they contain nothing your system recognizes as actual food says Middleberg Banish them from your diet and youll feel instant relief she says The same tiny bubbles that give soda and sparkling water that bubbly sensation also cause your stomach to swell says Middleberg Diet soda is an even worse belly bloater since artificial sweeteners cant be digested Check out these   Really cant live without you fizz fix Cut down on the carbonation by leaving it open for a few hours before drinking it or by pouring the drink into a cup with ice cubes Kidney pinto black redbeans plus their legume cousins lentils and chickpeas are an awesome source of highquality plant protein Unfortunately the carbohydrates in   tend to be indigestible and thats what gives them their gassy bellybloating reputation says Brill Thing is beans boost the health of so many dishes from chili to soup to burritos that it would be a nutritional crime to dump them out of your diet entirely The solution take an overthecounter antigas product such as Beano along with your beans These contain the enzyme were missing that makes the carbohydrates digestible says Brill Its safe to take and it prevents the uncomfortable puffy feeling Gum and hard candy keep your mouth occupied which can help you lose weight or quit smoking But they too cause you to inadvertently gulp lots of excess air And as with using a straw and eating too fast excessive air can lead to belching and that beached whale feeling Try giving up the gum and suckers and instead take frequent sips of waterthat will keep your mouth busy too Theres a bonus to HO as well plain water helps keep your GI tract moving and that gets rid of excess air and water bloating out your system explains Alissa Rumsey RD a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics If you eat a   within an hour or two of hitting the sack youre setting yourself up for morning muffin top Lying down impairs digestion so if you hit the bed with food in your stomach it wont be broken down as quickly leaving you bloated in the am says Rumsey Its not always easy to shift your schedule but try having supper at least three to four hours before turning in for the night Stay on your feet as much as possible to keep things moving before you fall asleep If you have no choice but to eat right before bedtime make it something small like a piece of fruit or yogurt and refuel with a bigger meal at breakfast when your metabolism is running high again and your body will benefit from the energy jolt Despite all the attention   score these days glutenfree mania anyone most of us arent affected by them Still some allergies and sensitivities are a littleknown reason for belly expansion People with a wheat allergy who cant digest gluten often deal with digestive issues and bloating and if youre lactose intolerant youll also experience lots of distention and discomfort says Rumsey If you find yourself frequently feeling like a bowling ball and none of these other factors seem to be the cause check in with your doctor and ask to be tested for food allergies and sensitivities
