
 Three springs ago Joe Ciriano was living in a fog He had just lost his wife of  years to   He was now the sole parent of a son and three daughters one with   The children ages  through  all had different needs and levels of understanding Mr Ciriano  an accounts manager in Burlington NC was riddled with doubts about his ability to carry on as a single parent and was struggling to keep his head above water While deeply mourning his wife he was unsure of how good a parent he could be What is normal he wondered What should he say to the kids about their mother How should he treat them Could he handle his family and do his job With no one to share daytoday family responsibilities and decisions and to help fill both his and his childrens emotional and physical needs life felt overwhelming Mr Ciriano said in an interview Then something wonderful happened He and Karl Owen a yearold software engineer from Chapel Hill whose wife had died of lung   three weeks after Mr Cirianos were asked to form a support group for fathers widowed by cancer who had children at home At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Dr Donald Lee Rosenstein a psychiatrist and Justin Michael Yopp a psychologist werent sure how openly these men would talk about their feelings and struggles But the researchers saw a pressing need to help them and their children through this trying life experience Too often theyd found widowed fathers contend with social and emotional isolation  a profound aloneness  and suffer in silence Im not a supportgroup kind of guy who wants to talk about touchyfeely kinds of things Mr Ciriano said But finding himself lost at sea he was willing to give it a try The   The eight widowed fathers who formed the core group led by a professional facilitator quickly learned that their feelings doubts and concerns were shared by all and offered one another insights and suggestions on how to cope All the men were exhausted and suffering a crisis in confidence fearful of screwing things up Dr Rosenstein said They faced countless daily issues  school problems struggles with discipline bed times expectations and a tendency to let things slide a little which really doesnt work well for kids Mr Owen said in an interview A lot of things that seemed abnormal in our lives were common to the other guys in the group Someone would bring up a situation and the rest of us would nod Yeah me too These issues were very difficult to discuss with friends who hadnt been through a similar experience said the father of two children who were  and  when their mother died We were all in a place in our lives we hadnt prepared for he said and collectively we could share experiences and help each other navigate Participants in the group developed a remarkable bond a level of friendship and sharing that is rare among men who even now are expected to be strong and resilient and many of whom still avoid talking about deep feelings and doubts Three years later four of the men continue to meet monthly and have benefited so much from the experience that they are reaching out to help other fathers newly widowed by cancer Meanwhile Dr Rosenstein and Dr Yopp who said they could find no similar support groups for widowed fathers are trying to get others started at cancer centers around the country They would like to conduct a formal study to determine what is most helpful and what isnt to these men Dr Yopp said in an interview Ideally he said every major cancer center would have a support group for widowed fathers whose experiences and needs are different from those of widowed women and older men More information about how the group works can be found at   Cancer is responsible for more widowed fathers than any other cause of death Dr Rosenstein and Dr Yopp noted in   An estimated  children are living with widowed fathers in the United States and the trauma of losing a mother at a young age can seriously disrupt a familys structure and the childrens development sometimes with lifelong consequences they wrote There is a pressing need to understand the experiences of these widowed fathers and to develop supportive interventions for them and their children they said I can attest to the value of such support I was  and my brother was  when our mother died of cancer in  leaving my father emotionally physically and financially drained by her yearlong illness To stay afloat he worked two jobs and had little time to enforce routines and discipline at home I soon departed for college and my brother was left to cope on his own with the devastating loss of our mother at so vulnerable an age Men traditionally do not play the role of the more nurturing parent therefore as widowed parents fathers may be less likely to employ childcentric or nurturing parenting styles and more likely to feel unprepared than widowed mothers Dr Yopp and Dr Rosenstein wrote They said various studies had found a clear link between the   of the surviving parent and the adjustment of the parentally bereaved child A major issue for widowed fathers Dr Rosenstein said is providing parental consistency with love and understanding Good parenting requires structure clear expectations welldefined limits and reasonable consequences What Ive seen happen a lot is the former family order melts away and no new order is put in place the psychiatrist said This can be tough for kids who feel cared for when there are limits and consistent discipline The trauma of a young mothers protracted death from cancer can be exacerbated by the patients understandable wish to live as long as possible for her family Dr Rosenstein added These women often choose aggressive therapy until the bitter end missing the comforts of   and the opportunity to express their love wisdom and wishes for the family In an online survey conducted by the two researchers nearly half of  widowed fathers said their wives had had no chance to say goodbye to their children
