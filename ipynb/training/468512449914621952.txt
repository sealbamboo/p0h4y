Suicide remains a leading cause of death in the United States especially among teenagers and young adults Anything that could reduce the toll would be good But asking everyone who goes to the doctor if he is considering suicide isnt the answer according to a federal panel that evaluated the effectiveness of existing screening tools for suicide They found there wasnt enough evidence to know whether screening the general public helps or hurts That doesnt mean doctors shouldnt be paying attention to   the US Preventive Services Task Force said Monday Instead the panel said that primary care providers need to be paying attention to people with symptoms of depression and other mental illnesses as well as people who were recently released from a psychiatric hospital or tried to hurt themselves Recent evidence suggests that interventions during these highrisk periods are effective in reducing suicide deaths the panel concluded The recommendation was   in   About  people die of suicide in the United States each year Theyre not saying dont assess says Jilly HarkavyFriedman a clinical psychologist and vice president for research at the   a grassroots group with local chapters They do make a point of saying its important to do an assessment if theres any suggestion of risk whatsoever Primary care physicians are supposed to screen for depression and many medical societies including the American Academy of Pediatrics tell their members to ask a patient if he is contemplating suicide But many primary care doctors dont have much training in mental health and substance abuse and may feel that they dont have counseling services to recommend They feel in a bind because someone is at risk of suicide but they dont have the staff to reach out to them says Julie Goldstein Grument director of prevention and practice for the   Training doctors to recognize warning signs and providing access to mental health services can lower suicide rates HarkavyFriedman told Shots But research on that is in its infancy Its really important to understand that asking someone if theyre thinking about suicide is not going to make them suicidal HarkavyFriedman says If anything its going to make them feel better because they dont have to go it alone Thats why primary care providers asking about it is an important step regardless of if theyre mandated to ask every single person Friends and family members can be lifesavers Grument says If youre concerned about someone you should always seek to get them help You should feel comfortable to ask them directly if theyre having thoughts of suicide That may be as simple as saying Sometimes people feel so bad that theyre thinking about killing themselves Is that you Still that doesnt sound easy The    can help friends and relatives figure out what to say and do Grument says That may involve talking to a family doctor or a faith leader or making an appointment with a mental health clinic And then stick with it Grument says Let them know why youre bringing them in for that appointment or asking about it
