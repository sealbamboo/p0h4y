Michael Pirron is feeling pretty good these days In January I reported the sad tale of his elderly parents whose   Though Anne and David Pirron had faithfully paid John Hancock about  in premiums over  years which would have entitled them to about  in benefits through their joint policy the elder Mr Pirron had gone to his bank and mistakenly stopped the autopayment system his son had set up When John Hancock sent notices that their coverage was about to end because theyd stopped making payments the Pirrons didnt know what to do with them and stashed them in a drawer Their son found the letters months later when his mother needed more care and he wanted to tap their benefits An only child Michael Pirron was their designated third party meaning the insurer was supposed to send notices of any change to him as well as to his parents Hancock said it sent such a notice Mr Pirron said he never got one He had no legal recourse under Virginia insurance regulations except a lawsuit that would have cost far too much So the older Pirrons had to sell their condo and downsize into a modest apartment in Richmond where Mrs Pirron now receives care through a Medicaidfunded PACE  Program of AllInclusive Care for the Elderly To try to prevent this from happening to other families  and it probably does because the inability to manage finances effectively is    Michael Pirron and the state AARP lobbied the Virginia Legislature to require insurers to send thirdparty notifications by certified mail The bill died in committee last winter but this month the state Bureau of Insurance took action and went one better Effective January  longterm care insurers in Virginia will have to use certified letters or get receipts from commercial delivery services to prove that they have sent lapse notices to third parties and to the beneficiaries themselves Im pretty excited about it Mr Pirron told me in an interview I thought for sure the insurance industry would block the whole thing but it didnt It tried During the comment period the bureau heard from Mr Pirron the Virginia AARP the Alzheimers Association and the Virginia Poverty Law Center as well as several other individuals in favor of the proposed change The American Council of Life Insurers opposed it calling the new regulations unnecessary and pointing out that obtaining receipts would require companies to reorganize their mail rooms potentially slowing mailings and costing money The bureau responded that given the relatively minor impact on carriers compared with what would befall policyholders whose insurance lapsed the new requirements were both reasonable and necessary Trying to follow suit in every state could take a very long time But Mr Pirron was also delighted to hear from the Senate Budget Committee led by Senator Patty Murray Democrat of Washington which is drafting a bill on longterm care insurance and thirdparty notification Theres no timetable yet  Were still in the very early stages the press secretary Helen Hare told me  but federal legislation could bring protection much more quickly None of this will reinstate the Pirrons coverage sadly or help Michael Pirron figure out what to do now that it is confirmed his father has Alzheimers disease Though they had intended to finance their own care before long both his parents will have to rely on Medicaid he believes Still the prospect of safeguarding Virginia policyholders cheers him It doesnt help my parents he said but at least this didnt happen for nothing
