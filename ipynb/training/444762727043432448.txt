Many of us will happily eat a gummy bear or cookie after it falls on the floor as long as we snatch it up quickly Say five seconds or less right Well science just gave us another excuse to continue this foodsaving habit especially when it comes to carpetdusted snacks Biology students at the Aston University in Birmingham UK measured how quickly two common bacteria hop aboard foods dropped on tiles linoleum and carpet Their findings support the idea that there really is such a thing as the fivesecond rule for moist snacks such as wet pasta and sticky gummy bears For dry foods like cookies and toast waiting a full  seconds didnt make much of a difference in the number of critters that jumped on microbiologist   and his students reported this week on the universitys   The team hasnt published the data yet So the findings are still preliminary and need to be confirmed But the conclusions make sense If you snatch up a wet gummy bear three seconds after it hits a tile or laminate floor it will pick up much fewer microbes than if you wait  seconds  at least for the two bacteria examined   and   And for carpet youve got an even longer grace period It didnt matter whether the food was wet or dry the surface spread the least germs even over the full  seconds the team found We have found evidence that transfer from indoor flooring surfaces is incredibly poor with carpet actually posing the lowest risk of bacterial transfer onto dropped food Hilton  in a statement With carpet of course your sticky candy will pick up much more than bacteria especially when you have furry family members But that doesnt seem to deter many folks from sampling off the floor Hilton and his students surveyed about  people and found that  percent of them said they eat dropped snacks And about threequarters of these people use the fivesecond rule Not everyone agrees that this is such a good idea The guys over at   recently reminded us that whether or not you get sick from floortainted food depends on which particular critters are hanging out on your linoleum  and not necessarily on the total amount of microbes Eating food off the floor is a bit like playing Russian roulette with your gut molecular biologist Eric Schulze says in a   on Smithsonians website We track harmful agents like fecal bacteria on the soles of our shoes all the time So no floor surface is guaranteed to be a safe bet he adds Although Hilton and his team didnt find any fecal bacteria on the indoor floors they examined it only takes a few of the wrong microbes to make you really sick So the conclusion Sampling food from the floor comes with a risk especially if you dont know how clean that tile is But grabbing it quickly could make a difference for sticky snacks
