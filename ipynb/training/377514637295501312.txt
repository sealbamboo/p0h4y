 Even though Id rather collapse on the couch the moment all three of my little rascals are tucked in tight finding the gumption to fire up a fitness DVD or head out on a walk gives me a sense of freedom  When I start carving out time for myself I feel better taken care of like our household isnt quite as chaotic as it usually seems Life with young children is tiring and when youve been dealing all day with tantrums pullup diapers and tiny people who insist on dressing themselves even though they cant fasten buttons its easy to sink into an emotional rut by nighttime Read a pity party with a side of laundry  By now everyone knows the chemical benefits of exercise Working out is   to provide endorphins the same kind you get while sneaking a big piece of dark chocolate while the kids are playing in the other room The difference being exercise endorphins actually whittle your waistline instead of expanding it  Ever the multitasking mom I make sure that even my workouts are twofers Since private time is at a precious premium I throw in a fitness DVD say one from Tracy Anderson and then I turn the volume down and fire up a fun show or podcast say This American Life  Its a system that combines genuine entertainment with physical stimulation  and both on the cheap No wonder Im loving my routine    When my yearold climbs on my back demanding one more snuggle before bed I can truthfully tell her Ive got to do my exercises now Love you And she totally gets it Love that kid Sticker for her  Ive always been an active person but Ive never been particularly thin Thats a whole other ball of wax one that involves eating a lot less especially given my height average and metabolism sea slugish  Right now after baby No  my fitness goals are purely focused on moving all my bodys parts every day and noticing how good it feels My creaky neck that pinch behind my left shoulder blade and oh those hips ouch What they need is movement strengthening and stretching  Ever since my kids were born Ive been a workfromhomer instead of an online executive leading a team from the comfort of a fancy office Nowadays my time spent being a professional and my time spent being a mom totally blur together to the point where my average day goes something like this Interview expert for upcoming article Throw load of clothes in washing machine Edit photos for   Check emails Get dinner going Throw clothes in dryer Have conference call with new consulting client With a schedule like this I find that its honestly just too tiring to consider doing ONE MORE THING at the end of the day  unless I make it feel like a reward For a while I really resented the whole idea of having to stick to a nighttime fitness routine Wait now my special thing is exercising Since when is that fun Then I had a change of heart Life requires effort Should one of my daughters ever find herself in a similar situation someday Ill be able to tell her Make the effort Make yourself healthy Because Ive learned from personal experience that along the way shell be happier I dont have all the kinks worked out yet Every working parent struggles with finding the time and energy to both work and raise kids Its that dance between spending time with your children and providing for them  and theres so much more to life than either one  Ive got personal goals beyond wearing normal jeans again and would love to increase the amount of time I spend chatting with friends by about  And that guy I married a few years back Weve got many canceled date nights to make up for This life is a work in progress but for now Im happy to have one little piece of the puzzle in pretty good shape even if that shape isnt exactly a sixpack Two more bits of advice  Get a couple of exercise DVDs you enjoy My favorites involve barefoot cardio that doesnt even require finding shoes  Stock up on podcasts or streaming videos that you can start and pause whenever you want Play them while you work out the distraction will make the whole thing feel like more of a treat
