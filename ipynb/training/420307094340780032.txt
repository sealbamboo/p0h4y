I remember when I first looked up a patient on Google It was my last day on the bone marrow transplant unit back when I was an intern As I stood before the patient taking her history she told me she had been a painter and suggested I look up her work on the Internet I did and I found her paintings fascinating Even though our paths crossed fleetingly she is one of the few patients I vividly remember from that time Google has taught me other things too things that dont come up during the routine historytaking or medication checks of my usual doctorpatient interactions I learned recently for example that one of my patients had been an Olympic gold medalist and worldrecord holder in the s Knowing more about my patients as people helps build empathy Doctors do Google their patients In fact the vast majority of physicians I know have done so To my generation using a search engine like Google comes as naturally as sharing pictures of our children or a recent vacation on a social networking site like Facebook But it surprises me that more physicians dont pause and think about what it means for the patientdoctor relationship What if one finds something that is not warm and fuzzy I recently   in which a yearold woman went to a surgeon wanting to have a prophylactic double mastectomy citing an extensive history of cancer in her family However she was not willing to undergo any workup and her medical team noted several inconsistencies in her story When they searched online it turned out she had set up multiple Facebook accounts soliciting donations for malignancies she never had One page showed her with her head shaved as if she had already undergone chemotherapy The surgeons immediately decided to halt her care I was once taking care of a frail older patient who came to the hospital feeling very short of breath It wasnt immediately clear why but her breathing was getting worse To look for accidental ingestions I sent for a drug screen and to my great surprise it came back positive for cocaine It didnt make sense to me given her age and the person lying before me and I was concerned she had been the victim of some sort of abuse She told me she had no idea why there was cocaine in her system When I walked out of the room a nurse called me over to her computer There on   was a younger version of my patients face with details about how she had been detained for cocaine possession more than three decades earlier I looked away from the screen feeling like I had violated my patients privacy I resumed our medical exam without bringing up the finding on the Internet and her subsequent hospital course was uneventful I am tempted to prescribe that physicians should never look online for information about their patients though I think the practice will become only more common given doctors  and all of our  growing dependence on technology The more important question health care providers need to ask themselves is why we would like to To me the only legitimate reason to search for a patients online footprint is   If for example a patient appears to be manic or psychotic it might be useful to investigate whether certain claims the patient makes are true Or if a doctor suspects a pediatric patient is being abused it might make sense to look for evidence online Physicians have also investigated patients on the web if they were concerned about suicide risk or needed to contact the family of an unresponsive patient In my state Massachusetts doctors can also use a specialized database to track every pharmacy a patient took controlled drugs from  an especially useful tool when drug abuse is suspected But if the only reason a doctor searches online is to gather personal information that patients dont want to share with their physicians then it is absolutely the wrong thing to do Recently one of my primary care patients was back in clinic with some worrisome news In spite of increasing the dose of his medication his panic attacks were getting worse He had told me that as he saw his business success grow so did his stress and the frequency of his panic attacks I stepped out of the clinic to speak with my supervising physician I related the patients history telling him about the growing success of the patients business What sort of business he asked When I told him that I had forgotten to ask he quickly flipped the window on the computer before us from an electronic medical record to Google and typed in the patients name But before he pressed return he paused This was unusual  most doctors I know dont pause Then with the cursor blinking before us he pressed the backspace key keeping it pinned until there were no more letters for the cursor to gobble up And he proceeded to do what has worked for physicians for eons He sat down next to the patient and asked
