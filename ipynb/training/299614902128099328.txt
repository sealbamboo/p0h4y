It seems the third time wasnt the charm after all The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has   the   to ensure that women with health insurance get access to nocost contraceptive coverage without violating the rights of religious employers The administration issued   last Friday While   that oppose abortion and birth control immediately dismissed the proposal the influential bishops held back saying only that they welcomed the opportunity to study the proposed regulations closely Now however its clear that this attempt by the administration doesnt clear the bar for the bishops either The proposal calls for insurance companies  rather than religious hospitals universities or charities  to provide contraceptive and sterilization coverage But thats not good enough said a statement from   president of the conference It appears that the government would require all employees in our accommodated ministries to have the illicit coverage  they may   opt out nor even opt out for their children  under a separate policy Dolan said He also complained that while the rules seek to accommodate nonprofit religious employers including churches themselves which are exempt from the coverage requirement along with affiliated entities like educational institutions they dont relieve forprofit employers of the obligation In obedience to our JudeoChristian heritage we have consistently taught our people to live their lives during the week to reflect the same beliefs that they proclaim on the Sabbath said Dolan referring to owners of   who are suing the federal government because they say the coverage violates their personal religious beliefs We cannot now abandon them to be forced to violate their morally wellinformed consciences Compared with some of Dolans   about contraceptive coverage requirements the latest statement was more measured We welcome and will take seriously the Administrations invitation to submit our concerns through formal comments and we will do so in the hope that an acceptable solution can be found that respects the consciences of all he said
