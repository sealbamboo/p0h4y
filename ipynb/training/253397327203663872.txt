Scientists have recently discovered three new human viruses One   causes severe pneumonia and kidney failure Another sent   to the hospital with severe fatigue and low blood platelets The third   causes a new kind of hemorrhagic fever The most striking thing about all three new viruses is that they were found on the basis of just two or three human cases Thats a long way from where the world was  years ago when another new virus popped up in Asia and quickly went global The mysterious new disease    Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Before it was stopped it would strike  people around the world and kill more than  amazingly none in the US Initially the World Health Organization thought SARS emerged in February  in southern China A physician who caught the virus there brought it to Hong Kong when he attended his sons wedding He famously infected a globetrotting roster of tourists during his stay at the Metropole Hotel But that early report turned out to be wrong in one major respect The first SARS outbreak caused by people eating civet cats who had apparently been infected by bats actually started four months earlier in Guangdong Province But few knew because Chinese authorities werent telling  of Childrens Hospital in Boston says that wouldnt happen today Today we would have seen that information bubbling up in many different places he says Brownstein and his colleagues collect realtime reports about disease outbreaks from all over the world and display them on a website called   Ten years after SARS I think its very difficult to imagine  an important public health event where that information isnt getting out in some form  via text messages tweets Facebook posts blogs chat rooms he told Shots I think theres very few places on Earth where were not able to get citizen reporting and information  an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University agrees Communication about healthrelated issues just travels with the speed of light today he says I think the problem of international communication  openness and sharing of information  is largely resolved One big reason is a new set of   that went into effect in  They require countries to report disease outbreaks right away to the World Health Organization Dr Isabelle Nuttall of the WHO says the new regulations are working And she says the agency is much better equipped to handle new diseases We are much better organized she says Weve learned over the years What was done for SARS as an improvisation I would say is not extremely wellstructured Nuttall is coordinating the WHOs current response to the new virus that emerged in Saudi Arabia It killed one Saudi man in June and last month put another man from neighboring Qatar into an intensive care unit in London Its not clear how the two men got the new virus which is   to a virus that infects bats They didnt know each other and the onset of their illnesses was three months apart But according to Nuttall both had been in   a Red Sea port of  million that is the gateway to the holy Muslim city of Mecca The new microbe is a   the same family that includes the SARS virus  and causes around  percent of common colds But fortunately it appears to be far less contagious than the SARS virus Better communications aside the world has another big advantage over the SARS era Back then it was months after its emergence before scientists even knew if the new microbe was a virus or bacterium In contrast thanks to an alert pathologist in Jeddah the new Saudi microbe was immediately identified as a new virus while the very first patient was still in the hospital Then when the second patient showed up three months later scientists in four countries got to work and figured out its full genetic code in record time Today we are speaking about days to a week rather than a month to resolve the whole genetic sequence of a new virus says     of Erasmus University in Rotterdam one of the scientists working on the new virus Knowing the genetic sequence gives researchers a lot of clues about where the virus may have come from It also has enabled them to devise a quick and reliable diagnostic test plus a confirmatory test so doctors can tell if an acutely ill patient is infected with the new virus or something else The next step is also critical  devising a blood test to detect antibodies to the new virus That would be important in detecting whether people who are not currently ill had been exposed to the virus in the past We need a test for antibodies and I think a test will soon be available Osterhaus told Shots That would give you eventually an indication whether the virus has been spreading at all among the population And that could tell scientists if some people get infected without getting sick raising the possibility that they could infect others who might be more vulnerable Or perhaps people can only get the new virus from an animal or insect Those are important questions as several million Muslims from all over the world converge on Saudi Arabia this month for the annual pilgrimage to Mecca
