Weekend Edition Sunday Reed Vreeland was born with HIV which means he has struggled for most of his  years deciding how and when to inform people about his illness His mom was infected but his dad was not Dozens of states criminalize HIV exposure or perceived exposure through sex shared needles or in some states exposure to bodily fluids that can include saliva Reed works for an organization the Sero Project that fights these state HIV criminalization laws Vreeland has very clear memories about the day his dad told him about his HIV I immediately just started crying because wed read in our first grade class a book about HIV and AIDS he tells NPRs Rachel Martin I remember the first thing I thought of was Oh Im like the kids in the book  And the book was about AIDS in Africa and about kids in Africa dying of AIDS His own mother died of AIDS when he was  and the pain of losing her was even more intense Vreeland says because I knew I had what she had She had many complications in her last few years and grew extremely weak I could beat her in an arm wrestle as a yearold and she was just so fragile Its just so hard to see a parent in that state and then know you could be next In  in college Vreeland met a woman with whom he had an incredible first date At the end of it she ran toward him and puckered her lips to kiss him and in that moment he had a decision to make about how to handle the information about his status I felt the stigma I felt the fear he says He knew that if he told her about his HIV it could become fodder for the campus rumor mill So he opted to kiss her on the forehead much to her confusion The following day we had a deeper conversation and I disclosed to her that I was living with HIV He describes it as a huge leap and a huge investment of trust in her Later they shared the most romantic first kiss Vreeland has ever had in his life and they began a great relationship  theyre now married His wife Vreeland says is more the exception than the rule when it comes to how people handle his HIV status The stigma you face still with medical professionals is very significant And you constantly feel youre being judged he says Together they see a future with a family and Vreeland plans to continue his work as an activist on behalf of people with HIV Its time he says to force society at large and our medical establishment to confront this issue and stop making people living with HIV carry the full burden of stigma Were not going to do it anymore Do you think you harbor quiet biases against people with HIV Tell us what you think on the   or in the comments section below
