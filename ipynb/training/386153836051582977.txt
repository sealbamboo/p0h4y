Say you are getting ready for a blind date or a job interview What should you do Besides shower and shave of course it turns out you should read  but not just anything Something by Chekhov or Alice Munro will help you navigate new social territory better than a potboiler by Danielle Steel  That is the conclusion of  published Thursday in the journal Science It found that after reading literary fiction as opposed to popular fiction or serious nonfiction people performed better on tests measuring empathy social perception and emotional intelligence  skills that come in especially handy when you are trying to read someones body language or gauge what they might be thinking The researchers say the reason is that literary fiction often leaves more to the imagination encouraging readers to make inferences about characters and be sensitive to emotional nuance and complexity This is why I love science Louise Erdrich whose novel The Round House was used in one of the experiments wrote in an email The researchers she said found a way to prove true  the intangible benefits of literary fiction  Thank God the research didnt find that novels increased tooth decay or blocked up your arteries she added The researchers social psychologists at the New School for Social Research in New York City recruited their subjects through that berpurveyor of reading material Amazoncom To find a broader pool of participants than the usual college students they used Amazons   service where people sign up to earn money for completing small jobs People ranging in age from  to  were recruited for each of five experiments They were paid  or  each to read for a few minutes Some were given excerpts from awardwinning literary fiction Don DeLillo Wendell Berry Others were given best sellers like Gillian Flynns Gone Girl a Rosamunde Pilcher romance or a Robert Heinlein science fiction tale In one experiment some participants were given nonfiction excerpts but were not talking All the Presidents Men To maximize the contrast the researchers  looking for nonfiction that was wellwritten but not literary or about people  turned to Smithsonian Magazine   was one selection  was another After reading  or in some cases reading nothing  the participants took computerized tests that measure peoples ability to decode emotions or predict a persons expectations or beliefs in a particular scenario In one test called Reading the Mind in the Eyes subjects did just that they studied  photographs of pairs of eyes and chose which of four adjectives best described the emotion each showed Is the woman with the smoky eyes aghast or doubtful Is the man whose gaze has slivered to a squint suspicious or indecisive Is she interested or irritated flirtatious or hostile Is he fantasizing or guilty dominant or horrified Or annoyed that his tech stock dropped half a percent on the Nasdaq in a round of late trading after news from the Middle East Just kidding  that last one isnt on the test The idea that what we read might influence our social and emotional skills is not new Previous studies have correlated various types of reading with empathy and sensitivity More recently in   called theory of mind scientists have used emotional intelligence perception  to study for example children with autism But psychologists and other experts said the new study was powerful because it suggested a direct effect  quantifiable by measuring how many right and wrong answers people got on the tests  from reading literature for only a few minutes  Its a really important result said Nicholas Humphrey an evolutionary psychologist who has written extensively about human intelligence and who was not involved in the research That they would have subjects read for three to five minutes and that they would get these results is astonishing Dr Humphrey an emeritus professor at Cambridge Universitys Darwin College said he would have expected that reading generally would make people more empathetic and understanding But to separate off literary fiction and to demonstrate that it has different effects from the other forms of reading is remarkable he said  Experts said the results implied that people could be primed for social skills like empathy just as watching a clip from a sad movie can make one feel more emotional This really nails down the causal direction said Keith Oatley an emeritus professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Toronto who was not involved in the study These people have done not one experiment but five and they have found the same effects The researchers  Emanuele Castano  a psychology professor and David Comer Kidd a doctoral candidate  found that people who read literary fiction scored better than those who read popular fiction This was true even though when asked subjects said they did not enjoy literary fiction as much Literary fiction readers also scored better than nonfiction readers  and popular fiction readers made as many mistakes as people who read nothing  There is much the study does not address How long could such effects last Would three months of reading Charles Dickens and Jane Austen produce larger or smaller effects or have no impact Are the differences in scores all attributable to the type of material read Would the results hold if the same person read all of the types And would it matter if the literary fiction was particularly difficult Nobody was asked to read James Joyce or Thomas Pynchon The studys authors and other academic psychologists said such findings should be considered by educators designing curriculums particularly the Common Core standards adopted by most states which assign students more nonfiction  Frankly I agree with the study said Albert Wendland who directs a masters program in writing popular fiction at Seton Hill University Reading sensitive and lengthy explorations of peoples lives that kind of fiction is literally putting yourself into another persons position  lives that could be more difficult more complex more than what you might be used to in popular fiction It makes sense that they will find that yeah that can lead to more empathy and understanding of other lives  He added Maybe popular fiction is a way of dealing more with ones own self maybe with ones own wants desires needs 
In popular fiction said Mr Kidd one of the researchers really the author is in control and the reader has a more passive role In literary fiction like Dostoyevsky there is no single overarching authorial voice he said Each character presents a different version of reality and they arent necessarily reliable You have to participate as a reader in this dialectic which is really something you have to do in real life  Dr Castano added that in many cases popular fiction seems to be more focused on the plot  Characters can be interchangeable and usually more stereotypical in the way they are described he said  Ms Erdrich the author said the study made her feel personally cheered  Writers are often lonely obsessives especially the literary ones Its nice to be told what we write is of social value she said However I would still write even if novels were useless Want to help the researchers with their work
