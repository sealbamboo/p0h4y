A naturally occurring substance called epidermal growth factor appears to reverse a type of brain damage thats common in very premature infants Repeated doses of   led to the complete repair of brain injuries in baby mice that didnt get enough oxygen after birth researchers   in the journal  It was really amazing says   of Childrens National Health System in Washington DC These mice looked identical to the mice that were not exposed to the injury The result is important because each year tens of thousands of premature babies sustain brain injuries caused by a lack of oxygen says   a neurologist at Childrens and an author of the  paper Many of the children that I have in my clinic have either cerebral palsy or they have issues with motor skills as a result of whats known as perinatal hypoxia he says This lack of oxygen near the time of birth occurs because children born before the nd week of pregnancy tend to have immature lungs and blood cells that are not yet able to deliver enough oxygen to the brain Scafidi says So even when they get supplemental oxygen in a neonatal intensive care unit he says some brain cells may die Previous research had shown that oxygen deprivation often kills specific brain cells called   These cells form myelin  the insulation that is wrapped around nerve fibers Gallo says Without myelin nerve cells do not communicate properly Experiments in mice showed that the damaged brain of a newborn mouse actually tries to replace dead or damaged oligodendrocytes Gallo says The problem he adds is that this happens too late The researchers thought EGF might start the process sooner and it did But the treatment worked only when it was given soon after the injury occurred That suggests that premature human infants would probably have to be treated within a few weeks of birth Gallo says The EGF was given to mice through the nose  which means it would be easy to administer to a human infant But use in babies is probably still a long way off Gallo says in part because many growth factors are known to encourage the growth of tumors as well as new cells So EGF and other growth factors with the potential to repair brain damage may be tried first in adults with   a condition thats also caused by a lack of myelin says   of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda And its possible she says that researchers will find a growth factor treatment that works against both MS and the sort of brain damage found in very premature infants
