Every day at  am Sunil Pande phones his parents in Gurgaon India which is part of the greater New Delhi metropolitan area If his yearold father and his yearold mother sound well his day proceeds normally But if something seems dangerously amiss he has a difficult decision to make Mr Pande  and an only child lives in Portland Ore The last plane out of the city that gets him to New Delhi within  hours leaves at  am  When a crisis appears imminent  a judgment call he must make from  miles away  hell drop everything get on the plane and rush to his parents side The last time that happened was about a year ago Mr Pandes father Chandra Shekhar Pande had stopped recognizing people and sounded incoherent on the telephone He is prone to urinary tract infections and the younger Mr Pande feared an infection was raging out of control Mr Pande hopped on a flight and remained in India for a month seeing his father through a day hospitalization and an extended recovery In India he said its expected that a family member or friend will stay with a hospital patient  serving as an unpaid attendant How many people who come to America for an education or a job and stay eventually become transnational caregivers  people who care for relatives or friends across national boundaries  No one really knows But theres certainly a long tradition of crossborder family interactions in this nation of immigrants  Both historically and today financial support from people who come to the United States flows to relatives across oceans and south to Mexico and Central and Latin America  Some immigrants spend parts of the year here and in their countries of origin looking after young children or older parents left behind     But the dynamics of these arrangements are different now because of two major trends Across the world people are living longer more immigrants have aging relatives in distant lands in their s s or s with all the related medical and social issues   Meanwhile technology has transformed how people can communicate over long distances and altered expectations of what people can do for farflung relatives Whereas letters once took weeks to cross an ocean and phone service was scarce in Africa Asia and rural areas of other continents today video chats occur in realtime and almost everyone has cellphones  Erica Dhar a senior advisor at AARPs office of international affairs wrote her graduate thesis on transnational caregiving a topic she became interested in while living in New York City and trying to look after her elderly mother Verna Pinto in New Delhi For a decade until her mothers death in January  her habit was to visit India once or twice a year and call each morning before going to work Gradually Ms Dhar became aware her very energetic very independent mother was developing dementia She would say Im so lonely When are you coming to visit and the guilt would kick in because you know shes alone and you feel responsible said Ms Dhar who said she came to dread the morning conversations   In India it is considered shameful to send an elderly relative to a nursing home  instead domestic workers   often from rural areas with no education  care for older people in their homes  When her mother started deteriorating Ms Dhar would call the domestic  helpers to try to get information about what was going on It wasnt easy During those years there was no such thing as vacation If Ms Dhar had time off shed travel to India and spend all her time off there Managing the expenses the time and the family relationships  Ms Dhar has two sisters one in Canada and one in India  presented constant challenges Complicating matters even further is a lack of geriatric training for doctors in India the absence of home health care services and an entirely different set of medical services You get the call  Mom is in terrible shape You jump on a plane you arrive stressed and jetlagged and now you have to deal with a health care and insurance system thats not at all familiar Ms Dhar said In these situations people often turn for help to friends from their neighborhood or from high school and college When theres an emergency Ill call someone usually from college and tell them Ill be there tomorrow  Can you go over and help take care of things before I arrive Mr Pande said He is a computer scientist who visited India five times last year combining vacation with business travel whenever possible He manages his parents medical care as best he can Every week his father has urine tests meant to identify the first signs of an infection Mr Pandes aunt takes a photo of the test results on her iPad and sends them to Mr Pande who keeps a running record on his iPad and his computer Should test values appear out of whack Mr Pande will then email the results to his fathers doctor who usually calls to discuss the next steps Two months ago when an infection actually erupted Mr Pande set an alarm on his smart phone each time his father was due to take medication When it went off he called India to check that the medication was administered as ordered There is a sophisticated orchestration of care that has to happen Mr Pande said   When his yearold aunt who is caring for his parents has her own medical issues I have to figure out whos going to be at home with my parents and whos going to be with my aunt at the hospital A longtime family cook can help but that involves walking him through what needs to be done step by step on the iPad he said Asked whether this routine takes a toll Mr Pande who is married and has a teenage daughter said its not rocket science  Someone has to do it A cousin also living in Portland faces many of the same caregiving challenges For the past several years he has taken consulting jobs so he can travel to India every three months staying for up to six weeks  Hes decided he cant have a regular job Mr Pande said For her part Ms Dhar said she had three close girlfriends who are currently traveling back and forth to India whenever possible and Skyping and calling elderly parents daily when theyre back in the United States  With increasing longevity and globalization this is going to be a growing issue she said
