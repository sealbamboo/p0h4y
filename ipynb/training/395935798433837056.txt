For a week I stuck to a budget of about  per meal the average SNAP benefit for one person It was a tough week I found myself drained and constantly thinking of food  When the SNAP cuts take effect next week benefits will average about  per meal I cant imagine the strain this will place on struggling families who are counting every penny and trying to stretch their benefits  Most families do not have enough to make it through the month already    by the third week of the month and  of food bank clients currently receiving SNAP turn to food banks for help at least six months out of the year  The upcoming cuts will result in an increased need for food assistance at food pantries and soup kitchens across the nation when many are already stretched meeting sustained high need in the wake of the recession  At Feeding America were doing everything we can to prepare our network of food banks for the increased demand but charity alone cannot make up for the impending  billion loss in SNAP funding The reduced funding will result in the loss of nearly  billion meals in the next year Thats more than half of Feeding Americas total projected output for  The cuts this week are significant and will put a strain on millions of families struggling with food insecurity hitting them right before the holiday season Adding to this is the fact that Congress is considering much deeper cuts to SNAP benefits and eligibility restrictions that will affect millions of lowincome people as part of the farm bill  In September the House passed legislation   in SNAP over the next  years according to a Feeding America analysis Together with this weeks cuts the pending legislation will result in a loss of nearly  billion meals for lowincome Americans in  alone according to a Feeding America analysis These are meals our most vulnerable citizens cannot afford to lose and food banks and other charities simply cannot fill that gap While we cannot stop this weeks SNAP cuts we can prevent further cuts from taking place Call your member of Congress and tell them not to cut SNAP  Helping our neighbors in need is a fundamental American value and fighting hunger is a publicprivate partnership We need a strong charitable system and a strong federal antihunger safety net Working together individuals charities business and government can solve hunger  Do your part to make sure no one in America goes hungry
