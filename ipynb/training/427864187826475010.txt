Once Rose got serious about losing weight for good she her husband David and daughter Rachel lost a combined  pounds together A big factor in the trios transformation was changing how they ate choosing healthier foods and cooking at home The weight loss in my opinion is the easy part Rose said Its the maintenance thats hard and thats difficult and takes time and education and understanding Rose had many complications with her pregnancies She was hospitalized for four weeks because of   with her first son Josh Her third child Noah almost died as an infant Rose suffered badly with asthma and weighed close to  pounds when she was pregnant with her youngest child Sarah Her older daughter Rachel now  suffered weight problems too Rachel remembers going to Target with her mother and wanting to try on clothes in the kids section But because of her large size as a thirdgrader she had to shop in the adult section  It was hard for Rachel knowing children were in the other part of the store she was surrounded by all these old women  Rachel looks at old pictures of herself and she says Why did you let me get so big  Rose said It probably is my fault I was kind of lost myself Rose tried commercial weightloss programs but nothing worked She became serious about getting healthy after an asthma attack in  a year after Sarahs birth Rose was driving her children home from a friends house when she felt a heaviness in her chest She reached for her inhaler but it wasnt in her purse She panicked and pulled over  The only thing I could think of is Im going to die here on the street  she said I called my husband and I told him where I was because I didnt think Id be alive when he got there  Her brush with death made her decide once and for all The weight had to go   In those days Rose didnt cook much at all Frozen pizza chicken nuggets in a bag mac and cheese in a box a premade familysize portion of chicken lasagna for herself and her husband  these were typical meals  When the children were little Rose kept a hefty supply of bags of chips she said  All the neighborhood kids used to come over all the time because I had so much junk food she said  But in  Rose dedicated herself to understanding healthy food choices Now Rose avoids anything that comes in a bag or box  The family cooks together making main courses such as chicken wings from scratch and sides such as mashed potatoes mixed with cauliflower Every meal has a salad  Roses husband has become a wizard with stir fry she said  And Rachel who used to buy two ice cream snacks at school at lunch now brings her lunch from home and makes strawberrybanana protein smoothies  The family has also been spending less time sitting on the couch  Rachel and Noah have been playing tennis for years Theyve motivated the rest of the family to play tennis too Rose said  The family also rides bikes around the neighborhood and has gone on outdoor adventures such as whitewater rafting and an obstacle course They have joined a family gym so that everyone is working out at the same time and have run K races together over the past two years David Rose credits his wife as leading by example in the diet and fitness changes that have transformed the household He lost  pounds which he has kept off for four years and now weighs about  pounds  I remember the first day that she took me over to the gym and put me on an elliptical machine he said That was the beginning of a process  It hasnt always been easy  On Valentines Day  David went to buy his wife a fondue maker and gourmet chocolate from a local chocolatier She had loved the Melting Pot fondue restaurant he thought with this present I was hitting a grand slam home run  He was wrong I just looked at him and said Youve got to be kidding me  Gabi Rose said I was just beside myself Hes just not understanding the efforts that Im putting into my weight loss Her fury didnt abate when her husband tossed the chocolate in the garbage She didnt speak to him for a month I knew she was going to bring up the fondue he said later  In retrospect Rose sees that until that point her weightloss efforts had been inconsistent But her husband apologized telling his wife that he hadnt understood where she was coming from  that she was serious about getting healthy long term and about making everyone in the family feel better about themselves  He was afraid that I was going to become a different person I guess or not as fun as I used to be she said But we found fun in other ways without eating  Today Rose weighs  pounds and has become an expert on losing weight She has traveled extensively speaking about how to make healthy changes and was the host and coproducer of a reality show in South Florida called The Get Fit Club  In  she teamed up with Dr Elisabeth CohnGelwasser  whose medical practice Rose has been coordinating since   to offer a medical weightloss program that targets nutrition and fitness and also incorporates counseling in behavior modification and medication when necessary   From a size  Rose has slimmed down to a size   Rachel has also made significant progress she lost  pounds between  and  and her father said she has been an inspiration to other children Now in high school Rachel knows a lot of girls who complain about their appearances  I honestly cant relate to them because I love the way that I am right now she said  As for the embattled fondue maker its still in the familys kitchen David said Its a reminder of an era of overeating thats melted away
