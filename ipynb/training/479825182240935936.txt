One of the UKs leading sports medicine specialists says government guidelines are actually discouraging people from being active  In this weeks Scrubbing Up Dr Mike Loosemore head of exercise medicine at the Institute of Sport Exercise and Health at University College London who has been involved in the development of commercial exercise programmes says people should be encouraged to do more lowlevel exercise  such as simply standing up Ready for a sitdown or are you sitting comfortably already  You might be a little less relaxed if you knew that lack of physical activity is the public health problem at the beginning of the st century  There is an overwhelming weight of evidence that humans need to be active  And Im not talking about hours in the gym or jogging miles around the local park but simply avoiding the sort of sedentary behaviour that sees us spending hours of our day sat in front of a computer at the wheel of car or watching the gogglebox Its time to stand up for yourself Literally  There is now enormous evidence that simply standing makes huge differences to your health  It is estimated that being on your feet for just three hours a day can extend your life by two years  The great news is of course that now everyone can benefit  If you are feeling unfit or fat or too over the hill to walk up even a small one its time to think again  Lowlevel activity even regularly getting off your seat can change your life forever Active individuals reduce their risk of heart disease by  against their inactive counterparts  Other reductions are similarly extraordinary High blood pressure can be lessened by almost  the risk of recurrent breast cancer by almost  whilst the likelihood of colon cancer goes down by over   It has great mental benefits too with the risk of developing of Alzheimers disease decreased by a third and depression eased as effectively as Prozac or behavioural therapy  Activity is not only more powerful than drugs for most conditions but can act as a cureall The UK governments recommendation that adults in the UK complete  minutes of moderate activity five days a week to achieve the above gains would seem to make sense  No drugs are involved and this level of activity needs no special equipment It would seem so undemanding yet so beneficial you would expect the whole of the population to be following these guidelines  However what do we find  When adults were monitored barely  of men and  of women were carrying out enough activity to fulfil them  It is perhaps not surprising that the UK has one of the highest levels of obesity in the world So the governments recommendations are not just failing to encourage the population to increase their physical activity but are seemingly acting as a positive disincentive to people to participate at all  For many of the population  minutes of moderate activity is deemed impractical or unobtainable so the idea that being more physical to improve longterm health is ignored or dismissed Most of us do not have the time energy or inclination to make the effort so the recommendations are not just failing to engage the population but are positively discouraging people to participate at all But there is some good news  Even a small amount of activity can make major health gains and this is what the population really needs to be taught   Every action even a single step on a stair or standing up for a few seconds can put you on a positive path to better health   If you start to think that the smallest movement makes a significant difference then every single person can take part and gain the powerful benefits of being physically active As you can see feeling great is a walk in the park
