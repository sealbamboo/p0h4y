The lives of older men have changed in a significant way since  or at least their sex lives have changed Thats the year Viagra was introduced Cialis and Levitra followed a few years later The once taboo subject of erectile dysfunction is now inescapable for anyone who watches TV Latenight comedians continually mine the topic By  Jay Leno had told  Viagra jokes according to the   We couldnt independently verify that number Actually we didnt try The drugs have been   by former Sen Bob Dole Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka and dozens of attractive anonymous actors canoodling on sofas and lounging in bathtubs A retired Marine Corps pilot named Mike  he asked us just to use his first name  says his own experience wasnt much different from the scenes on TV It was fantastic he says Mikes been married for  years Hes been using either Viagra or Cialis for the past  I was having some issues  Mike explains So he discussed the problem with his son whos a doctor and suggested Mike try the drugs Mikes wife was all for it too and he says theyve lived happily ever after I believe my wife and I became closer he says because a source of anxiety vanished from their relationship Before Viagra relieving that anxiety required measures that could cause plenty of anxiety themselves says   a professor of gerontology medicine and biology at the University of Southern California Theyre just medieval these things he says For example theres the vacuum pump where you essentially cause an erection by creating a partial vacuum around the penis drawing blood into the penis Schneider explains Hes never tried it himself he says but I imagine its awful Schneider says other remedies on the market include a surgically implantable pump a Viagralike drug you can inject directly into the penis and a little pill that can be inserted directly into the tip of the penis All these methods are still in use explains Schneider because some men cant take the oral medications But the men who   take them have made Viagra Cialis and Levitra wildly successful The three drugs took in more than  billion last year  a urologist at UCLA Medical School says theres another reason the drugs are so profitable Erectile dysfunction happens to all men Not all at once but gradually over time such that men in their s have a  percent chance of having this problem Rajfer says For every decade after  theres a  percent increase That means that a man in his s would have a  percent chance of having a problem at least once in a while Rajfer says this happens because after a mans prime reproductive years smooth muscle  the type found within the walls of blood vessels and in the penis  starts to deteriorate In fact years before Viagra hit the market Rajfer helped identify nitric oxide as the chemical in the body that acts on smooth muscle and makes erections possible Viagratype drugs work by keeping nitric oxide from breaking down too quickly The drug is much more than the sum of its chemical parts  and its physiological effects says a man named David who also asked that we not use his last name Its something that gives that sense that intimacy can continue he says You can feel less alone as a result David is  years old a recently retired community college professor and a widower Hes now in a new relationship I was simply concerned at my age that I wasnt as capable as I wanted to be he says And after I got the prescription I told her I had done that so that she would know And he says she was fine with it Women have their own concerns as they age says David She was also concerned about how we were going to be as older people making love With people living longer David notes that he and the new woman in his life could spend  years together I wanted to keep that intimacy as long as possible because I love this person and I expect to be with her for a long time he says And now because of a little pill being physically intimate with the woman he loves isnt something that will be lost to old age
