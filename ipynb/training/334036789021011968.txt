Most people know the ageold diet advice about grocery shopping when you are hungry You are more likely to buy fattening unhealthy foods So avoid it But the weight loss maxims found in diet books do not always hold up in the real world So two researchers at Cornell University recently devised an experiment that put this notion to the test  The study   was carried out in two phases In the first  men and women were brought into a lab on two separate days after having been told not to eat for five hours Then they were allowed to shop for food in a simulated grocery store which offered lowcalorie options like fruits vegetables and chicken breasts as well as highercalorie junk foods  Before shopping half of the subjects were given a snack Both groups ultimately purchased a similar number of items but those who shopped while hungry picked the highestcalorie foods  In the second phase of the study the researchers followed  actual shoppers in a grocery store Once again they found that people shopping at times when they were most likely to be hungry opted for the foods that were more calorically dense   In an accompanying editorial Dr Rita F Redberg a cardiologist said the findings provided scientific support for commonsense advice I think all diet guides include the advice to never go grocery shopping when you are hungry  she wrote and when I had young children I added and never with young children  because either of these factors seem to lead to less wise food choices Shopping for groceries on an empty stomach does in fact influence food choices
