Anyone who has cared for a baby knows that its easy to become preoccupied with what goes in one end  with what you feed her and how  and to regard what comes out the other end with a kind of fascination as if the diaper contained messages and auguries What you feed a baby is a reflection of your beliefs and family traditions your cultural background and life situation But it also means considering the advice of a good many experts from pediatricians to nutritionists to allergists Those recommendations in some cases have changed rather drastically Even as scientists reemphasize the importance of   exclusively in the first months of an infants life they also now acknowledge that there may be advantages to exposing the older baby to some of the specific solid foods that once were prohibited The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests breastfeeding exclusively  no formula no other foods of any kind  for the first six months of life and continuing breastfeeding for at least a year Other guidelines suggest that babies not be given solid foods until  to  months old and last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released   Heather Clayton the epidemiologist who was the primary author on the study told me The first thing that was surprising for me was the prevalence of solid food introduction before  months was  percent Mothers who were feeding their babies formula were much   than mothers who were exclusively breastfeeding she said Many mothers said that they simply thought their babies were old enough Other reasons included the desire to help the baby sleep This belief turns up regularly in the pediatric office I can tell you though that   Doctors and nutritionists cite concerns about the developmental readiness of young infants to handle solid foods There also may be links to later weight problems In a  study formulafed babies who started solids before  months old   Its only fair to point out that the medical wisdom on infant feeding has changed over time In the early s parents were advised not to introduce solid foods until around  months noted Amy Bentley an associate professor of food studies at New York University who is working on a history of baby food in the United States By the s some experts were recommending that babies start solid foods by  to   old Dr Bentley said That advice was connected to a sense that commercial baby food like infant formula was a more modern scientific and safe approach to infant nutrition Then as now doctors were talking about the fact that the mothers are just doing what they want to do and not really listening to the doctors Dr Bentley said With regard to infant feeding the most notable recent turnabout involves   Until five years ago the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Allergy    Immunology told parents to manage the introduction of foods most likely to cause   with particular care to avoid cows milk until a child was a year old eggs until age  anything containing peanut until age  It was thought that if you expose the baby to these foods early on in life that tends to skew toward allergies and you become an allergic person said Dr Amal H Assaad professor of   at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital But epidemiologic studies did not back this up and in fact some studies showed that   Our thinking now is this has failed and maybe we should go back to the opposing idea actually introducing these foods earlier when the body has more tendency to be tolerant she said Dr Assaad was part of a group which put together new recommendations published in January in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology In Practice The strongest recommendation for preventing allergic disease was breastfeeding but the authors also concluded that   though they should not be among the first solid foods that a baby gets This doesnt apply to a baby who has already had a reaction or who is in any way not completely healthy Still even for healthy babies even now   When we searched the literature very carefully it was very difficult to find evidence for one thing or the other said Dr Assaad Were doing the best we can with the evidence thats there Feeding a young baby can feel like the easiest and most clearly scripted part of being a parent But the evolving guidelines illustrate the complexity of the decisions The   these days for a child with no medical problems is to balance exclusivity in the first six months with a more relaxed  not to say promiscuous  approach after that Guidelines are themselves a mix of strong science collective wisdom and common sense they do indeed change with time and will probably change again No wonder parents obsess over what goes in and what comes out Expert committees do the same
