Having a hangover does not influence when a drinker will have their next tipple public health researchers have discovered  Hangovers neither deter nor encourage more drinking says the University of Missouri team The findings dispel the notion that people resort to having a hair of the dog to lessen their discomfort Likewise few appear to delay their next drink despite their postalcohol headache sickness and dizziness  The results published in Alcoholism Clinical  Experimental Research come from a study of  young adults  many of them US college students  who were asked to keep a diary over three weeks about their drinking Participants made a diary entry each morning and they were asked to rate their likelihood of drinking later the same day This yielded  drinking episodes and  hangover episodes for the researchers to analyse Overall ratings made on hangover and nonhangover mornings did not differ  Even when the drinkers were suffering acutely from the effects of a hangover it didnt seem to affect their conscious drinking intentions Surveys of college students have suggested that drinking to relieve hangovers has been tried by up to half of drinkers and that this behaviour is associated with heavier alcohol consumption But the current study did not find this The researchers also point out that some diary entries were missing  possibly because the participants were sometimes too hung over to do it  Researcher Thomas Piasecki said Our findings fill in a basic piece of the puzzle concerning hangovers and alcoholism If hangovers dont strongly discourage or punish drinking links between current problem drinking and frequent hangover seem less incongruent If hangovers dont generally hasten drinking we can rule out a direct causal role of hangovers in the acceleration of problem drinking According to Alcohol Concern around  people turn up at work every day with a hangover  And up to  million sick days are taken each year in the UK because of alcohol There are no cures for a hangover although making sure you rehydrate by drinking water may help The best way to avoid one is to drink within recommended limits which is no more than two or three units a day for women and three or four units a day for men If youve had a heavy drinking session hangover or not doctors advise that you wait  hours before drinking any more alcohol in order to give your body tissues time to recover
