At age  Jason DaSilva had everything  he was smart talented goodlooking and traveling the world as a documentary filmmaker Then he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis Some people live with the nerve disorder for years without having trouble but Jason was not one of them After suddenly falling on the beach during a  family vacation he quickly had to lean on a cane then a walker then a motorized scooter But he didnt just live through becoming disabled he filmed it His documentary    stations Monday night We follow him as he searches for help with  through alternative treatments traditional healers and even a miracle in the baths at Lourdes As DaSilva loses the ability to walk he wonders how much longer hell be able to live on his own But at an MS support group he meets Alice Cook a young woman whose mother has MS They fall in love and marry and work together on the film Their conversations include topics most young couples never contemplate like how they will manage if Jason cant talk in  years We talked with Jason  and Alice  by phone today This is an edited version of our conversation Jason I was pretty pissed off about that whole thing She rushed in showed me the wheelchair and then left right after I dont think I was really using a cane that much then They were trying to tell me what my fate was going to be and set me up for a wheelchair long before I used it Alice Its been really hard My parents have encouraged me to let Jason be Jason and not be the disability But none of us knows what tomorrow is The uncertainty is a little more visceral for us But were all living with uncertainty Jason Same for me Honestly I still have those frustrations I lived the life up till  where I was totally ablebodied and didnt have any challenges I still think of that when I get up every morning My psyche hasnt caught up Jason Its been really tough Alice I end up feeling overwhelmed Jasons here and desperately wants to help but cant Its rough More rough for Jason but its hard Jason Were trying Alice Were getting the community to go out and map places in their neighborhoods Whats amazing is that a lot of the ablebodied community loves this too They like knowing if theres a quiet place to go or moms want to know where to go with a stroller where theres no stairs Alice I think uncovering the financial issues surrounding disability is important In   we focused on the emotional things but I think that we would like to pull the curtain on financial issues and inclusion Were starting to do a lot of work with artists artists with disability  what would the world look like if we really prioritize including all people Jason People should find ways to get involved The easiest way to do that is the AXSmap people can use that as a way to really make the challenges that we face a bit easier
