Calling a girl too fat may increase her chances of being obese in the future new research suggests And thats regardless of what they weighed at the beginning of the study Making people feel bad about their weight can backfire said Janet Tomiyama an assistant professor of psychology at UCLA and the studys senior author It can be demoralizing And we know that when people feel bad they often reach out to food for comfort Tomiyama studies issues surrounding weight dieting stress and health at the DISH Lab at UCLA The study was conducted as a response to those who believe shaming people into losing weight is an effective way to deal with the the obesity epidemic Tomiyama said For example see the Strong  Life   sponsored by Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta To see whether simply being labeled too fat has an effect on a girls chances of gaining weight Tomiyama and her colleagues used data from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study that followed more than  girls from the time they were  until they were  When the participants were  years old they were asked if they had been called too fat by any one of a list people that included father mother brother sister best girlfriend boy you like best any other girl any other boy or a teacher If a girl answered yes to any of the above she was considered weight labeled The researchers found that girls who were labeled too fat by a family member were  times more likely to be obese at  Girls who were labeled too fat by a nonfamily member were  times more likely to be obese And lets reiterate that the effect of the girls BMI at the start of the study was removed Tomiyama said she understands that people who tell loved ones they are too fat often do so with good intentions I know its hard  if you call your child too fat she may gain weight but if you dont do anything are you enabling an unhealthy lifestyle she said Her advice Stay away from the word fat We dont really need to talk about fat or not fat if we are trying to talk about health she said Just say lets go eat healthier and lets go exercise and not even make weight part of the conversation She adds that weight is not necessarily a great marker for health anyway
