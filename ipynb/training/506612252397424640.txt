A federal judge in Baton Rouge La on Sunday night issued a temporary restraining order blocking the enforcement of a Louisiana abortion law just hours before it was to take effect The law passed overwhelmingly this year by the state Legislature requires all abortion doctors in the state to have admitting privileges at a hospital within  miles of the clinic where they work If doctors at clinics dont comply the clinic can be closed
