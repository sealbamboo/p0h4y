I entered the world of illness blogs for the first time when I learned through Facebook that a friend from middle school passed away last Friday from acute myeloid leukemia In the three months between his diagnosis and his death the friend whom Ill call Tom blogged beautifully and intimately on   a Web tool designed to help the seriously ill tell their stories and manage communication with friends and family Tom was  In his Web journal he wrote about the trauma of bone marrow exams and chemotherapy and his anxiety about finding a bone marrow transplant donor He supplemented his dispatches from the cancer ward with funny and raw Instagram photos   and YouTube videos and lyrics of the songs he was listening to Altogether it was a window painful but so rarely accessible into the exquisite horror of a harrowing prognosis and the burden of the toll of illness on his friends and family Tom was desperately worried about his wife his young son and his daughter on the way Yet his love for them rang out so clearly through his writings that the blog itself may one day be a treasured memento of the ways Tom held them close in his final days We share so many milestones now through social media And that includes health A   by Pew Research found that  percent of the users of social networking sites have followed their friends personal health experiences on Facebook So is it any surprise that the outer reaches of our social networks now also deliver us intimate stories of dying Palliative care experts who specialize in improving the quality of life for people with a lifethreatening illness say all this blogging and sharing about illness is helping to open up the conversation about death that we so often avoid As more people tell their story of dying with a terminal illness were seeing a change in how we look at illness and mortality says   national hospice medical director at Gentiva Health Services a large home health care company Illness and death are still so technically driven or medicalized So getting a safe space like a blog or social media to talk about it can be very empowering Blogging empowers patients to talk about illness outside the typical frame of the battle Sinclair says and reading the stories helps family members too They dont have to dodge the hard questions because the patient is able to tell their story openly and frankly says Sinclair who also edits the blog   The most prestigious medical institutions including Johns Hopkins and the University of Michigan now encourage patients to blog their illness through sites like CaringBridge and   In the hospice community a longtime volunteer and software engineer started   to offer similar services Other institutions like the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center in Washington DC run writing workshops Nancy Morgan who directs the centers arts and humanities program says she never instructs people to write directly about cancer There is a potential for wounding she says especially if the patients are depressed or otherwise feeling too vulnerable Most of the time they do choose to write about the cancer but its their choice While many illness blogs are read only by friends and family some patients go more public with their stories Right   Leroy Sievers and his wife Laurie Singer Sievers blogged their way through Leroys cancer which took his life in  And David Oliver a retired professor of gerontology at the University of Missouri and his wife Debbie a palliative care and hospice expert at the same university have kept a video blog of Davids illness on   and   Still some bloggers keep their blogs private from the people closest to their illness A    of  illness bloggers by researchers at Tufts University School of Medicine found that only  in  of the writers shared their blogs with their health providers Holding back from doctors and nurses like that could be a missed opportunity  and not just for the patient according to Sinclair I think these blogs help physicians and nurses see their patients as people he says But there are boundaries and some health care professionals are looking for opportunities to get closer while others want to shield themselves Sinclair says that when patients have shared their blogs with him hes enjoyed them I think it helps us check up on our own mortality Am I doing the things I want to do Am I making a difference These are positive questions that can get lost in the shuffle of the day
