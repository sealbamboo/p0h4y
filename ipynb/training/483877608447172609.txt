Intensive physiotherapy is the traditional way to treat the  people who have a stroke in the UK every year Thats what Anne Hopwood is doing as she slowly moves her right arm back and forth across a table guided gently by her physio  She lost movement on the right side of her body when she fell ill last November The repetitive exercises are designed to get the brain and arm to communicate again after being damaged by the stroke But Anne knows rehab is a long haul It was bad when I first had it she says Now I can walk with husband Peter in the house up and down the steps I couldnt do that before But just down the corridor from where Anne is having her physiotherapy at North Tyneside Hospital a piece of cuttingedge technology offers the prospect of a revolution in stroke rehabilitation Here another stroke patient Tom Means a yearold electrician is working with a stateoftheart robot His right arm damaged by a stroke in March is strapped on to a robotic limb which he grips with his fist Through moving his own damaged arm Tom is trying make a cursor hit targets on a computer screen  Again in trying to hit the targets hes practising repetitive movements  But the robot can accurately gauge how much movement he has and how strong his arm is becoming its all helping Tom back to an independent life When youve had a stroke every bit of exercise and movement you can do is a big help he says  Using the robot alongside my other exercises is ideal for me and whats great about the robot is that it also helps my handeye coordination Ive only had a few sessions so far However Ive really felt the difference in my arm as Ive got a lot more movement and much more strength  Im under no illusions that its going to be a lot of hard work but its all worthwhile because I know its going to make me better The technology has already proved its worth in the United States Now for the first time it is being tested in the UK as part of a fiveyear trial at North Tyneside in collaboration with Newcastle University as well as three other centres in Romford Cambridge and Glasgow  Helen Rodgers a professor of stroke care at the Institute for Ageing and Health at Newcastle University and a consultant stroke physician at Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust is leading the research  She says We have been looking at the research undertaken in the USA and we are working closely with colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to see if robotassisted training is an effective treatment  If shown to be effective robotassisted training has the potential to change how we provide NHS rehabilitation for people with arm weakness due to stroke Dr Hermano Igo Krebs a principal research scientist at MIT has pioneered the robot technology   The whole concept is revolutionising the practice of rehabilitation medicine by applying robotics that can assist and enhance recovery he says  Our focus is on helping clinicians to facilitate a functional recovery for their patients by using intensive and highly interactive robotic therapy to help people achieve their absolute optimum movement  Up to  of all stroke patients will be left with restricted movement in the arm so Dr Shamim Quadir of the Stroke Association is excited by the prospects for improved treatment opened up by the rehab robot The advantage of having this type of robotassisted training means that everything is recorded on a computer he says Because it is recorded to such a high level of detail this allows the scientists treating the patients to make better informed decisions Increasingly the NHS is using robots to deliver food dispense drugs  even to carry out operations And for those like Tom this new technology offers the chance of an improved recovery from what was once  not too long ago  a devastating illness
