An Air Force recruit whose organs were donated to four patients including a kidney recipient who died of rabies had at least two untreated raccoon bites several months before he became sick according to a medical journal report And tests confirm his rabiesinfected kidney caused the recipients disease  Doctors initially attributed the donors death to other causes But during an investigation prompted by the kidney recipients death in February lab testing found evidence of rabies in the donors brain tissue and also detected encephalitis a brain inflammation that can be caused by rabies   The virus was consistent with raccoon rabies and was nearly identical to a virus found in the transplanted kidney and other tissue from the recipient an Army veteran from Maryland said researchers from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others in a report published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association   Investigators dont know if organs given to three other patients  the North Carolina donors heart liver and second kidney  were infected with the rabies virus but all three were considered at risk Their recipients received antirabies treatment and to date remain well said CDC researcher Dr Neil Vora the lead author   The donor was yearold William Edward Small an avid outdoorsman from North Carolina who got sick after a fishing trip in Florida where he was undergoing Air Force training   Smalls initial symptoms included nausea vomiting and fever  which could indicate rabies but also other less serious conditions that are much more common Doctors thought Small had eaten tainted fish   Questioned during the organ procurement process relatives said they didnt know of any recent risk of rabies exposure and doctors did not test him   Investigators say they learned during subsequent interviews that Small trapped raccoons for use as bait during huntingdog training exercises and had been bitten at least twice by the animals  months and seven months before developing symptoms He was not treated for those bites   If you dont ask specific questions you dont get specific answers said Dr Michael Green chairman of an advisory committee on disease transmission for the United Network for Organ Sharing   At the time these questions are being asked initially families are often traumatized in shock Green said Theyre losing a loved one They may not be thinking normally or straight or remember all those details   While the case is rare it underscores the need to improve screening for wouldbe organ donors with suspected encephalitis the reports authors say They say a uniform donor questionnaire could help better identify risk factors for the virus and that rabies should be considered in donors with unexplained encephalitis   The United Network for Organ Sharing issued guidance last year to help organ procurement organizations screen for encephalitis and other central nervous system infections in potential donors It urged caution in accepting organs from donors with an untreated central nervous system infection   The researchers want to improve awareness that rabies can be the cause of encephalitis said coauthor Dr Sridhar Basavaraju another CDC researcher But he added We wouldnt want to mandate any screening that would potentially exclude transplantable organs   The study is based on a review of laboratory tests and medical records and interviews with relatives of the organ donor and recipient It provides the most detailed account of the chain of events that led to the two deaths and the investigation that followed which prompted health authorities to recommend vaccines for dozens of people who were in contact with the donor or recipients   The case attracted public attention because of the rare circumstances including the long time between infection and death of the transplant recipient  about a year and a half   It was just the third documented transmission of rabies through a solid organ transplant the report says   Also there are only roughly two human rabies deaths in the United States each year and all but two domestic cases between  and  were linked to bats according to the report The authors say raccoons pose an underrecognized risk for infection and their spread into urban areas raises concern   The patient who received the North Carolina donors kidney at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda Md in September  has not been publicly identified
