 Choirmaster cheerleader challenger and champion Im chief executive of Manchester mental health and social care trust  Because I wanted to make a difference to peoples lives Greater integration between services and more flexibility among providers Patientcentred care depends on everyone having a clear common purpose focused entirely on the individual  the day I qualified as a registered general nurse  constantly flexing and adapting the resources we are given to ensure we continue to deliver the same level of service We serve some of the most vulnerable members of our community yet mental health services remain woefully underfunded  unrealistic expectations With an ageing population increasingly complex healthcare needs and more sophisticated medical interventions now available to us we need to reset our expectations of the NHS which also means reevaluating the demands we make on   staff We need to be clear about what staff can safely deliver despite cuts in funding and dwindling staff resources  committed compassionate and professional They care about those who use our services and believe that the voice of the patient should shape the way that we develop and deliver our services  my passion for nursing and for the NHS as a beloved institution has never left me I just want to make a difference and to help people be the best that they can be every day  am never happier than when Im out and about in our services  and theyd be right I try to get out to see teams at least one day a week and that keeps me both grounded and reenergised  get out into the great outdoors and play a round of golf It can be difficult to find time especially during the winter when the nights are shorter but I do what I can because it keeps me fit and helps me to relax  everyone has their own perspective and contribution to offer Some of the best ideas come from the most unexpected sources so you have to keep an open mind and ear and actually listen to those who know the services best  the need to put the patient at the centre of all that we do And the need to make this more than an aspirational quote but a real way of being for everyone across the organisation  Dont try to anticipate the future Remain true to your values stick to your professional principles and stay passionate about what you do Other things will change but that must remain at your core  part of a holistic pathway of care services working hand in hand with other clinicians medics and social care professionals to put the patients needs first and provider interest second  Seeing the difference staff make to real people and their daily lives every day  Any tragedy that occurs as a result of some vulnerable member of our community not having had access to the help and support he or she needed  A great outcome for patients  and a good joke  Not a lot The only thing that stops me sleeping is excitement If Ive got a really big presentation or visit  or golf tournament  coming up that Im looking forward to that can sometimes keep me awake
