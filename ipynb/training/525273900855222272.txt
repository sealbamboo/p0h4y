An unusual government moratorium aimed at controversial research with highrisk viruses has halted important public health research scientists told an advisory committee to the federal government on Wednesday The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy   Friday that the federal government will for now not fund any new research proposals that might make three particular viruses more virulent or contagious The three viruses are those that give rise to influenza severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome The White House also   it would encourage those currently conducting this type of work  whether federally funded or not  to voluntarily pause their research while risks and benefits are being reassessed Some researchers who study these germs say they received ceaseanddesist letters from their funder the National Institutes of Health The moratorium has hit efforts to develop a smallanimal model for MERS the troubling virus thats recently emerged in the Middle East says   a biologist who studies influenza SARS and MERS at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases She notes that currently scientists have no rodent models to use for testing drugs or other treatments for MERS Her group developed such a model for SARS by creating a form of the virus that makes mice sicker and she wants to do the same for MERS This moratorium will stop that research Subbarao told members of an advisory committee called the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity at their Wednesday meeting on the NIH campus in Bethesda Md I have concerns about whether thats the wisest thing to do in the face of an ongoing outbreak without a small animal model This is potentially the worst time for this type of pause to occur agreed   of the University of Maryland School of Medicine a MERS researcher who notes that over the last several weeks a dozen more cases of the illness have occurred Whats more a flu researcher named   of St Jude Childrens Research Hospital told the committee that her ceasework order from NIH inexplicably told her to stop work on projects that included surveillance of circulating flu viruses And that really concerns me from a public health standpoint she said The chair of the NSABB said the committee would relay these issues to higherups one official noted that waivers could be granted under the temporary moratorium All of this is the latest twist in a long stormy debate that   about three years ago after two teams of governmentfunded scientists created mutant forms of the bird flu virus HN This type of research has   the scientific community with biologists lining up on opposing sides Proponents of socalled gainoffunction experiments say the work is vital to understand what these viruses are capable of because of the risk that they might mutate in the wild and cause a natural pandemic Critics say the experiments effectively create supergerms that could wreak havoc and potentially kill millions of people if they got out of the lab In January of  flu researchers voluntarily agreed to a   that ended up lasting about a year The government adopted new policies to give certain highrisk flu experiments extra oversight But then came the recent lab   at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that involved anthrax and a deadly flu virus Suddenly government officials worried about lab safety and decided they had to temporarily stop research that could create more dangerous pathogens as they began a yearlong public process to look at the risks and benefits The NSABB will be weighing in as will the prestigious   The government will also be hiring outside experts to do risk analyses The final goal is a new policy to guide decisions about what should get funded I think the moratorium is long overdue says epidemiologist   of the Harvard School of Public Health I would have preferred to have the risks and benefits weighed before these experiments started But I think its very important that we pause now and evaluate them in light of the increased concern over laboratory safety and the possibility of an accident that could lead to a pandemic Lipsitch notes that the issue is not work with dangerous pathogens in general but rather research that could create novel virulent and transmissible agents that might spark a pandemic in people I was pleased to see the pause announced says   director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centers Center for Health Security I agree that risk assessment of this work is needed I think the risks are potentially extraordinary But others say they think halting this research is counterproductive Im disappointed I think it is a kneejerk reaction to a very complex problem says   a microbiologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Virologist   of Boston University also opposes the ban People dont completely understand what is allowed and what is not allowed he notes But Duprex thinks starting this deliberative process is reasonable They have outlined a timerestricted process for consultation he says Thats good for the people who are vested in the experiments because they at least know there is a process which is not openended After all the flu research community has already gone through one yearlong pause After the voluntary moratorium on HN transmission studies new regulations and policies were issued flu researcher   of the University of WisconsinMadison noted in an email I do not know what else is needed We will never be able to satisfy critics who call for zero risk  He had government approval for additional HN transmission studies but says they will now be paused There are other projects for which we need guidance from NIH to determine whether they are subject to the pause Kawaoka wrote adding that continued pauses to influenza virus research will delay progress in science and have longterm effects on public health such as slowing improvements in vaccines and antivirals
