Many families with children who have autism count on their insurance to help pay for expensive longterm treatment But a recent   may undermine existing coverage protections some advocates say and they are concerned that other states might follow suit  affects  in  children according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The developmental disorder includes a   that are characterized by difficulties in communication and social interaction as well as repetitive behaviors In recent years advocates for people with autism and their families have pushed hard to get better insurance coverage prompting   that require insurers to cover autism treatment according to Autism Speaks an advocacy organization In addition some advocates look to new policies on mental health coverage to aid families Until recent years coverage for mental health conditions was often significantly more limited than coverage for physical ailments The   of  required that mental health benefits be covered at least as generously as medicalsurgical benefits in large group plans The Affordable Care Act   this year to   Advocates however are concerned that state actions like those in Connecticut could chip away at hardwon coverage gains That state has defined autism behavioral therapy as a type of medical benefit not subject to the mental health parity law a move that allows insurers more latitude to limit the benefits they offer The whole reason you have mental health parity is that mental health conditions were being singled out for discriminatory treatment says Daniel Unumb executive director of   And thats what were still facing with autism Connecticut is one of the states that mandate coverage for autism spectrum disorders Among other things the law requires health plans to cover behavioral therapy up to  annually for children younger than age   for children between  and  and  for children age  or  The states coverage mandate applies to insured group and individual plans Although selffunded plans that pay employees claims directly rather than buy insurance arent required to cover behavioral therapy and other treatments spelled out in Connecticuts autism coverage mandate most do says Cheryl Hughes an attorney at human resources consultant Mercers Washington Resource Group Connecticuts changes deal with a part of the federal health law that prohibits plans from imposing annual or lifetime monetary limits on  categories of coverage called the essential health benefits The federal Department of Health and Human Services has said its   however restricting the number of physician visits or days in the hospital for example Plans can convert those financial coverage limits to visit or unitoftreatment limits that are actuarially equivalent to the dollar amounts While the change shouldnt necessarily result in less generous coverage experts say the lack of consistency in how plans convert those dollar limits may sow confusion and limit access to care For example the  limit was converted to  hours of care annually by one Connecticut insurer while another calculated it was equivalent to  visits annually says Katie Keith director of research at the   a consultancy that works with autism organizations It will mean a lot of work for families at the front end to understand what theyre getting says Keith The conversion inconsistencies might not have mattered except for another wrinkle in Connecticuts approach to autism coverage According to the Connecticut bulletin the state classifies autism behavioral therapy as a    something that helps people develop or keep skills for daily living  and therefore it is defined as a medical service rather than a mental health service As such they are not considered subject to mental health parity says Donna Tommelleo a spokeswoman for the insurance department Under the federal health law states can define the   of which rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices is one The state may be attempting to implement the laws provisions  rather than limiting coverage  by defining autism behavioral treatments as habilitative services But Connecticuts interpretation gives insurers the green light to impose the visit and hourly limits that generally wouldnt be permitted under the mental health parity law Ohio and the District of Columbia have also defined behavioral therapy as a habilitative benefit but they have taken a different approach For example the District of Columbias description of its essential health benefits on its   says that coverage for habilitative services must include applied behavioral analysis ABA for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder In Connecticuts case they appear to be doing this to avoid coverage rather than enhance coverage says Sara Rosenbaum a professor at George Washington Universitys School of Public Health and Health Services The parity rule seems to say you cant play games like this
