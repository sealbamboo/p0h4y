Efforts to redirect patients away from busy AE departments will not work doctors have said  as a new study shows most need to be seen there  The College of Emergency Medicine review of more than  patients found only  could have been treated in the community Last year NHS England suggested  could  and used that to justify a major shakeup of AE units The difference amounts to m patients the college said The college is not opposed to NHS Englands proposed creation of a twotier system involving major and minor units But it said the expectation that large numbers of visits to AE could be saved was likely to be wrong and it was important to take other steps to relieve pressures One of these includes locating GPs in or alongside AE units to filter out the less urgent cases  something which is already happening in a number of hospitals The review carried out by consultancy Candesic looked at what was happening in  AE units over a hour period in March It found  of patients needed to be seen in AE  although  could have been dealt with by a GP on site if there had been one College president Dr Clifford Mann said The fact that only  of attendees at emergency departments could be safely redirected to a primary care clinician without the need for emergency department assessment is a statistic that must be heeded by those who wish to reconfigure services Katherine Murphy of the Patients Association said For many years patients have been wrongly criticised for abusing AE departments and wasting NHS resources but these latest figures show that the majority of these patients are genuinely ill and require urgent medical treatment  We cannot ignore these figures There is an urgent need to look at the provision of NHS care in a joinedup way and ensure that the patient comes first in every decision made But a spokeswoman for NHS England said There have been several attempts to quantify the percentage of AE attendances that could be readily managed elsewhere with estimates ranging between  and   Variation in these figures is due to the AE departments studied the types of patients attending locally available services and the subjective judgement of those involved in giving the clinical opinion This new figure from the College of Emergency Medicine therefore falls within the expected range She said NHS England recognised the value of placing GPs alongside AE units but said other measures such as better selfcare advice an enhanced NHS  and ambulance services capable of offering skilled treatment at the scene were also important
