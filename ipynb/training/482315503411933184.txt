Researchers believe they may have a new way to test a womans risk for breast cancer even if she doesnt have an inherited genetic mutation The test looks not for mutations but for changes to how DNA functions  in this case the BRCA breast cancer gene Its important because most cases of breast cancer are not caused by inherited DNA mutations About  percent of breast cancer cases can be explained by genetic susceptibility which leaves most to outside causes such as diet exercise smoking and alcohol use Women who carry the signature are at particularly higher risk of developing breast cancer in the future said Martin Widschwendter at University College London who led the study The researchers looked for changes made by a process called methylation which can step up or down a genes function BRCA brakes cell growth stopping the outofcontrol proliferation that turns a healthy cell into a tumor Widschwendter and colleagues tested blood from women with and without BRCA mutations before they ever developed breast cancer Both groups had similar changes in the DNA methylation they report in the journal Genome Medicine It was able to predict breast cancer risk several years before diagnosis Widschwendter said The changes may be caused by factors that raise breast cancer risk such as obesity and drinking too much alcohol he says The researchers tested their signature in three different groups of women and found it could consistently predict who would develop cancer five to  years later I think this is a productive direction says Dr Jeffrey Weitzel director for  at the City of Hope Cancer Center in Duarte California Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women It will be diagnosed in more than  US women this year and will kill  Theres a debate over how best to prevent it and who benefits most from screening Right now women get conflicting advice on when to get mammograms  starting at age  or age  depending on whos talking And theres disagreement over how often women should get one  once a year every other year or even every three years A simple test that could show whos at the highest risk of the most dangerous types of breast cancer could help women decide A test could help us tailor screening and risk reduction for women said Weitzel For instance recent research suggested that women with the very highest risk should  We know that we can change risk Weitzel said Women at high risk can also take tamoxifen to reduce that risk and those at the very highest risk can consider having mastectomies to reduce  but not eliminate  the likelihood that they will get breast cancer Most of us think the absolute risk should be  percent or more before you offer surgical removal said Weitzel The test is far from ready for prime time Right now its not terribly accurate says Widschwendter It was only tried in a few women And the team tested blood It might be better to test cervical cells perhaps as a test alongside the regular Pap smear that many women get because these cells respond to the same hormones associated with most cases of breast cancer Researchers are still working to understand all the underlying causes of breast cancer Just this month another team discovered that   also had a slightly higherthanusual breast cancer risk More than   are linked with breast cancer risk BRCA and BRCA are the best known
