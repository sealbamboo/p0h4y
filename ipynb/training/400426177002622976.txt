A twotier AE system in England should be created as part of an overhaul of services NHS chiefs say The   by NHS England suggested the biggest  to  units  specialising in heart attacks strokes and trauma  be called major emergency centres It would leave the remaining  to  AEs  known as emergency centres  to deal with less serious conditions It also suggested changes to the way ambulance crews and the new  phone service work to decongest AEs Greater coordination between community services such as GPs and pharmacists would also help it said The measures have been put forward in response to the growing pressures on accident and emergency departments Patient numbers have risen by  in the past decade and last winter the problems got so severe that the NHS missed its fourhour waiting time target Extra money has been set aside to help the NHS through this winter and the next one But this review aims to set out the longterm vision for the service Many of the proposals are already in operation somewhere and in essence the review is calling for this to be formalised across the system For example there are already a number of AE units that act as major centres in everything but name But by setting a target of having between  and  major emergency centres it means this will have to be extended across the health service This is likely to end up a controversial process because of the fear some hospitals could lose services NHS medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh who led the review said AE is creaking at the seams It is not broken but it is struggling  We need to change the way we work But what we are suggesting here already exists in places we are just trying to formalise it so it is available for everyone The review said there also needed to be further changes to the system if pressure was going to be relieved About  of people who attend AE do not need treating there What is more the problems developed by a fifth of patients who are eventually admitted to hospital with emergency conditions could have been avoided with better and earlier treatment in the community The review said key to tackling these problems was ensuring patients got access to the services that were best suited to them first time To achieve this  which has been beset by problems since it was launched in April to replace NHS Direct will need to be much more responsive giving patients direct phone access to doctors nurses and other health professionals Ambulance crews will need to treat more patients at the scene to reduce the number of patients transferred to hospital Meanwhile there needs to be greater coordination between GPs pharmacists and the network of minor injury clinics and walkin centres to give patients  access to care outside of hospital Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said Labour welcomed Sir Bruces report but deplored the governments attempt to avoid presenting it to Parliament and abdicate all responsibility for the crisis in AE Ministers said this report would have lessons for the immediate winter as well as the longer term he added But they are failing to act and their response remains crisis what crisis They are forcing AEs to go into winter with too few nurses doctors and beds He said the prime minister had made it harder to get a GP appointment closed NHS walkin centres and scrapped NHS Direct leaving people with no alternative but to go to AE Patients Association chief executive Katherine Murphy said the review had presented a promising vision At present there is genuine confusion amongst some patients who then opt for AE as a safe default option she added College of Emergency Medicine president Dr Clifford Mann welcomed the proposals although he said NHS chiefs would need to be careful the reorganisation of AEs did not lead to detrimental increased journey times He also said Any plan to provide emergency care must be based upon an adequate number of appropriately skilled clinicians and on this matter the review is disappointingly silent The changes will now go out to consultation and the review team will spend the next six months looking at the cost and staffing implications before producing another report in the spring It is likely to take three to five years before the overhaul is completed
