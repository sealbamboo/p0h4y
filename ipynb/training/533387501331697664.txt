If it was a snake it would have bitten us The secret to stopping a deadly stomach virus may be sitting right there in our guts scientists   Thursday in the journal   Or more specifically the treatment is in our microbiome  the trillions of bacteria that inconspicuously hang out in the GI tracts Immunologists at Georgia State University found that a tiny piece of gut bacteria can prevent and cure a rotavirus infection in mice The study suggests a whole new benefit of the   to fight off viruses says   an immunologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center who wasnt involved in the study Its tremendously important work she says Of course humans arent mice So the findings need to be taken with a grain of salt  and tested in people But its the first study Im aware of showing that gut bacteria can trigger the immune system to protect against a virus Hooper says And rotavirus is a bad one Anyone who has had a bad bout of food poisoning has a good idea about how nasty   can be  projectile vomiting painful cramping and watery diarrhea for up to a week Its not fun For young children in poor countries rotavirus is one of the most deadly diseases More than a halfmillion children under age  die from it each year There are two   for the virus They work well in the US But so far they havent been very effective in many places where theyre needed the most  India subSaharan Africa and parts of Asia   may be one reason for the discrepancy Immunologist   who led the study hopes the bacteria protein from the gut will one day be used to treat rotavirus outbreaks in developing countries  although thats still quite a long way off But he says the findings also change how we think about the immune system more broadly We were very very surprised that a bacteria component offered powerful protection against a viral infection Gewirtz says The basic thinking before was that bacteria have certain components on their surface that activate the immune system to fight bacteria not viruses His team has some evidence that the bacteria protein may protect against other viruses such as influenza  although it doesnt work as well on flu as on rotavirus Gewirtz says So what is this magic antiviral bullet Its those hairlike threads that dangle off some bacteria and help them swim Yup thats right the flagella When Gewirtz and his team injected pieces of the flagella under the mices skin a part of the immune system kicked into action and stopped the rotavirus infection dead in its tracks But these bacteria  and their flagella  are in our gut Would they still be able to talk to the immune system Hooper thinks so Heres why Just like our hair flagella are constantly falling off the surfaces of bacteria as they swim around in the gut Cool immune cells called dendritic cells are constantly surveying whats going on in the body Hooper says They can bind to the pieces of flagella in the gut and then mobilize other immune cells to come and fight the viral infection If this holds true in people Hooper says it would make me think twice about taking antibiotics Not only are they going to screw around with your gut bacteria but they may make you more susceptible to viruses
