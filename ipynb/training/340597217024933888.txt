Marc Fucarile reached a huge milestone this week He was one of the last two Boston Marathon bombing survivors to be released from the hospital Fucarile spent  days in   and he hopes someday to get back to work with a roofing company But first he will have to go through rehab He lost his right leg and his left leg was badly hurt He also suffered head injuries Hes eligible for compensation from a fund for victims called the   Almost  million has been   to the fund so far The deadline to apply is in two weeks yet the full extent of Fucariles injuries wont be known for years Survivors with permanent brain injuries or those who lost both legs will receive more money than single amputees The application is based on injuries to date and there are no plans to extend the deadline Fucarile is not complaining but hes also not sure which category he fits in The One Funds a great thing he says I cant believe how many people have stepped up The good thats out there in this world is just phenomenal And you know were all hurting I dont know what my outcomes going to be when I get out of here and what kind of bills Im going to have And thats starting to stress me out From his bed on his last day at Mass General Fucarile described what happened to him on April  By the time a firefighter finished applying a tourniquet to his leg all available ambulances had left the marathon finish line full of casualties A police officer carried Fucarile his skin still smoldering to a van typically used to transport prisoners and raced to the hospital It was a rough ride I think I might have been on a bench part of the seat and the firefighter was trying to hold me on there I dont know I was slamming my head a lot Fucarile says Surgeons told Fucarile that if he had arrived two or three minutes later he would have died     In the hospital he endured multiple surgeries and skin grafts induced comas and dozens of tests In rehab he will have to start rebuilding his arm strength first because his remaining leg is still too damaged for physical therapy He looks down and cups the stub of his right thigh the wound layered in bandages Its still wide open he says It hasnt been healed or shut yet It has its moments where it has sharp pains and the meds cant do nothing about it Fucariles left leg in a kneelength cast is red scarred and still riddled with scrap metal The left leg is improving he says Its questionable how functional its going to be Potentially I could be a double amputee but the doctors have a strong hope for it Its going to take me and therapy to get it to really work Family members packed Fucariles room for a sendoff Doctors and nurses stop by too remembering a charred mangled man barely holding onto life To nurse anesthetist Amanda Heidbreder who saw him that day in the operating room Fucarile was simply Distress Patient C I felt determined that I was going to find out what his name was who he was what he was all about and now I know she says Hes an inspiration to a lot of people The evil that happened is not going to beat him Hes going to beat it Jen Regan is Fucariles fiancee and the mother of their yearold son Gavin He cries at night asking for his dad But on this day Regan cried too tears of relief and gratitude Every days been a step forward and then four steps back and finally we have a solid step forward Regan says Im excited for Gavin to see him in a new place and you know its just a good day Regan and Fucarile hope to marry soon But shes told Fucarile it wont happen until hes ready to dance I dont have a choice shes going to make me he says Like I said with one prosthetic or two Im still going to do it Fucarile wont know if his left leg can be saved for a year or more He expects therapy and related costs to continue for the rest of his life
