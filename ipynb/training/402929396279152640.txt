Teenagers with family members in the military were more likely to contemplate suicide if their relatives were deployed overseas multiple times according to researchers from USC Most research on the mental health of military children has focused on those who are already receiving treatment or attending special summer camps Those kinds of studies dont allow experts to estimate the rates of psychiatric problems among all military children or make comparisons with other children So the USC team tried a different approach The researchers piggybacked on a statewide health survey of public school students in  and added questions for seventh ninth and thgraders in four Southern California school districts  all near military bases  about the military status and deployment histories of their parents and siblings Students with close relatives serving in the military were no more likely to suffer mental health problems than students with no relatives on active duty the team found The key factor was how many times a parent or sibling  currently serving or not  had been deployed during the previous decade A single deployment in the year period raised those rates to  and  respectively More than one deployment pushed them even higher to  and  All of those changes were statistically significant meaning they were too large to attribute to chance according to the study The ninth and thgraders who took the survey were also asked whether they had seriously considered suicide in the previous year The researchers found that  of the teens whose relatives had never deployed answered yes along with  of those whose relatives had been deployed once and  of those whose relatives had deployed more than once Only the difference between  and  was large enough to be considered statistically significant the team reported Theres a cumulative effect of deployment said study leader Julie Cederbaum a professor at the USC School of Social Work The researchers said they were aware of suicides in the school districts they surveyed but they did not attempt to measure suicide rates While the government has been concerned about a surge in suicides among activeduty service members over the last decade it is unclear whether their children and schoolage younger siblings have also been killing themselves at increased rates The researchers gave of the students an additional survey that asked more detailed questions about suicidal behavior in the previous year The results have not yet been published but they are worrisome said Ron Astor of USC who studies schools students and families Among military children he said  reported having made a suicide plan and nearly  made an attempt Nearly  said they had received medical treatment after an attempt The figures for children without parents or siblings in the military were   and  respectively The researchers said they would soon publish another analysis showing that deployments of family members raise the likelihood that students will be involved in fights or carry weapons to school Were seeing the shadows of a long war Astor said
