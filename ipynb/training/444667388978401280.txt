People are less likely to yawn when others do as they get older a study has found    Contagious yawning is linked more closely to a persons age than their ability to empathise as previously thought USbased scientists said  It also   than tiredness or energy levels  Researchers are now looking at whether the ability to catch yawns from other people is inherited with the hope of helping treat mental health disorders  Autism and schizophrenia sufferers are reportedly less able to catch yawns researchers said so understanding the genes that might code for contagious yawning could illuminate new pathways for treatment In the study published in the journal Plos One  participants were shown a threeminute video showing other people yawning  Each subject had to click a button every time they yawned Overall  of the participants yawned Of those  of people aged under  yawned compared with  of people aged between  and  and  of people aged over     assistant professor of medicine at Duke University in Durham North Carolina led the study She said This is the first study to look at a whole bunch of factors It is the largest study in terms of the number of people involved to date Dr Cirulli said she did not know why contagious yawning decreased with age  She added that although age was the most important predictor of contagious yawning only  of the variation in whether or not a participant yawned was explained by their age The vast majority of variation in the contagious yawning response was just not explained said Dr Cirulli  The study used questionnaires to test the participants empathy levels of tiredness and sleep patterns  Meanwhile intelligence was assessed using cognitive tests  professor of psychology at the University of Maryland in Baltimore County said the study was unique as it marked the first time a link between ageing and contagious yawning had been shown  He said the study would help to get down to the neurological nittygritty of contagious behaviours and mental health disorders such as autism and schizophrenia  Prof Provine said the findings could also help to understand why laughing and coughing were so contagious  He added Contagious acts such as yawning and laughing remind us that we are often mindless beasts of the herd not rational beings in full conscious control of our behaviour
