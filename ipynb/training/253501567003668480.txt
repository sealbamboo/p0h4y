A sunny day at the beach has plusses and minuses for your health A little bit of sun can help your body produce   but the suns ultraviolet radiation raises your   And it turns out UV radiation poses another threat  it physically weakens your skin As far as barriers go in the biological world healthy skin is a pretty awesome one And its one you definitely want to keep intact which can be a challenge Skin cells have to stick together to keep your insides in and bend with your body as you move Skin has to be permeable enough for you to sweat but impenetrable to noxious chemicals bacteria and viruses The skins top layer  the stratum corneum  is just  microns thick about half that of wax paper and is your first line of protection against the outside world Every single day its insulted by all sorts of abrasions and contact with surfaces says   a bioengineer at Stanford University Its actually a remarkably good barrier which is why getting medications through the skin is so difficult because many molecules simply cant penetrate Dauskardts lab studies the biomechanics of skin How much does it stretch when you stress it How stiff is it That sort of thing In a   just published in the   Dauskardt and his colleagues exposed pieces of stratum corneum from a human cadaver to UVB radiation Thats the type of UV light that the top layers of your skin absorb In the experiments the researchers used UVB equivalent to   or  consecutive days in Florida sunlight Then they tested the treated skin How easily did it crumble when pressed How much force did it take to tear or crack it How hard was it to separate the layers of its cells Bottom line UV light reduces skins strength and dries it out putting a strain on the cells Skin exposed to UV light breaks cracks and chaps more easily UV radiation really is a double whammy says Dauskardt On one hand youre making skin weaker and easier to break and on the other hand youre actually increasing the stresses in the skin so theres more stress available to cause it to break At the microscopic level UV radiation changes the structures of integral proteins namely keratin and fat molecules called lipids that serve as the glue that holds skin cells together These lipids become less cohesive So even in deeper skin layers the cells just dont stick together as well The damage depends on the dose and the researchers used particularly high doses They estimate it takes at least  days of sun exposure for the skins top layer to start weakening Can goops and lotions help Maybe Most moisturizing products would help prevent the skin from drying out Dauskardt says but depending on what moisturizing product you use it potentially could even be damaging because it could aid in the absorption of UV light rather than blocking it Your best bet is sunscreen Dauskardts group has found in preliminary tests that most sunscreens block the physical damage What were trying to figure out now is whether some sunscreens and some molecules or nanoparticles that are typically used in sunscreens are more effective than others he says For Boston University dermatologist   the takehome message is clear UV exposure can damage skin in many ways including ways not yet investigated in all likelihood she tells Shots In the meantime she recommends SPF
