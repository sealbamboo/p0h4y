Whether or not music stirs inside each of us bears a living metronome at our core It may tick at  or  beats per minute in threequarter time or in sixeight erratically or like a Swiss clock The human heart quietly marks the rhythm of our lives A new study focusing on the music of Ludwig van Beethoven treats shifting musical rhythms as a sort of musical electrocardiogram In Beethovens dotted rhythms tempo shifts sudden pauses and composition notes a trio of researchers suggest that they have gleaned the distant echo of the German composers heart  An earlier version of this post said the study focused in part on Beethovens Piano Sonata No  in A flat major The study focused on among other pieces Piano Sonata No  in A flat major Opus   Where most hear greatness they hear cardiac arrhythmia Although definitive diagnoses died with him historians have speculated that Beethoven who died deaf at  suffered from medical conditions including alcoholinduced cirrhosis lead poisoning and syphilis Beethovens heart was found structurally sound upon autopsy in  But   the authors  a cardiologist an internal medicine specialist and a musicologist  cite the rhythmic turnabouts in three of the masters compositions to diagnose an irregular heartbeat What is clear from his personal letters and notes is that Beethoven began to lose his hearing around  at the age of  He composed the bulk of his music even as the sounds of the world around him dimmed  and that say the authors of the new study may have made him exquisitely attuned to his own heartbeat Some of his most haunting and ambitious works  the late string quartets the Mass in D minor Missa solemnis the Ninth Symphony in D minor  were composed after he became completely deaf in  This is entirely speculative said Dr Zachary D Goldberger of the University of Washington the cardiologist on the team At least it gives us a new dimension by which to listen to his music Goldberger said he and his coauthors focused on the rhythmic shifts and punctuations of three Beethoven compositions the Opus a called Les Adieux Opus  and the Piano Sonata No  in A flat major Opus  These works have been characterized by musicologists as particularly abrupt dramatic or unusual in music of Beethovens time The authors note the distinctive galloping rhythm of the Sonata in E flat majors adagio section and hear slow irregular heartbeats followed by racing irregular heartbeats in the allegro section that follows In the String Quartet No  the authors hear in a sevenmeasure section in the middle of the fifth movement the Cavatina a short paroxysm of an atrial tachyarrhythmia They cite Beethovens notation that the passage should be played beklemmt or heavy of heart And they note the  observation by pianist Jonathan Biss that the section always evoked a sensation of shortness of breath In the third movement of the Piano Sonata No  in A flat major the authors point to an arioso dolente or lamenting song preceding one of two fugues The left hand plays a repetitive run of notes that bears some resemblance to rapid tachyarrhythmia they write The right hand simultaneously plays an irregularly punctuated melody that bears some resemblance to dyspnea or shortness of breath which would not be an unusual sensation for someone experiencing a tachyarrhythmia When your heart beats irregularly from heart disease it does so in some predictable patterns said Dr Joel D Howell of the University of Michigan the teams internist who also has a PhD in the history and sociology of science We think we hear some of those same patterns in his music Beethovens litany of physical woes clearly predisposed him to atrial fibrillation atrial flutter or even multifocal atrial tachycardia Goldberger Howell and University of Michigan musicologist Steven M Whiting wrote in the paper But they acknowledged that their observations are far from proof of those conditions Similar rhythmic intricacies are found in other works by many composers and cardiac arrhythmia can hardly be ascribed to all who use irregular syncopation However in highly charged passages of certain pieces the possibility of cardiac arrhythmia can lend a quite physical aspect to ones interpretation of the music in question they wrote These passages can seem in an unexpectedly literal sense to be heartfelt
