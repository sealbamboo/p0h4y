If the ticktock of your biological clock is getting more insistent but youre not worried because you think you can always rely on   or other assisted reproductive technologies later on you may want to to reconsider According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine roughly  percent of women now wait until theyre  or older to try to get pregnant There are several excellent reasons for this For one as of  there are more women workers in the United States than male workers And as more women work and enjoy fulfilling careers theyve been waiting longer to start families But regardless of these social and demographic transformations theres one immutable biological fact that hasnt changed A womans   begins to decline in her late twenties to early thirties Unfortunately not enough women appreciate the full reality of their ticking biological clock and are putting misplaced faith in the ability of fertility technologies to offset the challenges of trying to conceive at an advanced age Thats the finding of a new study conducted by doctors at the Yale Fertility Center and published in the journal   Doctors at the Yale center say theyve seen a worrying trend among many of their older female patients particularly women over  Women whove had trouble conceiving naturally seem to take it for granted they will easily get pregnant once they try assisted reproductive technology ART such as IVF The problem is that while IVF has grown in popularity it doesnt always work According to statistics from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology between  and  the number of IVF cycles undergone by women  or older increased by  percent Yet as Yale Fertility Center director Pasquale Patrizio MD points out in a news release greater numbers of IVF cycles havent led to greater numbers of babies The number of IVF cycles resulting in pregnancy in women above age  mostly remained static at  percent in  Dr Patrizio said Then whats the source of this misplaced faith in IVF as a slam dunk The Yale doctors place part of the blame on splashy media coverage of the growing ranks of celebrities from Tina Fey  a daughter at   to Kelly Preston  a son at  whove given birth after  Such news they said in the release makes it seem as if these women effortlessly give birth at advanced ages The truth of course is that we rarely know the full story about a celebritys private path to pregnancy Regardless of the root of the confusion Patrizio recognizes it can be extremely frustrating for otherwise   happy and successful women not to be able to conceive Their typical reaction is what do you mean you cannot help me he admits in the release I am healthy I exercise and I cannot have my own baby In fact this painful confusion highlights the importance of a key recommendation of the Yale paper which is that doctors must do a better job of educating women about ways they can preserve their chances of conceiving For instance one available technique is oocyte cryopreservation in which a woman freezes eggs during her younger years and then essentially donates those eggs back to herself when shes older While this process is recommended regularly for cancer patients it could be used more frequently with healthy younger women  if they knew about it As Patrizio says reproductive aging is irreversible but there are options to safeguard against the risk of future
