During this procedure doctors place a small adjustable band around your stomach to make it smaller The smaller stomach pouch controls your hunger helping you to eat less throughout the day The surgery is reversible meaning you can get the band taken out when you reach your goal weight   Before I had the surgery I went to an information session Everyone at the session said that getting the gastric band would be just a start They said that patients must exercise and eat healthy meals in order for the weight to come off and stay off  I listened to what they were saying but I figured it would be different with me I thought that this surgery alone was my golden ticket  Turns out they were right In making the decision to get the gastric band I was also making the decision to eat healthier and exercise on a regular basis  Eating healthy didnt happen overnight My doctor gave me a list of foods that I could and could not eat The list of foods that I could not eat was a challenge If you ate the wrong thing or ate too fast it would come back up  With the gastric band you cant eat pasta rice or bread That wasnt too hard for me to get used to My biggest problem was candy and potato chips I struggled for months before I finally got the hang of eating healthy   Today a typical days meals consist of  A spinach banana strawberries pineapple raspberries and vitamin smoothie and light yogurt for breakfast  Grilled chicken or grilled fish and veggies for lunch  Peanuts as an afternoon snack  Grilled chicken or fish and veggies for dinner With my diet firmly in place I made up my mind that I was going to put my all into exercising So I got a trainer and began to work out with him  He made me get up and out of the house  I had to meet him at the gym and he was not taking no for an answer He started me off with lifting very light weights working my arms one day then my chest the next He started me walking to build my way up to running In as little as two weeks I started to see that I was losing weight  Seeing that made it much easier to stick with my trainer  Eventually I lost enough weight and gained enough confidence to apply to join the CNN Fit Nation team  Now I normally work out twice a day  In the early morning three to four times a week I meet my trainer to do weights and cardio In the evenings I swim run or bike  I only rest one day a week Some days I work out harder than other days but I can truly say Ive fallen in love with exercise Many people think weightloss surgery is a copout  that getting the surgery automatically means youll lose weight But in reality the gastric band is only a tool If you dont eat right you wont lose the weight  If you dont exercise you wont lose the weight    So why get the surgery Knowing I have the band around my stomach pushes me to do what I need to do Nothing else worked  This works
