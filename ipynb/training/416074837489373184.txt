Today she is largely forgotten But thanks to   a new biography by   a Yale University medical historian readers can learn why she gained such fame And while Ms Kennys work was mostly in   which has nearly been eradicated her emphasis on the care of individual patients and close bedside observation could not be more relevant in an era dominated by randomized controlled trials Ms Kenny was an unlikely celebrity Born in Australia in  she became a bush nurse serving a largely rural population It was World War I that opened up her vistas she worked as a British army nurse on troop ships reaching the rank of lieutenant and earning the honorific title Sister for her service Contrary to popular belief Ms Kenny was not a nun In Australia and around the world the rates of polio were rising in the s and s Although only one in  cases damaged nerves in the spinal cord the viral disease was dreaded Most of its victims were children and young adults Those severely affected first developed   and body aches which progressed to varying degrees of   in hours to days The most advanced cases affected the brain stem and respiratory muscles those patients required iron lungs an early version of the respirator to breathe Five percent to  percent of paralyzed polio patients died and as many as half had persistent partial paralysis  Ms Kenny had encountered polio patients before the war and made a crucial observation Heated woolen cloths and muscle exercises seemed to relieve patients pain and contractures or muscle shortening which she thought resulted from muscle spasm in addition to nerve damage Plus Ms Kenny believed that patients needed to play an active role in their recovery learning the names of affected muscles and how they worked These interventions flew in the face of traditional polio treatment which emphasized using splints to immobilize paralyzed limbs Doctors believed that rest protected the damaged limbs and that persistent contractures could be treated by surgery Ms Kennys apparent successes led her to travel throughout Australia and England to demonstrate her techniques But it was in the United States where she achieved her greatest fame and lived out most of her life Based in Minneapolis she opened the Elizabeth Kenny Clinic to treat polio patients from across the country A  Hollywood movie   starred Rosalind Russell  Ms Kenny attracted passionate support from patients and families who believed that her ministrations had restored their strength and mobility In her  autobiography   Ms Kenny quoted one of her young patients as saying I want them rags that wells my legs The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis later known as the   provided financial support for her efforts  But Ms Kenny was criticized as well Physicians and physical therapists who relied on immobilization believed there was no scientific basis for her therapy They pointed to other claims made by Ms Kenny notably that massaged muscles might send out nerve fibers to help heal more severely damaged muscles as evidence that she did not understand the physiology of the disease Those critics called for randomized clinical trials which were never done to ascertain whether Ms Kennys system had value As Dr Rogers shows Ms Kenny irked the   and the rest of the medical establishment for reasons beyond her medical theories First she was a nurse questioning the authority of physicians Second she was a woman  and a very outspoken one fond of dramatic hats and corsages  challenging the overwhelmingly male medical profession Third as Dr Rogers admits Ms Kenny was prone to embellish both her own story and those of her patients  But it was Ms Kennys fierce adherence to what she observed at the bedside that holds the most relevance today She thought that she could see and feel muscles improve as she ministered to her patients She saw her patients recover at rates that she believed were much higher than those treated conservatively Who needed clinical trials when the proof was right in front of her According to Ms Kenny Dr Rogers writes the empirical evidence embodied in her patients recovery proved her therapy worked  Was Ms Kenny correct Yes and no Her emphasis on early mobilization has come to be a mainstay of not only polio treatment but of   more broadly Yet some of her claims about the nature of the disease and how patients recovered proved wrong The successful development of a   in the s made these debates much less pressing  But perhaps Ms Kennys greatest legacy in an era of evidencebased medicine and reliance on largescale clinical trials involving thousands of patients is that keen clinical observation  what the physician and writer   has termed bedside medicine still has its place Her opponents Ms Kenny once wrote have eyes but they see not Barron H Lerner a professor of medicine and population health at New York University School of Medicine is the author of five books
