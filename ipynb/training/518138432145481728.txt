Dr David Kuhar landed in Dallas on Tuesday night Kuhar is the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions   and the agency dispatched him as soon as they received confirmation that a man had carried the disease from Liberia Today his person team is on the front lines of an effort to keep that single case from turning into an outbreak When a person starts to feel sick with Ebola there isnt always enough virus in the blood to detect it There arent any fancy medical scanners or DNA tests to rely on at that early stage Instead the group is armed with cellphones laptops and notebooks Along with local and state authorities they have been walking the streets from morning until well after dark Their goal is to track down every single person who might have come into contact with Thomas Eric Duncan the man now sick with Ebola They ask questions to try and figure out what kind of contact each individual person may have had If they shook hands Kuhar says How long did you shake hands with them If you touched them How long did you touch them What were the circumstances under which you touched them Public health officials initially said that  people were at risk But after talking to many possible contacts they lowered that number It turned out a lot of the people on the first list didnt have the sort of contact that would lead them to catch Ebola from Duncan The virus only spreads through direct contact with body fluids But the CDC detectives found  people who did come into contact with Duncan  of whom are at high risk of developing Ebola All  will be visited daily by a health care worker And theyll check their temperature twice a day to make sure they dont have a fever Ebola can lie dormant for up to  days after exposure The checks will continue until that deadline And if someone gets sick and it is Ebola we would ensure that they are appropriately isolated and treated to ensure that there are no further transmissions Kuhar says This is how you stop an Ebola outbreak before it starts No fancy scanners or tests Just a quick check for a fever and then the question How are you feeling today
