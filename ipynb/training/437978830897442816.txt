A Delaware company has recalled 16 varieties of cheese after some of the cheeses were . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the cheeses produced by Roos Foods of Kenton, Del., are linked to a listeria outbreak. The recalled products are the company's Mexicana, Amigo, Santa Rosa De Lima and Anita brands.. The products were distributed in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia. The CDC said there was one death in California and seven illnesses in Maryland. All the Maryland victims reported consuming the cheese. Three of those sickened were newborns; it is unclear if the death was one of the newborns.. Listeria is especially dangerous to pregnant women because it easily passes through to the fetus.
