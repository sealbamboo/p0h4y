Researchers have an unconventional idea for reducing medical costs in the US Give more Americans a sense of purpose You see people who believe their lives have purpose are motivated to optimize their health That means theyre more likely than other folks to take advantage of preventive health services like cancer screenings And people who take advantage of preventive healthcare save the medical system big bucks In a   researchers from the University of Michigan and the University of Wisconsin suggest that these troublesome realities could be offset by greater use of preventive health care services which are known to enhance health and reduce health care costs Americans certainly have room for improvement on that score Studies have shown that   of senior citizens take advantage of preventive health services along with   of middleaged adults between the ages of  and  the researchers note The study authors wondered whether it would be possible to boost those figures by increasing the number of Americans who think they have a purpose in life defined as having meaning a sense of direction and goals to live for It may sound farfetched but epidemiologists have found that people with purpose are less likely to have a   or   or to develop   Theyre also more likely to   than other adults To find out whether preventive care had any role in this the researchers turned to the   which tracks a representative sample of American adults older than age  Some of the study participants answered seven questions designed to measure the extent to which they felt they had a purpose in life The volunteers were asked to use a sixpoint scale to indicate how strongly they agreed or disagreed with statements like I have a sense of direction and purpose in my life and My daily activities often seem trivial and unimportant to me The responses to the seven questions were averaged into a single score which was between  and  The study authors then compared the scores of  people with their use of various preventive health services After controlling for demographic factors like wealth education and marital status which might skew the results they found that having a purpose in life was indeed correlated with greater use of preventive care If these screening tests were helping then the people who were getting them should be spending less time in the hospital And indeed thats what the researchers found Over a sixyear period the average number of nights each study volunteer spent in a hospital was  But it wasnt the same for all of the  volunteers For each onepoint increase in sense of purpose the number of nights spent in a hospital fell by  Even with this uncertainty the idea of boosting preventive healthcare by boosting peoples sense of purpose is worth pursuing according to the researchers Several promising interventions have shown that purpose along with other facets of psychological wellbeing can be improved for greater segments of the population they wrote For instance early randomized controlled trials have shown that a meaningcentered therapy  can help raise meaning and purpose in life among people with cancer
