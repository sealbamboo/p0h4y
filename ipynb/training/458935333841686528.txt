You may have heard that dollar bills harbor trace amounts of drugs But those greenbacks in your wallet are hiding far more than cocaine and the flu Theyre teeming with life Each dollar bill carries about  types of bacteria on its surface scientists have found Most are harmless But cash also has DNA from drugresistant microbes And your wad of dough may even have a smudge of anthrax and diphtheria In other words your wallet is a portable petri dish And currency may be one way antibioticresistant genes move around cities says biologist   whos leading the Dirty Money Project at the New York University The project offers an indepth look at the living organisms shacking up on our cash One goal of the work is to provide information that could help health workers catch disease outbreaks in New York City before they spread very far Were not trying to be fear mongers or suggest that everyone goes out and microwave their money Carlton tells Shots But I must admit that some of the  bills in New York City are really nasty So far Carlton and her colleagues have sequenced all the DNA found on about  dollar bills from a Manhattan bank Their findings arent published yet But she gave Shots a sneak peak of what theyve found so far The most common microbes on the bills by far are ones that cause acne The runnersup were a bunch of skin bacteria that arent pathogenic They simply like to hang out on peoples bodies Some of these critters may even protect the skin from harmful microbes Carlton says Other money dwellers included mouth microbes  because people lick their fingers when they count bills Carlton says  and bacteria that thrive in the vagina People probably arent washing their hands after the bathroom she says What about the potential traces of   DNA Not a cause for alarm Carlton says Anthrax is a very common bacteria in soil Carlton says People who work with soil like farmers are often exposed to it Its only when anthrax is weaponized and sent through the mail that it causes those issues And some of the DNA that looks like anthraxs could have come from a harmless relative she notes The DNA survey also detected genes that make bacteria impervious to penicillin and methicillin The latter make   bacteria such dangerous pathogens Now we know that viable bacteria are on money and could serve as a mode of transmission for antibioticresistant genes Carlton says Money is a frequent route of contact between people in New York City At this point though scientists dont how important money is for transmitting pathogens and fueling disease outbreaks Would changing the material for dollar bills are made from help to keep them cleaner The jury is still out Some countries such as Canada have started printing money on flexible sheets of polymer film a fancy plastic One   found less bacteria in general grew on these plastic bills than cottonbased ones like the dollar and euro notes But another study reported that microbes survive longer on polymerbased bills     last week Until the ideal material gets figured out the best protection against moneys invisible inhabitants is also the simplest one Wash your hands after handling cash
