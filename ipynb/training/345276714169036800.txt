Like many many other young adults who dont have insurance through an employer I rely on the insurance provided by my fathers job to cover my health care But young adults are allowed to stay on a parents health plan only until age  So in one year like many other young adults I will have to figure out how to afford my own health insurance  Still Im one of the luckier ones Up to now Ive been fortunate never to have to choose between groceries rent and medical care But even with good health insurance on my parents plan the cost of my cancer treatment has been overwhelming Between copayments outofnetwork costs renting an apartment in New York City for my bone marrow transplant and the loss of two incomes mine and that of my mother who graciously took on the role of my primary caregiver the outofpocket costs of my care have already amounted to tens of thousands of dollars Despite all of this Ive been reluctant to talk about the cost of my care with the people who provide it my doctors I get along well with my medical team and I have a tremendous amount of respect for them But the idea of discussing my finances during a doctors appointment makes me uncomfortable Ive been asking myself why lately and Im still not sure of the answer The one thing I do know is that Im not alone in feeling this way A recent study that showed that while most patients want to talk with their doctors about the price tag of treatment only about one in five actually do  The study which surveyed about  insured patients treated at Duke Health and affiliated clinics in rural North Carolina found that almost  percent of the participants had private insurance but that the average outofpocket cost for patients was nearly  a month  Why the hesitancy to talk about the steep price of cancer treatment Patients link cost to quality and they fear that if they broach the topic of cost with their doctors they are going to get lowerquality care said Dr Yousuf Zafar an assistant professor at the Duke Cancer Institute and lead author of the research Maybe the most remarkable thing about the study is that  percent of the patients who did bring up their financial concerns found that the discussion helped reduce the cost of treatment Its a small but profound insight that suggests that communicating financial concerns to a doctor can be important in reducing treatment costs Doctors may be able to prescribe cheaper medications or refer patients to hospital assistance programs Hospital social workers and advocacy organizations like the Cancer Legal Resource Center the HealthWell Foundation the American Society of Clinical Oncologists and the American Cancer Society also provide resources for cancer patients who are struggling financially Whether were too embarrassed or shy  or worried that a discussion about cost might affect the quality of our care  its clear that both doctors and patients need to do more communicating We talk about everything else so why shouldnt cost be a part of that conversation But no conversation between doctor and patient can magically turn an uninsured patient into an insured one Doctors are just as helpless as patients when it comes to solving the problems of the uninsured Thats why I joined the Leukemia and Lymphoma Societys Federal Mission Day on Capitol Hill last week where I spoke about the many challenges facing young people with cancer Our legislators need to help us find costeffective ways for patients with and without insurance to access quality health care The steep price tag of cancer treatment needs to continue to be a part of the national conversation not just the patientdoctor one
