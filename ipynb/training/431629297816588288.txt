Of the many projects Ive worked on since joining the BBCs longrunning show for deaf people See Hears Child of our Time is a personal favourite We were of course inspired by Robert Winstons BBC series which has followed  children since their births in  as well as ITVs Up documentaries which have visited  people every seven years since  when they were aged just seven   In  I was tasked with finding four deaf primary school starters from a range of backgrounds so we could follow their educational journeys and maybe shed some light on these issues  There were many debates around deaf education in  when we first broadcast our version of the programme  and they continue today They ranged from opposition to deaf children being given cochlear implants to deaf schools being closed in favour of mainstreaming and discussions on whether it was better for deaf children to speak or sign or do both from an early age I found Lucy Aidan Yasin and Amie all of whom were four years old They had unique personalities and were representative of different family backgrounds communication styles and hearing levels Seven years later its  and we are returning to see how theyre getting on now they are   Lucy was born to deaf parents in a strong signing household When we met her she was in the reception class at Heathlands deaf school She had thick blonde curls and a mischievous twinkle in her eye At four she was already a fluent signer and was really attentive in the classroom hanging on the teachers every sign  Seven years later she is still signing thanks to support around her has become a confident swimmer and hopes to compete in the Deaflympics one day She still has the same twinkle in her eye Aidan was born to hearing parents both of whom used speech to communicate with him When we met him in a  update his mum Donna was attending regular classes so that she could also speak with him using sign language He wore a cochlear implant in one ear and also a hearing aid and communicated with a mixture of sign language and speech He was a real bundle of energy He started his education at a school for deaf children but now attends a small mainstream primary  Aidan has since been diagnosed with verbal dyspraxia a condition where a person has trouble saying what he or she wants to But he has overcome this and is now confident both with speaking and signing He seems more at ease in the deaf world than in previous years He pours all that excess energy into performing in rock bands and with the inclusivelyrun Chicken Shed theatre company for young people with and without disabilities  Like Aidan Amie was born to hearing parents and grew up using a mix of speech and sign to communicate She had a cochlear implant in one ear and went to a school with a deaf unit We saw her being very confident and sociable from an early age whether in the classroom or in the playground She seemed to prefer speaking to signing Amie is now becoming more and more comfortable in the hearing world to the extent where she is learning the violin Her speech has become clear enough for her to stop attending speech therapy sessions and she hopes to go on to a mainstream girls school Amie has a cochlear implant in both ears now as has Aidan but theyve had differing results since having the second one fitted Yasin was born in Birmingham  His mum Razia chose to speak rather than sign with him from very early on to make him master hearing with his cochlear implant He went to a mainstream school When we first met Yasin it was remarkable how little his deafness seemed to affect him Whether his mum was calling the names of different fruit out behind his back so he couldnt see her lip movements or taking us on a tour of his bedroom he seemed to really understand the words he heard spoken aloud  These days Yasin plays the trumpet in a band and hopes to attend a local mainstream secondary school His speech is more or less indistinguishable from that of a hearing child of the same age In our updates this week and next well see how much all four have grown both physically and as individuals over the last seven years  Since first meeting Lucy Aidan Amie and Yasin weve seen governments change educational policies change and more deaf schools close   Weve seen huge rises in the use of social media by deaf people also online video communication and other internet innovations Its impact has been profound  The four children live in a world which is more accessible than it was seven years ago but also a world of austerity and benefit cuts  But what have we learned  Have we solved any of the debates about sign v speech whether cochlear implants work or not whether deaf children should be mainstreamed or kept in deaf schools We hope to shed some light on this  Email us atseehearbbccouk with your stories and comments like our   and enjoy
