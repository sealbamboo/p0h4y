Look through a series of thcentury woodcuts and youll find that the leper is as much an icon of medieval art as the crown or the cross Leprosy was so common in Europe during the Middle Ages that its estimated  in  people was infected with the bacteria But by the turn of the th century after the Crusades had swept across Europe the disease mysteriously disappeared And it never returned This left scientists puzzled Did the bacteria mutate to become less harmful or did Europeans become resistant to the germs To answer this question a team of biologists and archaeologists probed the mass grave of a yearold leper colony for traces of ancient leprosy DNA They found leprosy didnt change we did A   in   Thursday shows that the ancient leprosy genome is nearly identical to the genome of modernday leprosy Extracting a pathogens DNA from human skeletons is nearly impossible says microbiologist   of the Ecole Polytechnique Fdrale de Lausanne The material was a mixture of human DNA microorganisms and contaminating DNA from other bones and surrounding soil he says This was difficult Cole said but after sorting through enough material eventually they hit the jackpot in the form of a decayed tooth Less than  percent of the tooths DNA came from the leprosy pathogen Still the team was able to reconstruct the ancient leprosy genome using this yearold chomper The old form of leprosy was almost indistinguishable from the one that infects people today If the explanation of the drop in leprosy cases isnt in the pathogen then it must be in the host that is in us Cole says Indeed   that a certain gene makes some people highly resistant to leprosy This particular gene Cole says is prevalent in Europeans To stop a disease Cole says its helpful to understand its origins Having information about the specific genes and proteins in the disease can help to determine preventative and therapeutic strategies as well as possible drug resistances The same methods used to uncover ancient leprosy could also be useful in exploring ancient strains of tuberculosis syphilis and the   The bacteria that cause leprosy also called Hansens Disease can live in the human body for up to  years without any physical symptoms But eventually the infection causes severe pain nerve damage and often a crippling loss of bodily tissue Today leprosy can be   Although the beginning of  saw fewer than  cases reported it remains a global concern A historically stigmatized disease leprosy often goes undiagnosed and untreated until it is in its advanced stages
