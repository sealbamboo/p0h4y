Dr Kent Brantly has now donated about a gallon of his own blood to other Ebola patients medical missionary Dr Rick Sacra and NBC freelance camera operator Ashoka Mukpo and most recently Dallas nurse Nina Pham Patients who have recovered from Ebola have blood chock full of antibodies to the virus Doctors hope that it can help kickstart the immune systems of patients fighting a new infection So why not give blood to everyone Its sheer luck that Brantly has been a match for all three Another Ebola survivor missionary Nancy Writebol offered blood to Thomas Eric Duncan but it wasnt a match Duncan died last week The use of whats called convalescent serum  blood from survivors of Ebola  is also controversial Its not clear whether it  although Brantly also received serum in his case from a boy he treated in Liberia Sacra recovered but he also got   and an experimental drug Mukpo is on the mend although he is not out of the woods yet We really dont know whether the convalescent serum is working in helping to protect these patients or not at this time Thomas Geisbert an expert at the University of Texas Medical Branch whos helped test many Ebola treatments told NBC News The World Health Organization complains that there is a black market for blood in some parts of West Africa affected by Ebola Serum which is blood with the red blood cells removed contains the antibodies that fight all sorts of attackers such as viruses and bacteria If someones recently recovered from an infection theyll usually have loads of antibodies that specifically recognize whatever caused the infection The same is true with Ebola But serum just like whole blood also carries blood type  A O B and AB And just as with whole blood giving someone serum of the wrong blood type can cause a serious and often deadly reaction Is there a way to make a universal donor Is there some way to make blood that doesnt react with anyones blood Thats what the makers of the experimental drug ZMapp are trying to do ZMapp is made using three of the antibodies that specifically target Ebola Its been tried in seven people No one knows if it helped  you need to test a drug in many people to know the answer But in   its been   and it rescues even monkeys that are already sick This is pretty darn good Peter Jahrling an expert in drugs and vaccines at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told a symposium on Ebola on Tuesday And thats a better record than using serum has No one knows if using convalescent serum helps and tests on monkeys suggest that using serum does not help them survive Ebola infection Plus its dangerous to use serum in the field says Jahrling ZMapp made by Californiabased Mapp Biopharmaceutical may be the scarcest drug in the world right now There are no doses available Two of the antibodies are made using close relatives of the tobacco plant and a third is made in Canada Its a process that takes time and before the epidemic started in West Africa there was no real rush to develop it ZMapp ramped up in my opinion is the treatment of choice Jahrling told the symposium held at Johns Hopkins University
