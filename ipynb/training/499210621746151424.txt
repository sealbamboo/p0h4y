The transitions coach ducks into your mothers hospital room for a brief introduction before shes discharged The coach explains that her job is to help keep patients safe at home and asks if she can call to set up a home visit Health researchers know that transitions  the handoffs from one setting to another as in hospital to home  often go awry Its so abrupt said Dr Eric Coleman a geriatrician at the University of Colorado Denver and a certified McArthur Foundation genius For three days people do everything for you and then  minutes before you leave they turn the tables Now   take over  Your parent is often sleep deprived and medicated at the time little wonder that nationally about one Medicare patient in five returns to the hospital within a month Judith Graham   last year To lower that figure Dr Coleman began developing the    years ago If patients agree a coach comes to their homes two to four days after discharge Shes not there to change dressings or help them bathe home health nurses or aides do that Instead over  minutes to an hour the coach  generally a nurse sometimes a social worker or other health care professional  asks about patients goals as they recover She will discuss the medications your mother takes and symptoms that might indicate a problem requiring medical attention Shell help your father strategize about whom to call if he needs help and rehearses what hell say She phones twice over the next few weeks to see if your parent has gotten his questions answered and needs met Dr Colemans brainchild has spread to over  hospitals care organizations Medicare Advantage plans and area agencies on aging around the country The pace of adoption has picked up sharply since Medicare started imposing financial penalties on hospitals with high readmission rates in  The Care Transitions Intervention sounds so simple and commonsensical that its hard to believe it has major impact But the evidence starting with Dr Colemans   and then a   shows that this coaching approach has reduced readmissions by  percent to  percent depending on hospital location Its costs are modest   to  per patient to train and pay coaches  but the cost savings can be substantial and long lasting In a study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine in  researchers at Brown University and Healthcentric Advisors of Rhode Island demonstrated that the Care Transitions program   to less than  percent from  percent among Medicare beneficiaries In the latest study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine these researchers looked not only at readmissions to six hospitals but at all health care costs except drugs among Medicare patients hospitalized between  and  who were discharged home not to a nursing facility The researchers compared  patients who received coaching with two control groups  who were eligible to participate but declined or didnt cooperate in arranging a home visit and an external group of more than  patients in the same hospitals who werent approached for coaching In all three groups the patients average age was in the mids and the researchers matched them by health status sex race and poverty indicators Over six months the coached patients had fewer emergency room visits observation stays doctors visits and nursing home stays  but those differences werent statistically significant What drove cost savings said Stefan Gravenstein senior author of the study was significantly reduced hospital readmissions Coached patients had a  percent lower readmission rate We believe that when something came up they got help before they got so sick they needed to be hospitalized said Dr Gravenstein a geriatrician now at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Ohio After allowing for the costs of coaching   over six months for coached patients compared with the internal control group and  less compared with the external control group which may have included more dementia patients among other factors Patients are often passive recipients of health care especially in a hospital Dr Gravenstein said Transitions coaches work to give them more confidence about navigating an often bewildering system When they discover that the things that worry them also have an urgency it removes the hurdle he added It gives them permission to bother the doctor  And that apparently pays off in more ways than one Lets not forget the other kinds of costs after all Hospitals their starched white reputations notwithstanding arent safe or friendly places for vulnerable older people You dont want to be there or bounce back there if you can avoid it It looks as if transitions coaches can help you stay away
