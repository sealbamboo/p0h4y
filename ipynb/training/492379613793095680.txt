Before the visit I had been split in two not by fear of death but by dread of dying  in anxiety dementia but mostly in pain from recurrent ovarian cancer   My mind was always running on two tracks On one track I attended to whatever actual event was occurring be it an outing to the library or the making of a meal The simultaneous second track was psychic or psychotic depending on your point of view but invariably chilling It took me to scenes of the degeneration that would ensue after the targeted drug I am taking stopped working   So I welcomed the idea suggested by a member of my cancer support group that we tour the new hospice facility where our friend Leslie had died Not a recruitment visit just a field trip we joked as we decided to invite our partners to join us in meeting with the codirector of Hospice House Dr Robert Stone   On a fearfully cold day we drove to a lodge on a wooded lot at the edge of our small town By a blazing fireplace surrounded by comfortable chairs about  of us amassed  six women dealing with gynecological cancer and some of our husbands We were quiet because the family of a patient was using the adjacent kitchen    A lanky and gentle Dr Stone welcomed us and proceeded to explain the program To enroll in hospice patients must have a life expectancy of six months or less and promise to forgo further curative treatments He had issues with these stipulations but they were put in place by the insurance systems that cover costs The vast majority of hospice participants remain at home with nurses on call a smaller percentage in nursing homes and only  percent arrive to reside in the facility  not for longterm residence but for five days or a week They come to give a respite to their primary caretaker or to stabilize and return home or to die during their stay  Medicare and Anthem love us Dr Stone said with a laugh Apparently the bill for allinclusive care at Hospice House is something like  a day compared with  in intensive care With a passing reference to Woody Allens line Im not afraid of death I just dont want to be there when it happens he pointed out the play area for young children introduced us to the nurses in charge and took us through a succession of meditation or meeting rooms for caregivers as well as hospitallike rooms for patients But even these did not have the feel of a hospital The place was quiet and beautifully lit Many rooms had French doors wide enough to open in better weather and through which a bed could be slid onto a deck overlooking the woods There were paintings on the walls and upholstered chairs that converted into beds for caregivers On the ceiling over a patients bed an odd mechanism  described as a drone with a pulley  could be used to convey the dying person into a large bathtub in the adjoining bathroom        I saw Julia blanch at the thought of the helpless frailty of the expiring body But I also overheard the equanimity in Danas voice she was telling her husband what a relief it was to know that he and their kids could be freed from arduous physical caretaking to focus on their emotional leavetaking It feels deeply respectful Dana whispered to me as Dr Stone waved goodbye by grinning and exclaiming I dont want to see you people back here too soon I agreed with them both Is that why an icy weight lifted while I floated back through the fireplace room and the massive front door to the parking lot From the moment of diagnosis I knew that I did not want to end up in a hospital and especially not in the ICU  with its blinking and beeping machines its fluorescent lights never turned off its frantic rhythms of intubations and CPRs and codes and respirators its endotracheal and feeding tubes its infections and psychoses It shocked me to learn that this is what happens to one out of five Americans   The information I clasped to myself in the car consisted of the answer to a question I had managed to ask Dr Stone when we stood around the bathtub Can you control pain during the dying process With extraordinary confidence this diffident man drew himself up to his full height to explain that he was fully confident he could dial up sedation when needed and dial it down when a patient wanted to gain greater consciousness for say a conversation with a family member He then added Pain is treatable No equivocation no qualification Hugging that flat statement I warmed at the thought of leaving behind the wearisome parallel tracks Perhaps I could fully experience the next library outing the braising and seasoning knowing now that the road not yet taken might be less agonizing than I had feared
