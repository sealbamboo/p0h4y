WASHINGTON—A minimally-invasive heart valve procedure with a device made by Medtronic Inc. was superior to traditional open surgery in extending the lives of patients with diseased aortic valves, according to a new study.. After one year, 85.8% of patients who received the Medtronic device, called CoreValve, were still alive, compared with 80.9% of patients who underwent open surgery, a statistically significant advantage, the study found.
