Outside such experimental settings there are no medications available in the United States for female hypoactive sexual desire disorder Thats the technical term for when women have a distressing lack or absence of sexual desire or fantasy Up to onethird of adult women may experience it according to a  Flibanserin seemed like a potential answer for many But the US Food and Drug Administration has rejected applications to greenlight the drug   Sprout Pharmaceuticals which is pursuing approval of the drug has appealed the FDAs most recent decision and was scheduled to have a meeting with FDA officials on Friday said the companys president and chief operating officer Cindy Whitehead  Given that the drug has been through numerous rigorous clinical trials and so much has been invested in it the FDAs refusal to approve it is a turning point in the field of sexual medicine says Dr Irwin Goldstein director of sexual medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego California who collaborated on clinical trials for flibanserin  If there is no positive action on the drug it could spell doom for pharmacological efforts to manage female sexual desire he said It will go back to dark ages of saying This is all a relationship problem even though we know its not he said  The FDA declined to answer specific questions regarding the matter  FDA spokeswoman Andrea Fischer said in a statement The FDA is only able to provide information on approved drug product applications Any information on an application that has yet to receive an approval or was denied approval belongs to the manufacturersponsor developing the drug Flibanserin was initially developed by pharmaceutical giant Boehringer Ingelheim but the company ditched it in  after the FDA declined to approve their new drug application asking for more research Goldstein said  A smaller operation Sprout Pharmaceuticals took over work on the drug in  and resubmitted an application with  new clinical studies encompassing data on more than  new patients according to the company  In total more than  people have participated in clinical trials for flibanserin Whitehead said Still the most recent attempt to get flibanserin off the ground failed the FDA did not approve the companys revised drug application in October  The FDA characterized the drug as having a modest effect in its response letter Whitehead said But clinical trial results show statistically significant improvement in the women who took the drug compared to those who took a placebo she said  In terms of what we see I would say modest is meaningful Whitehead said   showed that women taking the drug reported an average increase of  satisfying sexual events in four weeks compared to an increase of  among women using a placebo  Flibanserin is not a hormonal treatment and does not appear to affect fertility or interact with birth control medications Whitehead said  The drug works by increasing brain blood flow in particular ways Goldstein said It increases levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline and lowers levels of serotonin  Side effects of flibanserin include dizziness nausea fatigue and sleepiness Unlike some treatments for men flibanserin needs to be taken once a day every day  There are other experimental treatments for low female sex drive in the works  Drugs called Lybrido and Lybridos developed by a company called Emotional Brain have undergone several randomized studies with results that are very promising and will be published soon according to the companys website A drug called Bremelanotide is being investigated by Palatin Technologies for both men and women None of these drugs has completed phase  trials which are necessary before approval  Whitehead counts  FDAapproved treatments available in the United States for male sexual dysfunction including popular drugs such as Viagra sildenafil citrate For women its zero  A lot of times the medical community has really put mens needs first and hasnt really addressed womens sexual needs said Jennifer Foust a sex therapist in Aventura Florida who is not affiliated with flibanserin Because doctors have no solutions women have tried lessproven treatments for their low sexual desire such as diets and herbs None of Fousts clients has had success with them She said some women who arent functioning well sexually would be open to anything  Ive had women complain Why isnt there a female Viagra  Foust said   Sex drive is more complicated for women than for men Foust said There are a lot of factors that could explain a womans low desire  and not all of them are medical she said Lifestyle and relationship issues may come into play  Having a first child can be a problematic factor for some women the adjustment and figuring out how to restructure their sex life can throw off desire Foust has spoken to some new mothers who feel they are constantly being asked for something from their body as if they are touched out but find their lack of desire troubling  Some couples maintain satisfying sex lives over many years  but some over time go on autopilot and have less and less sex  You have to continue to feed your sexual relationship and feed your relationship in general Foust said A lot of it depends on how much importance and energy you put toward your sex life  Sometimes stress is the issue too she said  Foust offers cognitivebehavioral focused exercises to help women who are distressed about their low sexual desire  Low sexual desire in women isnt necessarily a problem in menopause or later Foust works with many women complaining of low sex drive who are in their s and s The average age of participants in the flibanserin trials was  Whitehead said  Gattusos daughter is in her late s and she and her friends are having similar problems Gattuso said  Her physician friends want a solution for low female sexual desire too she said they want to be able to offer female patients something besides Im sorry
