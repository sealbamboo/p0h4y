Tim Wests grandfather invented Doritos chips and was an executive at the global snack food giant FritoLay The younger West ate plenty of junk food growing up But lately hes been much more interested in kale quinoa and treeripened fruit And the yearold Bay Area food entrepreneur now wants to completely reinvent what we eat and how its produced A chef who trained at the esteemed Culinary Institute of America and New Yorks St Regis Hotel West is ready to bring a dose of millennialhipster to the legacy of his grandfather   Its all happening in San Francisco where West is spreading his mantra and tossing off phrases like   where business ideas are pitched prototyped and presented to judges over the span of a weekend This summer West is working with veteran venture capitalist Derek Proudian on a restaurant concept In June he launched an already beloved popup restaurant a temporary spot  a style of restaurant operation thats popular in the expensive streets of San Francisco called Cool Beans in the citys hip Lower Haight neighborhood His ultimate goal To cater both to people on food stamps and to affluent techies In this part of the world theres so much din about disruption you might assume every industry has already been shattered But theres still an open market when it comes to food You have these two unbelievable realms that were living in the nexus of West says of the foodtech sector on a spring day at World Headquarters In the hangar turned incubator workspace on San Franciscos Treasure Island huge pieces of art for the altfete Burning Man are being constructed Venture capital investment in general food products   between  and  according to data reported in   In   food apps online grocery stores restaurant ordering reviews more than  million in private investment came through the first quarter of  Among the emerging success stories Mealkitdelivery startup Blue Apron which raised  million and boasts a   Wests beanandvegetablefocused popup Cool Beans  where you can order Chipotlestyle bowls or wholewheat wraps  is a first step toward his goal of redefining comfort food with responsible choices that might make us feel better than say rich mac and cheese or a bacon cheeseburger Will consumers   the Bay Area order quinoa with gingerchili tempeh Maybe not But the demand for farm to counter is clearly there and proven by growing chains like LYFE Kitchen Veggie Grill and Tender Greens which are all reportedly part of a booming group of healthy sustainable fastcasual restaurants Add that to Proudians partnership with West which is an impressive endorsement considering Proudian once stepped in as CEO of Elon Musks first company West and Proudian now plan to open their first permanent restaurant in the heart of San Francisco by the end of the year with the goal of eventually creating an international chain According to West his grandfather was already working for FritoLay when he came up with Doritos So he never got any special royalties from the product and West didnt grow up drawing from a Doritos trust fund I am a selfmade bootstrapped entrepreneur West tells us But I have been inspired by my father and grandfather And its undeniable that my grandfathers success paved the way for me to pay for my education at the Culinary Institute of America Wests passion for food first emerged as a teenager Growing up as a triplet in Bedford Hills NY his diet included hamburgers pizza hot dogs and buttery grilledcheese sandwiches so says his brother Chris But around age  West began working as a stock boy at the Hudson Valley Flying Pig cafe in suburban New York Thats when he had his defining epiphany over a meal with the staff I remember sitting there between the person who had grown my food and the person who had cooked it he says and I just had this aha moment of like Oh food comes from people  But it took something else for West to start cooking his own food At the University of Colorado Boulder  where he jokes he majored in rock climbing and snowboarding and smoking weed  he got food poisoning from Taco Bell not from a Doritos Locos taco and decided it was time to start cooking his own food He roasted a chicken one day and neighbors down the hall smelled it and joined him West transferred from Boulder to culinary school and did an externship in Big Sur Calif thinning beets in the sunshine Then he spent a few years cooking for bigwigs like Elton John and the Saudi royal family at New Yorks St Regis After that came a nonprofit education project with cooking and farming classes and a stint designing a permaculture garden in Massachusetts He arrived in Silicon Valley in  inspired by a goal to feed Google Hed read an article about Google employees being served sushi on surfboards and a light bulb went off There was demand for healthful gourmet meals on a daily basis thanks to tech money and growing corporate offices He didnt land a Google gig but he did get hired as a chef at Facebooks Cafe  in  helping to prep up to  meals per week West left Facebook the next year to launch and eventually fail at a slew of food startups Grubly a food Airbnb where people invited strangers to their home for a meal they prepared and customcereal company Cerealize I was running around and I didnt have a lot of support I didnt have a lot of mentorship I didnt know what I was doing at all West says of that time While he may not have found his success as a food entrepreneur the first time around the guy has a couple things going for him charisma and an intense desire to network And in this land of hackathons West might end up greasing the path of more than a few foodloving millennials who would otherwise be spending their days creating another Instagram copycat Imagine West as the perfect dinnerparty guest affable charismatic and not afraid to speak his mind on the notion of food diplomacy its our greatest common denominator he says But for now West says hes developing a snack food that will be equally as delicious as Doritos equally as convenient as Doritos but better for you and better for the planet  anyone
