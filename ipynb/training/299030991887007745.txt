 Lets talk about muscle soreness Delayedonset muscle soreness or DOMS as it is often called is the common  one could even say requisite  result of a workout If you do an activity youre not used to such as taking a new type of fitness class attacking a hill on your bike when youre used to riding on flat ground or running a far longer distance than you are accustomed to  the difference in muscle use can cause microtears in muscle fibers and connective tissue As your body works to repair itself you may feel some lowgrade pain in the area But this is where the phrase no pain no gain comes in those tears and the subsequent repair help make the muscle stronger  and that improves overall fitness But it comes with some ache along the way In particular movements that include eccentric muscle contractions which occur when the muscle must contract even as it is being elongated running downhill or walking downstairs for example might cause some delayed onset pain But why Think of it like the weakest link says Allan Goldfarb PhD a professor in the Department of Kinesiology at the University of North Carolina Greensboro and a fellow of the American College of Sports Medicine Muscle proteins hold that weaker bit together and if there is too much force or tension from exercise on those muscle fibers or proteins they are vulnerable to getting slightly damaged In an effort to repair the damage the body can actually   repair explains Goldfarb and that can activate pain receptors Whats more the muscles can suffer from some lowlevel inflammation that can add to the pain DOMS can be mitigated by slow steady stretching exercises says Goldfarb And   that ice baths can also help improve soreness But that doesnt necessarily sound like whats going on in the case of this question For starters it seems as if youre experiencing muscle pain concurrent with the activity rather than hours after We asked Dr Lynn SnyderMacker PT ATC SCS ScD a professor in the Department of Physical Therapy and the Center for Biomedical Engineering Researchs Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Biomechanics and Movement Sciences at the University of Delaware for her opinion It doesnt sound muscular to me one flight of stairs she wrote in an email to HuffPost Healthy Living pointing to the burning sensation which is different than a sore muscles ache It sounds more like nerve or patellofemoral pain or referred pain from the hips That combined with your young age make her believe that this isnt exerciserelated after all Many illnesses could cause this type of pain   is one diagnosis that fits in with unexplained muscle soreness according to Goldfarb Thats not to say that unexplained muscle burning or soreness is a sign of serious illness but it may be worth further evaluation by a medical specialist like a sports medicine doctor
