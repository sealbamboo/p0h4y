A new idea to encourage teeth to repair themselves may see the end of the fearinducing sound of the dentists drill researchers say  Researchers at Kings College London believe electricity can be used to strengthen a tooth by forcing minerals into the layer of enamel They hope it will get rid of the need for drills injections and fillings  A company has been set up to bring the technique to the dentists chair in the next three years  Minerals such as calcium and phosphate naturally flow in and out of the tooth Acid produced by bacteria munching on food in the mouth help leach minerals out The group at Kings apply a mineral cocktail and then use a small electric current to drive the minerals deep into the tooth They say Electrically Accelerated and Enhanced Remineralisation can strengthen the tooth and reduce dental caries  areas of tooth decay  This is the launch of a company  Reminova  which will be based in Perth Scotland There is no device to see and due to confidentiality there has been no published evidence of the techniques effectiveness in medical journals  Prof Nigel Pitts one of the inventors and an investor in the new company told the BBC  This is early stage  you dont start with the finished product  but were excited because we think it is groundbreaking  We have set up a company to convert it from a demonstration technology into a viable commercial product that we can put into the hands of dentists around the world He said the technology had the potential to replace the need for many existing fillings but could not tackle large endstage cavities What it wont do is physically regrow a tooth he added
