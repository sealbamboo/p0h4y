Scientists say far too little is known about the health risks of chemicals used in food packaging and some could cause cancer  Research is needed to understand the effect on the human body and embryonic development of at least  chemicals used in packaging they said  Links between packaging and obesity diabetes and neurological diseases need to be explored scientists warned But critics have said that the call is alarmist   Scientists Jane Muncke John Peterson Myers Martin Scheringer and Miquel Porta called for an investigation into the health risks of food packaging   published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health They noted that chemicals such as formaldehyde which they said can cause cancer were used in many materials such as plastics used for fizzydrink bottles and tableware  Substances could leach into food and they added that the risks of lifelong exposure to such chemicals were not documented said the researchers  Whereas the science for some of these substances is being debated and policymakers struggle to satisfy the needs of stakeholders consumers remain exposed to these chemicals daily mostly unknowingly they said   But carrying out analysis would not be easy they said as there are no unexposed populations for comparison  The call for research has attracted criticism  Dr Ian Musgrave senior lecturer in pharmacology at the University of Adelaide said it was very hard to take seriously the claims that formaldehyde in plastic bottles could cause cancer  He said it was present in many foods naturally and to consume as much formaldehyde as that in an apple someone would have to drink at least  litres of plasticbottled water  Dr Musgrave added Obviously the concern about formaldehyde from food packaging is significantly overrated unless we are willing to place potential cancer hazard stickers on fresh fruit and vegetables Jon Ayres Professor of Environmental and Respiratory Medicine at the University of Birmingham said the scientists painted an alarmist picture  He said there was no denying that ingesting lower doses of some substances could in principle be harmful but the issue was how to recognise and quantify any effect  Prof Ayres added But can these effects really be anything other than modest at worst when few have been recognised to date He said that simply calling for a different approach to the chemicals does not really help  Dr Oliver Jones lecturer at the RMIT University in Melbourne Australia said More research is always welcome from a scientists point of view But I would hazard a guess that the high levels of fat sugar and salt in a lot of todays processed food are more of a health concern than any migration of chemicals from the packaging
