FINKSBURG MD  A tattoo parlor here has become a mecca for an unlikely crowd women with   Little Vinnies Tattoos offers designs ranging from swordfish and skulls to intricate Japanesestyle art But women who have undergone treatment for breast cancer do not typically come for traditional ink They flock here seeking one thing  a threedimensional nipple tattoo by the owner Vinnie Myers Nobody really talks about the areola and nipple area but its so important says Kimberly Winters  a human resources benefits administrator from Wooster Ohio who underwent a   and reconstruction of her left breast two years ago This spring Ms Winters traveled nearly  miles to Finksburg seeking a realistic nipple tattoo from Mr Myers 
 Word of his skill has spread among women who have undergone surgery for breast cancer More than  women have traveled from as far away as India to have their reconstructed breasts tattooed by Mr Myers After a woman undergoes a mastectomy and breast reconstruction the new breast is a blank canvas While the operation can recreate the size and shape of the patients natural breast by using her own body tissue or implants the darker sensitive skin of the nipple and areola is usually removed entirely Skin grafts can recreate the look of the original nipple but the procedure isnt popular because most patients dont want to have another surgery and another scar says Dr   an assistant clinical professor of surgery at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Instead many doctors and patients choose a tattooed rendition of a nipple In most cases the procedure is performed by a breast surgeon with only a few hours of tattoo training The result is usually a passing resemblance to the real thing  a onedimensional reddish pink or brown circle inked onto the tip of the breast Mr Myers originally specialized in colorful oneofakind tattoos But at a party in  he struck up a conversation with a woman who worked with a plastic surgeon She told me they were having problems tattooing their breast cancer patients and asked me if I would come in and help correct some of them Mr Myers said After doing a few jobs he quickly recognized the need for trained tattoo artists to be involved in breast reconstructions I would never advise anybody to come to me for surgery but in the same vein nobody should go to a surgeon for a tattoo he said As Mr Myers developed his technique word spread and his business grew giving him little time for other tattoos Mr Myers said that in  he decided to stop doing nipple tattoos The morning that I planned on telling the guys to stop taking appointments for them my sister called to tell me she had breast cancer he recalled 
 
He took it as a sign Today he is busier than ever with a waiting list of four to six months He has recruited his daughter Anna  to help with his business When she graduates with an art degree from Towson University in  Anna plans to learn nipple tattooing from her father I get to see tattoos done by different doctors from all over the world and it never ceases to amaze me how bad most of them are Mr Myers said Ive seen tattoos that dont match a womans skin tone or her existing areola nipples that are so large and out of proportion they take up half the breast or nipples that are positioned so far on the sides they are almost in the armpits Doctors have really dropped the ball on this I recently decided to make my own trip to Little Vinnies After two years of breast cancer treatment including   a double mastectomy and four additional surgeries I also wanted to have breasts that at least appeared normal and had the most realisticlooking nipples possible After talking to my doctor I made the fourhour drive from my home in New York to the tattoo shop in Finksburg Inside Little Vinnies butteryellow walls are decorated with mounted antlers traditional Asian face masks and hanging tattoo display racks that offer hundreds of design ideas from butterflies to tribal bands A pet iguana basks under a sun lamp in a glass cage A pool table sits at the center of the main room Tall and lean wearing a fitted houndstooth vest tailored jeans and navy and cognachued wingtips Mr Myers had me stand in front of a mirror as he drew  freehand  the outline of my tattooed areola As he pulled pigments from his inventory  Kelly green dark purple pink and black  he saw the terrified look on my face He explained that he would combine certain colors to complement the undertones of my   Mixed together they would form a naturallooking nipple color He dipped his finger into the ink and streaked it along my chest I wanted it lighter more pink He added three drops of white and then tested the color again Perfect The machine began to buzz and in less than an hour my tattoos were done As I looked in the mirror I was shocked by how real my nipples appeared The pale pink hue was perfect and the shading mimicked the imperfections of a natural nipple Mr Myers charges  to  for his nipple tattoos Some insurance companies reimburse patients while some including mine refuse to pay because Mr Myers is not a licensed health care provider Ms Winters who is AfricanAmerican traveled to Little Vinnies to correct a peachcolored tattoo that didnt match her skin It looked like the areola of a white woman she said Mr Myers created a nipple with subtle brown shading and a threedimensional effect to match the natural nipple on Ms Winterss other breast He created the illusion of a real nipple and areola she said Its amazing
