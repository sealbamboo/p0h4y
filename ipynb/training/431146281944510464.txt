A new bionic hand has for the first time helped a man feel the objects he is holding and tell how big they are and whether theyre hard or soft Its the first time anyone using a prosthetic has been able to really feel what hes picking up and its the latest development in field that has allowed people to   with thought alone and to manipulate objects with   It was quite amazing because suddenly I could feel something that I hadnt been feeling for nine years said yearold Dennis Aabo Sorensen of Aalborg in Denmark who lost his hand and part of his arm in when a faulty fireworks rocket exploded as he lit it in on New Years Eve  Its not quite ready for prime time Sorensen had to undergo delicate surgery to have electrodes implanted in the nerves of his upper arm and then months of training to use the device Silvestro Micera of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland and colleagues at the BioRobotics Institute at Scuola Superiore SantAnna in Pisa Italy developed the device which is described in the journal Science Translational Medicine They had to equip the artificial hand with sensors to detect an objects pliability and shape and translate this into an electrical signal They had to figure out how to translate this signal into something a human nerve could understand and conduct to the brain Implanting the electrodes alone took seven or eight hours of surgery Sorensen said But once it was all up and working it worked well Sorensen was blindfolded and given a hard piece of wood a stack of plastic glasses and a cotton pack and he could tell them apart He was also able to tell when he was handling a bottle a baseball or an orange My kids thought it was cool he said Sorensens since had to give the arm back for more refinement and all the testing was done a year ago They have to make it even better he said Was he disappointed at having to go back to a more standard prosthetic Not really said Sorensen Now that I know it is possible that is the key thing
