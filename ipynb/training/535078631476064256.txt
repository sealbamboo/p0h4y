Top of the morning to you. A shiny sun is hovering over the chilly Pharmalot campus, where the official mascots tell us they do not appreciate the frost gathering on their fur. And who can blame them? As for us, we are keeping warm by – you guessed it – downing a few cups of hot stimulation. Our flavor this week is Blueberry Cobbler for those keeping track. Meanwhile, there is much to be done. So time to get cracking. As always, here are a few tidbits. Hope you have a smashing day and do keep in touch…. Takeda Pharmaceuticals was ordered by a West Virginia jury to pay $155,000 over its destruction of documents about its Actos diabetes drug; a mass protest is planned against AstraZeneca by animal rights activists who say a corporate campus to be built in Cambridge, U.K., will be “the new Huntingdon Life Sciences;” and nearly a decade after losing a bidding war for Guidant to Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson finally has a chance for payback at a multi-billion-dollar trial set to begin today.
