Poor oral health and irregular dental checks can increase the risk of oral cancer a new study has found The International Agency for Research on Cancer report also found excessive use of mouthwash  more than three times a day  can also increase risk Smoking heavy drinking and low socioeconomic status are established risk indicators of mouth and throat cancers  The study covered  cancer patients and a further  control subjects across nine countries in Europe The study was led by the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology in Bremen Germany Bips and backed by researchers from Glasgow University Dental School Prof Wolfgang Ahrens deputy director of Bips described the study findings as really important  Up until now it was not really known if these dental risk factors were independent of the well known risks for mouth and throat cancers  smoking alcohol and low socioeconomic status he said  Prof Ahrens said the report findings were highly nuanced and there was an interconnectedness of many of the risk factors The definition of poor oral health included people who had complete or part dentures and people with persistently bleeding gums  Dr David Conway clinical senior lecturer at Glasgow University Dental School said People should not assume that if they wear dentures and have none of their own teeth left they have no need to see a dentist On the contrary even if you have got dentures you should make sure you go for regular checkups  People with poor dental care were defined as those who hardly ever or never brushed their teeth or visited the dentist  Dr Conway said the frequency of dental visits should be determined by a dentists risk assessment and if people fell into the lowrisk category it could be once a year or even every two years It is not a case of one size fits all he added Visits could be sixmonthly but certainly not fiveyearly  The research team said the possible role of mouthwash as a risk factor would require further research They were unable to analyse the types of mouthwash used many years ago by participants in the study  Dr Conway added I would not advise routine use of mouthwash full stop  There are occasions and conditions for which a dentist could prescribe a mouthwash  it could be that a patient has a low salivary flow because of a particular condition or medicine they are taking  But for me all thats necessary in general is good regular brushing with a fluoride toothpaste and flossing combined with regular checkups by a dentist  The findings of the study have been published in Oral Oncology
