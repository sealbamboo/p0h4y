An international team of scientists has been set up to determine the effectiveness of using the blood of Ebola survivors as a treatment  It is hoped the antibodies used by the immune system to fight Ebola can be transferred from a survivor to a patient  The study will start in Guinea and is led by the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp Belgium The European Union has given m euros m to fund the project There are no widely available proven drugs or vaccines for Ebola  The World Health Organization has backed the use of survivors blood as the worst outbreak of Ebola in history continues to get worse  People produce antibodies in the blood in an attempt to fight off an Ebola infection  In theory those antibodies can be transferred from a survivor into a sick patient to give their immune system a boost  However largescale data on the effectiveness of the therapy is lacking  Studies on the  outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC    after being given the therapy  Johan van Griensven from the Institute of Tropical Medicine said Blood and plasma therapy are medical interventions with a long history safely used for other infectious diseases  We want to find out whether this approach works for Ebola is safe and can be put into practice to reduce the number of deaths in the present outbreak  Ebola survivors contributing to curb the epidemic by donating blood could reduce fear of the disease and improve their acceptance in the communities  In total more than  people have died of Ebola The efforts will be a collaboration between the Institute of Tropical Medicine University of Liverpool London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine University of Oxford AixMarseille University the French Blood Transfusion Service Institute Pasteur and the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research  The consortium also includes the National Blood Transfusion Centre in Conakry Guinea the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale in Kinshasha DRC and the Belgian Red CrossFlanders The Wellcome Trust a medical charity based in the UK is also working on the project  Its director Jeremy Farrar said Convalescent serum offers the best potential treatment for Ebola in the short term that could be scaled up if proven effective  Global collaboration of this nature including clinical researchers and multiple partners from across Europe and West Africa is both unprecedented and essential if we are to bring the current outbreak under control
