The gut microbiome may soon reveal important answers to questions about our health But those answers arent yet easy to spot or quick to obtain The week after I mailed off my familys microbial samples to be analyzed for   I followed them down the road from my home to the University of Colorado Boulder They  and I  came to a massive futuristic science complex there Daniel McDonald a doctoral student studying quantitative biology and computer science greeted me and brought me up to the workspace where rows of researchers worked on computers outside of a small lab room Inside the lab where the sealed samples were received a lone technician sorted through new arrivals snipping off intentionally fouled swab heads Each sample kit contains two cotton swabs One swab head goes directly to the freezers for safe keeping in case the first sample doesnt provide clear results or for the near future when sequencing technology is better The other gets dissolved in a solution so its contents can be carefully analyzed for genetic traces of microbes Just down the hall is one of the labs boxedin robots charged with loading samples into individual wells on a tray that will later get fed through the sequencers The task might seem mundane for such a hightech tool but the bot works much faster and more accurately than a human lab helper can Still this is where some of the work can be slow going The team must wait for hundreds of fecal oral or skin samples to process together A single sample could go through the full analysis process in a week but it would cost thousands of dollars   a cofounder of the project estimates rather than the  members of the study pay For the project to be costeffective for participants the research team must wait to collect large groups of samples and analyze them together Little did I know then just how long I would be waiting for my familys samples to be processed Most of the human microbiome is uncharted territory because many of the microbes that live in our guts cant be grown easily in the lab Oxygen is toxic to them Using the tools of genetics to probe the human microbiome has already uncovered many new species each of which has a full genome of its own Were still far from getting quick full genomes from each of the inhabitants Instead scientists rely on microbes telltale   a marker that helps identify bacteria from one another Finding the base pairs the As Cs Ts and Gs  for this gene can help scientists sort out which species are present This is where a nifty machine that performs PCR   comes in It makes thousands of copies of the genetic material so that the pattern in the genetic code is easier for the sequencers to find These sequencers are located on a lower floor of the building in a room that smells a bit like a photography darkroom Here each tray of samples takes about  hours to process On a nearby screen I see a readout of bright genetic points against a dark background which looks more like a telescopic image of a night sky than the code to microbial life from someones stomach Deciphering this code is just the first step in understanding what is going on in the jungle of your gut Like many things in biology it is not just the organisms present  plants animals or bacteria  but how these organisms interact that is important The dynamics among the characters make a play  not just the cast For instance   that many of us are walking around with   in our guts but show no ill effects In much the same way that weeds or hungry insects might not harm a thriving field or forest but could wreak havoc on an unbalanced ecosystem we depend on a healthful mix of good microbes to keep the bad ones from taking over And to see what our intestinal forests are composed of we need more than just a few points of genetic data So after the sequencer spits out the genetic code it has assembled the data needs to get turned back into intelligible or at least semiintelligible patterns To do this our microbial code gets run through a supercomputer nicknamed Compy which hums safely in the buildings basement beyond two sets of doors and a sticky dustcollecting floor mat When I meet her Compy is busy crunching away on base pairs with her  processors From there the microbe sequences get reunited with their human hosts information from the questionnaires But figuring out the best way to do this is still a work in progress The research group is testing using new software to analyze and display these many layers of information One colorful display that we examine back up in McDonalds fourthfloor office shows a D plot of microbe species and their sites on the human body It looks a little like an explosion of Dippin Dots caught in midair  only the brown blobs dont indicate chocolate But these dots arent   microbes Our samples are still standing by in a freezer for their turn with the robots and whirring sequencing machines With our samples in the hopper and the process of turning a messy poopswab into a sterile colorcoded microbiome chart a bit demystified it was now time to wait to see what our swipes would turn up
