When did the language we use to talk about death start to resemble a Pentagon briefing full of military references and combat analogies Maybe it dates to  when Richard Nixon declared a war on cancer Or much earlier in the late s when doctors began using the word armamentarium to describe all the techniques materials and equipment available to treat disease Certainly these metaphors have since become pervasive among patients and physicians the public and the news media Family members seek aggressive treatment for an ailing relative saying Hes a fighter  or Shes a survivor We talk about whether people with terminal diseases want heroic measures or not And when people die we portray them not as having succumbed to disease but as having struggled to the very end before being vanquished by a superior foe Recent death notices in The New York Times which are placed by families as opposed to the obituaries written by reporters memorialized a woman in her s who died after a valiant battle against Alzheimers and Parkinsons and a yearold man who died after a longfought battle with prostate cancer The bellicose wording reflects some of the deathdenying and deathdefying feelings we find in our culture said Dr Daniel Johnson a palliativecare physician in Denver who directs the Kaiser Permanente Care Management Institute Society sees death as the enemy so its not surprising we turn to language that references war But that can have unhappy real world consequences Dr Johnson recently cautioned in a talk at the Association of Health Care Journalists national conference Patients have taken him aside to confess that they dread another round of chemotherapy but fear disappointing those who expect them to fight Theyre nervous about what their doctors and their families might think he told me in an interview What they may actually want to say is that Ive lived a really good life and now I want to spend time with my family instead of at a dialysis center or in intensive care To spend ones final weeks or months free of that pressure can be potentially transformative and beautiful Dr Johnson said Often though to give up has become shameful Consider the couple whom Patrice Villars a gerontological and palliativecare nursepractitioner is working with at the VA Medical Center in San Francisco Hes nearly  has metastatic lung cancer can no longer leave his hospital bed and has lost his appetite  a normal expected development at the end of life But his wife urges  him to eat and to just try harder His life expectancy is measurable in days or weeks Ms Villars said regardless of what he eats Ms Villars who   on the GeriPal blog a few years ago has come to see this language as stemming from the grief of those about to be left behind  Its intolerable to think of losing someone they care so deeply about she told me I think its true for health care providers too We feel helpless and sad and we dont know where to put that But she added war words make us judgmental I worry about the implication that somehow someone was deficient or a loser or didnt do something right if they died she told me People die The idea that sick and old people must wage war is on my mind lately as well For some people in some situations allout combat against a reversible condition makes sense In late January when a beloved cousin of mine Rae LeRoy had trouble breathing and went to the hospital it seemed logical to treat what initially looked like pneumonia She was a vibrant yearold still living in her house driving to club meetings doing water aerobics perhaps she could regain her strength and continue her active life a while longer But one hospitalization followed another a toofamiliar cycle of  calls release to a rehabilitation center and readmission She had developed heart failure not a curable condition Each hospital stay left her further weakened Was it time to shift to comfort care to call a hospice Her longtime doctor not only discouraged the idea when Raes daughter asked that entirely reasonable question but scoffed at it Were not anywhere near that She wanted Rae to continue The Fight But why Rae had fulfilled every obligation lived life fully and now she was weeping with fatigue saying I cant do it anymore Im so tired Is fighting which presumably means using everything in the armamentarium the only way to show courage at the end of life A palliativecare physician finally sat down with Rae and her children in late March explained her options and told her You decided how you wanted to live and now you get to decide how you want to die Rae chose to stop going to the hospital enter hospice care say goodbye to friends and family  a valiant decision in my book and her childrens  and let death come as it would It came in days She didnt want to die bloodied and exhausted on a battlefield She wanted peace Others will make different decisions and Id like to hear about your families experiences but they might feel freer to make them if they were released from the language of war and the expectations that accompany it  If immortality has become the only victory were all failures
