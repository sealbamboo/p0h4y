Are you reading this after a long days work lounging in bed with the love of your life If so I promise I wont feel bad if you stash the phone to take some time to talk in real life But if youre still reading youre probably not alone   percent of women in a recent survey said smartphones were interfering in their romantic relationship The   published Monday in the journal   says technology and the screens that consume us are creating technoference in couples That ranges from picking up the phone while partners are casually hanging out to checking Facebook while in the middle of an argument You see it everywhere says   psychologist at Brigham Young University and an author of the study Like at a restaurant where couples have their phones both of them on the table right there I think that is so easy for them to pick it up if it buzzes The study surveyed  married or cohabiting heterosexual women and asked them about their phone TV computer and tablet habits It also asked about how their partner used technology if there was any conflict about using technology and about their satisfaction with their relationship and life overall Play along if youd like to see how you compare against the women surveyed They said computers were the most interfering technology in their relationship followed by cellphones They also reported that of five scenarios presented to them the most common interference was seeing a partner pick up his phone during couple leisure time with  percent of women reporting this happened at least once a day Forty percent of women said their men would get distracted by the TV during a conversation at least once a day while a third said he would take out his phone in the middle of a conversation or during a meal together A quarter said their partner would actually send texts or emails to another person while they were having a facetoface conversation But worse than the intrusions was the way they made the women feel they found as you might expect that conflict over technology was associated with poorer relationships which in turn were associated with lower life satisfaction With mobile phone technology emerging on the scene as quickly as it did we all jumped into computermediated interactions without really thinking much about the implications developmental psychologist   at Indiana UniversityPurdue University Fort Wayne who was not involved with the study told Shots via email However this study involved a small group of women and the researchers acknowledge that these correlations could be due to other factors affecting a persons wellbeing But for those feeling similarly aggravated by     the authors say the answer isnt to completely remove technology from the relationship Its not silly for couples to make rules about technology says Coyne Just having the discussion about whats OK and whats not when it comes to devices at the dinner table or in the bedroom can help Her own method Put the phone out of my reach like on top of the refrigerator just so that it releases the temptation
