Ministers must launch an inquiry into how whistleblowers are treated in the wake of the Orchid View care home scandal MP Charlotte Leslie has said The Tory MP spoke after Lisa Martin revealed she had not worked since exposing abuse at Orchid View in Copthorne West Sussex in  That was an indictment of our system Ms Leslie told BBC Radio  live  The government said it would be publishing plans on protecting whistleblowers later this year On Friday at an inquest into  deaths at Orchid View West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield said the home was riddled with institutionalised abuse She ruled that neglect contributed to five of the deaths and said the home then run by Southern Cross was mismanaged and understaffed Orchid View has since reopened under a new name and new management Ms Martin who first told police about problems at the home told  live on Saturday I do want to work back in care but I cant get a job in the care industry again Where I live is a very small village next to Copthorne  everyone knows what went on Its just been an absolute nightmare for me Obviously I know morally that I did the right things Whether I would ever do that again  I probably wouldnt because its had a huge impact on my life Conservative MP Ms Leslie who is also a member of the health select committee told  lives Sunday Breakfast that Ms Martins experience was absolutely appalling but sadly its becoming a recurring theme Whistleblowers across the NHS and the care system do the right thing stand up and save lives in many cases And then other future employers look at them and instead of saying thank goodness  heres someone who can prevent bad things happening they look at them and say heres a troublemaker People who are saving lives are losing their jobs losing their livelihoods and everything She added Thats why I think a whistleblowing inquiry or review is needed into how we can ensure that whistleblowing isnt needed  because management systems iron out these things before it gets to whistleblowing  and how you can protect whistleblowers A spokesperson for the Department of Health DoH said staff in the health and social care sectors should never be stopped from raising concerns about patient safety and the secretary of state for health has told trusts that doing this is unacceptable Staff should be able to speak out and we are determined to ensure that if individuals raise concerns about patient safety they are listened to they added The department said that later this year it would publish its response to a public inquiry report released in February into failings at Stafford Hospital which came after years of neglect led to the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of patients Its response to the inquiry would lay out how we plan on making sure whistleblowers are not just protected but also praised for their courage and thanked by management That would form a key part of the effort to build the safe effective and compassionate culture that patients the public and the overwhelming majority of staff across health and social care expect the spokesperson added
