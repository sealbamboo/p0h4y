Friday marks a notsohappy anniversary for some of President Obamas biggest supporters Its exactly one year since Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius decided   on availability of the socalled morningafter pill   But now with the election safely behind them backers of the pill are hoping the administration may be willing to revisit the issue We are asking Secretary Sebelius to go back and take another look at the science the medical evidence  and see if theres a way to come to agreement to make this product more easily available to the women who need it says Kirsten Moore president and CEO of the   Moore points out that during the past year the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recommended that   while the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended   Since  emergency contraceptives have been available under whats known as a split label That means   for the product which is really just a high dose of regular birth control pills It is not the same as the abortion pill   But the split label also means that even those old enough to buy the product without a prescription must ask a pharmacist for it  and show ID Moore says thats not the ideal situation for a product that works best when taken as soon as possible Plan B is most effective if taken within  hours of unprotected intercourse Having Plan B on the shelf between condoms and pregnancy test kits is where it belongs not behind the counter she says Plus when its behind the counter its not just younger women who may have trouble getting it Last year Oklahoma law student Hilary McKinney went to a nearby Target with her fiance after his condom broke She sent him to the pharmacy counter to pick it up But the pharmacist wouldnt sell it to him McKinney returned to the counter and confronted the pharmacist she says and she looked at me and said I cant sell it to men Who knows what they could be doing with it  For the record Plan B is supposed to be available to anyone  or older without a prescription   The FDA originally approved the drug without prescription for those ages  and over in  it lowered the age to  after a judges order   McKinney who now practices family law in Tulsa says her experience is an example of why she thinks the product ought to be much more easily available We never invited this pharmacist into making our reproductive choices with us she says And she shouldnt have intervened in what is a legal safe effective way of preventing a pregnancy which is what we were trying to do Last December with a Democratic administration   the age restriction would be lifted And thats what FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg recommended But she was   who said she was worried about use by the youngest teenagers However many people assumed the decision was   Catholics were already up in arms about   and it was thought that the administration didnt want to add any more fuel to the fire with the election approaching Now however things are different Moore says The voters said very clearly this past November that when it comes to womens health they think that prevention is a good thing providing contraception is a good thing reducing barriers to access whether it be cost is a good thing she says And they supported a candidate who clearly made that a part of his message Moreover Moore says she thinks the election shows that there would be no political price to be paid by the administration for making what advocates say is the sciencebased decision If there was concern that doing the right thing by emergency contraception was going to get people into trouble she says I think that questions been asked and answered politically That is not to suggest that the political opposition to making Plan B more widely available has disappeared The reality is if its easier to obtain then it becomes not Plan B but Plan A  says Wendy Wright a vice president at the   It becomes the choice of first resort rather than last resort Wright also says younger girls are more at risk of being abused and need the contact with a medical professional ensured by requiring a prescription If young girls are sexually active theyre very likely the victims of sexual abuse and a medical exam provides the opportunity for someone to intervene to rescue a girl who is being sexually abused Wright says And so it really is in the best interest of girls having the morningafter pill only through prescription to ensure that not only are her medical needs being met but also to ensure that shes not being abused The Obama administration meanwhile had no comment as to whether it plans to revisit its decision to keep the current age restrictions in place
