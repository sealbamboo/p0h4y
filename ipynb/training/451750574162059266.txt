Enter D printers which because of their precise process can reproduce the vascular systems required to make organs viable Scientists are already using the machines to print tiny strips of organ tissue And while printing whole human organs for surgical transplants is still years away the technology is rapidly developing The mechanical process isnt all that complicated The tricky part is the materials which are biological in nature said   which covers the industry It isnt like D printing plastic or metal Plastic doesnt die if you leave it sitting on an openair shelf at room temperature for too long The idea of printing a human kidney or liver in a lab may seem incomprehensible even creepy But to many scientists in the field bioprinting holds great promise Authentic printed organs could be used for drug or vaccine testing freeing researchers from less accurate methods such as tests on animals or on synthetic models Then theres the hope that D printers could someday produce muchneeded organs for transplants Americans are living longer and as we get deeper into old age our organs are failing more   because of a shortage of donated organs  a problem that   and a pioneer in bioprinting calls a major health crisis Bioprinting works like this Scientists harvest human cells from biopsies or stem cells then allow them to multiply in a petri dish The resulting mixture a sort of biological ink is fed into a D printer which is programmed to arrange different cell types along with other materials into a precise threedimensional shape Doctors hope that when placed in the body these Dprinted cells will integrate with existing tissues The process already is seeing some success Last year a yearold girl in Illinois born without a trachea   The US government has funded  that prints tissue samples that mimic the functions of the heart liver lungs and other organs The samples are placed on a microchip and connected with a blood substitute to keep the cells alive allowing doctors to test specific treatments and monitor their effectiveness This is an exciting new area of medicine It has the potential for being a very important breakthrough said Dr Jorge Rakela a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix and a member of the  s medical advisory committee ThreeD printing allows you to be closer to what is happening in real life where you have multiple layers of cells he said With current D models if you grow more than one or two layers the cells at the bottom suffocate from lack of oxygen To accelerate the development of bioprinted organs a Virginia foundation that supports regenerative medicine research   for the first organization to print a fully functioning liver One early contender for the prize is   that has been a leader in bioprinting human body parts for commercial purposes Using cells from donated tissue or stem cells Organovo is developing what it hopes will be authentic models of human organs primarily livers for drug testing  The company has printed strips of human liver tissue in its labs although they are still very small four by four by one millimeter or about onefourth the size of a dime Each strip takes about  minutes to print and it takes another two days for the cells to grow and mature said Organovo CEO Keith Murphy The models can then survive for about  days Organovo has also built models of human kidneys bone cartilage muscle blood vessels and lung tissue he said Basically what it allows you to do is build tissue the way you assemble something with Legos Murphy said So you can put the right cells in the right places You cant just pour them into a mold Not everyone is comfortable with this bold new future of labbuilt body parts however A research director at Gartner Inc the informationtechnology research and advisory firm believes D bioprinting is advancing so quickly that it will spark a major ethical debate by  ThreeD bioprinting facilities with the ability to print human organs and tissue will advance far faster than general understanding and acceptance of the ramifications of this technology    These initiatives are wellintentioned but raise a number of questions that remain unanswered Basiliere added What happens when complex enhanced organs involving nonhuman cells are made Who will control the ability to produce them Who will ensure the quality of the resulting organs Bioprinted organs are also likely to be expensive which could put them out of reach of all but the wealthiest patients Murphy said Organovo only uses human cells in creating tissues and doesnt see any ethical problems with what his company is doing People used to worry about doing research on cadavers  and that dissipated very quickly he said We dont think theres any controversy if youre producing good data and helping people with health conditions Most experts   dont think well see complex Dprinted organs suitable for transplants for years if not decades Instead they believe the next step will be printing strips of tissue or patches that could be used to repair livers and other damaged organs We are very eager to put pieces of tissue to work for surgical transplants said Organovos Murphy who hopes his company will be ready to begin clinical trials within five years Of course any use of Dprinted tissue in surgical procedures would require approval by the US Food and Drug Administration That review process could take up to a decade By then the notion of a surgeon putting a Dprinted kidney into a patient may not seem so bizarre Then again this swiftly evolving technology may create new moral conundrums  The ethical questions are bound to be the same concerns we have seen in the past  Many major medical breakthroughs have suffered moral resistance from organ transplants to stem cells said Titsch of D Printer World   Will only the rich be able to afford it  Are we playing God  In the end saving lives tends to trump all objections
