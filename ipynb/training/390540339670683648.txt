Members of the US national rowing team follow an intense training regimen that combines rowing weight lifting and aerobic training for  to  hours a week We asked Esther Lofgren an Olympic gold medalist to take us through the rowers workout Ms Lofgren  who stands nearly  feet  inches tall grew up in Newport Beach Calif and later rowed for Harvard University She is a time national rowing team member and a world record holder Last year she   at the London Olympics in the event known as the   Ms Lofgren calls rowing a strength endurance sport  the races are a combination of endurance exercise and power lifting Her training regimen involves building muscle and doing plenty of aerobic training on the water and on a rowing ergometer machine known as the erg Recently we caught up with Ms Lofgren at the US Rowing Training Center in Princeton to talk about the rowers workout injury prevention and what its like to eat  calories a day Heres an edited version of our conversation My parents were both elite rowers back in the s and s which when I reached my teens made me think that rowing was very uncool I played a lot of other sports but my best friend rowed and he said If youre looking for another sport to try theyd love to have you Youre tall and its a great community So I went down and after the first practice where we got to go on the water I was hooked In a rowing race youre sitting in a boat thats stopped in the water and you have to pick the boat up out of the water from a dead stop until you get up to speed Youre essentially power lifting as fast as you can for  seconds until you get the boat up to speed and then you have another five minutes of racing Everyone out on the water is in an intense amount of pain trying to process the lactic acid If youve ever sprinted up a hill as hard as you can you know the feeling of hitting a wall Everyone that you see in a rowing race is hitting that wall about  seconds into the race and then we keep going for another five minutes I calculated that by the time I got to the starting line at the Olympics there was a six to seven minute race ahead of us and I had put in something like  hours of training for every second that I was going to be racing Thinking back on that preparation helps me feel confident at the starting line I think the ratio is something like  percent legs  percent body and  percent arms The biggest thing were using in the boat is our quads Our hips are extending our legs are pushing and driving and thats where the foundation of everything that we do on the rowing machine and on the water comes from We train six to seven days a week with two to four practices on each of those days Its about  to  hours a week of working out In a typical day we might row in the morning lift for the second practice and then work on the erg in the evening We do a lot of stretching yoga and physical therapy too Weight lifting is key for successful performance in rowing You can use it in two ways One is to build the leg muscles back muscles and arm strength which we can then condition on the water But were also using weights to balance out all the rowing stuff that we do because your quads can only get so big before you need to have hamstrings to balance them out If were just doing rowing for a few days then when we come in the weight room we might do things like bench press which is the opposite motion The rowing motion is pulling in so doing things where youre pushing back and working the opposing muscles can help you perform better and make you less prone to injury Injuries are a huge thing in our sport The most common injuries are stress fractures to your ribs The stronger the legs are the harder they can drive your butt back and that can injure your ribs if you dont have a strong core Lower back injuries are also something people associate with rowing And that also can come from not having a strong enough core to support the work that your legs are doing We do two to four core training circuits a week In the weight room we tend to focus on Olympic lifts but we dont necessarily try to max out We try to properly execute the lift and do the repetitions in a way that develops your core Two of the big Olympic movements that we do are deadlifts and cleans I think the closest lift to the rowing motion would be a power high pull Picking the bar up from the ground and bringing it up to your chest Youre doing a driving motion with your legs extending with your hips swinging your back open and finishing it with your arms Its similar to what we do on the water At the beginning of the year our lifting is more oriented toward three to five sets of low repetitions with higher weights And then we do something called endurance lifting which was popularized by the East Germans back in the Soviet era Its very high reps of generally lighter weight So that might be  or  or  reps at a very light weight but youre fatiguing your muscles in a much different way We do a lot of cross training because with rowing if you do too much of it youre going to get overuse injuries So running is a big cardio exercise for us And we do indoor cycling for pretty long distances We use cross training as a way to get a physical and mental break from rowing I tend to stay along the perimeter of the grocery store Im a big fan of fruits and vegetables and we do a lot of whole foods as much as possible I currently eat mostly paleo which has been described as a caveman diet So a lot of raw fruits vegetables nuts meats Im also a big fan of smoothies Ill just take a blender and add as much as I can fit in there  spinach kale milk some Greek yogurt almond butter berries and maybe some protein powder and a banana It varies by day Depending on the time of year and the particular week Id say my range is about  to  calories per day which is nice sometimes But  calories of spinach and almond milk is a lot of food so sometimes ice cream will work its way in there My college coach had a saying which was that oats move boats so Im a religious oatmeal eater before races My mom was actually the last woman cut from the  Olympic team and then I was born in  My parents have been huge supporters of my rowing career the whole way When we crossed the finish line at the Olympics it was a very emotional and exciting experience You go and get your medals and do interviews before finally you come to the place where your family is When I saw my mom I went up to her and I put my medal around her neck That was one of the most special moments in my life I actually carry my gold medal around in a beanie and I usually have it with me at most times Its a good incentive not to lose my purse
