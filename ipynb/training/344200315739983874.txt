The actor Michael Douglas has done for   what Rock Hudson did for   and   By asserting last week that his   was caused by a virus transmitted during oral sex Mr Douglas pushed the disease onto the front pages and made millions of Americans worry about it for the first time In this case it was a subset of Americans who normally worry more about being killed by cholesterol than by an STD The typical victim is a middleaged middleclass married heterosexual white man who has had about six oral sex partners in his lifetime The virus   Type  also causes   So is there any early oral screening that a man can have  an equivalent to the   which has nearly eliminated cervical cancer as a death threat in this country The answer according to cancer experts and   from the United States Preventive Services Task Force is no And for surprising reasons The    invented in  by Dr George N Papanicolaou  involves scraping a few cells from the cervix and checking them under a microscope for precancerous changes Precancerous cells have a halo around the nucleus while cancerous ones have larger more colorful nuclei said Dr Paul D Blumenthal a professor of gynecology at Stanford University Medical School In theory it should be similarly easy to scrape and examine throat cells But in fact cancer specialists said doing so would be useless Virtually all cancers on the mouth tongue gums hard palate or anywhere in front of the uvula the punching bag dangling from the soft palate are caused by tobacco and alcohol The kind of chronic HPV  infection that leads to   occurs much farther down near the base of the tongue Adding to the difficulty the infection is often deep down in the crypts of the tonsils said Dr Eric J Moore a Mayo Clinic surgeon specializing in such cancers The tonsils an expanse of lymphoid tissue that includes much more than the two backofthethroat bumps removed in tonsillectomies have deep folds and crevices If you spread them out theyre  feet by  feet said Dr Marshall R Posner medical director for head and neck cancer at Mount Sinai Medical Center You cant swab them Its just not possible By contrast the end of the cervix swabbed during a Pap test is only about two square inches and easily reached with a speculum It is impossible even to see deep tonsillar tissue without a scope that goes through the nose Probing this area would set off gag and vomit reflexes so strong that patients might have to be anesthetized A saliva test can detect an oral HPV infection But thats not useful since  percent of the population catches at least one of the  different human papillomaviruses that circulate Most infections are beaten by the immune system in a year or two Even among those who get an oral HPV  infection less than  percent will go on to develop throat cancer If I tell you that you have HPV in your mouth its not going to help you if I dont have anything to offer you and youre going to live with the anxiety and fear that you might get cancer said Dr Robert I Haddad chief of head and neck cancer at the DanaFarber Cancer Institute in Boston But if I tell a woman that she has an abnormal Pap smear theres something she can do about it Someone with chronic HPV  year after year would be at the highest risk for throat cancer  but even then it is not clear what to do Probing through all the tonsillar tissue under   looking for something worrisome to   would be difficult and expensive and could set off bleeding near the entrance to the lungs Even when surgeons find large cancerous lymph nodes the primary tumor that seeded them sometimes turns out to be a speck only a sixteenth of an inch wide buried by healthy tissue Dr Moore said Although throat cancer caused by HPV is increasing it is relatively rare About  cases a year are diagnosed in the United States compared with  lung cancers But it is growing in importance as smokingrelated oral cancers decline Oral sex has become more common since the sexual revolution of the s but not astonishingly so According to Debby Herbenick a director of Indiana Universitys Center for Sexual Health Promotion the mean number of lifetime oral sex partners reported by American men  to  is six Men  to  report five and men  to  report four Men over  and under  report three However such fairly modest changes in sexual habits do not explain why the cancer risk has doubled or tripled over the years said Gypsyamber DSouza a viral cancer specialist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health It has risen the most in white men  and up The older age is explained by the fact that like cervical cancer it can take decades to develop Men are twice as likely as women to get it according to Dr DSouza and it is more common among whites than blacks perhaps because whites are more likely by  percent to  percent to have ever performed oral sex And straight men are more likely to get the cancer than gay men One theory is that there may be more HPV in vaginal fluid than on the penis said Dr Lori J Wirth a head and neck cancer specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital The lack of a screening test means that a doctor should be seen as soon as symptoms appear a   a   or   that persists for two weeks or what Dr Posner called the hot potato voice the way you talk when something is burning the back of your throat Though no studies proving it have been done   and Cervarix the vaccines to prevent cervical cancer from HPV Types  and  should also prevent this oral cancer and should be offered to boys and young men several doctors said
