Back in  french fry lovers around the world received a nasty bit of news Those crunchy fried strips of potato contained a known carcinogen Now all these years later a new warning from the Food and Drug Administration has consumers once again puzzling over whether to fear the chemical acrylamide Acrylamide was known to cause cancer in lab animals when ingested at high doses So when researchers announced a decade ago that they had also discovered it in many commonly eaten foods  including French fries potato chips bread and even coffee  consumers were understandably worried that their snack chips might do them in The news set off a bit of a panic and even some   A panel convened by the World Health Organization concluded that acrylamide in food was indeed a major concern and the FDA issued an   Fast forward to last week when the FDA issued its first   for industry on how to minimize acrylamide in food products At the same time the agency also offered   on how to reduce their intake at home  such as frying food less often or toasting bread to light rather than dark brown But heres the real head scratcher In the years since that first scare researchers have studied acrylamide in humans and they havent confirmed those initial cancer concerns So why is the FDA acting now Im not really sure why they issued this now says   an epidemiologist at Harvards School of Public Health who studies the link between diet and cancer Certainly the human evidence on acrylamide doesnt suggest that it should be a priority in terms of our diets at this point she tells The Salt An FDA spokeswoman tells The Salt that the new draft guidelines have been in the works since  Acrylamide it turns out turns up in foods mostly plantbased ones when they are fried baked or otherwise cooked at high temperatures It forms from sugars and an amino acid naturally found in food as part of the   thats the chemical reaction that transforms the flavor and color of food when cooked In other words it has been in our foods probably for as long as weve been cooking but we didnt know it until a little over a decade ago Acrylamide by the way is also a known neurotoxin in humans but the WHO says the levels found in food   on that front Of course cancer epidemiology is one of the toughest areas of research  its notoriously hard to show cause and effect But most of the human studies published so far have failed to find any links between dietary acrylamide and various types of cancers We found a suggestion that it might increase ovarian and endometrial cancer but we found nothing for breast and nothing for prostate Wilson says Most of these studies are based on what people report about their diets Wilson says only a few have taken a more rigorous approach measuring blood levels of acrylamide and then looking for a connection to cancer Two studies that did this found no link to prostate or   cancer Wilson says the one study that did find a connection between blood levels of acrylamide and breast cancer was flawed because it didnt control for smoking  which is probably one of the main routes of acrylamide exposure for smokers   the American Cancer Society But she says theres a need for more of these bloodbased research studies to investigate acrylamide in food Still even though the human research hasnt pinpointed much of a cancer risk from eating acrylamide the National Toxicology Program   as reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen because of those animal studies If youre still worried the FDA and other public health groups say the best defense is to follow the general advice on healthful eating including going easy on fried and fatty foods And as for french fries As Wilson notes You probably shouldnt be eating them for a lot of other reasons than acrylamide content
