Tim Wotton was told he wouldnt live past  because of cystic fibrosis but having reached  he lives every day like it could be his last Every hour of every day is important for me as I never know when I will run out of time Having the lifelimiting condition cystic fibrosis CF drives my thirst for life I dress each day like its my last day on Earth and never leave my favourite clothes in the wardrobe waiting for that special moment I dont see the need to gripe about the small things I hear around the office instead I take time each day to appreciate something natural like a sunset or landscape Every day should be punctuated by special moments  For most of my adult life I was never happier than when my weekends were crammed full  I call them Windows  weekends  I gave them that name because there are seven windows of social opportunity after work ends for the week Friday evening Saturday morning afternoon and evening and Sunday morning afternoon and evening  If I were able to fill all seven slots with an activity of some kind  sport lunch dinner shopping cinema family partying  then in my mind I was savouring every moment  This fullon lifestyle spanned my late teens university all my twenties and early thirties and was driven by the likelihood that I would die young  Nowadays I have different priorities but I still take full advantage of those windows in each day to fit in quality time with family socialising my business consultant job and not forgetting my vital exercise in the form of hockey on Saturdays and evening gym sessions Cystic fibrosis is one of the UKs most common lifethreatening inherited diseases affecting over  people It affects the internal organs especially the lungs and digestive system by clogging them with thick sticky mucus making it hard to breathe and digest food Each week five babies are born with the condition but also each week three young lives are also lost to it There is currently no cure My wife Katie and sevenyearold son Felix provide the necessary motivation to keep on top of my survival battle and offer me a ready supply of lifeaffirming memories  Katie a senior nurse understood my medical needs from day one and was hardly ever phased by the sights and sounds of CF I frequently cough so hard and for so long that I go into spasm and end up being sick on myself  often as Im getting ready to go to work A single coughing fit can last longer than an hour and is exhausting My wife pitches in to assist me and has taken my lifeexpectancy worries in her stride She appreciates my zest for life but reminds me to pace myself at times Felix has grown up surrounded by medical paraphernalia and has become accustomed to seeing me use my bizarrelooking nebulizer and taking my  tablets per day which he calls Daddys sweets Im around for them as much as possible and give Felix quality time coaching him to play hockey taking my turn to get up early with him at the weekend going on family days out and taking Katie out for dinner I achieve these things against a daily backdrop of two to three hours of treatment to maintain my CF as well as regular visits to the GP chemist and hospital Im only as healthy as my last treatment so I have to think of it all as enabling rather than diminishing my life  One cruel twist is that CF can be a lonely and solitary condition as us CFers are advised not to meet facetoface for fear of making ourselves more ill from crossinfection different people can carry different bacteria It means we cannot socialise easily or give each other regular support This segregation of patients was enforced in CF clinics over four years ago so I am no longer able to engage in waiting room smalltalk with others who have the same condition as me Ive not been able to see my older CF mentor Chris in all that time and can only connect via email now  Although we can use social media its a shame that CF folk cant openly meet up and chew the fat By not being able to see each others body language we miss out on the most powerful form of communication As much as I despise my daily health battle it has given me a perspective on life that many people may never attain or will only encounter later in life People with a lifethreatening condition have a pronounced ability to not only identify but fully appreciate magic moments as they contrast so strikingly with the usual daily hardship I find it liberating to look at each day as potentially my last day on Earth
