The yearold was born with   an autoimmune skin disease that results in hair loss on the scalp and other places on the body The condition affects  of Americans both male and female according to the National Institutes of Health People with alopecia generally start losing hair in their youth which was the case for Katarina At age  she started seeing patches of her hair on the floor of the tub after taking showers and on her pillow after getting out of bed With no real cure available Katarina went completely bald at  She sported a mediumlength black wig throughout much of elementary school but after graduating she approached her mom and said she wanted to stop wearing it in middle school  She said the wig irritated her scalp especially during gym activities and she felt hot while wearing it But most importantly Katarina says she just wanted to be herself around her friends I was fearful she was going to get picked on She was picked on a little in elementary school said her mother Carmela Aranda She had seen students questioning Katarina about her condition asking her why she was losing her hair and whether she was sick   Aranda was nervous that by not wearing the wig to her new middle school Katarina would be subjecting herself to bullying and ridicule  Bullying was something Aranda was all too familiar with After a high fever and ear infection she lost her hearing at the age of  and grew up as the only deaf girl at her school I grew up in the s she explained The kids at school didnt know how to interact with me They made fun of my voice It was the kind of experience she didnt want for her daughter But Katarina was determined to stop wearing her wig and approached her middle school counselor Jennicca Mabe about her condition in private Mabe had similar concerns that Katarina might get picked on but worked with other teachers and the administration at Skyview Middle School to figure out how to share Katarinas story with the rest of her peers  With Arandas blessing Mabe and other school officials enlisted Katarinas teachers to help create a short documentary about Katarina and what it was like living with alopecia Mabe thought that if you educate people and if you tell them about things and you tell them that it isnt contagious that people wont pick on me Katarina said Katarinas science teacher Connie Sandel was one of the participants in the documentary  I was a little bit surprised she said when she learned that Katarina wanted to tell other students she was bald  Most kids dont come forward in middle school and do something like that In middle school kids can be a little harsh and bullying can be a problem But I wanted to support her in what she wanted to do Sandel said The documentary was screened this month in the schools library for several groups of students including Katarinas class I was sitting at the back so all these people wouldnt be looking at me Katarina said And I watched everyone and people were crying and I felt sorry I knew that maybe the teachers would cry but I never expected that the kids would cry she added  Her mother was also at the screening and had an interpreter translate the film for her I cried I think everyone in the room cried I knew we made the right decision The school was really supportive They didnt have to do this you know Aranda said  After the documentary Katarina accompanied by two of her teachers answered questions from her peers She also explained to her class that the following week she would not be wearing her wig anymore It was very inspiring Aranda said The kids were really interested and they asked a lot of questions like Does it hurt and Was your scalp itchy  Many students were surprised by the film and admitted that they never suspected that Katarina wore a wig in the first place Some students even told Katarina that she looked even better without a wig  Aranda couldnt help but think of how brave Katarina was standing in front of her classmates and answering their questions She was just determined to do it She wanted to be herself and not cover up and mask who she was She was very courageous The following week Katarina came to school with a hat instead of a wig Its winter in Colorado Springs and she says her scalp gets cold without something covering it  Sandel says her students are reacting normally to Katarina without her wig I let my first period class ask her questions and they didnt Everyone seemed ready to move on she said Looking back at the screening Katarina is happy with her decision to tell her classmates that she has no hair I want people to like me for me and not what I look like Katarina said because thats how I can find my true friends
