Pinpointing complex behaviors in the brain isnt simple we werent born with the words impulsivity and willpower etched into particular places on our heads Scientists are still in the early stages of figuring out how billions of cells called neurons generate particular outcomes and which circuits do what But some clues have emerged from recent experiments  When people who are trying to lose weight are confronted with meal choices it appears there are two major factors in their decision taste and health said   assistant professor of neuroeconomics at the University of Zurich   shows that dieters who successfully turn down fatty temptations such as ice cream put more emphasis on the healthiness of food and relatively less emphasis on the taste  It is the opposite for dieters who cant say no to sweets he said They say theyre trying to eat healthy but they seem unable to shift away from the more automatic stronger representation of taste Hare said  By using functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI scientists can see how a brain region called the ventral medial prefrontal cortex becomes active in valuing options in predicaments like this The  ventral medial prefrontal cortex also appears to get involved in certain monetary decisions  for instance when researchers present participants with the choice of accepting a large reward later or a smaller reward immediately Hares research on this is not yet published but the phenomenon was described in a   Scientists have also located a second important brain area for these kinds of decisions the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex There is more activity in this region when participants choose options that appear better for them in the long run  the healthy food item or the larger monetary reward that will arrive later The interaction between these two brain regions  the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  is stronger for people who show greater self control with either money or food Hare said  Theyre working together to shape the way youre going to make your choices Scientists are also investigating brain areas associated with turning down temptations  University of Cambridge neuroscientist Molly Crockett and her colleagues suggested in a study earlier this year that precommitment  voluntarily restricting ones access to temptation  is more effective at promoting self control than willpower In the experiment men viewed erotic images that they rated according to personal preference Then in one task they could decide in advance that they would not have the option to see the images they rated poorly In exchange  they could see the higherrated images after a greater time delay This is called precommitment In a different task men were challenged to use willpower to actively resist viewing the lowerrated images while they waited for the higherrated images Precommitment appeared to be a better strategy on average In impulsive participants in particular researchers saw more activation in the ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex areas during precommitment These relationships between brain activation patterns and impulsive tendencies suggest that people in general may have some selfawareness about their own selfcontrol abilities Are self control problems such as overeating and overspending the result of poor willpower or impaired ability to precommit or both Further research on these issues could help the development of behavioral or pharmacological interventions according to the study  Currently we dont have drugs designed to target such brain impairments associated with lack of self control  But in theory a drug of the future could stimulate key brain areas to help people with selfcontrol problems diet or save money according to David Laibson professor of economics at Harvard University If that sounds too much like science fiction consider that many drugs are already on the market to alter brain function for the better  for example methylphenidate Ritalin for attention deficit disorder and antidepressants for depression  Outside the pharmacy there is a drug to combat exhaustion and enhance attention used by millions of Americans every day caffeine Laibson argued that if these substances are widely accepted why shouldnt there be options for people who want better control of their food decisions  The practical realities for a selfcontrol drug are complex however Hare cautioned that these brain areas would be hard to target with medicine because a lot of other brain areas would be hit at the same time No drug could selectively increase activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex alone for example  A different approach which has not been tried would be to use transcranial magnetic stimulation to temporarily enhance the activity of regions of the brain near the skull This technique  in which magnetic fields generate small electrical currents activating cells in a specified part of the brain  is being explored for depression patients who dont respond to medication  A   used transcranial magnetic stimulation to temporarily inhibit the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and showed that this led to participants making more impatient decisions  Theoretically this technology could be applied in the opposite way  to train relevant brain circuitry to come online during problematic food choices among dieters so that eventually the persons brain would respond naturally in this way Hare said  If theres enough success with this in conditions such as depression then I could see that that would be the logical next step Hare said  Scientists may also be able to develop behavioral interventions based on brain research  ie how to train and promote selfcontrol Psychologists for example may be able to derive behavioral therapies from the brain circuit differences that we see in people with different kinds of self control problems said Joshua Buckholtz assistant professor of psychology at Harvard University  Buckholtz has unpublished research suggesting that people with high BMIs and nonobese impulsive people have similar brain chemistry patterns  To recap Were bad at self control Scientists are looking at the brain to figure out how self control breaks down at the neurological level Such insights could directly lead to interventions in the form of pharmaceuticals or brain stimulation  In the meantime what can we do to help ourselves behave more in line with our good intentions even in the face of temptations  The more we recognize the commonality of this problem the more prepared well be to develop solutions to solve a problem because the solutions end up being the same across all the different domains Laibson said The basis of nonpharmaceutical solutions is the big Cword commitment To some extent most of us are already entrenched in a system of commitments that keep us in line Its called the workplace  Journalists publish articles cashiers scan groceries and teachers grade papers because of systems built into our society that commits them to perform certain tasks with the threat of punishment  or not getting paid  looming over their heads Laibson said Managerial structures ensure that employees at every level do what theyre supposed to be doing We built this system that is actually well tuned to who we are psychologically he said Were not relying completely on our willpower to do everything We are letting the system take care of us When it comes to money for instance many companies offer savings plans that automatically place a fixed percentage of your paycheck into a k account with strict penalties if you try to access that money before retirement Once you sign up you dont have to think about making the choice every week it just happens in the background We dont want people to tell us what to do so that we have no freedom but we do need a little bit of help so that we actually get to work and have a productive day instead of rolling in at  am Laibson said  Applying that method to food is a lot trickier Your boss can make you go to a  am meeting but you dont have a Food Manager who prods you to avoid potato chips and count calories at every single meal Even if your workplaces cafeteria has reasonably sized portions including small desserts no one will stop you from buying two or three cookies To encourage healthy habits in an already structured workplace companies could instead institute standing desks and hold standing or even walking meetings in which people move around while they discuss business instead of sit in a conference room These interventions should however be tested scientifically before being widely promoted Laibson said Government intervention is another way that self control could be imposed but a controversial one The city of New York   sold to  ounces each last year but an   that this was arbitrary and capricious In Laibsons view such a policy needs scientific evidence that it has positive health outcomes before being broadly enacted But you dont necessarily need a boss or government official threatening to punish you for breaking rules you already want to follow for the sake of your health You can set up a system in which you discipline yourself  Through the Internet you can wager your own money to commit yourself to your own diet and exercise aspirations A website called   allows you to put your own money on the line in support of whatever goal you may have if you dont fulfill it you lose the money As Yale economist Dean Karlan cofounder of StickK   Its a contract to make slothfulness more expensive  So think how much money your healthconscious self would offer your sweettooth self to keep the ice cream in the freezer or not buy it at all  Change can start today
