After months of focusing on how many people have or havent signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act we now have a rough total  million and everyones keen to get to the bigger questions How well is the law working How many of those who signed up have paid their premiums and are actually getting coverage How many were uninsured before they signed up And just how big has the drop been in the number of uninsured people Unfortunately the answers to some of these questions simply arent knowable  or at least not knowable yet Its very challenging says Linda Blumberg a senior fellow at the   People want answers right away and the best data sets we have obviously come out with a lag Thats partly because of the enormous size and complexity of the health system and the law But its also because the insurance industry is mostly private and regulated by the states The impacts that all of these changes are going to have on the marketplace are going to play out differently all across the country says Robert Zirkelbach spokesman for the trade group   Simply looking at national data doesnt tell you whats going to happen in a particular market in a particular state Still its worth taking a closer look at some of those questions First how many people have actually paid their premiums for insurance theyve chosen through the health exchange Thats the final and arguably most important part of the signup process Most insurers report numbers in the   You might assume the people not paying are deadbeats But thats hardly the case This is not at all surprising says Ken Jacobs who heads   The labor center just published a   of whos signing up for coverage in California The research predicts that fully half the people who enroll in a plan through the California health exchange wont keep it for a full year Thats always the case in the individual market Jacobs says Its transient We have people who are starting in the nongroup market and they get a job with jobbased coverage and they leave Jacobs says Or their income goes down and they end up going into Medicaid Meanwhile some others who have Medicaid experience a boost in income during the year and dont qualify anymore so they go into the exchange Jacobs says or they get a job with jobbased coverage and they leave the exchange In the case of the Affordable Care Act he says that transience was multiplied by lots of people who signed up in October and November and December  well before they had to pay their premiums By the time they needed to pay he says life had changed and they no longer needed that coverage Then theres the question of how the law is affecting people without insurance But Jacobs says that asking whether people signing up had insurance previously is actually the wrong question  because of that same churning that affects the payment of premiums People move in and out of insurance all the time he says and what the new marketplaces do is provide a place where people go rather than becoming uninsured during those times And so you may have people who had insurance  jobbased coverage  then lost their job and now theyre going into one of the marketplaces rather than becoming uninsured The real question then is whether the overall number of people without insurance goes down One presumes wed begin to get a handle on that when the Census Bureau puts out its   Except officials have decided to   they ask their health insurance questions for the   Thats the study that produces the annual uninsured number Those tweaks to the survey mean that going forward the uninsured numbers wont really be comparable to those of past years That has produced some significant upset in the research community It is a very unfortunate set of decisions in my opinion says Blumberg of the Urban Institute We have all used the Current Population Survey for trends for measuring insurance coverage  forever it seems like and were not going to be able to do that because of the question changes Meanwhile the Urban Institute Wednesday released a   using its own set of data The Institutes analysis suggests that the number of nonelderly adults without insurance fell by approximately  million people between late summer  and March of this year But that number doesnt include children who gained health insurance during the ACA enrollment nor does it include the surge of enrollments that occurred at the end of last month and early April Eventually researchers say the impact of the law will become more clear as more data become available But eventually is likely to be well after this years elections  and possibly after the presidential contest of
