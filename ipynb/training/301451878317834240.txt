 Many vitamin D supplements may not contain what their label says they do a new study warns Some pills may pack a lot more vitamin D than the label states and others may provide markedly less according to the findings published in a research letter Feb  in   The researchers are more concerned by pills delivering too little of the vitamin than pills providing too much It can be hard to overdose on vitamin D said study author Dr Erin LeBlanc an endocrinologist and researcher with the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research in Portland Ore However the findings may be a concern for those who have been told by their doctor to take vitamin D if their chosen supplement does not have the amount listed Vitamin D is known as the sunshine vitamin because it is produced in response to exposure to natural sunlight This nutrient is also added to   and other foods and is available in small amounts in fatty fish beef liver cheese and egg yolks Still it can be challenging to get as much D as needed through diet so supplements are often recommended Some researchers have linked vitamin D deficiency to the bone disease osteoporosis heart disease and some types of cancer Exactly how much vitamin D people need has been somewhat controversial in recent years The independent notforprofit Institute of Medicine recommends  international units IU a day for teens and adults or  IU for those older than  Some groups feel that this bar was set too low In the new study researchers analyzed  overthecounter bottles of   from  manufacturers They also tested vitamin D pills made at a compounding pharmacy which creates individualized drugs The manufacturers were unidentified Overall the amount of vitamin D found in the supplements ranged from  percent to  percent of what was listed on the label When LeBlanc and colleagues tested five pills from the same bottle the supplements had anywhere from  percent to  percent of the stated amounts When five pills were averaged however twothirds were within the stated range Although the vitamin supplement industry remains largely unregulated some manufacturers volunteer to have the quality of their supplements tested by the independent notforprofit US Pharmacopeial Convention USP which sets standards for supplements One of the study samples had USP verification Generally the pills that were from this manufacturer were more accurate LeBlanc said Supplements from compounding pharmacies were the least accurate LeBlanc said Duffy MacKay vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition in Washington DC a trade group representing supplement manufacturers and ingredient suppliers said that there is no excuse for supplements to deviate from their labels Still he said I am comforted that there are no safety concerns Dr Susan Zweig an endocrinologist and clinical assistant professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City expressed more concern It is hard to get toxic levels vitamin D but it is certainly possible Zweig said Vitamin D is stored in fat so it can build up unlike other vitamins that we pass when we urinate People with liver or kidney conditions may be at higher risk for vitamin D toxicity she said It is shocking how variable   is from brand to brand and pill to pill she added Zweigs advice If there is any question about whether you need more vitamin D or if you are on the right dose see your doctor and have your blood levels checked MacKay said the study shows there is value in thirdparty certification Bigger and more wellknown brands dont use third parties because their seal is their brand and dont want a gotcha test MacKay said Go with the seal or a brand you can trust Dr Mary Hardy of the Collaborative Centers for Integrative Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles said that other types of supplements have fared much worse in similar tests She recommends looking for a USPverified vitamin D product If you are doing well and have achieved a good level of vitamin D do not change brands arbitrarily she added  Copyright     All rights reserved
