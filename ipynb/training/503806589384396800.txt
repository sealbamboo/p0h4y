When researchers at the University of California San Diego wanted to   an experimental Alzheimers drug last year they sought help from an unlikely group people with Down syndrome I had a CAT scan on my head and I was in a special machine Its called an MRI says Justin McCowan  whose parents drove him  miles from Santa Monica so he could participate in the study McCowan also took brain function tests and spent hours with a needle in his arm so researchers could monitor levels of certain chemicals in his blood Alzheimers researchers are increasingly interested in people like McCowan because people with Down syndrome represent the worlds largest population of individuals predisposed to getting Alzheimers disease says   director of the Memory Disorders Clinic at UCSD Down syndrome is a genetic disorder thats best known for causing intellectual disability But it also causes Alzheimers By the age of   percent of all individuals with Down syndrome have the pathology of Alzheimers in their brain Rafii says Down syndrome is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome  And one of the genes on chromosome  happens to control the production of   the substance that forms the sticky plaques associated with Alzheimers Because their bodies produce extra amyloid most people with Down syndrome develop problems with thinking and memory by the time they reach  Rafii has chronicled the decline of one of his patients a woman named Irma by collecting her signatures from medical forms over the years The first one is from  when Irma was in her mids You can see her signature is on the line its clear she wrote it in script Rafii says By  though she has switched to large block letters By  Irma is misspelling her name By  there are only a few characters written that resemble letters Rafii says And in the very last year its completely blank People like Irma used to be rare because the medical problems associated with Down syndrome meant they rarely lived long enough to get dementia Today though better medical treatments mean people with the disorder often live into their s And that has created a huge opportunity for Alzheimers research says   chairman of the neuroscience department at UCSD This is the one group in the world that you could argue would benefit most by the institution of early therapy he says Early therapy means starting people on drug treatment years before the symptoms of Alzheimers appear The approach has been hard to test because in the general population theres no good way to know who is going to develop Alzheimers But for people with Down syndrome its a near certainty Finding a drug that prevents Alzheimers in people with Down syndrome could help millions of people who dont have the disorder Mobley says This approach to treating Alzheimers disease might apply to all of us he says Imagine someday a drug that we all start taking when were  so we never get Alzheimers disease Thats a longterm goal But already people with Down syndrome are making a difference in Alzheimers research Early work with Down patients helped confirm the importance of amyloid More recently people with the disorder helped test an eye exam that may offer a simple way to screen for Alzheimers And then theres the study that Justin McCowan signed up for It involves a drug from Transition Therapeutics   that in mice can prevent the brain changes associated with Alzheimers Scientists hope the drug can do the same thing in people including those with Down syndrome McCowan says he volunteered for the study because he wants to help other people especially a friend of his named Maria who also has Down syndrome I feel very sad about Maria because she doesnt remember anything McCowan says His parents Don and Annamarie McCowan say their sons memory is still sharp They hope that what scientists are learning from people like Justin will keep it that way
