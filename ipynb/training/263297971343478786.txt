You can barely listen to former Massachusetts Gov Mitt Romney make a speech or give an interview without hearing some variation of this vow On Day  of my administration Ill direct the secretary of Health and Human Services to grant a waiver from Obamacare to all  states And then Ill go about getting it repealed he told   in September  But there are two big questions there First of all could a President Romney actually stop the health law in its tracks And if he did try what would happen First it turns out that stopping the law may be harder than the laws opponents realize For one thing if hes elected Romney cant just grant waivers letting states ignore the law on his first day as president There are waivers under the law but not an acrosstheboard waiver said Tom Miller a lawyer with the conservative   For the record Miller is an   But hes also a veteran of Capitol Hill and knows what can and cant happen You can try anything under the law he said But in many cases a federal court will usually step in and say Youve gone a little bit too far  In this case the part of the law that allows the president to grant states waivers doesnt actually kick in until  And even the   require states to cover as many uninsured people as would be covered by the Affordable Care Act Health industry consultant Robert Laszewski  also   of the law  says federal courts would likely block a lot of things Romney might try to do unilaterally like simply cut off funding or tell his staff to stop enforcing it Sure he can rewrite the regulations for example  but fundamentally he cant change the law he said And even rewriting regulations would take months at best That brings us to the repeal part of Romneys promise If Republicans gain control of Congress they plan to use a fasttrack procedure called   to repeal major chunks of the measure Budget reconciliation cant be filibustered and needs only  Senate votes rather than the usual  But there are a couple of problems with that says Laszewski One is that its more timeconsuming than many people realize Budget reconciliation rules require them to have a budget resolution and require them to be able to vote out the changes and that timetable will take him to at least midyear he said Indeed since  Congress has passed   The one that moved fastest got signed into law May   A few took more than a year to become law Meanwhile the health law will still be in effect and the clock will still be counting down So even as Congress may be working to undo the law he says states will still face deadlines to put important features in place Every state legislatures got a decision to make about whether they build an insurance exchange or not Laszewski said Everyone has sort of treaded water until the election  then were go or no go If Romneys elected its like  we dont know whats going to go or not And its just going to be one hell of a mess Theres still another complication It turns out that not all of the law can be undone using the budget process Things like requiring insurers to accept people with preexisting health conditions would almost certainly need the same  votes to undo it as they needed to pass it in the first place Laszewski says that could cause problems of its own So now we could be sitting here with reconciliation having stripped out all the money on Jan  every sick person in America is showing up getting their guaranteedissue health insurance and its just going to ravage the insurance pools drive the cost of insurance way high he said That he says is a recipe for total chaos Were playing with gasoline here he said This is onesixth of the economy  sitting on the ledge here wanting to know which way were going to go Tom Miller of the AEI agrees that key parts of the health care sector have been doing a lot of waiting around for the election  and that given the short timelines chaos is likely next year no matter who wins If you implement it in its entirety youll also cause chaos in the market  would be my rejoinder he said Were going to have chaos in either case But the law has already put a lot of changes in place So taking it apart particularly given the potential legal and legislative difficulties will be no easy task
