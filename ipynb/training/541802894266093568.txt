SAN FRANCISCO—Most companies developing cancer drugs want to kill out-of-control tumor cells. Agios Pharmaceuticals Inc. wants to repair them.. The Cambridge, Mass.-based drug company’s lead drug, called AG-221, targets a genetic mutation that prevents certain white blood cells from maturing into normal-functioning, infection-fighting cells. The anomaly leads to anemia and development of acute myeloid leukemia and other similar blood cancers.
