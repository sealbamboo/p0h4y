The NHS budget is under the microscope like never before The coalition may have protected it but that has not stopped problems mounting  Earlier this week a host of medical organisations wrote a   warning the NHS was creaking at the seams The Nuffield Trust thinktank has now published what is probably the most indepth look at finances in recent times  is that health care leaders fear the NHS may stop being free at the point of use within a decade But the report reveals much more than that Much of the focus is on the deficits being run up by hospitals That is understandable  they are the public face of the health service  But the accounts of the bodies that control the overall bnplus health budget  NHS England and the GPled clinical commissioning group  are more revealing They finished  just over m in surplus but that was only because they took nearly m from their reserves There is now less than m stashed away The room for manoeuvre is getting tight Following the public inquiry into the Stafford Hospital scandal a popular saying has developed among hospital bosses it is better to be hung for finances than the quality of care The Nuffield Trust reports shows they have been as good as their word Last year saw a rise in the number of staff employed by hospitals by   a  increase in total Foundation trusts  the top performing organisations  spent an extra bn alone  m more than planned Next year will see the NHS come to the end of a fiveyear bn productivity drive The challenge was for the health service to make efficiency savings of about  a year  This is something it had never achieved before but the health service rose to the challenge Initially at least  In the first couple of years it was on target  largely because of wage freezes  but  could be the year it started to unravel Managers reported productivity gains of bn  about half of what they should have  The answer to the rise in longterm conditions such as diabetes and heart disease which account for  of the NHS budget is to shift care out of hospital and into the community The theory is that this is more efficient and more likely to help people keep well and independent But there appears to be little progress Both emergency admissions and outpatient appointments are up and hospital spending still accounts for over half the NHS budget It is clear from wading through the NHS accounts over the past few years that when it comes to hospitals there are the haves and the have nots The largest trusts  often the big city hospitals  remain in the healthiest position financially Take  for example the  biggest trusts posted a surplus of nearly m but that was cancelled out by the smaller and mediumsized trusts It raises question marks over the future of a whole network of district general hospitals that seem to be struggling to attract enough patients to remain viable
