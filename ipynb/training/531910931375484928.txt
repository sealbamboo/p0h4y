Jane M Carlton a geneticist and director of New York Universitys Center for Genomics and Systems Biology hovers near as her graduate students snap on latex gloves and draw samples from Mr Keefes grimy ladle Each vial of sewage that they collect is teeming with microscopic life and saturated with dangerous viruses and essential bacteria  exactly what Dr Carlton is looking for By analyzing wastewater samples from each of the five boroughs Dr Carlton hopes to uncover trends in infectious disease  to detect flu viruses before the next outbreak for instance and keep tabs on antibioticresistant bacteria But her ultimate goal is far more ambitious Dr Carlton wants to sequence the microbiome of New York City More than  billion gallons of wastewater courses through  miles of the   every day The city combines residential and commercial sewage with animal waste and groundwater runoff so even a single sample of sludge can speak volumes about the local environment We want to take an environmental sample like sewage and extract all of the DNA from all of the microbes in that sample Dr Carlton said If her team could sample sewage from every neighborhood in the metro area Dr Carlton reasoned the resulting genetic map would highlight the citys microbial diversity across different districts Once public health officials knew what normal bacteria and viruses to expect in each sector of the city she hopes they will be better able to identify dangerous outliers  a new strain of the flu for instance or an outbreak of foodborne illness Its a preventative public health question Dr Carlton said We need to know the baseline to know how the baseline changes over time Dr Carlton started off by tackling smaller pilot experiments Last April her team presented the results of the Dirty Money Project which involved sequencing all of the DNA found on a wad of dollar bills Dr Carlton had assumed whatever bacteria she found would be dead Instead she found that thousands of bacteria  most of them harmless  thrive on paper money In a separate study the Microbikeome Project Dr Carlton and her team examined the microbial life on public bicycles in Manhattan and London in an effort to see how bacteria migrate about a city Both efforts Dr Carlton said helped her team develop laboratory standards and refine sequencing techniques But she and other scientists believe the wealth of information hidden in sewage is far greater Eric Alm a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology envisions a future in which policy makers and health care providers alike monitor sewage for realtime information about the state of public health a sort of realtime epidemiology Dr Alm recently received a grant to develop a smart sewage device that will analyze public refuse and relay broad public health data back to experts and officials The socalled Underworld platform will scour sewage for the biomarkers of health and disease and even detect trace chemicals used in bomb manufacturing We are interested in genomics but were also looking for different chemicals that might not be within the DNA he said If city officials were to start a public health campaign to reduce intake of sugary drinks the device might track the presence of sugar in sewage to help policy makers determine whether the campaign was having an effect 
 This whole field has enormous potential Dr Alm said Its hard to imagine that in  years every city wont be monitoring sewage as an information platform While Dr Carlton awaited approval for access to public sewage which she received in midSeptember she found creative ways to get her hands on New York City sewage Green apartment complexes occasionally maintain their own sewage systems and the Visionaire along with its sister building the Solaire agreed to accommodate the NYU researchers With wastewater obtained from private apartment complexes Dr Carltons students are already beginning to conduct genomics research Julia Maritz a doctoral student in Dr Carltons lab is focused on developing the best methods for extracting DNA from sewage samples In the coming months she will be studying how diseases move among humans and animals by tracking small changes in the genetic makeup of sewageborne parasites Susan Joseph a postdoctoral researcher will be keeping tabs on antibioticresistant bacteria such as MRSA and Clostridium difficile in the sewage system As studies continue to show that most of the bacteria in our bodies are healthy and even necessary Dr Carlton hopes that her work will not only improve public health but also educate the public about the good bacteria that surround us People need to understand that knowing about the microbes in our environment is a positive thing she said People shouldnt be afraid to find out whats out there
