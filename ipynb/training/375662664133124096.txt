When Jim Crabtree learned last May that his   who then committed suicide he felt not horror but relief  Crabtree had been struggling to take care of his yearold wife Rita who was diagnosed with Alzheimers disease six years earlier His parents were able to watch after her each day while he was at work But his mother  was forced to use to a wheelchair with severe joint pain and arthritis and his yearold dad had begun to develop dementia  My father shot my mother and then he shot my wife and then he shot himself Crabtree told NBCs Maria Shriver It sounds like a horrible violent end but in actuality it was an euthanasia that my father did It was a great gift that my father was able to give me He ended my Alzheimers and elder care issues at once Like many Alzheimers caregivers Crabtree felt stretched to the breaking point  Its the kind of stretch you get living your life on a treadmill he said Just when you think you got things in order something else comes up and you have to run a little bit farther and a little bit faster but you never get ahead Youre just scrambling around trying to figure out how youre going to solve all these problems Although rare there are other murdersuicide cases involving caregivers and their charges Its a sign of how stressful the job is said Linda Ercoli director of geriatric psychology at the Semel Institute at the University of California Los Angeles Its like having a second job that is  on top of whatever else youre dealing with in life she told NBCNewscom  Even his job as an emergency room nurse didnt prepare yearold Jim Crabtree for the overwhelming triple burden of caring for a wife with Alzheimers a father descending into dementia and a mother with crippling arthritis  Those burdens are so great they can shave years off the life of caregivers experts say In fact one study showed that compared to others caregiver spouses aged  to  had a  percent higher mortality rate Ercoli said Unlike many other types of things Alzheimers comes with an uncontrollability that really extracts a price said Dr Richard Schulz a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center And there is a vigilance component from having to be on guard all the time That in and of itself can be very stressful Add to that the length of time caregivers are on the job  on average eight years but sometimes as long as   and youve got years of chronic stress Ercoli said  Making matters worse the demands of caregiving often result in social isolation as caregivers disconnect from other family and friends because they feel they have no time to keep up these relationships Schulz said  Under that heavy burden a caregivers emotional state can bounce from helplessness to exhaustion to anger And that anger can be directed toward the patient if the caregiver doesnt understand the disease well enough to realize that some of the annoying behaviors are simply symptoms of illness  The high levels of anger and frustration often felt by caregivers is one reason Ercoli suggests all guns be removed and sharp objects be locked up Violence isnt uncommon in homes where an Alzheimers patient is being cared for the geriatric psychologist said Studies have found that while about  percent of caregivers are sometimes violent with their charges nearly  percent of patients are sometimes violent with their caregivers  Thats not the only risk caregivers face Along with a higher death rate they also are at increased risk of immune system problems and cancer  And then theres the evermounting stress which many caregivers dont recognize since theyre so caught up in the daytoday survival You can go to the Alzheimers Association website and actually   to find out how many signs of caregiver stress you have Ercoli said It can be very eye opening While many derive satisfaction caring for a loved one in the early stages of the disease that satisfaction can dwindle as Alzheimers progresses robbing patients of their personalities Schulz said People talk about the loss of self he explained The person you used to know disappears and for many people that is a really distressing aspect They dont recognize the person any more That rings true for Crabtree who said Rita at the end was an empty vessel one he nevertheless had to care for Until his father ended her life  and his own  Crabtree said other caregivers have empathized with his situation  and the relief he felt  Theyll come up to me  quietly and say Jim Im really sorry but you know Im kind of envious  You got out easy You didnt have to go the last mile he said Reactions like this are more understandable when you consider the strain on caregivers mental health Some  percent to  percent suffer from depression Ercoli said And in others the stress boosts anxiety Treatment for anxiety and depression can ease a caregivers distress but often people dont feel comfortable asking for help People kind of just take it Ercoli said They dont even share with their doctors Experts say caregivers need to reach out to others for support  whether its help in caring for the patient or just with house cleaning and shopping for groceries But even with help caregiving is the toughest job most people will ever have  People dont say I survived Alzheimers Crabtree said We are the survivors I survived caregiving
