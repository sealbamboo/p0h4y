Even as Dr Donald Berwick runs for governor of Massachusetts hes got a firm foothold in his former life as an expert on health quality Berwick most recently known as the acting chief of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid was the founder and longtime CEO of the nonprofit   And it was more in the role of health care troubleshooter that British Prime Minister David Cameron asked Berwick for his recommendations for restoring confidence in the English health system after higherthanexpected death rates at one hospital rocked the country The result Berwicks   early this month explaining his call for continuous learning without blame as the fastest route to improve quality within the National Health Service Berwick spoke by phone to a group of reporters about his work in the UK the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and his candidacy in Massachusetts Here are edited highlights from the call Well  this report is not part of the campaign I had agreed to do it prior to the announcement But this is about large system change I mean here you have a system with  million employees Thats the size of the NHS spending  billion pounds approx  billion So its a very relevant experience I obviously was dealing with very senior leaders in a politicized environment which of course as governor I would be doing constantly and helping build consensus Well first the critique in Washington always felt to me more or less hogwash It was more demagogic than informed I   his work goes back to the mids he was knighted in  with the NHS Im proud to have done that its a good system with flaws They brought me there because of their flaws and what they wanted is to continually improve It is not the case that you can take a system from one country or from one state let alone the country and just import it to another one so that was pretty much fabricated the idea that somehow I had a plot with the NHS Im proud of that work I think Massachusetts is a state that has a history of learning and growth and development and one of the ways you do that is by reaching out and learning what others are doing We dont have a   of that exact type here in Massachusetts A It was pro bono I got no fee for this at all I felt it was an honor to be able to do it and this is a very valued system in that country and I was happy to be asked Indeed the whole committee worked pro bono thats very important to know It really is true that I do not have an inside wire to information from CMS or for that matter the White House In many cases you know more than I do But my feelings right now two things First is the Affordable Care Act has already done very important things for millions and millions of Americans People have prevention coverage they never wouldve had without this bill people can get access to prescription drugs they couldnt have had insurance companies are under more and proper surveillance kids no longer have a preexisting condition threat when getting insurance and as of next year thatll be true for anyone that wants insurance Massachusetts itself has gotten millions of dollars for prevention funds for maternal and child care for people to get access to better care If the Republicans or anyone tried to take this law away I think thered be a sudden outpouring of rage as people realized what they were losing what theyve already gotten For the future its a complex endeavor were taking a  trillion system that serves the entire nation and trying to turn it into something that is universal that is higher quality that is more accountable that is oriented toward outcomes not volume Thats a big deal and of course therell be adjustments As I watch  as an outsider now  the president make decisions about changes in timing the delay of the employer mandates for example I dont  of course therell be adjustments theyre making decisions about how to help a very complicated thing get done well I cant second guess that I think this story is going to play out over time as a very important positive move for the country and that the people who are trying to take the law away are not going to meet a happy public I agree I think there was for reasons that are not clear to me something that was missed in terms of explaining to the public and helping the average person in the public understand how good this thing is how much benefit this is going to bring to our nation to our neighbors to each individual Why I dont know The story is a very important story When I was able to get out and about when I traveled the country as CMS administrator to town hall meetings and meetings with providers or beneficiaries it took five minutes to bring them around and help them see what they were really getting because of this law Its a very very good piece of legislation despite the inevitable changes and tweaks that are going to be needed over time I think some opportunity was missed Ive seen in the efforts of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius over the past year and the outreach now to get people enrolled a really great story in terms of helping people understand whats possible But if we could go back to square one I think a different better messaging effort wouldve taken off
