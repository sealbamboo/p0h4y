The World Health Organization says it has set up an emergency committee of experts to keep an eye on the new MERS virus thats killed  people most of them in Saudi Arabia Theres no evidence the virus has started to cause a pandemic  a global outbreak of disease And a study published on Friday shows that by one measure the virus isnt infectious enough to cause one  yet But WHO and other health experts say the virus is very worrying We want to make sure we can move as quickly as possible if we need to said Dr Keiji Fukuda WHOs top flu expert If in the future we do see some kind of explosion or if there is some big outbreak or we think the situation has really changed we will already have a group of emergency committee experts who are already up to speed so we dont have to go through a steep learning curve Fukuda told a news conference MERS short for Middle East respiratory syndrome broke out just over a year ago in Saudi Arabia WHO has official confirmation of  cases and  deaths  a rate that shows the virus is extremely deadly One of the latest deaths  a Qatari man who had been in a London hospital since September A single patient can infect many others MERS is a relative of the severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS virus that spread globally from China in  killed  people and infected close to  before it was stopped  SARS spread in what are known as clusters in which certain people seemed to be far more infectious than others These superspreaders infected groups of health care workers or others they came into contact with Theres some evidence MERS  sometimes too although not always And any virus is just an airplane ride away from anywhere else in the world SARS spread slowly within China for weeks or months before travelers carried it globally In one notorious instance an infected traveler became sick and threw up in a Hong Kong hotel He infected seven other people who eventually carried the virus to Canada Vietnam Singapore and elsewhere in Hong Kong MERS has been reported in Jordan Qatar Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates UAE France Germany Italy Tunisia and Britain MERS has not been seen in the United States although a handful of travelers have been tested for the virus according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention One reason experts are especially worried about MERS is that it has  Also Saudi Arabia will host the annual Hajj with its influx of millions of observant Muslims from all over the world in October But theres some reassuring news A French team has calculated the infectiousness of MERS and found its not yet as transmissible as measles smallpox or even flu in a bad year Arnaud Fontanet of the Pasteur Institute in Paris and colleagues looked at a measure called R which reflects how many other people an infected person might transmit a disease to When R is above  epidemic potential has been reached Fontanets team writes in the Lancet medical journal With our most pessimistic scenario we estimated MERSCoV MERS coronavirus R to be  by contrast the R for prepandemic SARSCoV SARS coronavirus was  they added Our analysis suggests that MERSCoV does not yet have pandemic potential To compare R for measles and whooping cough is  or higher in unvaccinated groups for polio its between  and  and for HIV its between  and  Researchers found after SARS was over that it had repeatedly passed from animals to people in China mutating in the process until it took on a form that more easily infected people and that more easily passed from person to person The same sequence of events might be occurring with MERSCoV which has been repeatedly introduced into the human population for more than a year from an unknown animal host and might have human pandemic potential Fontanets team wrote SARS was eventually traced to bats and an animal called a civet a delicacy in China Scientists suspect MERS also comes from an animal but they havent been able to find the source yet
