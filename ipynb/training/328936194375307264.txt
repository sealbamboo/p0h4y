The Southeastern United States has a rate of stroke higher than that of the rest of the country but it is only partly explained by known risk factors like high blood pressure and obesity Now researchers have found a risk factor independent of the others living in the Southeast as a teenager  investigators studied a group of  people average age  for almost six years recording their medical histories and time spent living in the Southeast sometimes called the Stroke Belt  As they controlled for more and more known risk factors including age sex race blood pressure socioeconomic level smoking and diabetes the association of stroke with living in the Southeast began to weaken But one association remained statistically significant Living in the region between ages  and  increased the risk for stroke by  percent We dont know what it is about the Stroke Belt said the lead author Virginia J Howard a professor of epidemiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham It could be factors we havent been able to examine sufficiently We need to do more research
