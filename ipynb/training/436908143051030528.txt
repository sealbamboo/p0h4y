The way that prescription drugs are advertised on TV could be better especially when it comes to communicating the risks and side effects of medicines Now the Food and Drug Administration is   into how the ads could be improved The problem as Michael Wolf a health services researcher and cognitive scientist at Northwestern Universitys Feinberg School of Medicine describes it is that most ads work like this At the end of the ad Wolf says you get a laundry list of possible side effects and warnings associated with use delivered at a rapidfire pace That ratatat recitation of side effects has become a joke says Dr Steven Woloshin a professor of medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice He points to   sketches one of which features   Among the long list of side effects that rolls out at the end the ad says Do not take Annuale if you plan to ever become pregnant as it may turn your baby into a firemonster  In the days around your period you may develop a leathery tail This week the FDA   to consider shortening the major statement  thats the long list of risks In an email to Shots an FDA spokeswoman points out that that part is often too long or may not include adequate risk information or leave out important information One proposal is to list only risks the FDA calls serious and actionable in TV ads and then to point out in a generic way that there are other risks too The FDA is looking for public comments on the study and researchers will finalize the study design afterward The FDA has been considering this issue for years along with academics and drugmakers says Northwesterns Wolf He says the current proposal  cutting back on the information and referring people to more sources  is the way forward Part of his research focuses on making prescription drug labels easier to understand and he says the challenge is similar Its almost the exact same thing we do to pill bottles We try to cram as much as we can in a very small amount of space and expect people to get everything says Wolf who is also a member of the   When you do that you end up losing everything He points to   that found among other things that the order of information affects whether people remember it or not From a list of five instructions on a prescription drug bottle people tend to remember what they read first and everything that comes after is less and less memorable Wolf says this just gets harder if something is read very quickly as is the case with drug ads on TV so a shorter list makes sense in theory You can imagine  now instead of having to talk about eight things in  seconds I can talk about two or three then you can slow down your speech rate he says Speaking slowly can increase comprehension But some doctors say there are broader problems with drug ads that the FDAs research proposal wouldnt address The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America   that prescription drug advertising is meant to get accurate information about diseases and treatment options directly to patients Yet it doesnt work that well says David Grande who coauthored   for and against direct marketing of prescription drugs to consumers Direct consumer advertising is really good at one thing and thats increasing the sale of drugs says Grande an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania He points out sometimes that can be good for undertreated conditions but advertising can also lead to overtreatment For example   found that doctors are more likely to prescribe antidepressants if patients ask for them Grande says the ads need to do a better job of presenting risks People need to really see some objective numbers about how valuable these drugs are and what kind of benefit they might have he says Right now benefits tend to be described in very emotional terms and that can make people overestimate how beneficial the drug can be for them Its good that the FDA is studying a better way of advertising drugs but its not enough to make a difference says Dr Lisa Schwartz a professor of medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice She says many advertisements feature new drugs and theres often some uncertainty about how a drug will actually work even if it has FDA approval For instance she   about two weightloss drugs that the FDA approved in  Her article notes that although the drugs come with warnings about depression and heart disease neither drug is actually marketed in Europe because of safety concerns She says warning is very different from saying the FDA was worried about the effects enough to require further study of the drugs risks after they hit the market FDA has encouraged doctors   and marketing Schwartz says thats not enough By the time there are any complaints about an ad its already run its course and it seems like we dont have a very good monitoring system for this information she says It relates to this general problem of a reactive rather than a proactive situation around direct consumer advertising
