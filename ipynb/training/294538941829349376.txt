 States with strong laws about what foods can be sold at school outside breakfast and lunch programs appear to have more students who stay at healthier weights new research suggests These laws known as competitive food laws regulate the foods that can be sold at schools outside the school meal programs in an attempt to reduce childhood obesity The laws cover food from vending machines for instance and those sold a la carte in the cafeteria or in fundraising projects for school teams or organizations Few studies have gauged how successful the laws are so Dr Daniel Taber a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Illinois at Chicago decided to evaluate their effects He found that they do work Competitive food laws in schools reduce weight gain if they are strong and consistent Taber said Students exposed to strong laws gained less than those not and they were less likely to remain overweight or obese over time compared to students in states with no such laws The study is published online Aug  and in the September print issue of   Childhood obesity has tripled over the past three decades according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In   percent of children aged  to  were obese The study looked at data from  states Of those  had competitive food laws that were consistently strong or became stronger over the time period studied from  to  Taber and colleagues classified the laws as strong if they required schools to sell only foods that met specific   standards The laws were weak if they recommended but did not require sales of healthy foods or if they used general language such as healthy foods without issuing guidelines for what qualified as healthy The investigators obtained health and weight data on  students in  states They compared the body mass index or BMI a measure of weight relative to height of students in fifth grade and then again in eighth grade Students who went to a school with strong laws in fifth grade gained on average  fewer BMI units over the three years than students in schools with no such laws It is difficult to translate that to pounds Taber said Roughly it would be  fewer pounds for a foottall child who started out at  pounds in  That was just an average so many students gained less and some gained more he noted Children who went to schools with strong laws throughout the study period gained an average of  fewer BMI units compared to those who did not That would be about  fewer pounds for the same foottall pound child The number of state laws regulating these foods has increased in recent years A federal standard passed in  prevents schools from selling candy and gum for instance in the   The US Department of Agriculture is in the process of updating this standard to coincide with the provisions of the  Dietary Guidelines but has not issued it yet The study results show that competitive food rules are incredibly important said Dr Marlene Schwartz deputy director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University We have found that kids eat less junk food when there is less   in schools she said However this is the first big national study that looked at the laws Tabers team does not claim causeandeffect Schwartz noted but they do show the importance of state laws The study took into account many factors linked with obesity such as income and race she added Some food industry groups have lobbied against such laws she pointed out saying   The study Schwartz said suggests otherwise Other groups such as the American Beverage Association have launched programs such as their voluntary effort to reduce calories in beverages shipped to schools Parents who live in states without strong laws have options Schwartz said School districts involved in the school food program must have a committee that writes school wellness policy Parents can ask to be on that committee Talk to your school administrators about your concerns Taber suggested Parents involved in fundraising for school teams or other projects can also suggest healthier alternatives than candy he said
