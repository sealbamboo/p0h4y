Since the Supreme Court made the   under the federal health law optional last year states decisions   along party lines States run by Democrats have been opting in states run by Republicans have mostly been saying no or holding back But now Arkansas  at the suggestion of the federal government  has suggested a   Enroll those newly eligible for Medicaid in the same private insurance plans available to individuals and small businesses And some think that could shake things up A lot The Arkansas proposal was crafted as much out of political necessity as from substantive desire says Andy Allison the states Medicaid director I think this is likely to be the only way that expansion or coverage for this population could occur he says There are two reasons for that One is that the state has a Democratic governor Mike Beebe now serving his second term but a heavily Republican Legislature that has   on expanding Medicaid A second reason is that few adults currently qualify for Medicaid in Arkansas Those who do have to be really poor says Allison We cover just at  percent of the poverty level for those who are parents and we dont cover childless adults unless they have a disability For the record  percent of poverty is less than  a year Expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to  percent of poverty  about   could potentially add as many as  Arkansans to the rolls But what was a political nonstarter gained new life when someone suggested the idea of enrolling those new people in the same private plans individuals and small businesses will be purchasing  the   called exchanges So far the state has gotten a   from the US Department of Health and Human Services That has caught the attention of several other Republicanrun states that had been holding out on the Medicaid expansion including Ohio Florida and even Texas But experts insist that the proposal is hardly as new as some have suggested The authority to use Medicaid funds to buy insurance has been in the law since it was first enacted said   a law professor and Medicaid expert at the George Washington University Still when the Arkansas arrangement first went public about a month ago there was some immediate handwringing about its potential cost We have to  recognize that it will cost more said   a Boston University health economist You dont get something for nothing But Frakt concedes that paying somewhat more  how much more remains a subject of contention  might not be all bad One of the basic critiques of the Medicaid program is they pay providers too little and thats why too few of them participate he said So putting people in private plans with higher provider payments could help address those access problems Meanwhile Medicaid watchers say proposals like the one in Arkansas could solve other problems  for the new Medicaid recipients and for the others who will be buying coverage in the new exchanges One potential problem the private plans could address is called   It happens when a persons income is near the threshold between qualifying for Medicaid and qualifying for   Imagine says Rosenbaum someone working  hours a week in the summer whose hours are cut back so they qualify for Medicaid part of the year then expanded pushing them back out of the program And you get a letter saying Now youre earning more money so now you have to leave your plan You and your kids have to leave your doctors you have to pick a new plan And then in winter if your hours drop back down you get another letter saying Oh sorry you have to leave your plan and your doctors  she says Those people could be forced to change plans multiple times a year Rosenbaum says enrolling Medicaid beneficiaries in plans in the exchange instead could protect as many as  million people a year from churning if their income does get too high Your plan will stay your plan your doctors will stay your doctors she said Basically the bank of Medicaid and the bank of the exchange will have a conversation with each other about who pays the bills And your premium may be a little bit different and your copays may be a little bit different but your health care wont be interrupted And its not just those on Medicaid who could benefit Many of the new Medicaid enrollees will be relatively healthy relatively young people with relatively low insurance costs They could help bring premiums down for those in the exchanges who are older and sicker Its the woman whos  working at WalMart with a couple of kids who we really need in the exchange Rosenbaum says And so if we buy her in and keep her in its going to be that much better off for the yearold woman who is sick and unable to work and needs coverage through the exchange because of a lot of health conditions Still one of the fundamental appeals of putting new Medicaid enrollees in private plans remains political I think in states where the resistance to the Medicaid expansion was based primarily on This is a biggovernment program that we cant make any bigger finding a way to do the expansion through private coverage will open a door to a conversation that was otherwise not taking place said Alan Weil of the  What remains a key issue for many states however is that the federal government hasnt yet said exactly how much states can spend on the private plans  only that what they spend to enroll Medicaid beneficiaries in the plans should be comparable to what they would have spent otherwise Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius says officials will spell out more details on that issue in the very near future
