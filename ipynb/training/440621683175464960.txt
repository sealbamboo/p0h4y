Young women are often the targets of aggression when theyre out in bars but the problem isnt that guys are too drunk to know better Instead men are preying on women who have had too much to drink When researchers at the University of Toronto and the University of Washington observed young peoples behavior in bars they found that the mans aggressiveness didnt match his level of intoxication There was no relationship Instead men targeted women who were intoxicated The researchers hired and trained  young adults to go into bars in the Toronto area and note every incident of aggression they saw They found that  percent of all incidents involved sexual aggression And  percent of the victims of sexual aggression were women being harassed by men Almost all of the aggression was physical with about twothirds of the aggressors physically touching women without consent About  percent threatened contact And  percent verbally harassed their targets Men may perceive intoxicated women either as more amenable to advances or as easier targets who are less able to rebuff them because they dont have their wits about them the researchers say Theres no reason that women should be touched against their will says   the studys lead researcher and a senior scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health at the University of Toronto Women wouldnt accept that kind of behavior at school or on the street she notes but it seems to get a pass in bars she tells Shots The study was   online Monday in   The researchers also wanted to look into whether unwanted sexual advances were intentional or just a matter of misperception This study points to the former Graham says If you walk through a bar and grab a womans breasts and then disappear into the crowd thats probably not a misunderstanding she says You dont actually think that she wants you to do that The fact that men were more likely to take advantage of intoxicated women shows that most of these incidents arent wellintentioned Graham says And the bar staff rarely stepped in to stop the sexual aggression There should be training for staff on how to intervene Graham says If a bar wants to have female patrons they ought to make it more female friendly Efforts have been launched in   and   to do just that They provide bar staff with free training on how to respond when they see sexual harassment The observers rated peoples level of intoxication based on the number of drinks they consumed and their behavior Observers worked in pairs with one man and one woman to reduce potential bias Since the observations were made in public places in or around bars the study doesnt tell us much about sexual assault or rape that might occur out of public view or after women leave a bar But the takeaway Graham says is that people should stop believing that Robin Thicke song The lines really arent that blurred
