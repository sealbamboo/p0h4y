Growing old is not for sissies I hear this often and have said it myself Among the many challenges of aging is knowing when to seek help and how to accept it graciously Most often the source of help is an adult child or children who may not be in a position to satisfy all the physical and emotional needs of an aging parent or parents Advanced old age can create a role reversal children who once required a nurturing parent must now nurture their parents Recognizing that the demands of modern life have eroded the timehonored commitments to care for aging parents China recently put in effect a law called Protection of the Rights and Interests of Elderly People It requires   and to visit them often or face fines or possible jail time In some former Soviet bloc countries aging parents can sue children for failing to provide needed financial support Interestingly there are   mostly unenforced relics of a bygone era But with or without a law moral obligations to assist ones aging parents are commonly felt They can leave adult children feeling overburdened and neglectful of their own families personal needs and goals Indeed The New York Times for several years has devoted a blog entirely to this subject   If the older parent is overly demanding hypercritical or unappreciative his child may become angry resentful depressed even abusive to the parent If the aging adult was neglectful abusive emotionally distant or selfabsorbed as a parent   when physical financial or emotional support is needed Adult children without siblings to help share the burden of parental care because they are only children or because their siblings are unwilling or unable to help can become especially resentful Intensifying the challenges is the fact that people are living ever longer often for decades with one or more chronic ailments including   And many older people exact promises from their children that they will be kept at home indefinitely and never placed in a nursing home even when home care becomes physically or financially overwhelming But an entirely different scenario can emerge if all parties involved respect the needs of others and if the parental recipients of help show appreciation rather than acting as if it was their due My maternal grandmother was widowed when I was an infant and then lived with my family until   claimed her life  years later My parents both worked long hours and having Grandma around to help even in a limited way and be there when my brother and I came home from school was a definite asset But such living arrangements have increasingly become a thing of the past Maud Purcell a psychotherapist and executive director of the Life Solution Center of Darien in Connecticut offers a laundry list of emotions that adult children are likely to experience when parents age and their health declines Among them  Fear when you realize that the roles have reversed and that you may now have to care for your parents  Grief as a oncerobust parents ability to function independently declines abruptly or little by little  Anger frustration and impatience when a parents needs interfere with your life  Guilt in response to the above feelings or because you are unable to spend enough time with your parent because of distance or other life demands Ms Purcell suggests that you accept these feelings as normal and not fight them Rather recognize that you cannot change what your parents are going through beyond   She wrote Dont take on more than you can handle Consider your commitments to your work and to other family members Overextending yourself will leave you stressed and will put a strain on your other relationships Worst of all you may end up taking your frustration out on your parent causing you intense guilt Ken Druck a clinical psychologist based in San Diego and author of The Real Rules of Life Balancing Lifes Terms With Your Own urges adult children to act out of love not guilt or resentment and to live and give within your limits To avoid burn out make an honest assessment of what you can and cannot do then lovingly communicate your limits to your parent Clear expectations prevent unnecessary stress misunderstanding disappointment hurt and fear of abandonment Dr Druck said in an email It often helps to try to put yourself in your aging parents position and think about what you might want and need under similar circumstances Also helpful is to sit down and have a hearttoheart talk with your parent about expectations deciding which you are able to meet and which might require outside assistance Experts do warn however against promising never to place a parent in a nursing home which may be the only reasonable and affordable source of care for someone in an advanced state of decline And it is unreasonable to expect those who had a neglected or abusive childhood and were never close to their parents to suddenly act like loving caring children when parents become old and infirm
