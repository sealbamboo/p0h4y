Older people who have relied on a class of drugs called benzodiazepines to reduce anxiety or induce sleep are at higher risk of going on to develop Alzheimers disease new research finds with those whose use of the medications is most intensive almost twice as likely to develop the mindrobbing disorder Benzodiazepines  marketed under such names as as Xanax Valium Ativan and Klonopin  are widely used to treat insomnia agitation and anxiety all of which can be early signs of impending Alzheimers disease in the elderly But the current study sought to disentangle benzodiazepines use in treating early dementia symptoms probing instead the possibility that heavy use of the medications may permit cause or hasten the onset of Alzheimers dementia The study compared the pattern of benzodiazepine use in  elderly people diagnosed with Alzheimers with that of  similar people who had no such diagnosis Such a study design conducted by French and Canadian researchers and published Tuesday in the journal BMJ cannot by itself establish that more intensive use of the medications causes Alzheimers disease But it does strengthen such suspicions Among the study participants over  who were living independently in the Canadian province of Quebec those who took lowdose benzodiazepine medication or who took higher doses but very briefly or infrequently did not see their Alzheimers risk go up five years after they were first prescribed such a medication But the picture was more worrisome for those who frequently took longacting benzodiazepines who frequently took high doses or who took any such drugs regularly over several months The benzodiazepines specifically considered by the researchers were the shortacting antianxiety medications alprazolam Xanax lorazepam Ativan oxazepam Seresta and diazepam Valium and the longeracting antiseizure and hypnotic drugs frequently used to treat insomnia clonazepam Klonopin flurazepam Dalmane midazolam Versed nitrazepam Mogadon temazepam Restoril and triazolam Halcion The widely prescribed prescribed medicines marketed as Ambien Lunesta and Sonata generically named zolpidem eszopiclone and zaleplon are atypical benzodiazepines and were not included in the analysis The authors of the study created an index that gauged the intensity of a participants benzodiazepine use and found that at the end of a fiveyear period following an initial prescription Alzheimers risk mounted steadily Those who took the cumulative equivalent of daily doses for three to six months over a fiveyear period were roughly  more likely than those who took none to develop Alzheimers Those who took the cumulative equivalent of a full daily dose for more than six months were  more likely to do so Theres already strong research evidence that frequent or regular benzodiazepine use degrades memory and mental performance in humans and animals And some research suggests that with regular use of this class of drugs the receptors to which they bind in the brain become less active And lower activity of those receptors has been linked to cognitive decline In view of the evidence it is now crucial to encourage physicians to carefully balance the risks and benefits when initiating or renewing a treatment with benzodiazepines and related products in older patients the authors wrote International medical guidelines recommend the use of benzodiazepines as treatment for anxiety disorders and transcient insomnia but caution that they are not meant for longterm use and should not be taken steadily for more than three months But many patients continue to take these drugs for years In addition to their cognitive effects benzodiazepines are widely implicated in the national epidemic of opioid pain medication overdoses and fatalities that result from mixing them with alcohol and opioid drugs
