 High levels of socalled bad or lowdensity lipoprotein LDL cholesterol  which so many of us are trying to control with statin pharmaceuticals  are enabled by a component of fat tissue Canadian researchers have discovered A substance secreted by fat tissue called resistin increases the bad cholesterol or LDL in our liver cells The liver is less able to clear bad cholesterol from the body Resistin speeds up LDL accumulating in our arteries increasing the risk of heart disease To make matters worse resistin adversely impacts the effects of statins the main cholesterolreducing drug used in the treatment and   A staggering  per cent of people taking statins are resistant to their impact on lowering   researchers say The bigger implication of our results is that high blood resistin levels may be the cause of the inability of statins to lower patients LDL cholesterol said Shirya Rashid MD senior author of the study and assistant professor in the department of medicine at McMaster University in Ontario Canada Dr Rashid said the discovery could lead to revolutionary new therapeutic drugs especially those that target and inhibit resistin and thereby increase the effectiveness of statins The possibilities for improved therapy for the causes of cardiovascular disease are very important said Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada spokesperson Beth Abramson MD About  percent of Canadians have   Its a significant health concern in Canada Its also a significant health concern in the United States Dr Abramson noted that the research reconfirms the importance of maintaining a healthy weight and cholesterol level two critical factors in the prevention of heart disease High blood cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke It can lead to a buildup of plaque in the artery walls and narrowing of the arteries causing a condition called   which can make it more difficult for blood to flow through the heart and body Being overweight also increases the likelihood of high blood pressure and diabetes compounding the risks of heart disease and stroke The study was presented Sunday at the Canadian Cardiovascular Congress in Toronto
