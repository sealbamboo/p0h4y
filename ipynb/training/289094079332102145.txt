If youve spent years CRANKING YOUR MUSIC UP TO  this items for you A drug developed for Alzheimers disease can partially reverse hearing loss caused by exposure to extremely loud sounds an international team   in the journal   Before you go back to rocking the house with your Van Halen collection though consider that the drug has only been tried in mice so far And it has never been approved for human use Even so the result is real and a step in the right direction says   a researcher at the University of Washington who wasnt involved in the study and has spent decades studying ways to restore hearing Loud noises cause hearing loss by injuring or killing hair cells cells in the inner ear that transform sounds into electrical signals that are sent to the brain The unusual thing about these hair cells is that what youre born with is what you have throughout life says Harvards   who is also a researcher at Massachusetts Eye and Ear and one of the studys authors Thats why deafness tends to be permanent Hair cells can be lost to diseases after taking certain medications or as a part of normal aging And hearing specialists are seeing a new group of relatively young people who have lost hair cells Edge says Whats important in our society right now are a lot of the soldiers coming back from overseas who have been exposed to even a single loud noise which can seriously damage hearing he says Tens of thousands of veterans have   because they were in a firefight or near a bomb blast that produced a sound many times louder than even the loudest rock concert Because permanent hearing loss is so common in people scientists have been studying species in which deafness is only temporary Fish for example can grow new hair cells to replace damaged ones And in the s researchers showed that that birds  warmblooded creatures that are more like us  had the same ability You can in fact deafen a chick for example and over the course of a couple of weeks they completely recover their hearing and the hair cells grow back Edge says That finding got scientists looking for a way to accomplish the same feat in mammals which dont naturally regrow hair cells The study in  suggests theyve partially succeeded Edge says Edges team took a bunch of mice and exposed one ear to a very loud noise Then they looked to see whether the ear was still producing electrical signals in response to a sound There wasnt Their ear is essentially dead Edge says Next the team administered an experimental drug known as a gamma secretase inhibitor to the inner ear Gamma secretase inhibitors were developed to treat Alzheimers disease but havent worked out for that purpose The drugs never made it to the market for humans  or mice  so you cant go ask your doctor for a presciption These drugs have an interesting side effect though Edge says In mice they can cause socalled support cells from the inner ear to transform into hair cells And to our delight these hair cells were functioning hair cells that improved the hearing of the animal he says Edge says this shows it IS possible to grow new hair cells in a mammal And because mice and humans have very similar hearing systems he says the approach is likely to work in people too Its not a complete cure though The mice got only about  percent of their hearing back and still couldnt hear certain sound frequencies Edge says Gamma secretase inhibitors are just one approach to restoring hearing says Rubel one of the scientists who discovered that birds could regenerate hair cells Other approaches being tried include gene therapy he says Im hugely optimistic Rubel says Theres no question that sometime in the future we will restore hearing in humans through regeneration It may take a couple more decades though Rubel says
