When we first met   he was living in Lakeport Calif a struggling massage therapist in a struggling town on the southern tip of Clear Lake Stevens had been uninsured his entire adult life and used to believe firmly that clean living and exercise could stave off any need for medical care But after a bicycle accident that injured his shoulder and a battle with advanced thyroid cancer Stevens was anxious last fall to enroll in some form of insurance  any kind of insurance  under the Affordable Care Act I talked to an insurance guy who is selling Obamacare and found out I dont qualify Stevens said when we first talked to him last November What Im going to get is    Californias Medicaid program The insurance broker had warned about long wait times But when Stevens called the tollfree line for   the states insurance marketplace I waited four minutes he says It was a piece of cake The operator didnt offer to help him apply for MediCal but instead told Stevens to call his countys   It wasnt a onestop shop Stevens says When he finally called the county office on Jan  he was worried he might own too much stuff to qualify  that his two aging cars and the modest home he had bought long ago from his mother would count against him Thats a common concern some rules about property and MediCal qualification  under the Affordable Care Act Sure enough the forms that arrived in the mail asked for details about his bank account and any cars he owned So I called them back up and said You dont need half of this stuff that youre requesting They said Yes youre right Thats an old form We havent switched over  On Jan  Stevens collected his records and made the halfhour drive down to the county social services office They were really efficient at the office Stevens says sounding surprised He says of the county worker She was like Boom Boom Boom Shes been doing this  years I was just signing stuff The county worker told him to expect the MediCal enrollment process to take  days When we next talked on Feb  Stevens was anxious to get his insurance card He needed to refill his thyroid medication  he has no thyroid and relies on medication to keep his body functioning His pharmacist told him the company that makes his pills had raised the price from  to  Im down to  pills right now so Im counting them daily he told us If I havent gotten my MediCal number before Im out of pills Im going to call WalMart to find out what their price is There were other concerns if his MediCal didnt kick in soon To monitor his thyroid condition Stevens has to get his blood drawn every year In the years following his thyroid cancer he could get the blood work done for  to  he always paid cash but now that same service was costing him  Its gone astronomical he told us With only a few thyroid pills left  and still no MediCal confirmation  Stevens went to WalMart and was able to get his prescription filled for  in cash Its a different brand than hes used to and he says it makes him more irritable and restless at night The medication I get at WalMart isnt as good as the medication I get here at the pharmacy in Lakeport he says The brand stocked at his local pharmacy while now much more expensive keeps me really level  I find that with the stuff from the pharmacy at WalMart I do more fluctuations  moods and more nights with night sweats More heart palpitations At the beginning of March a Lake County case worker called Stevens to tell him his MediCal was active Basically it took two months from start to finish Stevens says Now that Im covered I want a physical and a regular checkup that normal people who have insurance get And I want to get a colonoscopy Stevens says laughing at his own enthusiasm for the unpleasant procedure Its been a few years since Stevens has seen a specialist about his thyroid The last specialist at the University of California San Francisco charged him  for an hourlong visit It was super expensive Stevens says And I ran out of money Now that hes enrolled in MediCal Stevens plans to call his primary care doctor soon to make an appointment and search for a specialist in his rural region Even though the card still hasnt arrived he says being accepted into MediCal is an extraordinary relief Its an incredible peace of mind Stevens says Im going Yeehaw
