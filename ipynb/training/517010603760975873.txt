Last November, when the ACA rollout crisis was at a boil and on the front pages virtually every day, .  found that 37% of the American people were following the story “very closely” and 28% “fairly closely,” making the ACA the most closely followed news story that month. November was the high point–or, depending on your perspective, the low point–for the ACA as a news story last year in terms of public attention compared with other issues.. But this year the ACA has dropped as a news story in people’s minds.
