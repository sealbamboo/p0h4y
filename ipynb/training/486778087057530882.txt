Ask somebody about stress and youre likely to hear an outpouring about all the bad things that cause it  and the bad things that result But if you ask a biologist youll hear that stress can be good In fact its essential For example the adrenal glands of all animals have evolved to pump out   in unexpected situations  the hormones spur action and increase fuel to the brain helping the animal react to danger appropriately Those hormones also flow to memory centers in the brain to help the critter remember those notable moments and places If it turns out to be dangerous and if the animal actually turns out to survive danger then it will be aware of this as a potentially dangerous place explains   head of the neuroendocrinology laboratory at The Rockefeller University In that sense stress is good People also experience this good kind of stress Its your bodys reaction as you get pumped up to speak in public for example or compete in an athletic event We do something that takes a little bit of a risk and has a good outcome we feel exhilarated  thats good stress McEwen says Of course thats not what most people were thinking of when pollsters called them earlier this year NPR conducted  that focused on stress in America with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health Those   talked mostly about the downside of stress  the sort that comes from tension at work or family friction The biological mechanisms that help us in the short run it turns out arent so useful when the stress grinds on for weeks or months McEwen who wrote   says often people find ways to tolerate that stress But it can also be overwhelming and then we have something thats been called toxic stress he says The stress system gone awry can literally make you sick When stress is sustained or repeating or extreme then all the usual systems gets disrupted says   codirector of the Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute at the University of Michigan And eventually you do it long enough and it starts impacting other systems  immune responses it can affect the heart it affects brain cells It depends how long were talking about In our poll many Americans responding said that to cope with excessive stress they end up eating more or sleeping more Yet others said they end up sleeping less and eating less Sometimes these reactions can help reduce stress research shows  but other times not  a professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and   of   has been thinking about the source of all this stress I think a lot of people imagine that our modern lifestyle  with constantly chirping cellphones and email and all these demands  has led to more stress Linden says And the truth is it really doesnt seem to be that way Think how stressful it must have been for our forebears who lived in constant worry that their children would die of   still a constant   in some parts of the world Its not like stress is mounting up in our modern age  its just that the flavor of it is changing Linden says And that flavor isnt changing as much as you might think Our poll finds that over the past year the major causes of stress in Americans are still those ageold troubles illness disease and the death of a loved one Now  percent of the people we polled said they didnt feel stressed at all But that doesnt mean a few people have found a secret Eden right here on Earth Huda Akil says some people are simply more tolerant of stress than others She sees this clearly in her   Some animals like risky situations actually go seek them and other animals cower away from them Akil says And its clearly genetic We can breed for it And it shows up very very early in life And it is in humans what we define often as temperament That temperament is shaped by both biology and our experiences as young children It can have a lifelong impact on how we perceive stress and cope with it The good news is this mix of psychology and biochemistry is malleable A lot of stress can be very disruptive Akil says But a little bit of stress is kind of like working your muscles your emotional muscles And you build them up and you learn how to cope So this is not something thats irretrievably wired to be bad or good It can be retuned and finetuned and its never too late Stress is at root a mechanism for adapting to changing circumstances So when a challenging situation inevitably appears the trick is to get the stress reaction to work to your advantage
