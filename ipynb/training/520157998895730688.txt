A few weeks ago scientists issued a   about the Ebola epidemic in West Africa If nothing changes the world could have tens of thousands of cases in the coming months So how can we tell if things have started to change  if international aid is starting to work One way is to follow a chart   every few days by the World Health Organization It shows the number of new cases detected in West Africa And on Wednesday the chart showed something we hadnt seen in months a decline in cases reported in Liberia Starting at the end of September the line goes down by about  cases each week Could this mean the situation is improving in Liberia You look at that and it looks great Its encouraging says Columbia Universitys   who uses computer models to forecast the epidemics future Maybe theres a slowing which would be a very very good thing And Shaman says his   also show a similar trend For about five or six weeks now the epidemic in Liberia has been growing more slowly than his models predicted But Shaman is cautious I wouldnt be jumping for joy though OK Shaman says And the reason is that there are delays in the reporting and not all the cases are actually found In fact the big dip in cases could actually be a bad sign Shaman says It could mean more people might be hiding sick family members or not getting help for them because theyre afraid For instance treatment centers in Monrovia have started reporting they have some empty beds which is surprising Usually they have to turn away patients Those empty beds could be a good sign  it could mean there are fewer cases But it might mean instead that people are staying away from treatment centers Health officials have been tricked before by what looks like a big drop in cases Earlier in the outbreak reported cases plummeted to zero in Guinea for almost a month And health officials thought the outbreak might be over They started relaxing The key issue that made us fail in the early stages of this outbreak and why we didnt stop this back in March is we thought we were on top of this says WHOs Ian Norton who is in charge of getting   to West Africa But this time theres reason to be a bit more optimistic Some help has arrived in Liberia More sick people in Monrovia now have a place to go for treatment Norton says That means they have a better chance of surviving and also are less likely to spread the virus to family and friends We just opened the first of the new WHObuilt facilities in Monrovia he says And were about to in two weeks or so open an additional  beds in two sites The local contractors who have been working with us there have been working three backtoback shifts a day so theyre working  per day on sites Norton adds Its incredible The international effort is about  percent along the way of building all the new treatment centers across Liberia he says And simply building the clinics isnt enough  a massive number of people still need to be trained to work in them When you do the math Norton says we quickly get up into the  to  staff needed in Liberia alone So theres still a long way to go to get this epidemic under control But at least at this moment he says theres a bit of hope
