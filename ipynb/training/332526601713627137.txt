People with incurable cancer do sometimes receive good news as I have Why is it harder for me to share good news than bad news During treatment good news produces elating highs but also anxious lows   When I entered a clinical trial for a new cancer drug the consent form stated that the medication would not provide a cure and could kill me The pills effects on my ovarian cancer were to be measured by the CA blood test in which numbers above  indicate disease growth  I started the trial last August with a CA over  As the number fell in the autumn to  in the winter to  and in the spring to  my morale rose  tempered by occasional dips and drops   My family and friends are ecstatic So is my oncologist who wrote in an email You do not even know how exciting it is to see the results of this new drug I do a lot of clinical studies and I see so many negative results some of which are fatal We do all that work to get one rare patient who gets benefit  very rewarding to see it happening to my friend  The last two words of this message touched me to the quick After four years Dr Matei had entered my heart and apparently I hers A great joy to make a new friend at my age and in my situation especially a friend so admired  Yet I worry that I will fail her A number that descended in the past nine months can ascend in the next nine months Overwhelming odds are it eventually will Might sharing good news jinx it  turn it in the blink of an eye into bad news  I know from the nurse administrator of the trial that the experimental drug is not benefiting women with breast cancer My good news makes me distressed about their bad news Also I had overheard conversations in the hospital waiting room about other ovarian cancer patients dropping out because of deleterious side effects some of which I experience  Weak from months of dosing I cannot stand on my feet to cook for more than  minutes at a time At the supermarket I ogle readymade meals Changing the sheets on the bed requires timeouts Filling the bird feeder hauling it out bringing it back in at night so the squirrels cant raid it takes too much fortitude Bones ache that I did not know I had My hair has thinned so drastically that Joanne at the salon clipped it close to the scalp all the while lambasting combovers  Diminishing the cancer seems to involve depleting me Still I have kept my resolve steady by focusing on the satisfaction of contributing if only in a minuscule way to medical research I had also kept myself on an even keel by hunkering down for the worst  Now with the best possible results I am a neophyte who does not want to be an ingrate My trepidation at the lowering cancer marker reminds me of the angst recounted by many patients at the end of a round of successful chemotherapy The gift of time starts to feel like a present spoiled by uncertainty about the future With cancer you cant win for losing  Yet today I would rather be a cheerful Tigger than a gloomy Eeyore So to buoy myself I decide to use the chicken stock defrosting in the fridge its fat congealed on the top to make matzo ball soup for my visiting daughter and soninlaw  After I toss most of the fat saving a tablespoon I start whipping up the egg whites But one of the rotary beaters of the electric mixer refuses to stay in its socket it keeps falling out no matter how I swivel it I am here to testify that the gizmo works with only one beater That too feels revitalizing even though my low numbers and high spirits may have started to change on the day you read these words   Tonight there will be homemade soup Tomorrow Ill put out the bird feeder and leave it out despite the squirrels  To comfort you and yours here is my recipe for the Worlds Lightest Matzo Balls which evolved over the years from Jennie Grossingers cookbook The Art of Jewish Cooking While cooking they rise to the top  quarts stock
