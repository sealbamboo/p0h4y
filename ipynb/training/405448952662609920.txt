Hartmanns genetic code showed two mutations that are linked to   he says the site told him Some people with limbgirdle muscular dystrophy lose the ability to walk and suffer from serious disability his results page read   he thought  Genetic testing can be a powerful tool It can offer information about your family history tell you how your body might respond to different drugs and identify your risk factors for disease It can also be misleading  The Food and Drug Administration on Monday   of its  home genetic testing kits saying the Googlebacked company has not proven the validity of its product  The FDA warned that customers who received inaccurate results could suffer from undue mental anguish or undergo unnecessary medical procedures The government agency has asked andMe to   to comply with federal regulations The action triggered outrage among some of andMes supporters So GMOs aspartame artificial flavors  colors pink slime  no problem a poster named Laura Ann wrote on the companys Facebook page But in no way should we be allowed the right to know our own genetic material as a means for making better decisions about our health In a statement andMe said it has received the FDAs letter and will be working to address the agencys concerns  There are more than  billion letters in our genetic code Though its been  years since the   scientists still dont understand what every gene does and what a mutation might mean for someones health Its one of the issues opponents to home genetic testing kits raise most often If DNA experts dont understand  what a gene mutation means how can we expect consumers to  Scientists have identified more than  single gene disorders says Rebecca Nagy president of the   These are disorders that can be diagnosed based on the mutation of a single gene in the body some examples include Huntingtons disease or cystic fibrosis  But conditions such as Type  diabetes or Alzheimers are more complex Hundreds of genes may contribute to the development of these diseases Nagy says and a persons risk is also influenced by his or her environment Testing for markers of risk scattered across someones genome is really only testing for the tip of the iceberg  Thats where it gets a little scary because if a person has a normal test result on andMe they leave thinking they dont have a risk she says Its not that the science behind this kind of genetic testing isnt good Its that the science behind them isnt complete The upside of these athome genetic testing kits  and andMe isnt the only company that sells them  is that theyve generated a lot of buzz about genetics Nagy says She says she believes most early adopters of the tests are informationsavvy and understand the results arent set in stone  I dont think that anyone thinks that this kit replaces formal testing by a doctor Heather Armstrong posted on andMes Facebook page I seriously doubt that a doctor would agree to perform say a double mastectomy based on these results Joseph Stolarski posted If you find something interesting you then take it to a medical professional for further evaluation No one is or should rely on it for medical diagnosis Its just a tool like personally checking your heart rate with a watch or checking your weight on a scale But Nagy says she worries about what will happen when the tests become more mainstream  Giving this kind of information to someone unfamiliar with genetic testings limitations could prove dangerous   Nagy recommends anyone who wants to do genetic testing first talk to a genetic counselor Counselors have specialized graduate degrees and extensive knowledge of the human genome Theyre also trained in explaining test results to laymen  Our message is to be a smart consumer Nagy says Know what youre doing so that when you get the results back you can really use them to your best benefit Hartmann did some intense investigating saying he looked at the raw data andMe provided him He eventually found he did indeed have two mutations he says but they werent on the same gene He says he submitted his bug report to the company and it apologized  In general Hartmann thinks its a good thing for every person to have affordable access to his or her genetic data But hes browsed the community forums on andMecom and has seen how seriously some people take their results  without fully understanding them  Hartmann says he now believes he will not get limbgirdle muscular dystrophy although he says there is a risk he could pass the genetic mutations onto his kids I can live with that he wrote For quite some time I hope
