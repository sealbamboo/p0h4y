Whenever I see a woman walking or trying to in stilettos  skinny heels over  inches high  my first thought is Theres a sprained ankle waiting to happen An estimated  ankle injuries occur daily in the United States most of them through sporting activities including jogging on uneven surfaces But while no one suggests remaining sedentary to protect your ankles experts wisely warn against purposely putting them at risk by wearing hazardous shoes or getting back in the game before an injured ankle has healed If youve ever thought Oh its just a sprain read on The latest information about ankle   released in a   last month by the   clearly shows that ankle injuries should never be taken lightly and are too often mistreated or not treated at all The result is an ankle prone to prolonged discomfort reinjury chronic disability and early   Ankle injuries are the most common mishap among sports participants accounting for nearly half of all athletic injuries According to the report by the trainers association the highest incidence occurs in field hockey followed by volleyball football basketball cheerleading ice hockey lacrosse soccer rugby track and field gymnastics and softball I was surprised that tennis did not make the list since any sport that involves quick changes in direction leaves ankles especially vulnerable to unnatural twists Other reasons for ankle injury among athletes include landing awkwardly from jumps stepping on another athletes foot trauma to the ankle when the heel lands during running and stressing the foot when it is in a fixed position Perhaps the most interesting finding in the new report is the fact that the most widely accepted treatment for an ankle sprain  rest ice compression and elevation popularly called RICE  has yet to be shown to be effective in controlled clinical trials Theres not a whole lot of good evidence out there to support it Thomas W Kaminski lead author of the new report said with a hint of irony in his voice However neither he nor his coauthors suggest that this timehonored remedy be abandoned What should be abandoned is the temptation to try to walk off the searing pain of a twisted ankle In fact in years past thats often what athletes were advised to do But trying to walk on an injured ankle is precisely the wrong approach the athletic trainers now say Also wrong I was surprised to learn is to immediately reach for a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug NSAID like ibuprofen or naproxen to relieve pain and prevent swelling Rather its best to start with acetaminophen to control the pain said Dr Kaminski athletic trainer at the University of Delaware He explained Its best to wait  hours before taking an NSAID because you want the normal inflammatory process to kick in and begin the healing process Then you take the NSAID to keep the swelling from getting worse Dont take an NSAID on an empty stomach and dont exceed the dosing directions For both people who are physically active and those who are sedentary the only consistent risk factor for an ankle injury is having suffered a prior sprain This fact alone underscores the importance of giving ankle injuries the respect and treatment they deserve Most important Dr Kaminski said is to have the injury properly diagnosed to determine its extent and in turn dictate the proper therapy This doesnt necessarily mean you must race off to the emergency room and get an   for every twisted ankle But coaches trainers both athletic and personal and doctors should know how to do a proper exam checking for deformity swelling discoloration point tenderness and the ankles range of motion  the foots ability to move in all its normal positions Although Xrays are typically ordered for  percent to  percent of patients who go to the emergency room with a foot or ankle injury an Xray is not warranted unless there is an obvious deformity   or an inability to bear weight or walk four steps immediately after the injury the NATA report says Xrays do not show damage to soft tissues like ligaments and tendons the ones most often injured in an ankle sprain Nor is an   especially helpful both imaging tests mainly add many dollars to the cost of diagnosing and treating an ankle injury What should you do Immediately after injuring an ankle begin RICE described in the report as universally accepted as best practice by athletic trainers and other health care professionals That means get off the injured foot prop it up if possible higher than the heart wrap it in a compression bandage and apply cold There are various ways to ice an injured ankle ice packs immersion in ice water application of frozen cups of ice or frozen bags of peas chemical cold packs and cold sprays Apply cold for  to  minutes at a time then remove it for  minutes and reapply When using an ice pack or chemical cold pack cover the skin first with a wet cloth to avoid tissue damage Icing can also be used to reduce discomfort before doing exercises prescribed to strengthen an injured ankle No longer are prolonged periods of rest recommended The emphasis now is on functional rehabilitation  getting patients moving as soon as possible doing walking exercises and enhancing joint mobility Dr Kaminski said Most important of all and often the most neglected is balance training which starts with standing on one foot the injured one on a firm even surface then on a foam surface or trampoline first with eyes open then eyes closed The idea is to force the ankle to move under more unstable conditions as youd find on a sidewalk lawn or the beach Dr Kaminski said Also helpful is strengthening the structures that support ankle stability and flexibility Older folks take note ankle problems are a common risk factor for falls among the elderly and the stronger the muscles in the lower leg the more support they provide for the ankles An inexpensive way to boost ankle strength is to wrap a resistance band or towel under the ball of the foot and holding the ends of the band or towel tightly move the foot in every direction up down to the right and to the left  times Plan to do this   three times a day And of course unless youre a runway model stay out of those high heels
