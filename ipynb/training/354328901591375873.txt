Public health efforts to reduce the number of children and teenagers killed by guns got a big boost in visibility after the tragic killing of children at Sandy Hook Elementary School last fall Each week about  children and teens are   in the United States with homicide the second leading cause of death among teenagers here behind car crashes Gun possession is common among young people who have been injured in an assault a study finds Onequarter of teenagers and young adults surveyed in the emergency room of a hospital in Flint Mich said they had a firearm at home or carried it in public The No  reason they had a gun was to protect themselves or feel safer the youths said The researchers surveyed  teenagers and young adults ages  to  in  and  The youths who said they had a gun were as likely to be white as AfricanAmerican and were about  years old on average Theres definitely a feeling among people that they need some kind of selfprotection says Susan MorrelSamuels managing director of the   at the University of Michigan School of Public Health Often that means a firearm She works with violence prevention in Flint but wasnt involved in the study But the prevalence of guns means confrontations like the ones that landed these young people in the hospital can escalate with deadly results Often the ultimate victims are not parties to the confrontation but bystanders Whats surprising is how easy it is for young people to get a gun which they get from friends and family says   a professor of pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine He wrote an editorial accompanying the study This is emblematic of the kind of work we need to do to understand the origins of lethal violence and ways to reduce it The best way to reduce gun deaths and injuries in children and teens is to reduce access according to a   from the American Academy of Pediatrics That includes keeping guns in the home unloaded and locked up the pediatricians say Girls and young women accounted for almost onethird of the gun owners a statistic that MorrelSamuels says doesnt surprise her Theres been a lot of emphasis among manufacturers of firearms to market to young women she says Its become increasingly acceptable for women to carry guns as a means of selfprotection Her organization is working with children and teenagers in Flint with a focus on preventing the kind of violence that resulted in a yearold boy being   with the murders of his brother and the brothers girlfriend there last month In the same week a yearold girl there was charged with attempting to kill her older sister The fact that the youths in this study thought it was OK to hurt someone if they hurt you and the fact that they were more likely to drink or use drugs than people who didnt own guns makes it more likely that someone would be injured or killed with a firearm the study authors say Their   were reported online in the journal   Addressing youths feeling that they need to be armed to be safe and that its OK to retaliate with violence is something that should be addressed in order to reduce the risk of injury and death in the community the authors say
