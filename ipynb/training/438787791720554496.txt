Everybodys supposed to get screened for colon cancer starting at age  but many of us havent gotten around to it Thats especially true in the Latino community where about half of people are up to date on screening compared to  percent of nonLatino whites The numbers get even worse for people who dont have health insurance with just  percent getting screened So researchers decided to see if something as simple as mailing free home coloncancer test kits to patients of clinics that serve lowincome residents in Portland Ore would help get more people   Short story it did A bit more than onethird of the  people who got the kits in the mail used them and mailed them back Thats  percent higher than in clinic patients who didnt get the test kits mailed to hem at home Of the  patients who were tested seven had a positive test result indicating traces of blood in the stool Those patients were referred for   and all but one patient went in for the procedure About half of the participants were Hispanic and most had household incomes below the federal poverty line This sounds like a total win the mailin tests are cheap running  to  per test compared to more than  for a colonoscopy The test called a   or FIT is   and it doesnt require people to change their diet or quit taking medications as earlier fecal tests did But   the lead author of the study and a senior investigator at the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research says that because the FIT test should be done every year costs can add up for clinics that serve large numbers of uninsured people Some just bill for the clinic visit Coronado told Shots Unless they change that structure it might be hard to sustain But clinics are getting clever about this Coronado says trying things like processing the tests themselves which is cheaper than sending them to a lab or getting patients signed up for insurance Another issue is making sure that people have access to colonoscopy if they get a positive FIT test Coronado says The colonoscopies provided in this study were donated by the doctors But for now theyre moving forward Coronado and her team have gotten money from the National Institutes of Health to expand the project to  federally funded health centers in Oregon and California starting in February
