What makes it different from other MRSA antibiotics is the way it was approved This is the first drug   as a   QIDP is part of a program that the administration hopes will encourage drug companies to develop new drugs like Dalvance that will fight the epidemic of antibioticresistant infections Any drug designated QIDP by the FDA gets a priority review and expedited review process  If approved the drug also then qualifies for an additional five years of marketing exclusivity    Antibioticresistant infections are considered such a threat in a report released earlier this year the  said that these infections could derail the very achievements of modern medicine  The report characterizes the problem as so bad that a postantibiotic era is far from being an apocalyptic fantasy  The WHO report says if health trends continue a time when typical antibiotics dont work on run of the mill kinds of infections is a very real possibility for the st Century Antibioticresistant bacteria infect   according to the CDC Of those at least  die as a direct result of the infection and many more die as a result of conditions complicated by that infection mostly in hospital and health care settings The number of health care spread MRSA cases is declining according to the     But on any given day  in  hospital patients has at least one     Most happen to patients who are not in intensive care units  That means you could go into the hospital for a knee surgery and end up leaving with a serious infection that normal antibiotics dont treat  Experts say MRSA became a real problem for the health care system as doctors spent decades overprescribing antibiotics Patients who came in for treatments for colds and flus were given antibiotics even though such infections dont typically respond to medication Over time the bacteria that did survive these treatments reproduced and infections that were resistant to antibiotics became wider spread   Outbreaks of MRSA called communityassociated MRSA have happened at schools   and in gyms and are typically spread by skintoskin contact   Staph infections typically start with small red bumps which can turn into painful abscesses that often require surgical draining   The latest tool to fight MRSA Dalvance was approved after two clinical trials that included  adults with this kind of infection The adults were given Dalvance or another antibacterial drug  Dalvance was as effective as that drug for the treatment of this infection   The most common side effects for people on the drug during the trail were nausea  headache  and diarrhea
