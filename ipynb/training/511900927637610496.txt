Rodney Zimmers was  years old and  pounds when he got off heroin and cocaine for good Three years later he was still drug free but had ballooned to  He blames his weight gain on the highcalorie highsugar food served in rehabilitation  Once I got sober I continued to eat all this awful stuff said Mr Zimmers now  and the founder of Blueprints for Recovery an allmale treatment facility near Prescott Ariz I learned how to be sober but I didnt learn how to take care of all of me I didnt know how to cook or grocery shop because Id never done it I didnt learn any life skills or how to live like an adult His story is familiar to those in recovery who often   on their road to wellbeing Its not all their fault most rehabilitation programs havent devoted much thought to nutrition  The main focus was just get them off their substance and the rest will take care of itself said Dr Carolyn Coker Ross an eating disorder and addiction medicine specialist in Denver who has been a consultant to various rehab centers  While fruits vegetables and a variety of proteins were served in rehab so were refined sugars sodas energy drinks sugary juices and sugaryfattysalty snacks the socalled hyperpalatables all of which are relatively inexpensive and easy to buy in bulk  Sugar was also considered a harmless replacement for drugs and alcohol In fact    the  Step bible  suggests that recovering addicts keep candy on hand This may explain why cookies coffee and plumes of cigarette smoke are often staples at so many  Step meetings But though sweets may have eased some peoples drug cravings many ended up transfer addicting from their substance of choice to sugar  Once off the drugs the brain craves the uber rewards of the hyperpalatables  Mint Milanos Oreos any sugar An apples reward doesnt cut it said Dr Pamela Peeke an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Maryland and author of The Hunger Fix  So you end up with the transfer addiction she added Off the cocaine onto the cupcakes Research has found that food and drugs have similar influence on the brains reward center A   reported that sugar not fat stimulates cravings  And a widely cited study from that year found that   the brains pleasure or reward center as much as cocaine and morphine at least in laboratory rats  This has an effect not only on the addicts neural pathways but also on the addicts psyche and selfesteem  Some relapse because theyre so disgusted with the amount of weight theyve put on said Dr Marianne Chai the medical director  at the New York Center for Living a recovery facility for adolescents young adults and their families in Manhattan The mindset is I want immediate results They dont want to invest the four to six months of strict diet and exercise So they live on caffeine and stimulants or sometimes cocaine to lose weight Now with   some rehab facilities are overhauling their meal plans and hiring culinary nutritionists  certified chefs who are also registered dietitians   Were not asking them to live on arugula said Dr Peeke who is also the senior science adviser to Elements Behavioral Health which operates addiction and eating disorders treatment centers We come upon creative delicious entrees and snacks that will compete with the junk theyve been doing all along to reclaim that reward center Were switching them from bad fixes to healthy fixes The Center for Living offers onsite cooking classes for patients and their parents along with lectures on nutrition and healthy eating Patients grow their own herbs and vegetables on a roof garden and they are not allowed processed sugars caffeine or energy drinks  Most of the young adults dont know anything about how to pick out food theyre living on deli and fast food and a lot of parents fail and struggle with selfcare and modeling selfcare said Dr Chai who believes that maintaining a proper diet can play a pivotal role in helping maximize ones ability to recover in a sustainable lasting way Victoria Abel a certified addiction nutritionist in Prescott  Ariz who customizes nutrition programs at recovery facilities said she had no clue how desperate the field was for this Patients are so malnourished their bodys starving she added She leads weekly grocery shopping excursions where clients learn about healthy foods and how to read food labels Theyre not allowed to buy any item if the first four ingredients are some kind of sugar and dessert is  permitted only once a week Im trying to teach moderation she said  Not every expert agrees with this treatment path Dr Mark Willenbring the founder of Alltyr an addiction treament clinic and consultancy in St Paul says he does not believe that healthy eating is the missing ingredient to help patients stay drug and alcohol free I think its rehabs responsibility to provide a nutritious diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables not too much red meat and not too much fat because its healthy said Dr Willenbring the former director of the Division of Treatment and Recovery Research at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism But is it going to affect recovery I dont think so But those in the trenches are hopeful that the focus on nutrition is a step in the right direction   Christopher Kennedy Lawford the author of many books on addiction including the recent What Addicts Know said   When youre used to shooting heroin or drinking a bottle of vodka sugar seems really benign Its hard to take it seriously  But Mr Lawford who was been drug and alcohol free for  years and said his first drug was sugar is adamant that rehabilitation programs start treating addicts holistically  You cant get an addict into recovery until you deal with every aspect of their life he said What you think how you think how you relate to people what you put in your body how you exercise  its all related And we need to get smarter about it
