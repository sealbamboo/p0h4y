Antioxidant vitamins are enormously popular with people who exercise The supplements are thought to alleviate muscle damage and amplify the effects of exercise But recent studies have raised questions about whether antioxidants might be counterproductive for runners and other endurance athletes And now a cautionary new experiment adds to those doubts by finding that antioxidants may also reduce the benefits of weight training  It is easy to see why people might think that antioxidants like vitamins C and E could be helpful to anyone who works out regularly Both aerobic exercise and strength training lead to the production of free radicals molecules that in concentrated amounts can cause tissue damage Antioxidants sop up and neutralize free radicals So the thinking goes taking antioxidant should lessen some of the damage and soreness after exercise and allow people to train harder  But   have found that consuming large doses of vitamins C and E actually results in a slightly smaller training response The athletes taking these vitamins had lower levels of certain enzymes that spur an increase in mitochondria in muscle cells Mitochondria help to create cellular energy and having more of them allows people to exercise longer and harder By blunting the creation of mitochondria the vitamins had lessened the expected increase in fitness   But those studies looked only at endurance sports such as running and cycling not weight training which involves different biochemical processes within muscles So for the new study which was   scientists at the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences in Oslo and other institutions some of whom previously had studied aerobic exercise and antioxidants set out to repeat those experiments in a weight room  They began by recruiting  men and women who had at least some experience with weight training They measured the volunteers muscular size and strength  Then they randomly divided them into two groups Half were asked to start taking two antioxidant vitamin pills each day one before and one after exercising The total daily dosage amounted to  milligrams of Vitamin C and  milligrams of Vitamin E which is high but not higher than athletes commonly use said Goran Paulsen a professor at the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences who led the study   The other group did not take any supplements  All of the volunteers then began the same resistancetraining regimen consisting of four fairly rigorous training sessions each week As the exercises grew easy weights were increased with the aim of pumping up the size and strength of the volunteers muscles The program lasted  weeks But midway through that time the researchers took small samples of muscle tissue from each volunteer in order to determine what precisely was going on deep within each volunteers cells Then the men and women finished the remainder of the program at the end of which the researchers again measured their strength and muscle size  In general peoples muscles had increased in size to the same extent proportionally The group that had taken the vitamins now had larger muscles So did the group that had not  But there were subtle but significant differences in their strength gains Over all the volunteers who had taken the antioxidants had not added as much strength as the control group Their muscles were punier although they had grown in size  The differences continued beneath the skin where as the muscle biopsies showed the volunteers taking the vitamins had reduced levels of substances known to initiate protein synthesis Protein synthesis is necessary to repair and strengthen muscles after weight training So the volunteers taking the vitamins were getting less overall response from their muscles even though they were following the same exercise program  Exactly how antioxidant pills change muscles reactions to weight training is still unknown But Dr Goran and his colleagues speculate that by reducing the number of free radicals after exercise the vitamins shortcircuit vital physiological processes In this scenario free radicals are not harmful molecules but essential messengers that inform cells to start pumping out proteins and other substances needed to improve strength and fitness Without enough free radicals you get less overall response to exercise   Dr Goran believes that the same process occurs after endurance exercise although the specific biochemical signals and pathways are different  The upshot is that whether you lift weights or jog Dr Goran would advise against the use of highdosages of concentrated antioxidant supplements  Of course his advice does not apply to anyone with an actual deficiency of one of the antioxidants he said although that condition is rare He also doesnt suggest that we avoid orange juice or other natural sources of vitamins C and E while training But large volumes he said would be unnecessary
