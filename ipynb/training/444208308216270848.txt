If you want to know whats up with the flu at the moment you have a few choices You can get the latest information at   Or you can get the   from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which is based on data thats by now a couple of weeks old But a   in the journal  finds that quicker isnt necessarily better This story started in  when scientists at Google realized that they could measure flu activity by tracking when people searched for flurelated terms They created a handy site called Google Flu Trends And it works pretty well  some of the time But dont bank on it It missed by a huge amount last year and actually it turns out its been missing by a fair amount for several years says David Lazer a professor of political science and computer science at Northeastern University He says Google Flu Trend whiffed during the  flu season Its like bases loaded and bottom of the ninth striking out on three pitches They predicted twice as many flu cases as the CDC later said there were Lazer has written a critique of Google Flu Trends in the latest issue of   He finds that the data collected painstakingly from around the country and forwarded to the CDC is still much better even with the time lag You could just have used old CDC data  two or three weeks old  and have projected forward and done a better job than Google Flu Trends he says So does this make Googles approach worthless Not at all he says Not at all I think actually the core idea is a terrific one Lazar thinks Google could improve its system with the help of outside scientists if it were less secretive about what exactly its doing to get its results But he sees some inherent problems as well Google is always refining its search methods which is good for people doing Google searches but not so good for analyzing that data  consistency is important in science If we know ahead of time that flu is going to really peak in the next few weeks we need to start getting additional resources to help manage all these patients who are going to be coming in says Andrea Dugas a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and an emergency room doctor During past outbreaks Hopkins has actually opened up new areas of the hospital to care for flu patients Dr Dugas and her colleagues have been working to improve those predictions looking at various methods to do that The most accurate of those models was the one that looked at the confirmed flu cases she says That one was the most accurate in predicting what was going to happen in the following week When they added in the Google Flu Trends data their prediction improved she says but not by a lot Adding that in really helped refine the model and give us a better prediction she says but the main driver for that was the number of flu cases She and Dr Richard Rothman at Hopkins have developed an app called   to help hospitals predict the ebb and flow of flu Another free app called   also maps out flu trends based on reports that individuals submit through the app Dr Dugas says Googles approach is no substitute for lab tests hospital reports and ontheground data And its important to note that its not tracking actual flu caused by influenza viruses  rather its identifying common symptoms like fever cough and sore throat Google didnt provide a scientist to comment for this story but a Google   notes one shortcoming They sometimes get a flood of searches simply when theres a lot of flu in the news So Google updated the flu tracker system last fall to help reduce the errors that result from that
