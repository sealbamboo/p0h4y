A visitor brought Ebola to the community of New Georgia Signboard this summer and by the middle of August people were sick with the virus Six people died But its what the community did for the six survivors in the family that brought Liberias president to New Georgia Signboard where she launched her Ebola Must Go campaign on Monday We are standing by you in New Georgia community because you are a role model for taking responsibility for stepping up and stopping Ebola   told the crowd gathered at Christ Kingdom Harvest Church We are launching in a place where they have made a difference JohnsonSirleaf has set a goal of zero new cases of   by the end of the year She says its up to community efforts like the one made in New Georgia Signboard to keep the virus out of Liberia once its eradicated The New Georgia Signboard community has recorded  Ebola cases but none since September Authorities credit its aggressive selfmonitoring and community education The Ebola Must Go campaign aims to shift responsibility for eradicating the disease to community efforts Liberia has suffered half of all deaths in this Ebola outbreak But in recent weeks the West African nation has had some gains The country is now recording about  to  cases each week the World Health Organization   last week Thats down from nearly  cases a week at the height of the outbreak here New Georgia Signboard is a community of several thousand people who have found a spot to call home in a place that looks like it could revert to bush if given half a chance Its made up of one and tworoom concrete dwellings that sit under darkgreen mango and breadfruit trees Sweet potato vines seem to grow wild To get there you head out of Monrovia on a paved road bordered by meat markets auto repair shops and vendors selling clothes smoked fish gas for your car by the jar Chinesemade plastic goods chewing gum kola nuts and more Liberians are entrepreneurial The road is awful until you turn left onto a dirt road Thats when it really gets bad New Georgia Signboard is a community that doesnt get much official attention Theres no running water or electricity The road into the village quickly dissolves into a footpath Official motorcades delivered dignitaries to New Georgia Signboard for the presidents address Hundreds of people sat outside Christ Kingdom Harvest Church as others crowded inside to listen to the president JohnsonSirleaf told the audience she wanted to be the first to make a new antiEbola pledge I citizen Ellen JohnsonSirleaf pledge to protect myself my family and my community because everybody must work on stopping Ebola Stopping Ebola is everybodys business she said New Georgia Signboard is an example for the nation she said And then she credited the communitys vigilance and attention to the antiEbola safety protocols for its success against the virus Among the Ebola victims in New Georgia Signboard was the Kaifa family What happened really was that the mother died and the kids were too sick We couldnt get near We couldnt touch them said community leader JB Walker Dennis The Ebola thing is very dreadful A relative visiting from another community brought the infection Dennis said Within days the relative and his mother were dead leaving six others alone and infected All of the sick living children were lying on the porch vomiting toileting on themselves said Ophelia Ghartay wife of the churchs pastor We should not touch anyone that is sick But we knew we could still do something And that something included basic support like food and water finding transport to take them to an Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia and having church members visit the children while at the ETU Dennis said New Georgia Signboard started a task force early in the outbreak and also held weekly educational gatherings at the church to inform people on how to keep safe Dont touch anyone Dont hug anyone When people started dying we started quarantining their homes he said He said they got the guidance they needed from government Ebola safety messaging that blanketed radio and text messages The Ministry of Health was always on the air telling us what to do he said All six kids survived but with an uncertain future Relatives would not take them in So the community stepped up The church rented a room for the kids But things didnt go well Fear of Ebola remains high and survivors are stigmatized People began to lash us said Pastor John P Ghartay What right do we have to bring the children into the community he remembers them saying And the landlord was angry He didnt want the children in his house So Ghartay found them another place to live But that landlord also canceled the deal upon learning they were Ebola survivors said the pastor He finally found them a tworoom place on the edge of the village But they have not been embraced by the community said Hawa Kaifa who at  is now the family caregiver Yes I feel like a true outcast I have nobody she said I had a best friend at school before Ebola And since I came from the Ebola unit she never talked to me She never visited me Then I called her one time and explained to her that Im a survivor of Ebola I no longer carry the virus She came to me once but since then I have not seen her anymore Kaifa now cares for five children including two of her own and three siblings ranging in age from  to  During Mondays ceremony President Johnson Sirleaf made a point of highlighting the Kaifas She called them to the front of the church to recognize their survival and to laud the communitys support We are going to work with you and with the church to see what we can do JohnsonSirleaf told them But in an interview Kaifa started to cry when asked if she was honored that her story helped draw Liberias president to her village I feel proud that shes coming to this community because of me she said But its just sad that shes coming because my whole family died
