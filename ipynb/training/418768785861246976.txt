The FSU Seminoles have had an outstanding year Theyre undefeated at  Their quarterback Jameis Winston recently won the  Heisman trophy The team is set to play Auburn in the BCS National Championship Game on January  Basically Jimbo Fisher is on fire I love what I do he says The more success I have the more awareness I can bring to this disease  In December  Ethan fell ill with the flu The Fishers were visiting family in Alabama so his mom took Ethan to an urgent care clinic A blood test revealed his platelet count was low  Probably nothing to worry about the doctors told Candi Fisher Just follow up on it when you get home  A few months later Ethan was diagnosed with Fanconi Anemia  All we knew about the disease was what we looked up online Jimbo says It was all the worsecase scenario We thought it was a complete death sentence  That day was  After a moment he finds the word devastation  is an inherited blood disorder that affects about  in every  people says Dr Margaret MacMillan a pediatric hematologist oncologist at University of Minnesota Amplatz Childrens Hospital  Patients with Fanconi Anemia cant repair their DNA When their bodies make new cells they come with mistakes  big ones that can lead to birth defects bone marrow failure and cancer  Acute myelogenous leukemia is seen   in FA patients than its seen in children in the general population FA patients are also   head and neck breast and brain cancers Close to  need bone marrow transplants before they reach adulthood   Other than stunted growth Ethan didnt show any external signs of Fanconi Anemia MacMillan says About  of cases present with a birth defect such as a shortened thumb But the average pediatrician will see only one or two cases in a career and its difficult to diagnose   Most patients go into full bone marrow failure before they ever find out she says  When he was diagnosed in  doctors estimated Ethan would need a bone marrow transplant in three to five years His blood is tested every few months and once a year the family travels to Minnesota to get a bone marrow biopsy  Its hard  for the parents because hes a ticking time bomb MacMillan says  A bone marrow transplant will buy Ethan more time but its not a cure And the procedure itself is dangerous requiring up to a year of recovery Time isnt really on our side or anybodys side with this disease Candi says  The prognosis for Fanconi Anemia patients is difficult to predict MacMillan says  the average lifespan is between  and  years but the data are based on past success rates for bone marrow transplants  When MacMillan started at the Minnesota hospital  years ago the survival rate after a bone marrow transplant was about  she says Now its  The Fishers created the nonprofit   shortly after Ethans diagnosis to increase awareness and raise money for research about Fanconi Anemia  In September Jimbo joined forces with Paul Chryst head coach at the University of Pittsburgh to promote his cause Players from both teams wore I fight Fanconi decals on the backs of their helmets     We thought we can go private with this and keep it within or we can go out publicly and not only help Ethan but help all those kids who dont have a voice  whose dads arent the head football coach Jimbo says  To date KidzstFund has given more than  million to MacMillans program Donations stream in from all over the country Most are in  or  amounts from fans who hear about Ethan and want to help  But the donation Candi remembers best came from former FSU player Andrew Datko who gave  the night the foundations PayPal account was set up  Five dollars to him was a lot of money because those players rely on their program money heavily she says It touched my heart The FSU players have been unbelievable Jimbo says Theyve all signed up for the   Several have already donated bone marrow to help another child in need And theyre great with Ethan who is doing his best to live life as a normal kid His parents have told him about his Fanconi Anemia but havent explained the seriousness of the disease Hes very aware that all of these people have come together and are trying to help Candi says He has the rest of his life to worry Through the foundation the Fishers have met other families whove been through similar struggles  A yearold who hasnt yet gone into bone marrow failure gave Candi hope that Ethan could hold out a few more years  A practicing attorney named Christopher showed the Fishers that FA patients can live well into their s if the bone marrow transplant is successful And Logan Stevenson the yearold who   before passing away in August cemented their resolve to do everything they can to fight Fanconi Anemia  God put us on this path for a reason Candi says And I dont feel hes going to let us down For Jimbo that means winning as many football games as possible to keep FSU  and KidzstFund  in the spotlight    Oh were definitely going to try to win the championship
