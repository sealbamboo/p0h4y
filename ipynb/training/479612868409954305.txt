A baffling cluster of  in central Washington state is raising new questions about whether adding a vital nutrient to corn tortillas tamales and other foods favored by Hispanic families could prevent such devastating problems in the first place Health officials still cant say why  babies have been identified with socalled neural tube defects in the region since  including  in which theyre born missing parts of the brain and skull Of those more than half the mothers are  But some advocates point to low levels of folic acid a supplement proven to prevent such birth defects and theyre questioning why it still isnt required to be added to corn masa flour a staple of Hispanic diets  the same way its been added to enriched wheat and rice products in the US since  Critics say a petition calling for folic acid fortification of corn masa has been pending at the Food and Drug Administration for more than two years This is one area where we can definitively prevent a known birth defect said Cynthia Pellegrini senior vice president for public policy for the March of Dimes Foundation which led the  petition Fortifying grain products with  micrograms of folic acid per  grams of flour has been lauded as one of the  great public health achievements in the US said Dr Joe Sniezek chief of the Prevention Research Branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Neural tube defects like spina bifida and anencephaly occur in the early weeks of pregnancy usually before a woman knows shes expecting and are caused when the tube that typically develops into the brain and spinal cord fails to close completely Cases of NTDs dropped  percent in the US after mandatory fortification preventing an estimated  neural tube defectaffected pregnancies between  and  Today about  babies each year are born with the devastating and costly problems the CDC says Still Hispanic women are about  percent more likely than other women to have babies with those conditions and they continue to have far lower levels of folic acid intake either through diet or supplements according to Heather Hamner a health scientist with the CDC Fortifying corn masa to the same level as other grain products could boost folic acid intake by  percent in Hispanic women of childbearing age driving down the number of birth defects From the information and the data and the science our models indicate that about  babies would be born without spina bifida and anencephaly each year Hamner said But moving forward with such a seemingly positive public health intervention is proving much harder than expected experts said When folic acid fortification was implemented first as a recommendation in  and then as a requirement in  corn masa flour wasnt widely consumed and the FDA didnt include it in the list of affected grains Hamner said Since then the population of Hispanics in the US has jumped from about  million in  or  percent of the population to  million in  or  percent of the population according to census data Corn masa consumption has climbed too with the Tortilla Industry Association estimating that Americans consume about  billion tortillas a year But the FDA cant simply apply rules for wheat and rice products to corn Pellegrini said Instead the agency is requiring extensive  and expensive  testing to determine the safety and stability of adding folic acid to corn masa flour The trouble is neither the March of Dimes nor its copetitioners  the American Academy of Pediatrics the Spina Bifida Association and others  has the deep pockets to fund the extensive testing It was in the  million range and we didnt have  million to spend on this she said But with the lifetime cost of caring for one child with spina bifida estimated at  some public health advocates say that fortifying corn masa should be only obvious Why did we do it for rice and wheat cereal and we didnt do it for this said Vickie Ybarra a public health nurse who spent  years visiting the homes of Hispanic women in Yakima Washington one of three counties where the cluster of birth defects has been detected Folic acid needs to be ingested in the earliest weeks of pregnancy to have an effect on neural tube development she noted Doctors recommend that all women of childbearing age take the supplement because half of all pregnancies are unintended Most women dont know theyre pregnant at that time Ybarra said Its why fortification happened in the first place Several other countries already allow fortification of corn masa products with folic acid including Costa Rica El Salvador and Mexico FDA officials said they cant comment on the status of the pending petition but Pellegrini said the issue appears to be stalled for now You can make the public health benefits argument until youre blue in the face but until you address their food safety questions youre not getting anywhere she said We dont have a sense right now whether were close to signoff
