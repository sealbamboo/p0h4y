Many hospitals in England are failing to provide adequate care for people who have selfharmed despite a national drive to improve services say researchers  The snapshot analysis of  hospitals over a threemonth period found marked variability in the care provided  More than twothirds of selfharm patients did not get a specialist psychological assessment Performance had improved little compared with nearly a decade before Prof Nav Kapur is senior author of the study published in   and chairman of the recent   on treating selfharm  He said We were surprised to find that despite national guidelines and policy initiatives the management of selfharm in English hospitals is as variable as ever  This is important because the treatment patients get in hospital affects their outcome The researchers looked at how  episodes of selfharm were handled by  English hospitals between  and  Hospitals varied markedly in their management of selfharm The proportion of episodes that received a psychosocial assessment in line with national guidance varied from  in some hospitals to  in others  Overall the level of assessment had remained more or less static over the last  years a comparison with an earlier audit at  of the same hospitals revealed Prof Kapur said It remains to be seen how the more recent guidance and the linked quality standards for selfharm services will impact on care Hopefully people who selfharm will increasingly get the assessment and treatment they need An estimated one in  young people in the UK are believed to have selfharmed at some point in their lives Selfharm includes selfinjury skin cutting burning hair pulling and selfpoisoning ingesting toxic substances Vicki Nash head of policy and campaigns at the mental health charity Mind said When someone has been hospitalised as a result of harming themselves they are in crisis and need urgent help and support  This research is consistent with our own findings that while excellent crisis care does exist in some parts of the country too many people dont get the help they need when they are at their most unwell It is not acceptable that despite clear guidance the quality of service you receive still depends on where you live A spokesman for the NHS Confederations Mental Health Network said there was no excuse for inaction  Variability is sadly very real in our NHS The reasons for this are complex as are the solutions but that doesnt mean it is acceptable
