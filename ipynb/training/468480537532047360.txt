If you were dying wouldnt you want access to any drug or device that might have the slightest chance of saving your life Colorado has become the first state to enact a socalled right to try law that expands access to experimental medications making it legal for the terminally ill to seek access to drugs that have not yet received FDA approval Many others   Politicians know a surefire winning issue when they see one Sounds like a great idea The truth is such laws are utterly inadequate for helping the dying and the desperate They would better be described as right to beg laws  a right which sadly the terminally ill already have and already use in social media campaigns State Sen Irene Aguilar a medical doctor who cosponsored Colorados bill said that the movie   provided the inspiration for the law In the film actors Matthew McConaughey Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto connive to elude the federal government specifically the Food and Drug Administration to sneak in AIDS medicines from Mexico for those dying of the disease Unfortunately Hollywood is a crummy place to turn if you are in the business of enacting legislation The movie was set in  when the FDA was a barrier to access for untested drugs for AIDS or acquired immune deficiency syndrome That was  years ago The FDA is not the problem now for those who are dying who want to take a chance on a new pill Today the FDA will allow patients to do so The right to try laws have been crafted by ideologues who apparently taking their policy lessons from a movie still think the FDA is the main roadblock to giving the terminally ill their last shot at life Why are such laws so pathetically inadequate First because they are restricted to the terminally ill Many who are going blind becoming demented or losing their ability to walk are not terminally ill The law fails to recognize those plights Second if you dont have a doctor  or dont have a good one  then you may not know what is out there in the research pipeline that might help you The law does nothing to fix that Third if the drug you want is expensive this law only gives you the right to beg for it Drug and device companies are under no obligation to give patients anything  no matter how sick they are Where is the money to help people pay for drugs Fourth what if you have to travel to get a shot at a drug Where is the money to help you get there And finally what if the drug you want is a crummy drug peddled by a crooked doc looking to make a fast buck off the desperate The Colorado law  and others like it  says nothing about registering those who give out unapproved drugs or holding them accountable if they cause a lot of people to die more rapidly or painfully Giving the dying and the very sick a better chance at compassion is a serious ethical challenge Passing bills full of empty promises based on Hollywood rather than the real world of today is not compassionate but actually flatout cruel
