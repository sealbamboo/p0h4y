Cancer care across Staffordshire could be privatised as part of a bn contract a trade union has warned In what is believed to be the biggest outsourcing deal in NHS history four clinical commissioning groups CCGs are jointly tendering for a body to integrate care across the county The Unison trade union said it could mean the privatisation of care and described it as a huge gamble The CCGs said patients treatment would be unaffected Andrew Donald chief officer for Stafford and Surrounds and Cannock Chase CCGs said no decision had yet been made on a provider It could be an NHS body it could be a voluntary body it could be a private body or it could be all of them working together he said The successful bidder will be asked to coordinate cancer care throughout Staffordshire  from diagnosis through to treatment and endoflife care It will cover the four CCGs that commission services across the county  Stafford and Surrounds Cannock Chase StokeonTrent and North Staffordshire Unison however said the deal could lead to the privatisation of care affecting the lives of many thousands of patients and staff Christina McAnea Unisons head of health said This is by far the biggest procurement process in the NHS and is a dangerous experiment We are talking about bn of taxpayers money and contracts lasting  years in vital cancer services and endoflife care This is much bigger than just asking private companies to provide a service this is asking them to design the whole system With profit as the main driving force how can it not lead to problems The union also criticised the transparency of the tendering process Mr Donald however said the bidding process was intended to lead to better value for money The NHS in lots of areas is inefficient and weve got to make the taxpayers pound go further he said One of the challenges is that weve got lots of organisations providing healthcare to the same patients and what really we struggle with is how those organisations work together What we feel is if we can get an organisation to help to integrate those services wed get a better deal for patients and carers A spokesperson for the Department of Health said The key thing is that patients get the best possible care free at the point of use no matter who provides it
