Increases in health costs will accelerate next year but changes in how people buy care will help keep the hikes from reaching the speed seen several years ago PricewaterhouseCoopers says The prediction based on interviews and modeling splits the difference between hopes that costs will stay tame and fears that theyre off to the races after having been slow since the  financial crisis This is not an immediate return to doubledigit growth rates says Ben Isgur a director in PwCs Health Research Institute However he adds what were seeing for  will be our first uptick in some time If health plans stay unchanged PwC sees medical costs rising by  percent in  up from a projected increase of  percent this year PwC defines medical costs as percapita health expenses for private insurers and large selfinsured employers This is different from   of   which includes outlays for the government programs Medicaid and Medicare But PwC doesnt expect plans to stand pat In a separate analysis the consulting firm forecasts that employers and insurers will continue to raise deductibles and give members other incentives to mind the price of care The deductible is what patients pay before insurance kicks in Those changes should slow growth in the total cost of care to  percent PwC says as greater exposure to price tags prompts workers to undergo fewer treatments and tests PwC expects the deceleration from  percent to  percent to come solely from changes in consumer behavior not money employers save by shifting costs to workers Employers increasingly offer plans with deductibles of several thousand dollars making members responsible for routine medical costs and often for large portions of hospitalizations and other expensive treatment Twothirds of the companies surveyed by PwC offer highdeductible plans Nearly a fifth of employers offer nothing but a highdeductible plan Fortyfour percent of the rest are considering it PwC said Other   shows the same trend A few years ago an employer would kind of put their toe in the water with the the highdeductible health plan Isgur said They were saying Hey its one of three you can pick from Now theyre saying This is the health plan we offer  Highdeductible plans  with lower shortterm spending research shows But some   higher costs prompt patients to delay or skip needed care which could raise longterm costs Other factors restraining medical expenses include better coordination between different parts of the system and payment changes that penalize caregivers for poor patient outcomes PwC says On the other hand an improving economy is expected to prompt an increase in healthcare consumption That pushes up costs So does hospital acquisition of physician practices which allows the hospitals to charge more Drug manufacturers are introducing expensive specialty drugs which also puts upward pressure on spending
