A clinic used sperm from the wrong donor in fertility treatment a report by the regulator says  The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority HFEA warned clinics too many mistakes were being made  Its report showed one in every  women treated had experienced some form of adverse incident although most would not have affected their odds of having a baby The regulator has called on clinics to eradicate avoidable errors There were  adverse incidents in fertility clinics in the UK between  and   Three of them were in the most serious  or gradeA  category In one case a woman was having fertility treatment using donated sperm She wanted a child who would be genetically related to an elder sibling but sperm from the wrong donor was used No further details have been released to protect the familys anonymity A separate gradeA case involved embryos being contaminated probably with sperm And in the third incident sperm were removed from storage too soon There were  gradeB incidents which include the loss of embryos or equipment malfunctions affecting embryo quality There were  gradeC errors such as eggs left unusable or womens ovaries being overstimulated to produce eggs HFEA chairwoman Sally Cheshire said We are committed to ensuring that clinics provide the safest and highest quality service to their patients  These results show that in the main clinics are doing a good job of minimising the number of serious errors and this should be welcomed  However there remain too many gradeC mistakes such as breaches of confidentiality  As patients have often told us these mistakes may be less serious at first glance but they can still be very upsetting Clinics can and should be eradicating these sorts of avoidable errors which will go a long way towards reducing patient distress and improving the overall experience of IVF treatment
