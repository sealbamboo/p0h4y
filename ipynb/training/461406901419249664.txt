Members of NIs health committee are calling for greater clarity on details of cases of children travelling to Dublin for lifesaving heart surgery  A number of MLAs have said that despite the health board assuring the committee early last year that there were no emergencies some parents and surgeons are suggesting otherwise  The future of childrens heart services is expected to be announced in July That will follow a review by an international independent panel   According to the Ulster Unionist Partys Roy Beggs there is evidence that heart surgery for children should be retained in Belfast  He said he was aware of three cases between December  and April  where very sick babies required emergency surgical intervention before being transferred to Dublin  However early last year at a health committee briefing the health board informed members that while there may have been urgent cases these were not classified as emergencies  According to Mr Beggs the board is splitting hairs     The difference between urgent and emergency can be a very thin line he said  And the point is that in a few cases there needed to be a surgical intervention carried out in Belfast before the child could be transferred to Dublin  Whether or not the surgery was required in  or  hours surgery was still required and therefore should be retained in Belfast  Northern Irelands Health and Social Care Board HSCB have refuted allegations that either it or the Public Health Agency PHA were not being transparent  In a statement to the BBC a spokesperson said The board and the PHA can confirm that from  December  to  April  there were no emergency paediatric cardiac surgical cases undertaken in Belfast  This is consistent with the evidence given by the HSCB and PHA to the health committee on  May     However Mr Beggs said during that committee briefing on  May Dr Miriam McCarthy of the PHA was not forthcoming with important detail   It would have been much healthier if the full picture was given into specific cases where very sick infants did require surgery  whether or not these were described as urgent or emergency means very little to the public he said  The health board however said emergency cases are defined as those requiring surgical intervention within  hours  The three cases between  December  and April  were classified by the Belfast Health Trust as urgent requiring intervention within  hours  The HSCB and the PHA have established with the Belfast Trust a robust monitoring system by which service activity and the timeliness of access to surgery is reviewed on an ongoing basis   During the period  May  and March  there was one emergency procedure undertaken in Belfast Trust   This was a child who had elective surgery in Belfast and had complications that required a second emergency surgery procedure two days later  The BBC has been in contact with a family of an infant who received cardiac treatment in Belfast Lorraine McEldowneys newborn baby son Brogan was diagnosed with a heart defect shortly after he was born at the Causeway Hospital in Coleraine in January   According to Mrs McEldowney she was told that emergency surgery performed in Belfast saved her babys life    My son was seriously ill In fact he was so ill that a team of doctors was sent from Belfast to stabilise him in the Causeway They then travelled with him by ambulance to Belfast for emergency surgery she said  Because Id had a caesarean section I couldnt travel with my baby It was awful   A surgeon at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast performed an emergency atrial septostomy  This is a surgical procedure in which a small hole is created between the  upper two chambers of the heart   It is normally used to treat lifethreatening congenital heart defects seen in babies  According to Mrs McEldowney she was told that her baby would not have survived travelling to Dublin without the emergency surgery in Belfast  I was told that Brogans oxygen levels were so low that he may have died or been seriously brain damaged she said  In a statement the Belfast Health Trust said The possibility of any procedure on a sick newborn infant must be an emergency to that babys family This baby did not have a surgical operation he had an emergency cardiology procedure to stabilise his condition The baby was then transferred to Dublin for surgery In a further development the BBC can also reveal that the Department of Paediatric cardiology in Belfast wrote to the health board last year stressing the importance of retaining surgery in Belfast  The letter was sent in February   In the letter leaked to the BBC consultant paediatric cardiologist Dr Brian Craig wrote to Dr Miriam McCarthy outlining the details surrounding one case which he said crystallised how any decision regarding the future of paediatric congenital cardiac services PCCS in Belfast could impact on individual patients  Dr Craig described what happened following the birth of baby in a maternity unit in Northern Ireland He said It was clear that the only intervention at this stage which could improve the childs condition was an emergency balloon atrial septostomy The infants condition was stabilised The letter continues that if an option was chosen by the health minister where there is no paediatric cardiac surgical presence in Belfast it will not be possible to carry out any balloon septostomy in the Belfast trust without appropriate surgical cover  An infant will have to be transferred to a surgical centre in an unstable condition with deteriorating oxygen levels and increasing metabolic acidosis Dr Craig said  He went on to say that even if an infant should survive the transfer the cardiologist would be faced with a deteriorating situation and a hazardous intervention  According to figures provided by the Health and Social Care board between  May  and March this year there have been two emergency cases five urgent cases and two elective cases were referred from NI to Dublin for paediatric cardiac surgery
