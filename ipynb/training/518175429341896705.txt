I seem to be a permanent yoga newbie I hate sitting crosslegged and that always gets in the way despite my yogafan friends insistence that it doesnt matter So I reluctantly agreed to try another yoga class Yogascape held in a room heated to about  degrees lets participants escape to the water the desert and elsewhere with sound and videos on all four walls Yogascape created by Steven Metz owner of Earths Power Yoga is unexpectedly down to earth and a satisfying immersive experience that left me tired and my skin feeling great And I hardly had to cross my legs at all Be prepared to seriously sweat   Melrose Ave No    The room is hot and the lights are low the walls are a changing series of scenes some fairly abstract some real A huge moon covers much of a wall at one point at another theres a firered sky then a huge lake mountains stars Metz talks through the class explaining the moves Metz is an extreme sportsman and said he got the idea for yogascape while watching sunlight play on the ocean currents while scuba diving in Mexico We are shaped by and adapt to our environments he said For his students I want them to get to a fully blissedout yogic immersion experience  At first the class seems fairly tame but by the end of the hour I was like an overcooked noodle Metzs style is vigorous with almost constant movement It was rare until the brief meditation at the end that a pose was held still Most of the work could be done by a reasonably fit yoga beginner just one pose was completely beyond me After two years naked in a cave youll get this he joked I was happy I had an experienced yogi next to me so I could look to her to get things right  Metz is funny and doesnt take himself or the work too seriously He gives many pointers on modifying poses supporting the back etc only rarely in yogaspeak  Single classes are  various packages also available
