For many of us chicken soup can soothe the soul and mac and cheese can erase a bad day We eat chocolate when we feel gloomy or when weve been in the presence of a Dementor And we eat chocolate ice cream to help us get over a bad breakup These comfort foods usually arent so good for our arteries but we tend to think they have healing properties  that theyre the antidote for all our emotional afflictions But maybe theyre not says   a professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota In a recent study Mann and some colleagues induced a bad mood in  college students by making them watch clips from sad movies They then fed half the students their favorite comfort food while the other students ate food they enjoyed but wouldnt consider comfort food Once the students had finished eating the researchers asked the students how they felt It turns out all the students felt better regardless of what they had eaten That is not what we expected Mann says We kept repeating the study because we didnt believe it In another experiment Mann had half the kids eat comfort food and the other half eat nothing After a few minutes both groups felt equally better The comfort food had no effect on mood The   of these experiments appeared in the August issue of   People are taking this very hard Mann says I guess it removes a very handy justification people have for eating comfort food Of course the study has a few significant limitations For one it only looked at a particular kind of negative mood  induced by watching sad films Other studies have come to different conclusions For example   published in the journal   suggested that eating chicken soup may help some feel less lonely And the researchers didnt look at the reallife contexts in which people eat comfort foods Maybe the comfort from comfort food comes from going to a cafe acquiring it Mann says The research on the psychological effects of comfort food is fairly scant she notes so we dont have any definite answers yet  a professor of nutrition at Cornell University says Manns research is in line with what he would have expected We tend to look for a magic solution to our problems Levitsky says The idea that we can feel better by simply consuming certain foods is very appealing he says but in actuality feeling better has nothing to do with the food itself and its a very weak psychological effect The comfort foods we turn to the most are the ones we ate while growing up or the ones that remind us of celebrations Levitsky says We may associate chicken soup with all those times Mom took care of us when were little and maybe mashed potatoes remind us of joyful Thanksgivings Its a connection between food and memory beautifully rendered in this scene from the movie   when a crusty food critic finds his meal transportive We think that eating foods that remind us of home or of good times will make us feel better when were down Levitsky says But we dont know if its performing the function that people want it to So does this mean we should step away from the Ben and Jerrys when were feeling sad Not necessarily Levitsky says Theres no harm to it he says unless youre overeating or consistently eating food to avoid coping with big problems Mann concurs I am not opposed to comfort foodeating during your occasional glum moment she says Maybe the food doesnt help anything she says but that doesnt mean it isnt delicious So you lose one justification for eating a cookie Come up with another one
