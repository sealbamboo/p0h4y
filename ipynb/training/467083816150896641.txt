Only eating breakfast and lunch may be more effective at managing type  diabetes than eating smaller more regular meals scientists say  Researchers in Prague fed two groups of  people the same calorie diet spread over two or six meals a day They found volunteers who ate two meals a day lost more weight than those who ate six and their blood sugar dropped  Experts said the study supported existing evidence that fewer larger meals were the way forward  occurs when the body does not produce enough of the hormone insulin to function properly or the bodys cells dont react to insulin Since insulin controls the amount of sugar in the blood this means blood sugar levels become too high  If untreated it can lead to heart disease and stroke nerve damage lightsensitive eyes and kidney disease  About  million people in the UK are affected by diabetes  of whom have the type  form of the disease Current advice in the UK recommends three meals a day with healthy snacks  Scientists at the Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine in Prague divided a group of  volunteers aged  to  with type  diabetes into two groups of  people  Volunteers were then given either a sixmealaday diet A for  weeks followed by a twomeal day diet B or vice versa  The study compared two meals with six meals  as the latter accorded with current practice advice in the Czech Republic researchers said  Each diet contained on average  calories a day The B group ate between  and  and then between  and  and the A group ate their food throughout the day  Weight loss for the B group averaged kg lb more than A and they lost about cm in more from their waistlines Lead scientist Dr Hana Kahleova at the Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine said the results were very pleasing  She said The patients were really afraid they would get hungry in the evening but feelings of hunger were lower as the patients ate until they were satisfied  But when they ate six times a day the meals were not leaving them feeling satisfied It was quite surprising Dr Kahleova said the study could apply to people without diabetes who were trying to lose weight  Dr Richard Elliott research communications officer at Diabetes UK said the study added to evidence that eating fewer larger meals a day could be more effective than smaller frequent meals at helping people manage their condition  He added However larger studies over longer periods of time will be needed to back up these findings before we would make changes to the dietary advice given to people with type  diabetes Dr Elliot said eating a healthy balanced diet being active and maintaining a healthy weight alongside taking any medication was vital to effectively manage the condition
