Scientists have proposed a new idea for detecting brain conditions including Alzheimers  a skin test  Their work which is at an early stage found the same abnormal proteins that accumulate in the brain in such disorders can also be found in skin  Early diagnosis is key to preventing the loss of brain tissue in dementia which can go undetected for years  But experts said even more advanced tests including ones of spinal fluid were still not ready for use  Investigators have been hunting for suitable biomarkers in the body  molecules in blood or   for example that can be measured to accurately and reliably signal if a disease or disorder is present  Dr Ildefonso RodriguezLeyva and colleagues from the University of San Luis Potosi Mexico believe skin is a good candidate for uncovering hidden brain disorders  Skin has the same origin as brain tissue in the developing embryo and might therefore be a good window to whats going on in the mind in later life  at least at a molecular level  they reasoned  Postmortem studies of people with Parkinsons also reveal that the same protein deposits which occur in the brain with this condition also accumulate in the skin  To test if the same was true in life as after death the researchers recruited  volunteers   who were healthy controls and the remaining  who had either Parkinsons disease Alzheimers or another type of dementia They took a small skin biopsy from behind the ear of each volunteer to test in their laboratory for any telltale signs of disease  Specifically they looked for the presence of two proteins  tau and alphasynuclein The  people with Alzheimers and the  with Parkinsons had raised levels of both these proteins in their skin compared to the healthy controls and the patients with other types of dementia The people with Parkinsons also had higher levels of alphasynuclein protein Dr RodriguezLeyva who will soon present his findings to the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology said More research is needed to confirm these results but the findings are exciting because we could potentially begin to use skin biopsies from living patients to study and learn more about these diseases This new test offers a potential biomarker that may allow doctors to identify and diagnose these diseases earlier on It could also guide research into new treatments he said  Dr Arthur Roach Parkinsons UK Director of Research and Development said This work points to a possible diagnostic test that would be minimally invasive and could provide earlier more accurate diagnosis   There is still a need for more innovation in this area  at the moment theres no way to definitively diagnose Parkinsons Dr Simon Ridley of Alzheimers Research UK said it was too early to say if a skin test would become available  He said research into biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid  the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord  was at a more advanced stage but that even these methods were not yet close to becoming a routine test
