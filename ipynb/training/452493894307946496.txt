Stroke symptoms can be so   to spot that sometimes even emergency room doctors get it wrong A study from Johns Hopkins University suggests that ER doctors may be up to  percent more likely to overlook signs of stroke in women and minorities And for patients under  the odds are much greater than for those who are older Younger people are less likely to have a stroke but when they have that stroke theyre much more likely to be missed says   a neurologist at Johns Hopkins and the studys lead author Using federal health care data from  to  NewmanToker and his colleagues tracked the discharge records and emergency visits of nearly  stroke patients in more than  hospitals Nearly  percent of people admitted to the hospital with a stroke diagnosis had visited the emergency room up to  days earlier with complaints of headaches and dizziness which NewmanToker says may have indicated that they either were having a stroke with atypical symptoms or were having a minor attack that acted as a precursor to a more severe stroke But during the initial visit these patients either were diagnosed with benign conditions like inner ear infection or migraine or were sent home with no diagnosis at all Roughly a quarter of these patients returned less than  hours later in the midst of an obvious stroke according to   published Thursday in the journal   Though the study doesnt say why misdiagnoses seem more likely to occur in women minorities and younger people NewmanToker says the   could range from language and cultural barriers to the typical belief that stroke only happens to older folks Since stroke accounts for only one of every  cases of dizziness physicians may not think of stroke as a probable cause unless the patient is elderly When a yearold or a yearold comes in with dizziness theyre not going to think of stroke because its generally not a disease of the young he says And women are less likely than men to exhibit the classic more familiar   of speech difficulty or weakness in one arm Without clinical details about each case however its too early to firmly say that the majority of these patients were misdiagnosed says   a neurologist and the director of the Duke Comprehensive Stroke Center who wasnt involved in the study Theres no evidence from this paper that those in fact did have stroke earlier on he says adding that headaches and dizziness arent necessarily signs of an attack Headaches are extraordinarily common he tells Shots If one thought they were having a stroke when they were having a headache the entire population of North America would be diagnosed with a stroke NewmanToker agrees that only three to five percent of ER patients with dizziness actually have a stroke But though the study doesnt definitively say every case was a misdiagnosis he says the correlation between the early symptoms and a subsequent stroke is too strong to be passed off as mere coincidence If all these dizzy patients that came in were correctly diagnosed for inner ear infections then inner ear infections would have to be a trigger for stroke  but thats never been shown NewmanToker says He adds that other studies have suggested that doctors miss  percent of strokes when patients complained of dizziness compared to four percent when patients complained of weakness in one side of the body Both neurologists agree that stroke misdiagnosis is a real problem In fact misdiagnosis in general accounts for an estimated  to  preventable deaths each year costing hospitals nearly  per claim according to a recent   published in  Based on this latest study NewmanToker and his colleagues estimate that somewhere between  and  stroke cases are misdiagnosed each year Its no longer enough to base diagnosis on demographics and risk factors NewmanToker says especially since research shows that early treatment   and can lower the risk of having another one by as much as  percent
