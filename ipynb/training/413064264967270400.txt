Dahab Egypt just north of Sharm elSheikh on the Sinai Peninsula is perfect for freediving A diver can have tea in a simple beach cafe and then take just a handful of steps into the Gulf of Aqaba where the seafloor plunges more than  yards into a wineglassshaped blue hole Freedivers who take a breath swim as deep into the ocean as possible and then come back up come to Dahab from across the world to compete But a divers death in November has raised questions about the safety of the sport with some divers saying too little has been done to cut down on overly ambitious competitors and common injuries At a recent competition in Dahab  the first since diver Nick Mevoli died in the Bahamas  a dozen competitors had strung their yellow buoys out in a row across the blue hole Each buoy had a weighted rope attached which the divers followed down into the blue abyss One  two  then three minutes would go by And then a diver would come back up with a tag that proved he had reached the bottom But not all the scheduled divers competed that day Maxim Iskander a CanadianEgyptian freediver withdrew from competition because of an injury known as a lung squeeze How did I know I spit a little bit of blood Iskander says Not that much but enough to tell you OK something happened Part of Iskanders caution stems from what happened to Mevoli I said to myself I might as well rest and not make any stupid mistakes especially considering what happened with Nick  Iskander says Everybody got pretty shocked from what happened Competition officials havent yet determined the official cause of Mevolis death but everyone in the community knows the telltale signs of a lung squeeze blood and shortness of breath When the body dives deep the weight of the water presses the lungs and the air sacs inside Picture a paper bag full of blueberries when your hands relaxed you can compress the bag carefully enough to avoid squashing the berries But any twists or jerks can cause ruptures Mevoli contorted his body several times on his last dive aborting twice only to turn back down to finish Iskander calls that extreme Personally I would have never even thought about doing anything similar to that because there is a very high risk of squeezing then Iskander says In the first competition since Mevolis death organizers asked divers not to compete if they had experienced a squeeze in the past month They also limited the depth by which divers could attempt to exceed their personal record We all sat here thinking the sport is very safe And obviously weve got to react to this until we get some feedback  to see what the results of Nick was and what actually happened says freedive instructor Brian Crossland who was running the competition Weve got to err on the side of caution Squeezes are common in freediving Judges and safety divers describe athletes surfacing posing for YouTube and then ducking behind a buoy to spit up slicks of blood flecked with white body tissue Sara Campbell a fourtime world record freediver says the sport has grown complacent with these injuries like one she witnessed at the freediving world championships in  A fountain of blood Everyone trying to help him was covered in it It was gruesome she recalls Once they got him breathing again he was taken to hospital he was treated for the lung injury and hes fine On the one hand Campbell and others blame overly ambitious competitors who have seen other divers return from death unscathed wrapped in a cocoon of safety divers and medics Mevoli she says inherited this complacency But Campbell also criticizes AIDA the organization that governs competitive freediving She says the group isnt proactive enough in publishing accident reports Kimmo Lahtinen AIDAs president says the organization isnt covering anything up Rather he says its victim to the paralysis of an allvolunteer organization thats run democratically When you try to lead this kind of multicultural and challenging organization which is actually nonprofit as well its not easy to make fast decisions quite often Lahtinen says So I can agree that we are not the fastest organization maybe in the world But we try to do our best Lahtinen also says there are downsides to ramping up regulation Competitors could start lying to judges and medical staff he says or worse the sport could go underground where there are no safety or education infrastructures Currently there is a special AIDA work group investigating the factors that contributed to Mevolis death Lahtinen says the report will likely recommend rule changes similar to those implemented at the Dahab competition
