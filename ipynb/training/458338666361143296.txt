The yearold boy who   of a  flying from California to Hawaii survived with help from an unlikely source the frigid temperatures that could have killed him The runaway from Santa Clara Calif is one of just  people to survive such a journey since  though more than  have tried according to the Federal Aviation Administration Fewer still have survived at an altitude approaching the  feet reached by Hawaiian Airlines Flight  Its amazing said Roger Connor curator at the National Air and Space Museum Hes very very lucky to be alive Something like that happens only once in a long time A number of deadly hazards await a prospective stowaway  the lack of pressure and oxygen and extreme cold among them The first thing is that youre almost unpressurized at that altitude We are talking about pressures at nearly  feet Thats going to be about  percent less than the pressure at the top of Mount Everest Connor told NBC News And keep in mind that a lot of people dont survive on Mount Everest even with extraordinary conditioning In fact Connor said most people wouldnt survive more than a few minutes at  feet To last at  feet for an extended period of time is really extraordinary The few survivors almost all have been very young males who were presumably fairly fit At those altitudes temperatures are probably going to be around  degrees Fahrenheit and oxygen levels will be low Connor said For those who survive the frigid conditions the temperatures can actually turn out to be a lifesaver The cold might work to help slow the bodys processes to prevent death Connor said Its somewhat analogous to people who survive after being submerged under icy waters Its an analog to hibernation Temperatures might also be mitigated by frictional heat from the workings of the landing gear and breaks Connor said Warm hydraulic fluid lines in the wheelwell compartment would also provide some heat according to an FAA study but the warmth would diminish as the plane climbed Of course if the cold temperatures and lack of oxygen dont get you theres yet another danger decompression sickness At about  feet you run into decompression sickness  the same problems a scuba diver runs into when he ascends too rapidly Connor said Nitrogen can form in the blood stream and there are all sorts of possibilities for cardiac arrest The vast majority of these end very badly According to the FAA there have been  stowaways since  Of those  people  died and  survived translating to at least a  percent death rate But Connor noted that there may be more unreported deaths  some stowaways have probably fallen out of the wheel well and into the water when landing gear come down on flights coming in over the ocean Theres also the possibility of being crushed by the landing gears moving parts While the wheel well of a big jet like a  probably has a good amount of space  enough for a person to hide out in and even move arounda stowaway would have to be careful to stay out of the way of the actuators and pistons Connor said Even if a stowaway survives all those hazards there are other dangers As the landing gear come down the stowaway can be exposed to winds at speeds of  mph Connor said adding most people cant hang on in that scenario Just two months ago a body of a stowaway was found at Dulles International Airport in Washington Two bodies were found within a week of each other at New Yorks John F Kennedy airport in  Another was found in the landing gear of a British Airways Boeing  that arrived at Heathrow airport from South Africa in  Some bodies discovered that way have been frozen Others have fallen from the sky In  a body of a man fell into a southwest London neighborhood assumed to have fallen from the wheel well of a plane arriving from North Africa The body of a North Carolina teenager was found in Boston in  and his fingerprints were found in the wheel well of a Boeing  In  a woman in New York found body parts in the backyard of her suburban home that had fallen from a South African Airways plane on its way to JFK But there have been other tales of survival The last known survivor of a stowaway incident was last August on a domestic flight within Nigeria Africa according to the FAA In  Fidel Maruhi survived a mile journey from Tahiti to Los Angeles Victor Alvarez Molina survived a trip from Cuba to Canada in  and five years later yearold Andrei Shcherbakov survived a trip from Perm Russia to Moscow claiming he went into the wheel well to check it out and fell asleep Pardeep Saini was found alive at Londons Heathrow airport in  after traveling from Delhi with his younger brother Vijay who did not survive the trip The noise was terrible he   at the time As the wheels came up they were glowing hot They were burning us The wheel house was shaking It was like an earthquake My whole body started feeling numb He said he passed off minutes after takeoff and believed his brother died quickly
