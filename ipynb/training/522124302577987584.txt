Nurses were worried about Ebola long before nurse Nina Pham became the first person to become infected with the deadly virus in the United StatesNow theyre worried and mad And theyve got lots of questions about how to care for future Ebola patients safely Pham  was part of the team caring for Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan at a Dallas hospital until he died last Wednesday She was  on Sunday and is reported to be in stable condition at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital hospital Her case is especially troubling because as far as anyone can tell she was following the hospitals infection control procedures which included wearing a gown mask face shield and gloves when working with the patient The hospital and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating whether invasive procedures used on Duncan including intubation and kidney dialysis could have increased the risk of infection We called   a professor of nursing at Hunter College and president of the American Academy of Nursing to talk about what needs to be done to make hospitals safe for patients and staff when dealing with Ebola This is an edited version of our chat Theres a lot of outrage about Friedens comments Its blame the nurse again If Im working with most patients with isolation in the United States theres a separate room where I gown and degown But thats probably not sufficient with Ebola You dont want to gown and degown in the same place If you look at the hazmat suits that Emory used thats not what most nurses in the United States are going to have So its really important that when I gown up that I have someone watching me to make sure Im doing it correctly and the same thing when I take all this equipment off Thats why I think the CDC is thinking of regionalizing the care of Ebola because most hospitals dont have that capacity to have that kind of space for suiting up properly and degowning properly If Ive been working  hours and Im going into my th hour the likelihood that Ill have a lapse is huge Thats human nature You wont want an exhausted worker caring for Ebola You just do not We need to make sure that hospitals are putting in place the best practices with staffing as well as with infection control Well I went into nursing when I was  I really didnt think about the hazards And even then nurses are committed to caring for people Sometimes that means you are exposed to things that other people wouldnt even want to witness Its just what you do Someone asked a nurse what do you make I make sure your seriously ill father is cared for I make sure that when youre incontinent youre cared for Its this everyday profound yet intimate work that people do People dont understand it It requires incredible cognitive and emotional intellect to do it You are with someone at the most difficult and challenging and joyous moments of their lives If your hospitals not prepared for Ebola the nurses will know it You want to pay attention to what theyre saying But Ill tell you that many nurses who speak up end up being given a really hard time in some institutions
