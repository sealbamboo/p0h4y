 feel uncomfortable about the use of the word stigma in mental health campaigns But I havent been able to put my finger on what my disquiet actually is I think we are doing the wrong things in the UK by travelling along this road and my associates challenged me to elaborate and disclose why I felt this to be true It forced me to explore why I had this feeling and whether I was the only one unsettled at the notion that stigma be applied to the experience of having mental health problems The efforts to change individual acceptance and societies perceptions of the impact of mental ill health are laudable and I welcome them But I think that by using words like stigma to describe societys collective perceptions of mental health problems and the personal and social challenges people face we accept the stigma and buy into the very concepts we are trying to challenge I know how harmful language can be and checked my discomfort out online with a few dictionaries to see why I was splitting hairs over a seemingly accepted word Stigma is a derivation of the Greek word for tattoo and is described as a mark of disgrace or infamy a stain or reproach as on ones reputation The religious and historical roles of madness in society are further reinforced with elaborations in these dictionaries of the stigmata a further derivation of the word stigma in medicine meaning a mark that is a characteristic of a defect or disease  hardly very progressive and politically challenging The word stigma generally applies when we are talking about peoples moral choices and behaviours and that others may pass a moral judgment upon In mental health this harks back to the times of the moral defective as the primary diagnosis and reinforces a bigoted attitude  an attitude which may be prevalent in society that mental illness is something that people are in control of There is a need to change and educate not only individuals but also society This is more about accepting what we in society have done wrong over the years in creating such a discriminatory experience establishing no blame and working on ways for individual and social change The focus of our efforts should be upon society and the perpetrators of this discrimination not the subjects of it If we accept the concepts of   then we should describe not stigma but rather bigotry hatred unlawful and unjust discrimination Accepting the application of the word stigma reinforces this prejudice and does nothing to challenge it We must challenge the status quo not accept it This is what we may choose to learn from other political acts and thats how we change There is a personal and institutionalised acceptance of bigotry toward oneself for whatever that complex reason may be and then there is a need to change society which is more about accepting what we have done wrong establishing no blame and working towards ways for individual and social change thats not an antistigma campaign its an antibigotry one
