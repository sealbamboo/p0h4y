In   million children under the age of  died Thats a tragic statistic  yet it represents a  percent drop from  according to   released Tuesday by the United Nations  the head of UNICEFs global health programs spoke with us about the encouraging trend  and what still needs to be done in parts of the world where childrens lives are threatened by unsanitary water disease and malnutrition In many ways under mortality is a lens of how far we have progressed as a civilization Newborns premature babies and children under  are the most vulnerable members of our society They are completely reliant on the values the care and the love that we as a society are providing to each other The reduction in mortality rates is a measure of childrens lives which are very important Each life saved is someone else who will contribute to our wellbeing as a whole But its also a measure of how we are progressing as human beings If there are still children dying of causes which can be easily prevented cheaply and we still arent doing that Then we arent really progressing as much as we think we are We have much more awareness of the problem than weve ever had Government leaders and communities recognize there are things they can do to solve this problem and theyve been doing them We have new technology specifically vaccines to respond against the biggest causes of death such as diarrhea and pneumonia We also have ways of delivering those interventions   have been very important in many of the poorest countries where health systems are not yet properly established They can now reach out diagnose and treat common illnesses and common causes of death Finally we have been making investments in other areas apart from health which also impact childrens health most importantly girls education We are seeing a close relationship with girls that are educated and the fact that their children are far less likely to die of diseases and illnesses First and foremost we still need more resources to buy more vaccines to pay for more health workers to build more clinics and so forth African governments all committed to putting   of their budgets aside for health and not many are doing that And among richer countries the aid going for children and womens health is not rising fast enough to be able to accelerate change further Even when we have the resources they dont go to the right things In many countries most of the health budget is taken up by large hospitals and intensive care in the capital city quite often addressing the needs of the better off rather than where most of the child deaths are occurring which is amongst the poor in the rural areas As you see in the report neonatal care is the one area where we have not made as much progress as we have done with the child after one month of age Of these childhood deaths  percent are happening in the first month of life We know that delaying your first pregnancy until youre  or  increases the chance of your child surviving by almost fivefold We know that being wellnourished before you become pregnant is also important During pregnancy if we can avoid the mother getting malaria HIV or syphilis that increases the chance of survival One of the interventions highlighted in the report is called kangaroo mother care or skintoskin care which replaces the need for incubators for premature babies Premature babies have trouble keeping their body temperature up If you keep the baby right by the skin of the mother and wrap the baby and the mother together the mothers body temperature will regulate the babys Just doing that has reduced newborn mortality where it has been implemented by  percent When I worked in Africa in the s and early s I would see every year like clockwork hundreds of kids coming into the hospitals with measles And many of them would die But because of the attention to vaccinating children from measles weve been able to almost eliminate it There has been more than  percent reduction in measles deaths even in the last  years or so You can see across large numbers of children how this has transformed their lives
