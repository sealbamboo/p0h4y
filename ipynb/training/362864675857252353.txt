For all the   the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has concluded that amyloid brain scans for the purpose of diagnosing Alzheimers disease are not ready for prime time  Instead   and Medicare coverage extended only to older patients participating in clinical trials examining their usefulness the federal agency recommended in a preliminary decision   Given the tests cost   or more  such a decision if made final would greatly limit the use of PET scans as a diagnostic tool for Alzheimers disease for the foreseeable future More than  imaging centers across the country have begun offering the scans which are designed to detect abnormal amyloid proteins in the brain Generally they are not covered by public or private insurance CMS has just finished accepting comments on its proposal and expects to make a final decision in early October   This is a controversial topic as I wrote when the government   When asked to vote on their confidence that the scans contribute to improved health outcomes for patients  longer survival better quality of life slower rates of decline and avoidance of futile treatments or tests  experts gave an average  score on a scale of  to  with  being the lowest and  being the highest  Still supporters of the technology had hoped that CMS would be swayed by other experts who believe that scan results can increase physicians confidence in diagnosing Alzheimers disease and help to prevent misdiagnoses   More than  medical conditions can resemble Alzheimers disease and about  percent of people who are told they have the illness are found upon further examination to have frontotemporal dementia vascular dementia normal pressure hydrocephalus Parkinsons disease or another condition  In an interview Maria Carillo vice president of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimers Association expressed disappointment with the preliminary decision by CMS The value of knowing and increasing the certainty of a diagnosis is an important contribution to a patient and also to the management of their health care she said Its hard to argue with that sentiment but theres a hitch positive results from an amyloid PET scan cannot be used to make a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimers disease When autopsies are performed on older adults who were cognitively normal when they died about  percent are found to have significant amyloid deposits in their brain The percentage rises with the age of the deceased  Amyloid plaques also appear in the brains of people with other conditions like Lewy body dementia Parkinsons disease and Huntingtons disease In other words the presence of amyloid plaques in a persons brain cannot tell you whether he or she will develop Alzheimers disease some other neurological illness or any illness at all   A positive scan doesnt mean much of anything while a negative scan means you dont have Alzheimers but doesnt tell you what you do have said Dr Daniel Silverman head of neuronuclear imaging at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles  This ambiguity leaves open the question of how medical management of patients might change if amyloid scans became more widely available Currently the only drugs approved for patients with Alzheimers disease have no impact on the underlying course of the illness and limited impact on symptoms And in the past year several notable clinical trials of new drugs have failed leaving nothing new on the immediate horizon Dr Ronald Petersen a professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic and the chair of the   said it could be important to determine whether amyloid plaques play a role in people who develop significant cognitive issues before age  and people with atypical symptoms including language problems visual and spatial difficulties or difficulty navigating the environment But what role would amyloid imaging play in medical plans for these patients Its probably not going to change management all that much at this point he said And what about people with negative amyloid scans for whom Alzheimers could be ruled out definitively Having this kind of information is important because drugs for Alzheimers should not be given to patients who have frontotemporal dementia or Lewy body dementia said Dr Dan Skovronsky chief executive of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals which makes a radioactive chemical used in amyloid scans  As many as  percent of older adults with cognitive impairment do not have Alzheimers disease he noted Just being able to rule it out should be cause enough for this scan to be approved because of the potential impact on their care he said But CMS is not convinced by this argument either If its not clear whats wrong with a patient work up to exclude other diagnosable and potentially treatable diseases should proceed anyway as it would if any amyloid scan were negative the agencys preliminary decision said The unavailability of an amyloid scan does not change that logic
