With a hug and a kiss President Barack Obama said goodbye to his troubled Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Friday thanking her for her friendship and wit and taking note of her nonetoogentle battles with Congress The White House announced on Thursday night that Sebelius  after serving five years as head of the agency that takes care of health policy food safety fighting disease and medical research Shell be replaced by the current director of the White House Office and Management and Budget Sylvia Mathews Burwell Sebelius   will go down in history for serving as HHS when United States of America finally declared that quality affordable health care is not privilege but right for every single citizen of these United States of America A former governor of Kansas who had also been the states insurance commissioner Sebelius helped oversee the hasty writing and rollout of the   an ambitious piece of legislation that has been fought at every twist and turn by Republicans in Congress governors of conservative states insurance companies and employers The challenges went right up to the Supreme Court forcing teams at HHS to try to write the rules for implementing the law even as they wondered whether it would even take effect It seeks to get health insurance to more than  million Americans who dont have it tries to lower health care costs and to improve how service is coordinated among primary care doctors specialists hospitals and clinics Besides that HHS battled the HN swine flu pandemic dozens of outbreaks of food poisoning an epidemic of fungal meningitis linked to poorly regulated compounding pharmacies debates over stem cell research and questions about a womans right to birth control Shes got bumps Ive got bumps bruises Obama said Friday morning as spring finally came to the White House Rose Garden But we did it because we knew of all the people weve met all across the country who had lost a home had put off care had decided to stay with a job instead of start a business because they were uncertain about their health care situation The reward for all that work was the horrific debut of HealthCaregov the webbased marketplace that was supposed to look like Travelocitycom but that instead crashed and burned for the first two months Sebelius and   took much of the blame but experts also pointed to poor project management and a clunky federal contracting process that forces agencies to take low bids and work with trusted partners who may not be up to speed with the best technology and practices Obama noted this and praised Sebelius for sticking it out Under Kathleens leadership her team at HHS turned the corner got it fixed got the job done and the final score speaks for itself  there are  and a half million people across country that have security of health insurance most of them for the very first time and thats because of the woman standing next to me here today and we are proud of her for that Obama said Thats an historic accomplishment There was one last glitch for the road Sebelius lost one page of her brief farewell speech in the Rose Garden and was forced to adlib Sebelius silverhaired thin and elegant is different in physical appearance from her successor but perhaps not in her ability to stay calm despite often theatrical attempts to throw a cabinet officer off balance in Congressional hearings and on cable television shows I will miss her advice I will miss her friendship I will miss her wit But I am proud to nominate someone to succeed her who holds these traits in abundance Obama said Burwell  came back to the White House a year ago from the Walmart Foundation the charitable arm of the king of big box stores Before that Burwell worked for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and in President Bill Clintons administration under thenTreasury Secretary Robert Rubin Diminutive sometimes rumpled but with a ravishing smile  called the bluff of a battling Congress and ordered the shutdown of the federal government from pandacams to national parks when it failed to pass a budget Sylvia is a proven manager and she knows how to deliver results Obama said He noted she will need them to see through the implementation of the Affordable Care Act adding that she will need those skills managing the health care law and other HHS responsibilities These are tough tasks  big challenges Burwell who comes from West Virginia is the daughter of a smalltown mayor She brings the common sense that you see in small towns Obama said She sees the values that you bring in caring about your neighbor Shes a proven manager and knows how to deliver results Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy said he hopes Burwells nomination will be the start of a candid conversation about Obamacares shortcomings and the need to protect Medicare for todays seniors their children and their grandchildren Other Republicans wasted no time in thumbing her noses at Sebelius and promising the acrimony will not end Secretary Sebelius oversaw a disastrous rollout of ObamaCare but anyone can see that there are more problems on the way said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus If I could take something along with me it would be all the animosity Sebelius   in an interview
