Give Representative   a nineterm Democrat from Oregon credit for two things First a sense of humor He began an oped piece he wrote for The New York Times a few years back with   He sometimes adopts the very phrase he got slurred with in  referring to himself ironically as the deathpanel guy just as the president and his administration now embrace Obamacare Yes it was Mr Blumenauer who as part of the effort to overhaul health care introduced into the legislation an unremarkable provision requiring Medicare to cover voluntary discussions with a physician about advance directives and treatment preferences at the end of life These consultations would take place every five years more often if a patients health declined substantially Critics of our health care system frequently lament that providers are paid to do things  order tests perform procedures  but not simply to talk with patients Mr Blumenauer with cosponsors and supporters in both parties intended to change that Hed been dismayed by the dreadful   case in Florida One familys tragedy turned into a political spectacle Mr Blumenauer told me This was something that was entirely preventable Opponents of Obamacare seized on this modest idea  asking patients what they want really shouldnt be so controversial  as the embodiment of evil The falsehoods  that the provision was mandatory no that it advocated or enabled euthanasia no  spiraled culminating in Sarah Palins denunciation of death panels So lets give Mr Blumenauer credit secondarily for nerve He and several cosponsors again from both parties have introduced the Personalize Your Care Act of  which once more would provide for Medicare and Medicaid coverage of voluntary discussions of advance care planning His initial effort derailed in the heat of the debate about health care reform the superheated rhetoric the Tea Party frenzy he said Now the hysteria has died down This time Mr Blumenauer has vowed to meet with all  members of the House to explain his idea and seek their support and has passed the member mark Even so he doesnt think the bill can pass this year By  or  he thinks the time will be right Maybe so Three years ago the political climate was so toxic that when the final version of the Affordable Care Act didnt include the advance care consultation Medicare administrators added it to a package of regulations  then   It was the height of the frenzy and the administration got cold feet and yanked it said Mr Blumenauer In this lessfrenzied atmosphere Senator   and Senator   a Democrat and a Republican respectively have introduced   Like Mr Blumenauer theyve tried this before without much luck A number of medical groups and senior advocates have endorsed one or both bills For this it doesnt matter where someone stands on Obamacare Mr Blumenauer said Indeed several of his cosponsors have voted repeatedly to repeal the Affordable Care Act Advance directives he pointed out protect someone who wants the full range of medical science to give them one more minute of life as well as those who want to prevent aggressive endoflife medical treatment His bill also provides grants to help develop   which require patients advance care plans to be included in their electronic health records and makes such directives portable across states Of course this all sounded rational the first time too The ensuing nuttiness  this notion that someone was going to step on Grandmas air hose as he put it  shows how easily facts can be distorted Mr Blumenauer thinks the deathpanel fever has abated Its been debunked so many times that people who used the term are a little embarrassed  Lets hope so Think of older patients facing operating rooms or intensive care units and distraught families huddling in hospital lounges wondering what their relatives would want them to do A bit of chagrin about having turned their plight into partisan nonsense would be encouraging
