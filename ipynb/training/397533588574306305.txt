One year on the BBCs Shanghai correspondent John Sudworth reports on his slow recovery from Bells palsy and frowns almost symmetrically at the lack of medical awareness about the condition It may have taken a whole year but the muscles on the left hand side of my face have been slowly drifting away from the picket line and getting themselves back to work The strike it seems is over My left eyebrow the left side of my mouth and my left eyelid have all reported for duty again and I can now do two of the most glorious and underrated things a human can do  smile and blink Shortly after the onset of my Bells palsy in October last year I wrote about my decision to carry on working as a BBC TV reporter The response was overwhelming with many many fellow sufferers writing to tell me about their experience coping with this facially disfiguring and deeply distressing condition So exactly  months on by way of returning some of that generosity this is my own story of recovery from an illness that was recently shown to be more common than previously thought and one that deserves far more medical attention than it gets Bells palsy sufferers usually find themselves becoming overnight  and unwitting  members of a very strange club There are no warning signs and most people simply wake to find that they cant move half of their face  Although membership includes some pretty esteemed company including the likes of George Clooney and Pierce Brosnan it is not a club that anyone would choose to join The paralysis can be shocking and socially at least very difficult to deal with  The hardest part for me as well as the loss of my smile was the inability to close my left eye Bells Palsy leaves sufferers with one eye stuck permanently wide open unable even to blink sometimes for months on end  Of course the other unaffected eye carries on as normal merrily blinking away  So for the record my apologies to anyone who may have mistakenly thought Id been winking at them for the past year or so Except the barmaid in the Nags Head That was a wink  The eye issue certainly presented a thorny dilemma in my TV reporting With my left eye stuck open the choice was to either force my right eye to do the same  in manic twoeyed stare  or to blissfully wink away at BBC viewers Move over Anne Robinson  Thankfully as the above video shows at some time between the six and ninemonth mark my left eyelid began to take instructions again Bells palsy is thought to be caused by the waking up of a dormant virus often at times of stress and lowered immunity much in the same way as the chickenpox virus causes shingles long after the initial illness has passed The virus attacks one of the two facial nerves causing it to swell up and become constricted inside a bony passageway close to the ear Signals then cease to be transmitted along it paralysing one side of the face and rendering it expressionless The only treatment that has been shown to have significant measurable benefit is a course of steroids but it must be started early within  hours of the onset These steroids reduce the swelling and lower the risk of permanent damage to the facial nerve Remarkably despite this clear evidence   has shown that many people more than  in the UK are still not getting the appropriate treatment And the same study shows that Bells palsy is more common than previously thought The estimated incidence rate suggests that worldwide there are more than  new cases every day One year ago as I was becoming acquainted with my own facial paralysis Charles Nduka a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon was setting up a new charity Facial Palsy UK which campaigns for better UK services for Bells palsy and a range of related conditions The information available online about Bells palsy at the moment is pretty appalling he tells me And there is very poor data because there is not enough research The illness he believes is all too often dismissed by the medical profession as a cosmetic issue because there are no ill effects apart from the paralysis  But Mr Nduka has seen the huge toll it can take One patient a professional musician is no longer able to make the mouth movement needed to play the saxophone  Another a receptionist is simply unable to carry on in her job facing the public In my previous article I mentioned one father permanently stripped of the confidence to appear in a family photograph As one of the UKs leading experts in the treatment of the condition Mr Nduka says that there are a few vital rules for doctors to follow when dealing with new cases  Of course the two questions any new Bells palsy sufferer wants answered are Will I get better and How long will it take  The good news is that most people make a full recovery  many within a matter of weeks Something like  of sufferers are back to normal within the space of a year Getting the course of steroids in time will increase your chances of finding yourself in this happy category Even without steroids as my own case shows most people get back to normal The doctor I saw did not prescribe them and by the time I realised how important they were it was too late Im left wondering though whether my recovery might have been faster and fuller if I had been given them  Ill never know because while steroids increase your chances of recovery they dont guarantee it Estimates suggest that up to  of sufferers will be left with some residual effects more than a year after the onset Five per cent of sufferers will experience aftereffects that are severe and long lasting and as a result face the possibility of serious psychological distress It may be even harder nowadays Mr Nduka says Face is everything  Facebook Facetime Skype We live in a very imageconscious age As for me well Im almost back to normal as you can see from the video Ive been left with a tiny bit of asymmetry and a slightly weaker blink in my left eye But recovery can continue for up to  months and the blink being at the furthest extremity of the facial nerve is often one of the last things to return Anyway Im not complaining So a big thank you to all those who wrote with words of encouragement advice and good humour You made a difficult  months so much more bearable And on behalf of those whose recovery is still slower and less complete than theyd like a humble appeal to medical science to do a bit more
