The Congressional Budget Office earlier this week said this years deficit is likely to be about onethird the size it was in  when the Great Recession bottomed out A recovering economy is the main reason for the deficits improvement but moderating health care costs have also contributed Harvard economist and health policy specialist David Cutler says getting the federal governments finances under control is all about health care A fairly accurate summary of the federal budget is that the US does not have a deficit problem  it has a health care problem Cutler says The problem is that health care costs grew significantly faster than the economy in the s s and s  driving up the cost of government health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid In the s increases slowed a bit but then they peaked again in  These increases have led to projections of huge unsustainable budget deficits in the future as baby boomers retire and demand more health care for their aging bodies So if you say Whats affecting the longrange outlook for the federal budget it is almost entirely health care Cutler says But a decade ago increases in health care spending began to decline and in the past few years theyve been historically low  between  and  percent a year That moderation if it continues could have an enormous impact on the countrys finances Cutler adds Just as an example the Congressional Budget Office has modified a little bit its forecasts for cost increases over the next few years in health care particularly Medicare and Medicaid and that by itself has taken about  billion out of the expected deficit in  he says But the CBO projects ballooning health care costs and exploding deficits in the decades after  Thats partly because a big factor that has reined in health care spending in recent years is fading Joe Antos a health policy specialist at the American Enterprise Institute says Certainly the biggest factor although its hard to put a number on it is the recession and the slow recovery since then People reduced their health care spending during the recession that ended almost five years ago and cost increases have been subdued ever since And some other factors holding down health care cost increases may also reverse For instance Antos says theres been less innovation in medical devices and procedures in recent years and fewer new expensive blockbuster drugs Theres no reason to think that thats a permanent state of affairs and it certainly is no reason to think that thats a good state of affairs We do need better pharmaceuticals Antos says But Cutler who helped develop costcontrol measures in Massachusetts says there are forces in motion that could keep cost increases significantly lower than they have been historically They include limits on Medicare payments and other costcontainment elements of the Affordable Care Act My own personal sense is that at the moment the race is being won by the cost savings more than the cost increasing Cutler says And he says thats led him to believe theres a real chance that the countrys longterm finances can be brought under control If we see cost increases remain as low as they are now the health care problem would go from something that we have no idea how to address into something that we could address along the lines of Social Security Cutler says And theres broad agreement that Social Security could be made solvent with a mix of relatively small tax increases and benefit cuts But Antos is less optimistic that health care cost increases have been reined in enough to significantly reduce the threat of longterm budget deficits I think its possible I hope its true I think its too early to know he says Antos points to a recent report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services the official arbiters of health care cost projections It says more evidence is needed before concluding that health care cost increases have moderated for the long term
