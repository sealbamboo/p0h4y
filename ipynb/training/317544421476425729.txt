If you havent done your taxes yet   from HR Block might make you feel even more anxious The Affordable Care Act means big changes this year when you file your taxes says the young woman in the ad with a smug smile She then claims to have read all  pages of the law so she can offer you a solution We wanted more details about whether the federal law was really making this years taxes more difficult so we asked Meg Sutton the tax firms senior adviser for tax and health care services The big changes are really just filing that return she said And so getting into the office recording your income and your household size thats the biggest change youll see Except people have to do that every year So we asked if there are new forms people have to file this year because of the health care law No said Sutton When we pressed her she said the big change is in preparing for the new federal   that millions of Americans will be able to apply for to help them buy individual health insurance policies next year Because people can   for plans from the new health insurance marketplaces as early as October of this year a  return could come in handy The  tax return will be used to establish a baseline to determine your eligibility for a tax credit to pay for health care benefits Sutton said Eligibility for the new health insurance subsidies will be based on income and family size Information from  tax returns  the returns people are filing this year  should be automatically pulled up on a computer screen when people apply for the subsidies this fall But its just a baseline says Tara Straw of the advocacy group   which supports the Affordable Care Act Nothing in that return locks people into a certain income or a certain family composition that is unchangeable if its not representative of their actual situation in  Straw says What will actually determine whether people get a subsidy and how big it will be isnt what they report on their tax forms this year at all but how much they estimate theyll make in  That could be the same as whats on their tax form this year or it could be very different So when Straw sees the HR Block ad saying the Affordable Care Act means big changes this year when you file your taxes she says its fairly misleading Unfortunately right now with this ad it sounds like theyre just trying to drum up business by emphasizing complications she says A   shows twothirds of Americans   the health care law Straw acknowledges thats a problem Thats actually where companies like HR Block could be doing a real service if theyre actually using their outreach to the community to help educate people on the benefits says Straw HR Block says its doing that by offering all its customers a free health care and tax review this year that they say takes about five minutes They also have a   to how the law might affect different tax profiles But as far as filing any new tax forms related to the health care law those will come in April of
