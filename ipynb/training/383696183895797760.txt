Brain surgery is a dicey business Even the most experienced surgeons can damage healthy tissue while trying to root out tumors deep inside the brain Researchers from the University of Maryland are working on a solution and it sounds like something out of a scifi movie Theyre developing a tiny maggotlike robot that can crawl into brains and zap tumors from within The idea first came to   a neurosurgeon and professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore while he was watching TV He saw plastic surgeons use sterile maggots to remove damaged tissue from a patient It sounds strange but its a real thing Simard says And thats when he had the idea If I could train maggots to resect brain tumors I would he says I cant do that so robotic maggots are the next best thing He teamed up with   a roboticist at the University of Maryland in College Park and radiologist   to create a working prototype They call it MINIR  Minimally Invasive Neurosurgical Intracranial Robot The wormy multijointed prototype is about a halfinch wide which Simard says is half as the size of tools he uses now But Simard says what really sets   apart is that it works while the patient is inside an MRI scanner The surgeon can look at whats happening inside a patients brain without having to open it wide Its difficult for the naked eye to discern cancerous tissue from healthy tissue so surgeons depend on MRI scans to locate brain tumors So surgeons usually take a scan before operating But things can shift around as they work Thats where a robot that worked inside an MRI could help A surgeon might someday insert a small tube leading to the site of the tumor then send a robot crawling in The doctor would control the robot remotely while watching its progress on MRI scans This approach would be less invasive that traditional surgery and makes it easier for surgeons to avoid harming parts of the brain that control essential functions like speech and vision The project is funded by the National Institutes of Health So far Simard says theyve successfully tested the device in pig cadavers The researchers says theyll be ready test on humans within three to five years if all goes well Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon   who isnt involved in research says the project looks promising Ideally you want to minimize the collateral damage with brain surgery he says A neurosurgical robot is one way to do it Deepseated tumors are the hardest to treat By the time you get down to the tumor youve already injured the patient Quinones says And once youre there he says its hard to tell the difference between normal and pathological tissue I compensate with the use of a microscope he says He also takes MRI scans intermittently throughout the surgery But for the surgeon nothing beats being able to operate while the patient is inside an MRI Desai the teams engineer is experimenting with different materials and technologies to balance cost and function in the robot He expects that the final product will be disposable His biggest challenge is finding materials that are compatible with the strong magnetic fields of the MRI Some materials equipment can distort images Others pose safety hazards An electromagnetic motor will get pulled toward the MRI and could slice through brain tissue along the way Desai says Thats why were looking at alternative solutions Desais latest prototype uses a system of pulleys and cables but hes also looking into using a special type of nonmagnetic motor With the current prototype the surgeon can control the robots pulleys from outside the MRI But once he pins the mechanics down Desai says hell focus on developing a simpler system surgeons can use to make the robot do their bidding
