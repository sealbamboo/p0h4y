A day before the th anniversary of the LA Marathon is no time to change your shoes  if you are running But a couple of days later when the experience is fresh in your mind and your body starts healing the planning for No  should begin This review of innovative shoes which will appeal to a range of runners and shoe collectors is a good place to start  This trainer features a socklike upper and a bouncy midsole material called Boost that is made of  squashedtogether foam capsules  more than earlier versions  Almost everything  the comfort the looks the energy The front of your foot nests in a socklike woven upper your heel luxuriates in a pillowy gap that pampers your Achilles tendon Most of all the Boost foam makes you feel young providing a noticeable bounce that makes the shoe feel lighter than its moderate weight  ounces in mens size  Adidas claims the foam is so resilient that it wont stiffen up in the cold and breaks down much more slowly than typical foam thereby providing the same cushion at mile  as it did at mile  So in theory youll get twice the miles out of it knocking down the pricey costpermile  Besides the skyhigh price the thinness of the outsole makes me worry it will wear quickly negating the foams longevity   A lowprofile special edition made for the th anniversary of the LA Marathon has unique graphics The DFA refers to the  joints of the foot  The words Itd be cool to frame this along with your finishers medal LA Marathon Santa Monica  miles  Stadium to the Sea and West Hollywood are all printed somewhere on the forefoot upper Strangely so is March   even though the race is March  Someone at Asics wasnt paying attention as the dislikes will testify Not superlight for a racing shoe at  ounces in size   The shoe feels hard Compared with the Adidas it had much less cushion and flexibility     The trainer with the highest level of cushioning on the market Designed for heel strikers who worry about forceimpact injuries This new model has more rubber on the outsole and padding on the tongue than earlier Bondis  It makes me taller Ive lost an inch over the years and the inch pile of soft EVA heel cushioning about double that of the other shoes here got me back to college height and more Despite the bulk it is remarkably light  ounces in size  possibly making it marathonworthy for some Biomechanically correct types will like the minimal millimeter drop from the  mm heel to the  mm forefoot Diehard heel strikers will like the MegaRocker degree heel bevel which helps propel you through the gait cycle The extra cushioning is probably best for heavier runners who want to baby their aching joints  The upper is too stiff and narrow My Dplus width feet were suffocating The ground feel is nil as expected Being a minimalistwearing forefoot lander I felt kind of sluggish and unbalanced They are not cheap unless you absolutely need a lot of cushioning     This lightweight trainerracer has decent cushioning Fresh Foam refers to a design that uses concave and convex hexagonal blocks respectively on the medial and lateral sides of the midsole  Comfy superlight  ounces in size  and fast with good ground feel The Fresh Foam delivers a surprisingly robust cushion It has a bootiestyle stretchymesh forefoot with seamfree interior and attached tongue and it has won raves from the running magazines and fast runners with narrowtomedium width for its smooth feel and responsiveness While some mistakenly put this shoes foam in the same league as the muchheavier Adidas Boost it lacks the energizing bounce its shock absorption will be a treat for lightweight marathoners  The toe box cramped my little toes at first they got used to it but seemed to spill over the outside edge which made me feel unstable The narrowness was surprising for a shoe with the normally roomy New Balance nameplate Heavier people I include myself at  pounds will find this shoe too frail     This is the ultralight racing shoe that American Meb Keflezighi wore while winning last years Boston Marathon  Its not as plush bouncy and energizing as the Adidas but its comfy and very fast because of its feathery weight  ounces in a size  on my scale but Skechers claims  ounces in size  and a lively feel Its nice combination of cushioning and lowtotheground stability may be due to a plastic midfoot plate and inch thick Resalyte midsole foam which is dense and protective with a good springback The nearlyflat shoe has a  mm drop from heel to forefoot It cuts the weight with a seamless structureless onepiece mesh upper and a thin unpadded tongue The mesh thicker and less flexible than that of the heavier New Balance Zante lent the shoe a substantial feel and seemed to keep my foot in place Also it comes with a rare extra pair of laces  in fluorescent green  Its a bit lowvolume in the toe box my big toenails scraped the inside The marketing technobabble  GOimpulse sensors that offer flexibility and feedback  is a little grating The sensors are just  inch circles of harder rubber embedded in the foam sole so it doesnt wear out too quickly
