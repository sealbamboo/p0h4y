Like many other doctors across the country   a Dallas orthopedic surgeon recently made the switch from paper to electronic medical records This meant he no longer had to just take notes when he was examining a patient  he also had to put those notes into the computer as a permanent record I was really focused on just trying to get the information in and not really focusing on the patient anymore Ramnath says In fact he found he was spending an extra two to three hours every clinic just on electronic records So he hired medical scribe Connie Gaylan Acting a bit like a court reporter Gaylan shadows Ramnath at every appointment As the doctor examines a patient Gaylan sits quietly in the corner typing notes and speaking into a handheld microphone Once shes finished with the records she gives them to Ramnath to check and approve saving him hours of administrative work and allowing him to concentrate on his patients I would more than happily sacrifice a significant chunk of my income for the improved quality of life I have Ramnath says Medical scribes are in high demand nationally Any doctor who doesnt make the switch from paper to electronic records by  will face Medicare   and this deadline is fueling the demand  the countrys first scribe staffing company is on the second expansion of its Fort Worth Texas headquarters and has opened another office in Chicago   the companys CEO says the firm is growing by  to  percent every year In  PhysAssist had  scribes now it has  The other big scribing companies    and    each have thousands more and the demand keeps growing PhysAssist trains scribes from across the country every week in its Fort Worth mock emergency department where instructor Brandon Torres shows students the right way to fill out an electronic medical record There are thousands of record systems and scribes need to know how to put in the right billing codes and medical terminology at lightning speed Torres says its important not just to be able to multitask but also to be able to listen to multiple things at the same time Youre listening to the physician youre listening to the nurse youre listening to the patient Torres says And youre gathering all that information and presenting it back to the physician That last parts crucial The physician has to approve the scribes notes because ultimately the doctor is responsible for the record Medical scribes make  to  an hour Many of them are medical students who say they find it an invaluable experience But its not clear that scribes make things better for patients  with   in Washington DC points to one   done in an emergency department in New Jersey that found that doctors with scribes were able to see more patients on average  which means more money for the institution But that same study found that the amount of time a patient spent in the emergency department didnt decrease Medical scribing also raises some privacy concerns OMalley says Some patients may not like having an extra person in the exam room
