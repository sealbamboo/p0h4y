Righttodie campaigner Debbie Purdy who won a landmark ruling to clarify the law on assisted suicide has died The yearold from Bradford had lived with primary progressive multiple sclerosis MS for almost  years Ms Purdy had spent a year in the citys Marie Curie Hospice and had sometimes refused food She died on  December In  she won a ruling to get clarification on whether her husband Omar Puente would be prosecuted if he helped her to end her life Lord Falconer the former lord chancellor said Ms Purdys role as a campaigner against the law on assisted suicide was absolutely key and she had transformed the debate Mr Puente confirmed the death of his wife in a statement paying tribute to a much loved wife sister aunt and friend We would like to thank the Marie Curie Hospice in Bradford for the care the staff gave her which allowed her last year to be as peaceful and dignified as she wished he added David Ward Liberal Democrat MP for Bradford East where the hospice is situated said Debbie was a remarkable human being and despite her condition she was an ebullient character In her own words she said if she was allowed to die it would help her live Mr Ward said he would remember Ms Purdy for the great spirit she had and as a remarkably inspiring person Lesley Close a friend of Ms Purdy and patron of the group Dignity in Dying said Debbie was an amazing person Every moment of life was fun when you were with her Lord Pannick Debbie Purdys barrister who first met her in  at the start of her legal battle said Her body was already afflicted terribly by this awful disease she was in a wheelchair she was in great pain for much of the time But I dont think I have represented a more energetic client in my professional career In her final interview with BBC Look North Ms Purdy said the painful realities of her condition meant her life was unacceptable She said Its painful and its uncomfortable and its frightening and its not how I want to live If somebody could find a cure for MS I would be the first person in line Its not a matter of wanting to end my life its a matter of not wanting my life to be this Debbie Purdys landmark legal victory did not result in a change in the law but it forced the authorities to clarify what the legislation meant in practice Ms Purdy had sought assurance over whether her husband would be prosecuted if he helped her end her life In  the Law Lords ordered the Director of Public Prosecutions to specify when this might be the case after ruling the law was unclear That prompted Keir Starmer  the then director  to publish guidelines in February  setting out what was taken into consideration when weighing up a prosecution He said a range of factors should be taken into account including the motivations of the person assisting and the victims ability to reach a clear and informed decision about their suicide But it still remains an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt in England and Wales As a result of Ms Purdys battle five Law Lords ruled in  the Director of Public Prosecutions DPP must specify when a person might face prosecution for helping someone end their life Former DPP Keir Starmer went on to publish new guidelines in  But Ms Purdys condition deteriorated significantly and she was unable to go through with her plan to travel to Dignitas the Swiss assistedsuicide organisation She decided to enter the hospice and begin refusing food intermittently in December  I first met Debbie in October  when she was launching her High Court bid to clarify the law on assisted suicide Over the years I got to know her really well  She was an intelligent and witty woman very interested in news and current affairs I was lucky enough to film her at university debates church events and even concerts with her musician husband Omar  In June  Debbie telephoned me and asked me to visit her at home She told me she had decided to end her life I interviewed her the night before she went into the Marie Curie Hospice in Bradford She told me she was scared about refusing food but said her life had become unbearable  We stayed in touch during her year in the hospice She was angry and knew that her choice would cause further debate  I last saw her on  December and she told me it was agonising how long it was taking for her to die She will be greatly missed
