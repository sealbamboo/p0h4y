Dengue  aka breakbone fever  has been a tough nut to crack when it comes to making a vaccine The problem is that the mosquitoborne virus comes in four flavors or strains Vaccines that work on one strain havent worked well on the others Now scientists at Imperial College London have discovered a potential way around this problem Immunologist   and his colleagues have found molecules  specifically antibodies  in human blood that stop all forms of dengue The molecules offer a road map for developing a simple vaccine that works on all types of dengue at the same time the team   Monday in the journal   Scientists really didnt think that was possible before this study Screaton told reporters last week Dengue sickens millions of people globally the World Health Organization   The virus threatens to spread to Europe and the US Both Florida and Texas have experienced outbreaks Since theres no cure for dengue a vaccine is critical to stop the growing threat Screaton says Really theres a great deal of hope placed on vaccines for dengue Screaton said I think that without a vaccine this disease is not going to be controlled The strategy so far has been to engineer a separate vaccine for each strain of dengue  which means four times the effort and four times the roadblocks The results havent been great Take for instance Sanofi Pasteurs vaccine The pharmaceutical company spent  years  and a billion dollars    that includes separate proteins from all four types of dengue After three shots the experimental vaccine reduced the risk of getting two types of dengue by about  to  percent in a large clinical trial in Latin America Thats not too bad But for the other two types of dengue the protection was only cut in half to about  to  percent The vaccine did reduce the number of severe dengue cases by about  percent In most cases dengue causes severe flulike symptoms with a high fever a bad headache and extreme pain in joints and bones hence the nickname breakbone fever But in a small percentage of cases people get a more severe form of the disease They have leaky blood vessels severe bleeding and organ failure This form of dengue is fatal about  percent of the time if left untreated People are more likely to get a severe case of dengue the second time they catch the virus Screaton said Recovering from one type of dengue doesnt give you protection from the other types Instead it might make the second infection worse Something about the immune response to the first contact with dengue primes you for a worst outcome Screaton said Thats another reason why having a vaccine that works on all forms of dengue is important he said To find a way to stop all dengue viruses at once Screaton and his team got blood samples from seven people infected with the virus Then they scoured the blood for powerful dengue antibodies that take down all four strains The goal now is to build a vaccine that triggers these antibodies To do that Screaton and his team figured out how the antibodies work They stick to a weak spot on the virus surface Now the researchers can use that weak spot  which is simply two viral proteins  to make a vaccine It will of course take years to develop and even more time to test it in animals and people
