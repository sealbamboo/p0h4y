Think you do just fine on five or six hours of shuteye Chances are you are among the many millions who unwittingly shortchange themselves on sleep Research shows that most people require seven or eight hours of sleep to function optimally Failing to get enough sleep night after night can compromise your health and may even shorten your life From infancy to old age the effects of inadequate sleep can profoundly affect memory learning creativity productivity and emotional stability as well as your physical health According to sleep specialists at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic among others a number of bodily systems are negatively affected by inadequate sleep the heart lungs and kidneys appetite metabolism and weight control immune function and disease resistance sensitivity to pain reaction time mood and brain function Poor sleep is also a risk factor for depression and substance abuse especially among people with posttraumatic stress disorder according to Anne Germain associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh People with PTSD tend to relive their trauma when they try to sleep which keeps their brains in a heightened state of alertness Dr Germain is studying what happens in the brains of sleeping veterans with PTSD in hopes of developing more effective treatments for them and for people with lesser degrees of stress that interfere with a good nights sleep The elderly are especially vulnerable Timothy H Monk who directs the Human Chronobiology Research Program at Western Psychiatric heads a fiveyear federally funded study of circadian rhythms sleep strength stress reactivity brain function and genetics among the elderly The circadian signal isnt as strong as people get older he said He is finding that many are helped by standard behavioral treatments for insomnia like maintaining a regular sleep schedule avoiding lateinday naps and caffeine and reducing distractions from light noise and pets It should come as no surprise that myriad bodily systems can be harmed by chronically shortened nights Sleep affects almost every tissue in our bodies said Dr Michael J Twery a sleep specialist at the National Institutes of Health Several studies have linked insufficient sleep to weight gain Not only do night owls with shortchanged sleep have more time to eat drink and snack but levels of the hormone leptin which tells the brain enough food has been consumed are lower in the sleepdeprived while levels of ghrelin which stimulates appetite are higher In addition metabolism slows when ones circadian rhythm and sleep are disrupted if not counteracted by increased exercise or reduced caloric intake this slowdown could add up to  extra pounds in a year The bodys   which may ultimately result in Type  diabetes In one study healthy young men prevented from sleeping more than four hours a night for six nights in a row ended up with insulin and blood sugar levels like those of people deemed prediabetic The risks of cardiovascular diseases and stroke are higher in people who sleep less than six hours a night Even a single night of inadequate sleep can cause daylong elevations in blood pressure in people with hypertension   and raised levels of inflammatory factors linked to heart disease In terms of cardiovascular disease sleeping too much may also be risky Higher rates of heart disease have been found among women who sleep more than nine hours nightly The risk of cancer may also be elevated in people who fail to get enough sleep A Japanese study of nearly  women ages  to  found that those who slept less than six hours a night were more likely to develop breast cancer than women who slept longer The increased risk may result from diminished secretion of the sleep hormone melatonin Among participants in the Nurses Health Study Eva S Schernhammer of Harvard Medical School found   A study of  people by researchers at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland found an   Children can also experience hormonal disruptions from inadequate sleep Growth hormone is released during deep sleep it not only stimulates growth in children but also boosts muscle mass and repairs damaged cells and tissues in both children and adults Dr Vatsal G Thakkar a psychiatrist affiliated with New York University recently described evidence associating inadequate sleep with an   In one study  percent of children with sleep problems had symptoms of the disorder but not the disorder During sleep the body produces cytokines cellular hormones that help fight infections Thus short sleepers may be more susceptible to everyday infections like colds and flu In a study of  healthy men and women Sheldon Cohen and colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University found that   when exposed to a coldcausing virus than were people who slept eight or more hours Some of the most insidious effects of too little sleep involve mental processes like learning memory judgment and problemsolving During sleep new learning and memory pathways become encoded in the brain and adequate sleep is necessary for those pathways to work optimally People who are well rested are better able to learn a task and more likely to remember what they learned The cognitive decline that so often accompanies aging may in part result from chronically poor sleep With insufficient sleep thinking slows it is harder to focus and pay attention and people are more likely to make poor decisions and take undue risks As you might guess these effects can be disastrous when operating a motor vehicle or dangerous machine In driving tests sleepdeprived people perform as if drunk and no amount of caffeine or cold air can negate the ill effects At your next health checkup tell your doctor how long and how well you sleep Be honest Sleep duration and quality can be as important to your health as your blood pressure and cholesterol level
