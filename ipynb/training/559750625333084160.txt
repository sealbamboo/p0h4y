My professional athlete clientele are plagued by prolonged sitting as they travel from game to game They also end up sitting a lot during downtime at hotels and in the offseason  So how can we limit our deathbysitting risk Sit smarter with yoga  Just as yoga is a practice based on mindfulness so is sitting smarter Thats why I coach my clients to become more mindful of their sitting habits Notice your posture Be aware of your breath And know when its time to move  Of course awareness is only the first step Here are some quick easy yogabased tips to give your sitting a healthy overhaul Place your feet hipdistance apart with your knees at hip level Keeping an even pressure through the inside arches and outside heels of your feet helps maintain neutral knee and hip position Avoid crossing your legs or ankles which can stifle blood flow and cause swelling  Evenly distribute your weight through your sitting bones the bony parts of your pelvis you can feel making contacting with your seat Our feet and knees indicate and affect our hip position so avoid letting a foot or knee drift forward taking the hips out of balance  Maintain the natural curves of your spine  dont try to straighten it Your midback curve is naturally kyphotic which means hump in Greek Your low back is lordotic so it curves into some extension Keep spinal curves soft not exaggerated  Your chest should be open with your shoulders sitting evenly Concentrate on pulling the bottom points of your shoulder blades downward rather than inward Its a common mistake to squeeze your shoulder blades together and puff your chest out which lifts your rib cage arches your midback and decreases your ability to breathe deeply Align your head and neck between your shoulders rather than lurching into text neck The action of engaging muscles to draw the shoulder blades down in point No  helps position your head properly by initiating a muscular action called reciprocal inhibition which turns off inhibits the overactive neck upper back and chest muscles that tend to pull your neck forward  How you breathe affects how you sit  Breathing quality dictates rib cage position which affects your shoulder and chest position If your breathing is shallow it feeds poor posture  The diaphragm is not just a breathing muscle its also a core postural muscle that attaches to your lumbar spine low back and runs through your hip flexors Because it has a longer thicker attachment to your spine on the right when its dysfunctional it can pull you into sitting more on your right side leading to andor aggravating sciatica Ouch  For the postural reasons above  as well as increased oxygenation and stress relief  practice deep diaphragmatic breathing whenever youre seated  Focus on inhaling through your nose into the bottom and back of your lungs Exhale slowly and fully internally rotating the bottom ribs and releasing the rib cage downward by engaging core muscles internal obliques and transverse abdominus Exhaling like this feels fantastic and also promotes lowback stability  Its not a matter of standing versus sitting Studies also point to health dangers of too much standing Instead alternate your position frequently According to   former NASA director of life sciences and the author of Sitting Kills Moving Heals its ideal to change your posture every  to  minutes throughout the day Healthy muscle function is the only way to support good posture and alleviate the pain caused by bad sitting practices Thats why I recommend practicing specific yoga poses to reduce tension and help reset postural alignment Poses that address hip back and upperbody tension are especially helpful for counteracting the effects of sitting  These are two good examples  is a basic standing yoga pose that lengthens the upper body while stretching hip flexors and stabilizing the low back From standing step back into a lunge but drop your back heel and point your toes out  degrees Keep your back leg straight with your forward knee flexed above your ankle Lift your arms overhead shoulderdistance apart Hold for three to five long deep breaths Repeat on the other side  stretches hip flexors while releasing chest neck and upperback tension From a kneeling lunge with your left foot forward place your right hand on your left thigh Reach your left arm behind you with your forearm and palm turned up Look back over your shoulder as you draw your right shoulder blade down relaxing the muscles of your neck and chest Hold for three to five long deep breaths Repeat on the other side Note The reachback twist can be done sans lunge  simply from standing or sitting  Mindfulness is paramount to sitting healthier but its understandable that we disengage during sedentary activities such as watching TV reading or working at a desk Its helpful to set a timer to remind you to keep your sitting in check  Technology  such as computers tablets and smartphones  might be a big reason were in our seats so much but it can also help  There are some innovative posturecorrecting apps such as Posture Trainer and wearable technology such as Lumo Lift Im actually on the advisory board of   creator of the worlds first smart stool to monitor your realtime posture and cue you via an app to apply all the principles I outlined above
