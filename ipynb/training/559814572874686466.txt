A project that could point the way to a new class of drugs to treat influenza won the top prize Tuesday night at the Intel Science Talent Search netting yearold Eric S Chen a cool  Chen a senior at Canyon Crest Academy in San Diego combined chemistry biology and computer modeling to find compounds capable of blocking an enzyme called endonuclease which the flu virus needs to spread Despite taking home the grand prize at the   and the top individual honor at the   Chen said he didnt expect to come in first at the   I had no idea I was going to win   his hometown newspaper the San Diego UnionTribune after the awards were announced in Washington DC If I had placed between fifth and th I would have been incredibly happy Chen has   of   an assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC San Diego since the summer of  The lab is down the street from the Salk Institute established by Chens idol     a molecular biologist at the UCSD School of Medicine has also advised him on his flu research Chen has said his interest in influenza was sparked by the   of a deadly neverbeforeseen virus that came to be known as swine flu The HN strain  a combination of viruses that had come from pigs birds and humans  killed more than  people worldwide the first US cases were in San Diego and Imperial counties Winning the Intel science competition may help get Chens research noticed by the drug companies he would need to turn his research into real medicine Hopefully we can work together to solve these problems and get these discoveries onto the market he told the UT Finding a cure for the flu while finishing high school might sound like enough to keep your hands full But Chen still finds time to serve as copresident of his high school fencing club he qualified for the  Junior Olympic Fencing Championships He also plays piano tutors Mandarinspeaking senior citizens on basic computer use and runs a math contest for middle schoolers Somehow he has managed to stay humble in the face of so many achievements The way youre probably feeling about him is the way he felt about the other  Intel finalists he met in Washington A lot of the other students they blew me away he said Not only their projects but just how smart they were how they could think differently than the average person In the plusyear history of the Science Talent Search founded in  as the Westinghouse Science Talent Search seven participants have gone on to win Nobel Prizes and  won Genius grants from the MacArthur Foundation among other honors Chens prize money will help pay for college though he hasnt yet decided whether to attend Harvard or Stanford according to the UT He says he may pursue a career in academics or start a company that uses technology to tackle world problems as he put it in his   Other winners include  Kevin Lee of Irvine whose mathematical model of a beating heart could lead to better treatments for arrhythmia  William Henry Kuszmaul of Lexington Mass for a project on the mathematics of modular enumeration that could solve problems in computer science bioinformatics and computational biology  Joshua Abraham Meier of Teaneck NJ for finding a gene that causes stem cells to age rapidly  Natalie Ng of Cupertino who developed a tool that predicts when breast cancer cells will spread through the body  Aron Coraor of Huntington NY who studied a mineral on the moon  Zarin Ibnat Rahman of Brookings SD who investigated how screen time affects sleep stress and learning in teens  Anand Srinivasan of Roswell Ga who developed a computer program that makes sense of patterns in DNA data  John Anthony Clarke of Syosset NY who studied Xray emissions from Jupiter  Shaun Datta of North Potomac Md who made discoveries about the interactions of nuclear matter    and like   on Facebook
