This one is a bit of a splurge, because it's individual instruction. But in my search for ways to develop good posture to counteract all that screen time, several people have recommended Gyrotonic as something that is useful no matter your fitness level. It's usually done one-on-one, sometimes in Pilates or other studios. My session was with Deandra Lee, who teaches in her own studio.. The work is done on a big piece of equipment with many moving parts, all adjustable for your condition. It looks pretty intimidating, even potentially like torture, but my workout felt great..  Lee has a bright, cozy studio set up behind her house. Her clients do other kinds of workouts as well as those on the Gyrotonic Expansion System. And she also offers massage therapy. She is friendly but not too chatty, happy to answer any questions about the workout..  The Gyrotonic pulley tower was created by a former dancer. It's no surprise then that the workout is continual motion and rhythmic, elongating the muscles as you arch and reach and twist. Lee adjusts the pulleys and other bits of the tower to fit your body and ability. The session includes lots of stretching and strength work from resistance weights..  It's up to you, since you are the only student. This is definitely not your jumping, competitive, high-sweat experience. Instead, it feels like you are treating your body to the sorts of movements it longs for after many days at a desk or behind the wheel..  Until March 31, Lee has a new-client special of $65. Otherwise, $80 per session with packages available.
