A Canadian study has challenged the use of corn and safflower oils as healthy substitutes for saturated animal fats saying the oils may increase the risk of heart disease In a paper published Monday in the   researchers concluded that polyunsaturated vegetable oils that were rich in omega linoleic acid but relatively poor in omega alphalinolenic acid were not associated with beneficial effects on heart health Specifically authors said a review of recent research suggested that though omega linoleic acid lowered serum cholesterol levels it also seemed to increase the risk of coronary artery diseases Study authors Richard Bazinet a professor of nutrition at the University of Toronto and Dr Michael Chu a heart surgeon at the London Cardiac Institute in Ontario said it was unclear why the oils increased health risks However they said it might have to do with the chemical process known as oxidation The detrimental effects of linoleic acid were seen in participants who were smokers and those who consumed alcohol people likely to be under increased oxidative stress the authors wrote In Canada corn and safflower oil are used in foods such as mayonnaise creamy dressings margarine and chips The federal Food Directorate allows the food industry to label products with corn and safflower oil as healthy replacements for saturated fats Study authors are now asking the government to reconsider its labeling eligibility The authors note that canola oil and soybean oil which are consumed to a far greater degree are associated with health benefits Those vegetable oils contain more omega alphalinoleic acids which lower cholesterol and lower the risk of coronary artery disease
