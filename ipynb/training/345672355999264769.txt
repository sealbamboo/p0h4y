The da Vinci surgical robot is so precise promotional videos  Its so popular that most socalled keyhole hysterectomies are done using the machine and its used in four out of five operations to remove the prostate according to the nonprofit ECRI Institute But a series of lawsuits threaten to burst da Vincis highflying bubble claiming that a very lowtech problem  wear and tear  can spoil the benefits of using a remote automated system injuring patients and forcing the invasive surgery they were trying to avoid It all boils down to microscopic cracks in the protective covers insulating some of the tools that da Vinci uses which could possibly allow electricity to leak out and burn patients Whats at issue is whether anyones actually been burned and whether its the companys fault The cases promise to be complicated and difficult to sort out The lawsuits allege that da Vincis maker Intuitive Surgical hasnt done nearly enough to correct the problem or to warn hospitals and doctors But the company told NBC News its tested its devices over and over and not found a serious problem and at least one team of doctors who flagged the problem say they havent seen much evidence that patients are being harmed By many accounts Intuitive Surgicals da Vinci Surgical System is an effective option for anyone eligible for minimally invasive surgery for a range of problems from prostate cancer to fibroids Its made the company hundreds of millions of dollars sent its stock soaring and changed the look of many surgical suites The company says it has sold more than  systems to more than  hospitals despite its nearly  million per unit cost The system is a remotecontrol robotic device operated by a surgeon who can see the action on a magnified screen Its a nextgeneration version of an endoscope a device with both camera and snippers that can be sent into the body via a tiny incision for surgery What surgeons like about da Vinci are its precise controls that allow them to use four robotic arms that bend and twist like their own hands and wrists  only steadier The system also employs some fairly common technology using an electrical current to cauterize as it cuts tissue and its here that some lawsuits allege it has caused some substantial injury They say microscopic cracks in the casing holding the scissors attachment can let electrical current leak out and potentially burn tissue  just as holes in the insulation on an extension cord can burn carpets and cause fires While these devices are only supposed to be used  times before they are thrown out the cracks may develop quickly testing shows The part of the arm that is prone to the cracks is out of the magnified view of the surgeon so he or she may not see telltale sparks or evidence of the tissue being burned centimeters away according to several research studies published on the issue You can have a surgeon operating with this arm that might have been used five times and without the surgeon seeing it  you could have an injury to the bowel says Dr Francois Blaudeau a gynecologist in Alabama who has been trained on the da Vinci and who is the lead plaintiffs attorney That patient could be sent home  and two days later could come back and have a bowel perforation Blaudeau added in a telephone interview We have cases from all over the country On May  Intuitive issued an Urgent Medical Device Notification to its customers about the Monopolar Curved Scissors MCS or Hot Shears  one of the devices deployed on one of the four robotic arms The MCS may develop microcracks near the scissor end of the shaft which could create a pathway for electrosurgical energy to leak to tissue The microcracks result from variations in the manufacturing process of the shaft and first appear after users reprocess the instruments the company said in a statement To date in over one million surgeries with these instruments the Company has no confirmed evidence of patient injury attributable to this issue  The notification says Intuitive has received only one complaint of an injury associated with the use of an MCS monopolar curved scissors instrument that was later found to have microcracks however laboratory testing did not detect any energy leakage from this instrument  The company says it told the US Food and Drug Administration which has been investigating the reports of problems Intuitive gives instructions for how to avoid injuries and advises that all surgeons check out the whole area after performing an operation to make sure no tissue got burned or otherwise damaged In August  the company also recalled the tip covers for the scissors A spokeswoman for the FDA could not comment on the issue but said the agency was aware of two Class II recalls by Intuitive  these are recalls of products in which the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote The FDA cautions that a report of an adverse event does not necessarily mean that the device complained about caused the injury A spokeswoman for Intuitive Angela Wonson told NBC News the company will ship replacement devices to all da Vinci owners over the next two to four weeks  Why did you wait until after you got the lawsuit to replace it Blaudeau asks  Intuitives Curet responds We are always looking at our system and our instruments to see how we can improve the safety I wouldnt say we changed anything based on these lawsuits Blaudeau points to several studies done since  that suggest there could be a problem with the devices  Dr Mario Leitao of Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center in New York and colleagues published a study in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology detailing the cases of three women burned by cracked robotic instruments Intuitive Surgical is currently evaluating a new and improved silicone scissors tip cover to address this issue they wrote In another study Dr Mercedes Espada and colleagues at Hospital Quiron in Madrid Spain studied both robotic and conventional laparoscopic equipment used at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona They found insulation failure in  percent of robotic instruments and  percent of conventional laparoscopic instruments They said insulation failure  meaning cracks that let the electrical current escape  were common in all laparoscopic procedures They are associated with a high mortality rate because of subsequent intestinal perforation and delayed recognition they wrote in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology  But the robot seems safer they said Because robotic instruments are discarded after  uses they have a lower potential for insulation failure than reusable laparoscopic instruments they added Dr Rosanne Kho a gynecologic surgeon at Mayo said the leaks show up in the lab but not in actual surgery We have operated on close to  patients now with the robot since  Kho said in a telephone interview As best we know there is only one possible case where this may be the cause of complications But we dont know for sure The one case which involved a patient whose bowel was damaged prompted the review Kho says It seems that outside of the surgical arena we found multiple insulation failures but it does not seem to translate to clinical outcomes she said She says all surgeons who use the electrified equipment know or should know about the issue We are very aware of this possible complication Kho said We are not currently thinking that the robot would inflict more complications compared to the laparoscope Dr Myriam Curet chief medical advisor at Intuitive said the company took note of the studies We repeated some of the testing and could not demonstrate some of the issues Curet said in a telephone interview We did extensive testing she added In one test if the surgeon mistakenly lifted the instrument away from the tissue and then accidently touched a bit of nearby bowel the bowel tissue did become discolored as if burned So the company issued the May  warning We felt that the risk was very low but nonetheless wanted to let our surgeons know about it she said At least two of the cases against Intuitive have been settled out of court Blaudeau handled one filed by Patricia Mayfield of Butler Ala who alleged she developed a painful abscess after having a hysterectomy done using a da Vinci device in  Mayfield then  had to have additional surgery Her suit alleged that Intuitive knew she could be burned by the device but didnt warn patients or surgeons and overpromoted the device Three other cases are pending two in Alabama and one in California says Blaudeau Gwendolyn Jones of Ethelsville Ala says she was permanently injured during a hysterectomy while Charles Whitlow of Cusseta Ala says he was permanently and seriously injured while having his prostate removed by the device  Michelle Zarick of Sacramento had a hysterectomy in  when she was  and says she didnt start feeling ill until five weeks after the surgery Her intestines spilled out of a hole in her vagina and she required extensive surgery Blaudeau says no trial date has been set in that case Intuitive is contesting all of the lawsuits disputing it is liable for the injuries Like most companies that get sued Intuitive isnt commenting directly on the litigation
