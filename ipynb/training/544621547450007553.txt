Orange Calif  Nick Meza  recently had another fiveday round of   at the outpatient clinic here at Childrens Hospital of Orange County Usually those days drag for Nick an Eagle Scout with a flashing grin a hunger for conversation and  Like most patients who get intravenous medication at a pediatric clinic Nick typically receives treatment in a small curtained cubicle with hospitalgreen walls outdated video games that are often broken tiny TV monitors and dividers that dont muffle hallway clatter or the wails of a child in the next cubicle But now Nick whose baseball cap doesnt disguise his gleaming bald head emerges from his cubicle holding his IV pole He saunters down the hall toward velvety black curtains Parting them he slips inside and eases into a reclining chair Adrenalized thumping music fills the makeshift space called the Infusionarium Roiling closeups of extreme sports spring across four highdefinition monitors each fivefeet tall skateboarding stunts parachuteskiing kayaking over waterfalls Nick is entranced After a while theres a beep on his IV The infusion is finished He is oblivious Thats crazy Nick shouts at racecars careening across the monitors This is awesome According to the National Cancer Institute nearly  new cases of   will have been diagnosed this year in infants and children up to  years old On any given day thousands of these young patients are receiving chemotherapy at outpatient infusion clinics Children are also treated with infusions for other illnesses including       and immune disorders Particularly for a child such visits can be among the most physically and emotionally exhausting of a grueling regimen that can go on for years After needles are inserted children are tethered to a pole and bags of fluid for up to eight hours fear loneliness and anxiety seeping into their bodies More profoundly such visits are insistent reminders that they are sick and different not like friends they may have just seen the day before at school The longterm impact can leave some patients with posttraumatic stress It can be horrific said   medical director of the   at the childrens hospital here We should be doing better psychosocial work with them throughout their cancer experience so they dont feel like victims Now as fiveyear survival rates for some pediatric cancers climb to  percent medical teams are paying more attention to making outpatient treatment less formidable and more responsive to the patients psychological needs Thats no small challenge when patients at a pediatric clinic range in age from newborn to  years old To calm and distract them researchers have tried aromatherapy teaching patients selfhypnosis having them make music CDs and giving them candy before medication Some clinics are being redesigned to encourage patients especially reclusive teenagers to be more social The infusion clinic at   in Fort Worth Tex now includes play areas for younger children and long tables for teenagers to do their homework and watch TV together If teenagers want to document their cancer treatment the   gives them cameras to use Its outpatient infusion clinic which reopened this fall features a large lightfilled space with activity tables and clusters of treatment chairs We want to make sure they dont lose their childhood said Lisa Scherber director of patient and family programs The teenagers can stay together but they can also enjoy watching the yearolds do silly stuff We intended the space to help them feel Im not alone in this  The Infusionarium is the Childrens Hospital of Orange Countys latest effort to normalize the arduous visits Dr Sender had long wanted patients to have some positive associations with treatment to feel more complete and whole If he ever needed chemotherapy himself he said he would want to lose himself in a tranquil enjoyable environment Could I get my infusion in an aquarium He put the question to Roger Holzberg a former creative director and vice president at Disney Imagineering and also a former cancer patient In July Mr Holzberg installed the Infusionarium infusion  aquarium Its black curtains invite patients to peek inside where pinlights woven into the fabric twinkle like starlight With the communal feeling of a cozy theater it has room for four treatment chairs and seating for visitors  an ad hoc area intended to make a permanent difference It offers patients a menu of ageappropriate selections allowing them to be happily distracted engage with one another or connect with friends and family The treatment chairs provide access to five broadcast channels including social media allowing patients to Skype check Facebook video games and movies To refine the Infusionariums offerings Mr Holzberg interviewed patients Younger boys he found preferred the Gene Wilder version of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory over animated films like Cars Mr Holzberg surmised that they wanted realistic entryways into an escapist world The live action helps connect them to real emotions he said Some teenage boys however wanted their escape in extreme sports Conversely the younger girls choice Frozen hands down Dr Sender and Mr Holzberg also asked patients If you could be treated anywhere but a hospital where would it be In the sky soaring like a bird some replied Underwater said others So the Infusionarium offers sensory immersive selections like The Living Sea The Infusionarium which cost about  has another transporting feature live feeds Recently young patients with IV poles and their relatives crowded into the space for a talk with staff at the Monterey Bay Aquarium some  miles north A nursemanager Allison Langdon distributed questions for the children to ask aquarium guides This is to help the kids get started Ms Langdon said Most of them havent been in school for quite a while As sea otters gamboled on one monitor a yearold receiving chemotherapy for a   was too shy to read her question She handed it to Nick who smiled and read it aloud Technology is not the only way the center engages patients Like most pediatric hospitals it employs therapists known as child life specialists Christy Campos tools include a soothing voice as well as finger paints crayons and Scrabble When a sick child is having a bad day Ms Campo and the patient may draw an archerystyle target on a whiteboard label each circle with a complaint and then with waterfilled syringes take gleeful aim But such activities may not work for teenagers and young adults Robert B Noll a psychologist who is chairman of the behavioral science committee of the   a national consortium noted that cancer confounds normal   when part of your mission is to go off and do stupid things he said But instead Now I need my mom and dad  If technology such as that used in the Infusionarium can be harnessed to help teenagers express themselves he said he is all for it But like all teenagers these patients both want to assert their individuality and long to be just like everyone else The Infusionarium gives them a cool place to hang out with one another We want to help them realize theyre all struggling with the same issues said Dr Heather Hawthorne an oncologist at the Orange County hospital If you can improve that you can improve their whole cancer treatment You take kids who would have crumbled and fallen to their disease and instead helped them use it to become strong resilient people  Some adolescent patients intuitively seize the opportunity to become role models Nick Meza made  lap desks for sick children to use as crafts tables finally earning his Eagle Scout rank When there are no teenagers in the Infusionarium he teaches younger patients how to sharpen their Xbox skills Anecdotally staff members here have noted that patients who use the Infusionarium ask for less medication for nausea anxiety and   The hospital is conducting a randomized trial to see whether the facilitys distractions have a measurable impact Symptoms can be subjective Dr Hawthorne said For some the anxiety of coming here is so strong that the patients get very worked up They may label it nausea whether they have it or not Because of the Infusionariums growing popularity traffic jams build as patients with competing interests from teenagers to the littles the nurses affectionate nickname for the youngest ones clamor to use it On a recent afternoon it was finally Matthew Cobbs turn He had been waiting since  am Matthew  has a rare genetic disorder that has required  operations so far Because he has no resistance to infection every three weeks he needs a sixhour protective infusion Matthew used to sob on nights before treatment said his father Kenneth Cobb The boy didnt want his siblings to accompany him He hated the cramped cubicle Now Matthew looks forward to treatment Matthew and his brother Micah  ran into the Infusionarium grabbing controls for an Xbox game The boys whooped as Matthew mask over mouth bounded around the treatment chairs an IV pole wobbling in his wake Micah makes sure he finishes his homework so he can come with Matthew on infusion days Mr Cobb said Eventually Matthews IV stand beeped The infusion had ended A nurse glided in to disconnect the IV If you cant stay still Matthew she said Ill have to press pause  One more level Dad Matthew asked Mr Cobb smiled When they play Xbox in the Infusionarium its brother time he said Matthew and Micah are always on a team together fighting against the same villain
