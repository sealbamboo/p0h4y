The idea that alcohol consumption might be good for our health is not a new one and a welter of studies comparing nondrinkers health with that of drinkers has inspired hope among those who imbibe that its true But a new study of people older than  largely scotches that hope Unless youre a woman over  alcohol consumption is unlikely to forestall your death a group of British researchers has found For these older women they add the health benefits of alcohol are not enormous but drinkers were less likely to die during a followup period of between six and  years The same study initially returned findings that men between the ages of  and  might reap a small benefit from drinking alcohol But those apparent benefits evaporated when the researchers scrubbed from their nondrinking reference group all those who used to drink but have stopped This strange twist does more than disappoint middleaged men eager to believe that alcohol makes them more robust It also casts doubt on many studies that have concluded that drinkers are healthier than those who dont imbibe It turns out that former drinkers who may have quit because they became ill or were recovering alcoholics are a much lesshealthy group than people who simply never drank at all But researchers often lump these former drinkersÂ  together with people who have always been teetotalers the authors of the current study estimate that more than half of those who call themselves nondrinkers are misclassified as people who never drank The inclusion of these lesshealthy former drinkers makes the average health of nondrinkers look poorer In comparison those who consume alcohol tend to look healthier In the current study when these former drinkers were expunged from the comparisongroup of teetotalers the nondrinking group suddenly looked healthier And the bar for showing alcohols health benefits rose The apparent benefits of alcoholat least for men tovanished  Tuesday in the journal BMJ Open the study suggests that many studies finding health benefits from alcohol consumption suffer from the same fatal flaw The benefits of alcohol consumption therefore have generally been overstated in recent research But lets get back to those older ladies In the current study compared to women over  who were lifelong teetotalers they were  to  less likely to die during the study period And those health benefits did not significantly vary with the amount women drank those who claimed they drank two or fewer drinks per month were just as protected against death from any cause as those who drank  or even  units of alcohol per week The authors warn that older drinkers are more likely to have health conditions and to take medicine for them that impair their ability to metabolize alcohol That puts this group of people at greater risk from drinking alcohol Even the finding that alcohol consumption benefits older women they caution may be the result of selection bias wherein the group of women polled for this study were somehow unusually healthy
