 Im flying soon What is the risk of contracting Ebola on a flight Not high Top Ebola experts have said they would not expect to be infected even if they were sitting next to another passenger with Ebola  unless that passenger actually vomited or bled on them   the LiberianAmerican who brought the virus to Nigeria in July was so sick he had to be helped off the plane in Lagos He had vomited while on board There were about  passengers on the plane according to Nigerian health authorities and not one of them got infected  Isnt the virus airborne if a sneeze can move it three feet What is the likelihood that Ebola will mutate into an airborne virus  Although both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention take the position that Ebola is not transmitted through the air scientists are publicly battling on   and   over whether it is possible in rare cases  or could become possible if the virus mutates 
 Also in   rhesus monkeys shipped from the Philippines to a government research lab in Reston Va   of a variant of Ebola that does not harm humans Ultimately to stop the outbreak all  monkeys in the building were killed Some scientists who worked there believe the virus spread between cages and perhaps even between rooms when monkeys sneezed or coughed There are two kinds of airborne transmission An infectious dose of measles smallpox or chickenpox virus can be contained in a droplet small enough to hang in the air so the next person to walk through that sneeze cloud catches it or the disease transmits through ventilation systems Influenza is thought to need bigger doses in larger droplets that fly as far as six feet but then fall to the floor No human airborne transmission of Ebola has been confirmed even though there have been multiple outbreaks in Africa since  and many crowded places  like minibus taxis  providing opportunities If Ebola  transmitted like influenza experts point out   would echo the spread pattern of the   and by now there would be millions of cases around the globe Ebola does not typically cause sneezing or coughing and saliva does not normally build up large viral loads until late in the disease But because patients can cough vomitus or blood  or vomit violently caregivers routinely wear masks and goggles No one can say exactly what the likelihood is that the virus will mutate to definitively become airborne but it is not thought likely No virus has ever been known to change its mode of transmission HIV mutates incredibly rapidly  as much in one day as flu does in a year according to CDC scientists and HIV has not become airborne Since Ebola is good at finding hosts it is under no great Darwinian pressure to change On the contrary since human Ebola victims die so fast that they cant spread it to many others the more likely change is for the virus to become milder so victims live longer Airborne viruses have surface proteins that attach to cells in the nose and throat Imagine throwing magnetized BBs into a castiron pipe all would stick Ebola lacking those proteins is like marbles falling down the pipe into the gut where it attaches It may take a lot of mutation to do the equivalent of changing a marble into a magnetic BB
