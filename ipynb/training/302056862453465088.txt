When the Xray was invented people clamored to get one Not for any medical reason but just to see what was typically hidden inside their bodies Something like that seems to be happening with DNA sequencing technology First it was companies offering to sequence peoples genomes Now its learning all about your microbiome the collection of microorganisms living on and in your body Peoples fascination with their inner workings may provide a new way for scientists to raise money for basic research Just ask the folks at   and   Both are basic science projects aimed at understanding how microbiomes influence health And in return for funding from individuals both will provide donors with an analysis of the bacteria in their very own digestive tract Using a website called   to crowd fund the uBiome and American Gut projects have together raised more than  Crowd funding in case youre unfamiliar it is accomplished by posting a project on a website like   setting a fundraising target and asking people to donate Lets say youre an electronic band from New York and you need money to make a new album  you could crowd fund Or you have a bakery and you need some dough to buy a new oven  you could crowd fund Crowd funding for those kinds of projects has been going on for several years Crowd funding for science though is fairly new Jessica Richman one of the cofounders of uBiome says she and her colleagues chose to crowd fund their project rather than use more traditional types of fundraising because they wanted to engage the public in the project Theres something magical that happens with crowd funding where you start getting  emails from people telling you well does it do this Or what about that Or why doesnt it do that And that really helps you refine what youre doing and understand better what peoples questions and needs are Richman says Before uBiome and American Gut most of the scientists whove tried crowd funding havent raised anything close to  Previous takes were closer to just  People say you know what can they do with  Im an ecologist You can do a lot of things for  says   Hes with the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis in Santa Barbara California and he also cofounded the   an effort to encourage scientists to crowd fund He says for an ecologist  would pay for several months of field work Not all science is you know sending a rocket to Mars Ranganathan says Critics of crowd funding worry that it will turn science into a popularity contest They say  Only the panda bear research is going to get funded My very serious research will never get funded this way Thats the worry says Ranganathan And in fact its dead wrong Even esoteric projects can raise money Ranganathan says We had a microbiologist in New Zealand who was studying the evolution of  in mouse guts Wow nothing very particularly sexy about that but she was such a gifted communicator and could explain Hey this is why its exciting  Ranganathan says scientists ought to get better at selling their science My goal is to change the culture of science to one where scientists are reaching out to the public he says But some scientists need to be persuaded that reaching out to the public is a good thing Some do and many do a fantastic job But generally do scientists reach out No they dont We need a new argument How about money Money seems to be a good argument sometimes he says The idea of being financially rewarded for being a good science communicator seems to me to be a worthy goal
