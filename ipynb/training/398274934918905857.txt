For scientists building devices that would allow the paralyzed to interact with their environment as well as those wishing to understand the workings of the brain its important to understand that using two virtual arms is a more complex proposition than using each arm separately and multiplying by two But with a little help and a lot of technology a new study shows even a monkey can be taught to do it The latest account of a brainmachine interface that could give a quadriplegic two good hands was published Wednesday in the journal   The article describes a process by which two monkeys were taught to move two arms on a computer terminal in front of them using only their thoughts One of the monkeys achieved that feat by first manipulating two virtual arms projected on a screen in front of himwith his own hands on a pair of joysticks But the other did so without ever actually using his hands Instead the second monkey watched a projected image in which two arms move around a field and manipulate virtual buttons That vicarious experience alone produced a complex pattern of neuronal firing in the monkeys brain Later when the monkey reenacted that distinctive firing pattern by thinking about how he would move his arms the two virtual arms carried out the command That accomplishment holds out the prospect that even patients with no control over their limbs might one day be able to choose a virtual armor twoand send them forth to turn on lights punch in a phone number or type a letter In the latest study researchers found that it would take neural recordings from many different clusters of neurons across the brain to replicate the act of moving both arms In all researchers listened in on and recorded the activity of about  neurons distributed across the frontalparietal lobes of each animal to create the neural signature of each distinct movement of the arms That reproducing the movement of both arms would involve such a widely distributed ensemble of neurons was a surprise even to the researchers involved said lead author Dr Miguel Nicolelis of Duke University Those neural signatures became the commands that directed the virtual arms to move even when the monkeys arms were gently immobilized at their sides When a computer program detected the telltale signature of a monkey wishing to use his left arm to reach out and press on a red square on the screen it executed that movement virtually The research carried out largely at Duke Universitys Center for Neuroengineering is part of a broad   that could   lost to illness or injury Some hope that the same technologies could someday   as well The work is led by Nicolelis a Brazilianborn physician who heads an international consortium of brain and computer scientists engineers and prosthetics experts intent on building a fullbody prosthesis for the paralyzed The Walk Again Project aims to allow a person with paralysis to use technology and his or her thought patterns to bypass a severed spinal cord To that end Nicolelis and his team have pioneered a wide range of brainmachine interfaces tested first on nonhuman primates that could restore movement control and touch to those paralyzed below the neck The consortium is on course to unveil its exoskeleton in June in Brazil at the opening of the Soccer World Cup and is currently training a pool of patients in Brazil in the brainmachine interfaces that are at the heart of the project The culmination of a project Nicolelis calls the Brazilian moonshot one of those paralyzed patients will be chosen to walk onto the field and open the Games with a decisive kick of a ball The twoarmed monkey study is one more step toward achieving that goalÂ  Nicolelis said in an interview Wednesday Read More
