Its hard to find an issue on which President Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney disagree more than health care The  Affordable Care Act is considered President Obamas   as well as something Romney has   Yet while Democrats in tough races   from touting the justpassed health law known by its detractors as Obamacare the president has embraced both the name and the law on the campaign trail this year We passed health reform  yes I like the name Obamacare  so your insurance companies cant jerk you around anymore he told a cheering crowd in   last week So young people can stay on their parents plans till theyre  So women cant be charged more than men for their insurance  being a woman is not a preexisting condition But the health law has been one thing on which Romney has been consistent What the court did not do on its last day in session I will do on my first day if elected president of the US he said just after the   in June that found the law largely constitutional And that is I will act to repeal Obamacare Now Romney   on his first day in office Hell need Congress to do that It might take a while but its likely he  Still the big question is what if anything hed try to replace the law with Heres how he answered that question at the   in Denver In fact Romneys   after the debate to clarify that no preexisting conditions wouldnt be covered for most people Only those who have maintained continuous coverage There also wouldnt be any guarantee for young adults to stay on their parents plans Romney says it would happen because the private sector is already doing it albeit with a push from the law The right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have Romney said at the Denver debate Thats the wrong way to go The private market and individual responsibility always work best Now this sounds curious to people like Jonathan Gruber an economist from MIT who worked on both the   that passed when Romney was governor in  and the federal law passed two years ago Gruber says he is stunned at how Romney can still profess support for his states law but opposition to the federal law since the two are such close cousins This is an unprecedented case of a major national policy where we ran an experiment first he said In Massachusetts the state met both of its goals We wanted to cover the uninsured and weve covered twothirds of our uninsured residents Gruber said Our uninsurance rate is now down to  percent compared to an  percent national rate And we wanted to fix what was a broken nongroup insurance market And we did we lowered premiums in that market by  percent What the original Massachusetts law did not do however is attempt to lower health costs overall A second law   does attempt to take on that task It is cost control that makes the federal law so controversial There are two big barriers to getting a handle on health spending Gruber says The first is the science which is we dont really know how to do it he says The second is the politics which is that even if we did the politicians wouldnt let us Thats because saving money always causes pain for someone That said however the Affordable Care Act does start to take some steps in the direction of cost control The problem is that most of them are still largely invisible to the public Its all technical its all professional its all behind the scenes says Len Nichols of George Mason University Nichols says that includes things like paying hospitals less if patients who are discharged are   too soon or encouraging doctors and hospitals to better   But it is indeed making health care cheaper he says Why are health care premiums growing less than they were Part of the reason is because people have figured out Hey we can do this stuff cheaper And were going to have to to survive in the long run So lets start now  The question is does the health care industry need a federal law to make these changes continue Many say no All the innovations that Obamacare is trying to impose in a topdown sort of way already exist in the marketplace says Michael Cannon of the libertarian Cato Institute Cannon like Romney says real cost control can come only from the private sector Giving patients the money is going to encourage them to be more costconscious consumers and force prices down in a way that government has proven itself unable to do The problem is no one knows which would work better because neither has really been tried So the choice is to let the new law continue to play out or repeal it and see whether Congress can pass something else That is if it doesnt take Congress another generation to reach another compromise
