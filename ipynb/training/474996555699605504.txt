Smokers who want to quit have all sorts of tools at their disposal call lines nicotine patches medication friends doctors And now texts Getting counseling through text messages doubled the odds of kicking the habit compared with those who relied on Internet searches and basic information brochures a   Friday in the  found Its one of the few longterm randomized trials looking at the effectiveness of texting as a method to help people quit smoking The participants were enrolled in   a publicly available Webbased program that sends personalized texts and emails to smokers to help them cut down as they approach a target quit date In moments of weakness people could text keywords like CRAVE or STATS to receive tips about fighting cravings an update on their progress or even a trivia game they could play to distract them I was interested in helping people quit smoking with cognitive behavioral therapy and given the widespread use of cellphones I thought this was a neat opportunity says   a professor at George Washington Universitys School of Public Health in Washington DC and the brain behind the program Abroms got the idea about five years ago when there werent   available for receiving counseling or medical advice via text So she started developing a program herself Since TextQuit was licensed and launched in  about  people have enrolled In the trial Abroms and her colleagues recruited  people by posting an ad on Google that would appear when people searched phrases like quitting smoking or how to stop smoking They randomly assigned some to enroll in TextQuit The others received a brochure in the mail and were encouraged to search for selfhelp materials online The researchers checked in with participants who tended to skew female and white four times over the course of six months to monitor their progress Those who couldnt be followed up with were classified as smokers By the end of the six months at least  percent of the participants using TextQuit had successfully quit Only  percent of the participants using selfhelp materials had quit The researchers verified the selfreports by taking saliva samples which shaved the numbers down by about half That may not seem like a big deal but it means that even with a conservative estimate texting doubled a participants chances of quitting And Abroms points out its about   as other methods including phone counseling We have a number of proven therapies in the US that are recognized says Abroms like calling a help line or using a nicotine replacement patch But now were accruing more evidence that we can also use text messaging on mobile phones So we have another tool to quit smoking In a small   published in  the researchers asked people who were getting counseling from both a call line and TextQuit which one they liked better and why They liked that the texts came in the daytime says Abroms Rather than scheduling a minute phone conversation usually at night they could just glance down at their phone during the day It was a constant reminder that they were quitting smoking But theres room for improvement Now that call lines are offering TextQuit as a complement to phone counseling Abroms says shed like to find out if combining the two increases the odds of success
