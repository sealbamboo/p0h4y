Deprescribe Its a word I hadnt encountered before but Dr Cara Tannenbaum who holds an endowed chair in geriatric pharmacy at the University of Montreal told me that its been popping up with exponential frequency in medical journals and conversations among geriatricians Along with campaigns to dissuade older patients from having so many screening tests like     and   and potentially harmful procedures researchers now are trying to help them kick certain prescription drugs Specifically Dr Tannenbaum and her colleagues want older people to wean themselves from benzodiazepines widely used for insomnia and anxiety The brand names are familiar Ativan Ambien Halcion Klonopin Lunesta Sonata Valium and Xanax Some like Ambien and Lunesta actually belong to a class of sister drugs but have the same effects on the brain How widely are they used It varies between  and  percent of the population over  worldwide Dr Tannenbaum said One study found that after the introduction of Medicare Part D which doesnt cover benzodiazepines nor do some state Medicaid programs   but  percent of residents still took them A third of older adults in Quebec take sleeping pills too Dr Tannenbaum added Dependency is not just an American problem But it is a problem  especially given older users changing metabolisms and the likelihood that theyre taking many other drugs People taking sleeping pills are five times more likely to report problems with concentration and memory Dr Tannenbaum said Twice as likely to have a hip fracture Twice as likely to have a car accident the next day if theyre driving They also experience more incontinence If the risks of sedativehypnotics are well established why do so many older people keep taking them Theyre psychologically addictive Dr Tannenbaum said People believe they cant function without them They may have unrealistic ideas about how much sleep older adults actually need  most yearolds will do fine with six hours a night  or how much sedatives can help Unfortunately its normal for older people to wake up a couple of times a night Dr Tannenbaum said But they dont like it She has worked in an emergency room and seen older patients come in with fractures from nighttime falls Thats a bad time to say Maybe you shouldnt be taking a sleeping pill she said Instead she and her colleagues devised in medspeak a deprescribing patient empowerment intervention  a brochure  to help older users detox Through a pharmacy chain in metropolitan Montreal the researchers identified  longterm users aged  to  who agreed to be contacted and to share their health records Half received the eightpage brochure in the mail the other half didnt see it until after the study ended six months later All took at least five prescription drugs so neither pharmacists nor patients knew sleeping pills were the focus The brochure customized to refer to the actual drug a patient was taking was cannily designed to employ many of the same strategies used in directtoconsumer advertising It begins for instance with a truefalse quiz Sample question Ambien is a mild tranquilizer that is safe when taken for long periods of time Its intended to elicit cognitive dissonance Dr Tannenbaum said If you turn the page and see that no youre wrong it creates a kind of anxiety What do I do about this situation For the record benzodiazepines are recommended for insomnia in older patients only in very rare cases The booklet also includes a narrative from a yearold woman  actually a composite of several of Dr Tannenbaums patients  and alternative ways to improve sleep or handle anxiety A chart shows how to gradually stop using the drug You have to be weaned off the pills over  to  weeks so your blood levels go down slowly she said We tell patients youll have a few nights where you have trouble sleeping so just plan your activities accordingly Eventually your body will catch up How did these older patients fare Among those who received the brochure  percent had discontinued the drug by the sixmonth followup pharmacy records showed compared to  percent of the control group Another  percent of brochure recipients had reduced their doses Just from reading a brochure one in four patients got off a medication theyd been taking for in some cases  to  years Dr Tannenbaum said If older relatives are taking sleeping pills  and sometimes people dont realize they are  reading about the risks and following the daybyday reduction plan might help them quit You can   Im amazed at how receptive older people are when you explain the evidence Dr Tannenbaum said Theyre thirsty for this information
