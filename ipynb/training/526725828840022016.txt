Good morning, everyone, and welcome to another working week. Once again, the weekend respite has come and gone rather quickly, which means the usual routine of meetings and deadlines and what-not has begun in earnest. As always, we are coping by downing a cup or three of stimulation – our flavor today is the seasonal Pumpkin Spice.  Please feel free to join us. After all, a little stimulation can a long way. Meanwhile, here is your menu of tidbits. Have a grand day and do stay in touch…. Is Sanofi ceo Chris Viehbacher under board pressure? He explored plans to sell an $8 billion drug portfolio without informing his board, and Sanofi directors are meeting today and may discuss replacing him; Sarepta Therapeutics is likely to file for approval of its muscular dystrophy drug in mid-2015, pushing back from previous plans to file by the end of this year; and Novartis is selling its flu vaccine business to CSL for $275 million, which would create the world’s second-largest supplier of such products.
