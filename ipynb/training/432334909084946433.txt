Highdose vitamin C can boost the cancerkilling effect of chemotherapy in the lab and mice research suggests  Given by injection it could potentially be a safe effective and lowcost treatment for ovarian and other cancers say US scientists Reporting in   they call for largescale government clinical trials Pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to run trials as vitamins cannot be patented Vitamin C has long been used as an alternative therapy for cancer In the s chemist Linus Pauling reported that vitamin C given intravenously was effective in treating cancer However clinical trials of vitamin C given by mouth failed to replicate the effect and research was abandoned It is now known that the human body quickly excretes vitamin C when it is taken by mouth However scientists at   say that when given by injection vitamin C is absorbed into the body and can kill cancer cells without harming normal ones  The researchers injected vitamin C into human ovarian cancer cells in the lab into mice and into patients with advanced ovarian cancer  They found ovarian cancer cells were sensitive to vitamin C treatment but normal cells were unharmed  The treatment worked in tandem with standard chemotherapy drugs to slow tumour growth in mouse studies Meanwhile a small group of patients reported fewer sideeffects when given vitamin C alongside chemotherapy  Coresearcher Dr Jeanne Drisko said there was growing interest in the use of vitamin C by oncologists Patients are looking for safe and lowcost choices in their management of cancer she told BBC News Intravenous vitamin C has that potential based on our basic science research and early clinical data One potential hurdle is that pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to fund trials of intravenous vitamin C because there is no ability to patent natural products  Because vitamin C has no patent potential its development will not be supported by pharmaceutical companies said lead researcher Qi Chen  We believe that the time has arrived for research agencies to vigorously support thoughtful and meticulous clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C  Dr Kat Arney science communications manager for Cancer Research UK said there was a long history of research into vitamin C for treating cancer Its difficult to tell with such a small trial  just  patients  whether highdose vitamin C injections had any effect on survival but its interesting that it seemed to reduce the sideeffects of chemotherapy she said  Any potential treatment for cancer needs to be thoroughly evaluated in large clinical trials to make sure its safe and effective so further studies are needed before we know for sure what benefits high dose vitamin C may have for patients
