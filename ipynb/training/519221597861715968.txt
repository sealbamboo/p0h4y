The classic slogan for Firestone tires was where the rubber meets the road When it comes to Ebola the rubber met the road at the Firestone rubber plantation in Harbel Liberia Harbel is a company town not far from the capital city of Monrovia It was named in  after the founder of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company Harvey and his wife Idabelle Today Firestone workers and their families make up a community of  people across the plantation Firestone detected its first Ebola case on March  when an employees wife arrived from northern Liberia Shed been caring for a diseasestricken woman and was herself diagnosed with the disease Since then Firestone has done a remarkable job of keeping the virus at bay It built its own treatment center and set up a comprehensive response thats managed to quickly stop transmission Dr Brendan Flannery the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventions team in Liberia has hailed Firestones efforts as resourceful innovative and effective Currently the only Ebola cases on the sprawling squaremile plantation are in patients who come from neighboring towns Long rows of dappled rubber trees cover Harbels landscape Prevailing winds cause the adult trees to lean westward Back when Firestone was still based in Ohio employees used to joke that the trees are bowing to Akron When the Ebola case was diagnosed we went in to crisis mode recalls Ed Garcia the managing director of Firestone Liberia He redirected his entire management structure toward Ebola Garcias team first tried to find a hospital in the capital to care for the woman Unfortunately at that time there was no facility that could accommodate her he says So we quickly realized that we had to handle the situation ourselves The case was detected on a Sunday Garcia and a medical team from the company hospital spent Monday setting up an Ebola ward Tuesday the woman was placed in isolation None of us had any Ebola experience he says They scoured the Internet for information about how to treat Ebola They cleared out a building on the hospital grounds and set up an isolation ward They grabbed a bunch of hazmat suits for dealing with chemical spills at the rubber factory and gave them to the hospital staff The suits worked just as well for Ebola cases Firestone immediately quarantined the womans family Like so many Ebola patients she died soon after being admitted to the ward But no one else at Firestone got infected not her family and not the workers who transported treated and cared for her The Firestone managers had the benefit of backing and resources of a major corporation  something the communities around them did not Firestone didnt see another Ebola case for four months Then in August as the epidemic raced through the nearby capital patients with Ebola started appearing at the one hospital and several clinics across the giant rubber plantation The hospital isolation ward was expanded to  beds and a prefab annex was built Containing Ebola became the numberone priority of the company Schools in the town which have been closed by government decree were transformed into quarantine centers Teachers were dispatched for doortodoor outreach Hundreds of people with possible exposure to the virus were placed under quarantine Seventytwo cases were reported Fortyeight were treated in the hospital and  survived By midSeptember the companys Ebola treatment unit was nearly full As of this weekend however only three patients remained a trio of boys age   and  So we have these three says Dr Benedict Wollor coordinator for the Ebola treatment unit at Firestone We are concerned because by this morning the yearold was just crying A team is getting dressed in full body suits gloves and goggles to enter the ward a doctor two nurses and a man with an agricultural sprayer full of disinfectant strapped to his back Wollor says the team has a lot of work to do before they get overheated in their industrial spacesuits They have to change Pampers bedding even bathe them says Wollor Make sure theyre clean If someone is dehydrated open an IV line Imagine how we maintain an IV line on a kid These three boys all came from outside the plantation So even as the worst Ebola outbreak ever recorded rages all around them Firestone appears to have blocked the virus from spreading inside its territory Dr Flannery of the CDC says a key reason for Firestones success is the close monitoring of people who have potentially been exposed to the virus  and the moving of anyone who has had contact with an Ebola patient into voluntary quarantine By most accounts this Ebola outbreak remains out of control with health care workers across West Africa struggling to contain it Asked whats needed to turn that around Flannery says More Firestones  places that have the money resources and unwavering determination to stop Ebola
