If youre in bed reading this you may feel sleepy tomorrow morning A study has found that reading from a lightemitting device such as an ereader before bedtime can shift your bodys natural clock and delay the onset and characteristics of your sleep And that could leave you feeling more groggy the morning after according to the study published online Monday in the journal   A dozen people checked into the sleep lab at Bostons Brigham and Womens Hospital and stayed for two weeks During that time each spent five consecutive evenings reading a book for four hours under reflected light and five evenings viewing an iPad for the same duration the order of the fiveday blocks was randomly assigned All had a mandatory bedtime of  pm and a  am wakeup Blood tests showed those who read from the computer tablet had suppressed evening levels of melatonin and on the next day the increase in that hormone occurred  minutes later an indication of a shift in their bodys circadian cycle according to the study Longterm suppression of melatonin by nighttime light exposure has been linked to increased risk of certain cancers the study noted The study subjects using ereaders also took  minutes longer to fall asleep and had nearly  minutes less rapideyemovement sleep a stage that has been linked to memory consolidation the study found Tablet reading participants also rated themselves as less sleepy in the evenings a subjective measure that also correlated with weaker electroencephalogram EEG readings that are associated with transition to sleep the study found Those who used the ereaders also described themselves as more sleepy the morning after and needed more time to feel fully alert We really didnt anticipate it would have an effect the following morning especially after an eighthour sleep opportunity  and study subjects slept the same amount of time said neuroscientist AnneMarie Chang a biobehavioral health expert from Penn State University who works at Brighams division of sleep and circadian disorders Although the magnitude of the melatonin shift was large the smaller REM and sleep delays also may contribute to the morningafter effects Chang said Researchers suspect the quality of the light from computer devices matters more than its overall intensity relative to reflected light cast on a book These devices are enriched for shortwavelength light which is in the blue range Chang said Previous studies have shown that exposure to such wavelengths strongly affects the bodys circadian clock compared with exposure to light of longer wavelengths Researchers warned that the effects they measured in a laboratory with a mandatory lightsout may understate the problem in the real world If youre in a home environment and youre reading on a lightemitting device and youre not feeling sleepy chances are youre not going to stop and go to sleep at the time that youre supposed to Chang said There are alternatives however  some devices dont emit enriched light and there are ways to alter such emissions The study did not examine whether there is a rebound period after putting down the devices that might lessen their effects on sleep There are so many things we dont know about how these devices affect our health and our sleep she said How much time before sleep do you need to kind of wind down Is there a window when this light wont have that effect Those are very interesting questions that need further investigation
