Experts are urging doctors to ease up on using medications to control blood pressure in older patients Rather than aim for a target blood pressure of  mm Hg the target will be relaxed slightly to  mm Hg according to new guidelines issued Wednesday The authors of the   published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn emphasized that they were not changing the definition of high blood pressure Rather they are recognizing that data from randomized clinical trials do not show that using drugs to nudge down systolic blood pressure from  to  provides any health benefit Systolic pressure  the top number in a blood pressure reading  measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart muscle contracts Diastolic pressure the bottom number measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart muscle is relaxed between heartbeats An estimated  million American adults suffer from high blood pressure known formally as hypertension according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention That works out to nearly  in  adults making it the most common condition treated by primary care physicians People with high blood pressure force their hearts to work too hard putting them   the No  and No  causes of death in the US the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute says The American Heart Assn also   that hypertension can lead to atherosclerosis kidney damage vision loss erectile dysfunction memory loss peripheral artery disease and other ailments Adults past their th birthday should maintain their blood pressure at or below  mmHg according to the new guidelines If patients are above that target they should get medication from their doctors the guidelines state This is a strong recommendation supported by moderate to highquality evidence that shows that lowering blood pressure below  reduces a patients risk of stroke heart failure and coronary heart disease the expert panel reported Other data also suggest that reducing systolic blood pressure below  doesnt lead to additional improvements though the evidence for this is weaker they said If patients in this age group are already on medications that keep their systolic blood pressure below   in line with current guidelines  and they are tolerating that treatment well they can keep doing what theyre doing the panel advised There is no need to ease up on medications to let their blood pressure rise to  Adults under the age of  should maintain their diastolic blood pressure below  mm Hg using drugs if necessary the guidelines state Highquality evidence from clinical trials showed that when patients between the ages of  and  kept their blood pressure below this target they were less likely to have strokes heart failure and premature death from any cause the expert panel found However when patients reduced their blood pressure even lower to  or  there was no additional benefit For patients between the ages of  and  the recommendation to maintain diastolic blood pressure below  mm Hg is based on a consensus of expert opinion according to the JAMA report The panel said it could not find convincing evidence from clinical trials to recommend a specific target for systolic blood pressure in people under age  So the experts opted to stick with the current standard of  mm Hg The panel was guided by expert opinion in recommending that adults of all ages with diabetes or chronic kidney disease whose blood pressure is above  mm Hg should use medication to get it below that target Finally the guidelines include recommendations about which drugs patients should use to control their hypertension African American patients should start with   or a   Other patients should try either of these drugs or an   better known as ACE inhibitors or an   better known as ARBs Patients of all races with high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease should be treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB the guidelines state If doctors cant get their patients blood pressure under control after one month they should add a second drug to the regimen the experts advise The guidelines go into more detail on how to proceed in stubborn cases The   the formal name of the panel that developed the new guidelines included experts in hypertension primary care geriatrics cardiology nephrology nursing pharmacology and other fields They based their advice on data from large randomized clinical trials  the type considered the gold standard or medical research because they are least subject to bias All of the studies had at least  patients and followed them for at least one year The preliminary guidelines were vetted by  outside experts and representatives of five federal agencies The feedback they offered was incorporated into the final guidelines Despite their detailed review of drug therapies the experts said that medications arent the only way to control high blood pressure For all persons with hypertension the potential benefits of a healthy diet weight control and regular exercise cannot be overemphasized the panel wrote These lifestyle treatments have the potential to improve BP control and even reduce medication needs    and like   on Facebook
