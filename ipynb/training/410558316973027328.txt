At the same time she found that zooming in on objects helps preserve peoples memory of them beyond just the detail on which they zoomed  Henkels father is a photographer so she has been hanging around photos and taking photos all her life She wanted to see if snapping photos of objects would impact peoples memories of what they saw at a museum  This study had a small sample size  undergraduates participated in the first part and  in the second Both groups were mostly women In order to strengthen the conclusions this research would need to be replicated with a lot more people and a more balanced sex ratio not to mention a wider range of demographic characteristics such as age  But this is an interesting start It underscores the point that there are different ways that the brain processes information At an automatic level by taking pictures and at a more meaningful level by focusing on a specific object or something with a personal association said Paul D Nussbaum clinical neuropsychologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Its that deeper level that enables memories to form Nussbaum said in an email  The more we engage our brain into processing a stimuli and the more personal that processing is the more solid the memory formation and recall he said  For the first experiment participants went to the Bellarmine Museum of Art Onethird of them had never been to the museum before They visited  objects spanning such media as painting sculpture jewelry and pottery  One group of students was instructed to read the name of each object out loud look at the object for  seconds and then take a photo of it The other participants looked at an object for  seconds without taking a picture The following day participants were asked to write down the names of all objects they remembered from the museum and to indicate which they photographed They could describe any objects whose names they could not recall  Then they were given a list of  objects and were asked to indicate which they had seen which they had photographed and which were not on the tour They also answered questions about details of objects and completed a photorecognition test of objects they may or may not have seen  Henkel found that people performed worse on memory recognition tasks in reference objects they had photographed compared to objects they had observed with their eyes only Similarly they appeared to remember fewer details about what they photographed compared to the ones they had only seen  When we distract ourselves and count on the camera to remember for us then we dont remember as many objects she said We dont remember as many details about the objects The second experiment gave participants  seconds to view each object in addition to extra time for photographing when that was asked of them That meant they had extra time with objects that they had to photograph Some were also asked to zoom in on specific parts of the objects The next day it was time to test their memory Participants had to indicate from a list of names of art objects which were part of the tour they had been on  For objects they remembered participants were asked to say whether they had photographed the object or just seen it and answer two questions about visual aspects of the object  Henkel found a similar effect as in the first experiment Photographed objects tended to be associated with a decline in memory about them But here is the twist Zooming in on one part of the object preserved participants memory about that entire object not just the part on which the camera zoomed Accuracy was about the same regardless of whether participants just observed objects or zoomed in on individual parts  Henkel explains that when you zoom in on part of an object its drawing your visual attention there but youre also thinking about the object as a whole  So what your eyes are doing what the camera is doing is not the same thing as what your brain is doing Henkel said In other words when you spend the extra time and attention to zoom in on something youre likely to remember aspects of it as well as if you had just observed it without a camera  OK so maybe its a little more complicated than just taking photos is bad for your memory Thats good news since people took more than  billion photos in  according to an estimate cited in the study and  million photos are uploaded to Facebook daily  Still says Nussbaum I wonder sometimes how much we may be missing when we rely so much on technological gadgets rather than using our brains  Henkel points out that the advent of digital photography has overstepped the ageold traditions of printing photos out putting them in scrapbooks and sitting around with your family and looking at them That sounds a little like using a paper map But maybe those photorelated activities that make us take time to reminisce do enhance our memory of the experiences we have tried to photograph so diligently If were going to going to rely on that external memory device of the camera to remember for us weve got to take that extra step and look at it Henkel says Keep that in mind this holiday season when you take hundreds of photos with with friends and family Theyre worth a second look
