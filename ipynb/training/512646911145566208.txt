When I started clearing my closet a few weeks after the th chemo infusion I struggled against bitterness about my changed body After all someone else could wear the clothes that no longer fit me Then why not bundle them up along with jackets shirts pants and shoes unworn because they were a professional uniform no longer needed Previously and sorrowfully I had boxed all the files in my campus office and sent them to the university archive providing a place with my departure for a younger colleague The fading signs my daughters had drawn some  years ago  Mom at Work  were taken down and brought home Months later I realized that whenever I went into the bathroom I would find myself tossing hair and bath products The aftereffects of chemotherapy and of the grotesque debulking operation that eviscerates ovarian cancer patients put an end to hair and baths  The next year I went through my stash of cotton fabric with my friend Dyan gave her a large plastic bag and urged her to take whatever she could use for future quilts Why should I hoard fabric that I will not have time to cut and stitch No amount of cajoling convinced her that she might become a knitter and should also pack up lovely wool that I would never have the energy to use Project Divest only emerged in capital letters after I read the harrowing but hilarious graphic elegy composed by the cartoonist Roz Chast  In Cant We Talk About Something More Pleasant Ms Chast recounts and illustrates her successful efforts to pry her aged parents from the apartment they inhabited for more than four decades relocate them in The Place and then return to clean up their horrific clutter  Before my incapacitation and death shouldnt I unburden my family of the mounds of useless debris I had accumulated over a lifetime Fueled by a blast from Chast I assumed a righteous air   With my husbands help I went through a succession of closets full of crumbling letters and journals dusty VHS tapes with no player grungy pocketbooks elegant but heavy leather luggage from his first wife tattered posters plastic green Hulk hands with no batteries caked running shoes dysfunctional humidifiers and fans tax records from the last century and crocheted afghans from my mother These last had to be put aside for the girls During breaks when I returned to the cancer memoirs that have absorbed me since diagnosis I was surprised to discover that the act of purging preoccupies younger women who deem cancer just another chapter in their book of life as Dr Janet R Gilsdorf does in InsideOutside  A Physicians Journey With Cancer A breast cancer survivor who specializes in pediatric infectious diseases Dr Gilsdorf ends her book with a description of ruthlessly discarding possessions that no longer represent security against an unexpected crisis as in you never know when youll need three fondue pots Maybe perceived crises dont drive my actions much anymore she writes or maybe I dont perceive the issues as crises  Since cancer survivors find themselves engaged in disencumbering themselves perhaps Project Divest has less to do with my impending death and more to do with the death of the self that required all that stuff   In one of the finest cancer memoirs A Whole New Life the author Reynolds Price concluded his response to treatment of a spinal cord cancer with advice for people confronting a grave illness Grieve for a decent limited time over whatever parts of your old self you know youll miss and then find your way to be somebody else the next viable you  a strippeddown whole other cleareyed person who is thankful for air not to speak of the human kindness youll meet if you get normal luck     Like Reynolds Price the sociologist Arthur W Frank responded to treatment in his case of testicular cancer by wishing less to recover what I had been than to discover what else I might be   Similarly after a mastectomy and chemotherapy the brilliant queer theorist Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick decided If I can fit the pieces of this self back together at all I dont want them to be the way they were Instead she hoped to be realer With Good Will I am just saying no to recovery I may not look it but I feel lighter And thanks to Dyan I still have wool  For  little could I have imagined such a deluge of delight  the arrival of a new grandson floods my lucky life with love Im brimming with joy actually with pulloutallthestops ecstasy like when in the last movement of Beethovens Ninth Symphony the whole chorus joins the orchestra to sing over and over again Freude schner Gtterfunken and spirits soar   On a quieter note I consider recently emptied shelves that can accommodate all the equipment babies need when their parents bring them to play Truth to tell there always was room in this country house But now theres ample space to welcome the little guy into my besotted heart
