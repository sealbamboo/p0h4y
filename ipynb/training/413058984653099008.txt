A decade ago President George W Bush announced an unprecedented global health initiative  billion over five years to fight HIV in developing countries There are whole countries in Africa where more than onethird of the adult population carries the infection Bush said in his  State of the Union address Yet across that continent only  AIDS victims  only   are receiving the medicine they need Congress quickly passed the bill By the end of May  the   or PEPFAR was law Over the past decade the US has spent more than  billion on PEPFAR largely to test and treat people for HIV in subSaharan Africa Some health officials have   whether PEPFAR has drained money from addressing other problems But in general the initiative has been considered a success Nearly  million people around the world now have access to antiviral drugs and treatment for twothirds of these people is directly supported by PEPFAR the US government   earlier this month Treatment for HIVpositive mothers funded by PEPFAR prevented  infants from getting infected with the virus at birth Back in  South Africa was the   for the global AIDS epidemic Infection rates were soaring More than a quarter of pregnant women were HIV positive And yet the government was still denying that there was a connection between HIV and AIDS NPRs Melissa Block talked Tuesday with   a South African HIV specialist about PEPFARs impact in South Africa which has received more money from the initiative than any other country Venter who is at the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute was part of a secret task force within South Africa that was trying to come up with a response to the epidemic At the time we were having running battles with what was then the denialist government They were trying to stop us from giving antiretroviral drugs to stop mothertochild transmission It was a really tragic time The minister of health the president the whole cabinet was just running interference And at the time the PEPFAR money started to roll in  I cant tell you how bizarre the situation was where you have the minister of health and the president saying they dont believe HIV exists on the one hand And then these drugs were flowing freely almost in certain places and in certain clinics When Bush said  billion  its such a large amount of money Firstly I dont really know the concept of what that means  I dont think we anticipated how direct that support was going to be It came with lots of constraints but they kind of turned around to us and said Put as many people on antiretroviral therapies as you possibly can Test as many people for HIV as you possibly can It was a very different world suddenly And you have to understand that nobody had done anything on this scale before So there were a lot of mistakes to be made I have criticisms of the approach I think there wasnt nearly enough focus on how to disburse the funding We were able to hire staff and we were able to buy drugs We could fix little aspects of the government I remember my own clinic We first were able to renovate the place  We were able to put in additional pharmacy staff additional doctors additional nurses I think PEPFAR really has saved a huge number of peoples lives This has been one of the most effective public health inventions outside of clean running water decent nutrition and vaccine programs This has made an unbelievable difference
