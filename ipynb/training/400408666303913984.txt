After decades of cajoling Americans to know their cholesterol level and get it down as low as possible the nations leading heart specialists are changing course Cholesterol is still important But new   published Tuesday afternoon throw out the notion that a specific blood   level should automatically trigger treatment with cholesterollowering drugs Also out the window is any notion of treating patients with drugs until their socalled   hits a specific target  one that for most people is all but impossible to achieve by diet alone Instead the new guidelines groups adults into four categories most likely to benefit from cholesterollowering drugs They include people with heart disease and diabetes as well as people with high levels of   the bad kind The guidelines also explicitly tell doctors not to bother with drugs other than   saying theyre the only ones proven to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes The effect of the new guidelines would be to double the number of Americans who are candidates for lifelong statin therapy according to   of the University of North Carolina one of the guideline writers Nobody knows for sure how many Americans are already taking statin drugs Under the old guidelines  percent of adults are recommended for treatment or about  million people A doubling of that would be  million But by some estimates the number currently taking statins may already approach that number It may be there are a substantial number of patients now on statin therapy where there is not strong evidence of benefit Smith tells Shots The new guidelines will treat better and smarter focusing on populations most likely to benefit Statin drugs marketed in the United States include brand names such as Crestor and generic versions of Lipitor and Zocor They   from  to  per month The new guidelines were developed jointly by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association at the behest of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute a federal agency They are based on the most uptodate research on prevention of heart attacks and strokes The new guidelines will pay off Smith says in a sizable reduction in Americans suffering and dying from cardiovascular diseases Its clear we need to treat more patients because we have a big problem and were not getting there now Smith says At a time when one out of three Americans are dying of heart attacks and strokes these guidelines offer a way forward to more precisely identify the patients who need to get statin therapy But the new way forward is more complex than the current advice Under the   people whose bad cholesterol is above  milligrams per deciliter of blood should get cholesterollowering drugs to lower their levels to below  In recent years the push has been to go as low as possible with LDL with targets as low as  to  a level usually not possible to achieve without statin drugs One main reason why the number of Americans on statin treatments could double if the new guidelines were actually followed is that people without known cardiovascular disease or diabetes would now be considered for statin treatment if their year risk of heart attack or stroke is more than  percent One of the previous thresholds for cholesterollowering drug therapy was a year risk of  percent Thats a big driver the changing of the threshold Smith says In addition the guideline panel has come up with a brandnew way of calculating the year risk replacing a widely used   derived from the famous   The   takes into account the risk of stroke while the   doesnt Other than healthy people with a  percent year risk there are three other groups that ought to be considered for statin treatment under the new guidelines For people over  who also have risk factors the guidelines recommends moderate doses of a statin drug Those at greater risk should get aggressive therapy but the new guidelines dont specify an LDL target that older patients should achieve The guidelines stress the importance of a healthful diet weight loss exercise and blood pressure control in addition to statin treatment But theres no doubt that the overall effect to the extent the guidelines are followed will be to put many more people on cholesterollowering drugs In borderline cases where doctors arent certain whether to write a statin prescription the new guidelines say they should take into account a patients family history of heart disease and stroke and also consider ordering tests that can indicate underlying artery disease These tests include a CT scan for   levels that measures the degree to which the hearts arteries are clogged a blood protein called   that indicates chronic inflammation and a test for   of the ankle which indicates whether leg arteries are narrowed by atherosclerosis Around  percent of patients taking statin drugs get   and a much smaller proportion can have serious muscle damage Some of these patients have taken alternative cholesterollowering drugs that the new guidelines say are ineffective in lowering cardiovascular risk The hope specialists say is that nearly all muscular side effects can be minimized by lowering the statin dose or switching to a different statin The new guidelines are clearly more complex so its not clear how readily patients and doctors will adopt them This is a tectonic shift in thinking thats hard to explain says   of the Cleveland Clinic a leading cholesterol expert who wasnt involved in writing the new guidelines Nissen is generally supportive of the new guidelines but he predicts theyll be controversial and difficult to understand I worry about this causing confusion because weve been telling patients for two decades know your numbers and treat to a certain level  Nissen tells Shots There will be some significant confusion until we educate everybody about what we are asking them to do
