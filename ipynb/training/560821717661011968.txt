he   wants your feedback I know this because they ask for it On a cold evening in October last year my wife Jane and I had to make a sudden desperately unwanted trip to our nearest AE department Jane was  weeks pregnant and we were concerned she might be having a miscarriage The waiting room wasnt as crowded as we had feared it would be though it certainly contained a few scattered casualties of nights out gone wrong Within half an hour we were taken to what looked like a storage room where we were attended by a gynaecologist who performed an ultrasound scan on Jane She was calm compassionate and clear and I could see that she desperately wanted to find what was no longer there but the awful truth dawned on all three of us long before she gave in to it Eventually the doctor put down the scanner and paused briefly Then came the euphemistic diagnosis Im afraid this pregnancy has not progressed in the way that we would have hoped Jane was given some strong painkillers and plastic sheeting to take home and warned to expect a long night as our longedfor son or daughter would break down and emerge unrecognisably in stages I thanked the doctor for her sensitivity and care put my arm around Jane and we left As it happened our unfortunate baby didnt emerge as had been described Jane felt something give way as we walked through the car park She lay on the back seat and I came face to face with a tiny human being who wasnt strong enough to make it It was quick brutal and utterly devastating We drove home and started the slow process of coming to terms with our loss The grief was volcanic Jane woke in the middle of the night howling I want my baby back having dreamed of a happier ending and emerging from sleep been forced to confront the nightmare of reality once again The next day Jane received an automated text message It read We would like you to think about your recent experience in the AE department How likely are you to recommend our AE department to your friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment Please reply  for extremely likely  for likely  for neither likely nor unlikely  for unlikely  for extremely unlikely or  for dont know Please reply today texts are free of charge Your feedback is anonymous and important to us and helps us to improve our service Two days later while staying with my parents we attended the Royal Surrey hospital for a followup scan to make sure everything was OK Once again Jane received an almostidentical text message the following day a system being used across different NHS authorities called   Its difficult to describe how crass and inappropriate those messages were What are they for I can imagine a faceless man in a suit pointing to a pie chart at a meeting of senior managers and telling his colleagues that customer satisfaction is at a record high Hell probably get a pay rise for improving results But heres the thing Jane and I had already given our feedback We had thanked the excellent doctor who witnessed our anguished hope who entered into that space with us at the start of a long night in AE and held our hands when our nightmare became reality I cant speak highly enough of her and I say that knowing full well that we probably werent the last people whose lives she saw being shattered that night Thats the place for feedback face to face sincere thoughts and feelings expressed from one human to another To the faceless bureaucrat who thought those text messages were a good idea I would make the following plea we come to you in the darkest moments of our lives You see us through them whatever the outcome and then you move on to the next patient You do this because thats what the NHS is for and its a beautiful institution In the vast majority of cases we go to the nearest and most convenient hospital which renders utterly redundant the notion of recommending your facility as if it were a restaurant or a BB Please get rid of the gimmicks  the fauxconcerned and impersonal feedback loop and the specious choice paradigm designed to    and listen to your frontline staff They know whats really going on and theyre the remarkable people who really care enough to face broken humans every single day
