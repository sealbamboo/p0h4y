Patients with severe epilepsy are giving scientists the chance to see the human brain in action a view they could never get with an MRI or other hightech tools By applying small jolts of electricity to the brain theyre able to wipe out a persons ability to     or even induce a will to persevere as researchers   last week  None of this would be possible without patients like yearold Nate Bennett of Santa Cruz Calif Hes had   since he was a teenager and its getting worse to the point where he worries that hell lose his job as a restaurant manager In his back pocket Bennett carries around a black leather wallet about the size of an envelope attached to a key chain He made it himself His teeth have left deep scars in the leather Thats a good sign It means he had time to prepare If Im conscious and I feel the seizure starting I warn people around me whats going on he says I lay down on the floor and I put this in my mouth That way when I wake up I may not have bitten my tongue Bennett has one or two grand mal seizures a month sometimes in the middle of the workday Hes unable to drive and worries about having to go on disability and losing his health insurance Medication isnt helping That makes Bennett a potential candidate for surgery to remove the part of his brain thats causing the seizures and possibly cure his epilepsy The first step is to find out whether his seizures originate in a specific place in the brain and if so whether thats a part of the brain that could safely be removed Back in August Bennett underwent surgery to implant electrodes in his brain at Stanford University Hospital in Palo Alto The electrodes are designed to read his brains electrical activity including the electrical storms that cause his seizures Waking from anesthesia Bennett was groggy but gave a visitor the thumbsup Im putting reality back together here  gradually he says with a smile A doctor tells Bennett that while he was unconscious a surgeon implanted seven wires in his brain  two in the right hemisphere and five in the left Each is a bit thicker than a human hair and extends about  inches into his brain What a party Bennett replies wryly Bennett will spend a week or more in the hospital To keep himself occupied hes brought a bag of musical instruments and a copy of   by Hermann Hesse A few days after the electrodes were implanted Bennett welcomed visitors into his hospital room His head is wrapped in bandages A thick braid of wires hangs from his left temple At the bedside is   an associate professor of neurology at Stanford University and Bennetts doctor Today Parvizi is going to send tiny jolts of electricity along the electrodes and into Bennetts brain Essentially hes exploring Bennetts brain neuron by neuron To be clear this is completely painless But very strange things happen when you stimulate the brain this way One of Bennetts electrodes is located in the dorsal anterior cingulate a part of the brain associated with automatic speech like saying ouch or whoa Parvizi sends a small milliamp jolt there Bennett suddenly lurches forward I became unable to speak he tells Parvizi I was going to say jinx I I I  I started stuttering I couldnt get the words out The notion that epilepsy offers a window into the brain has a long history In the th century English neurologist John Hughlings Jackson observed an epileptic seizure that seemed to travel from one part of his patients body to another To Jackson this revealed that the disease was affecting parts of the brain in succession each with a corresponding effect on the body This phenomenon is still called the Jacksonian March Epilepsy gave us our first clue that parts of the brain are responsible for parts of the body or for different senses says   a neurologist and neurosurgeon at the University of California San Francisco whose work with epilepsy patients has led to key findings about how humans   In the s a Canadian epilepsy specialist named Wilder Penfield found that by stimulating certain parts of the brain he could make people move their hands involuntarily or report a smell of burning leather Parvizi is one of a handful of neuroscientists who have picked up Penfields torch showing that brain regions correspond not just to body parts or senses but to emotions In a   of an experiment with another epilepsy patient Parvizi sends a small jolt of electricity to a part of the brain called the anterior midcingulate cortex a part of the brain located about  inches behind the bridge of the nose The patients heart begins to race Parvizi asks him to describe how he feels I started getting this feeling like I was driving into a storm the man says As if one of the tires was half flat and youre only halfway there Theres no way to turn around and go back You have to keep going forward Parvizi asks Was this negative or was it positive This is the part thats most interesting to Parvizi and his colleagues because while the patient clearly feels a sense of danger he feels something else too a determination to get through it It was more of positive thing the patient says Like Push harder push harder to get through this  When the anterior midcingulate cortex is stimulated Parvizi says patients have the will to go towards the storm and fight rather than giving up being scared depressed and running back This study which was   last week in the journal   lines up with other research on the area of the brain known as the salience network says coauthor   an assistant professor of neurology at Stanford University Over the last  years or so weve started to get this sense for a network thats constantly scanning the environment and manipulating the internal environment Greicius says It does that by adjusting heart rate and blood pressure reducing blood flow from the gut and generally shifting the bodys resources from whats less urgent to the task at hand Thats the beauty of evolution right says Parvizi If you really are going to go through difficulty youd better have higher blood pressure so your muscles can get the blood and run or fight This illustrates the great debt that neuroscience owes to patients like Nate Bennett says   a professor of neurology at NYUs School of Medicine It is one thing Devinsky says to study the brain through MRI scans or animal models Its another thing to zap a specific part of the brain and be able to ask the patient to describe what happens We only use these electrodes if theres a clinical application says Devinsky but once theyre in we have this incredible scientific opportunity Brain stimulation is already used to treat certain disorders including Parkinsons disease and in experimental settings for depression Devinsky says Parvizis findings might hint at future therapies But for now the goal is to solve the problem of Bennetts epilepsy starting by figuring out where his seizures are coming from Back at the hospital in August Parvizi flips a switch and a jolt of electricity enters Bennetts brain I feel a change warns Bennett I might have a seizure Bennetts face hardens His eyes fix on some invisible spot across the room Hes having a seizure This is a good thing The electrodes implanted in his brain have recorded exactly where it came from But further testing reveals that there is not just one source of Bennetts seizures or even two Instead they come from points spread out across his brain So hes not a candidate for surgery to stop the seizures This was disappointing Bennett says But being part of a scientific experiment was a silver lining For me Id like to see something positive come out of it all even if its for somebody else You know he says after the electrodes were removed and he was back at work And his exploration isnt over Bennett says A new epilepsy device called the    kind of like a pacemaker for the brain  recently got FDA premarket approval Pretty soon hell start looking into that
