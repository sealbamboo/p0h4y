                  . Laura Geller Beauty Baked Impressions blush in Barolo ($14; . ). "My hair goes flat fairly quickly, so I am always looking for ways to perk it up. These days, I wash it, add a dime-size dollop of light mousse—that's key!—and put it into one big braid. When I undo the braid midday, I have perfect waves with body and volume.". "When I don't have the time or cash to go to a salon, I shampoo at night, then run a drop of smoothing cream through my hair. I rough-dry it with a blow-dryer, wrap my damp strands into a bun and go to sleep. When I wake up, the top half is smooth. I just wrap random sections of the lower half around a curling iron for waves.".
