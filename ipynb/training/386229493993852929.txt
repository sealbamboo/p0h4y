Almost everything about this case makes me sad  and angry wrote Nora OBrienSuric a senior program officer for The John A Hartford Foundation in a recent blog post entitled   She was writing about the parole of Anthony D Marshall    He was convicted of stealing tens of millions of dollars from his cognitively impaired mother Brooke Astor a socialite and philanthropist before her death in  at   The Hartford Foundation has awarded  million to researchers studying aging and at least two of the grantees have expertise relevant to the highprofile Astor case Dr Laura A Mosqueda at the University of California Irvine and   and Tina Maschi an associate professor at Fordham Universitys Graduate School of Social Service who studies the aging of the American prison population its causes and consequences  Studies by the American Civil Liberty Unions National Prison Project and Human Rights Watch have calculated the size growth and cost of this population of aged prisoners most expected to die behind bars Among the nations  million people in custody  are considered elderly and their incarceration costs are three to nine times greater than those of younger prisoners  billion a year over all  billion of that for medical and endoflife care  One reason for our overstuffed prisons is the aging of the entire population of baby boomers The other is the flurry of stricter sentencing policies in the s that put more people in prison for longer periods of time  According to an ACLU report in    this combination has effectively turned many of our correctional facilities into veritable nursing homes A report published by Human Rights Watch called   echoed the concern  Prisons were never designed to be geriatric facilities it said Yet United States correction officials now operate old age homes behind bars Prison is no place to grow old Older prisoners in pain may be denied appropriate medication because prisons do not dispense narcotics Those with brittle bones may be left to sleep on hard cots with thin mattresses Ill and frail prisoners may be without adequate blankets in the cold of winter and risk dehydration and worse in the summer  Those with dementia may become lost on the way down long hallways unable to find their cells their behavioral outbursts lead to verbal abuse even being chained to their beds by guards who dont have to skills to handle them Prisoners with mobility issues find themselves assigned to top bunks and asked to rise from their wheelchairs for inspections Retribution can shade into vengeance Jamie Fellner author of the Human Rights Watch report wrote in   While being old shouldnt be an automatic getoutofjailfree card infirmity and illness can change the calculus of what justice requires  More than  states have laws  variously called medical parole compassionate release or geriatric release   that permit the older prisoners to apply for an early exit Some of the statutes exempt those who have committed serious or violent offenses It was via New York States medical parole provision that Mr Marshall gained his controversial release Wheelchair bound he has Parkinsons disease and congestive heart failure he was believed to be the oldest nonviolent prisoner in the state system But it is rare experts say for less privileged inmates to have his network of advocates and private lawyers many older prisoners dont even realize they may be legally entitled to release Among those who wrote letters regarding Mr Marshalls suitability for release only the Manhattan District Attorney opposed it citing the significance of raising public awareness about the silent epidemic of elder abuse which  as it was in the Astor case  is far more often financial than physical rarely reported in families rich or poor and thus not considered real abuse by far too many people    If Mr Marshalls conviction sent a strong message about the unacceptability of elder abuse what does his release say Despite his age and fragile health Mr Marshall unlike the more typical prisoner had not experienced the accelerated aging that Ms Maschi and others have reported among the poor Disproportionate numbers suffer chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes longstanding substance abuse or mental health issues and exposure to routine violence at home or in the street  Layer the ill effects of the prison experience on top of that and an inmate with the chronological age of  generally is the biological equivalent of a yearold Ms Maschi has found Mr Marshall by comparison had ailments typical of a man his age not one  years younger  He certainly did qualify medically for release said Ms Fellner in an interview But clearly strings were pulled so one person got a great deal  Ms Maschi feels the decision to release Mr Marshall  when so many poorer elderly prisoners are not  demonstrated racial bias Imagine a black face and poverty and that case wouldnt have been treated the same she said Thered have been a harsher sentence and no compassionate release  Yes Mr Marshall is so frail that he poses no risk to society Dr Mosqueda said Still incarceration is in part a message to society about what is and isnt acceptable Mr Marshalls conviction and imprisonment confirmed that elder abuse was a crime with or without blackandblue marks  That he was released scares me she added What does it say to other adult children
