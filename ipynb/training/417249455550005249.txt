In the early s a team of researchers decided to follow about  volunteer families  some poor some middle class some rich  during the first three years of their new childrens lives Every month the researchers recorded an hour of sound from the families homes Later in the lab the team listened back and painstakingly tallied up the total number of words spoken in each household  came to be known as the word gap It turned out by the age of  children born into lowincome families heard roughly  million fewer words than their more affluent peers Research since then has revealed that the word gap factors into a compounding achievement gap between the poor and the betteroff in school and life The word gap remains as wide today and   from Stanford University found an intellectual processing gap appearing as early as  months That study led to some increased   but some say thats not early enough I recognized that we need to really start in the cradle says Angel Taveras mayor of Providence RI He says twothirds of kindergarteners in the city show up on their first day already behind national literacy benchmarks Next month with funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies Taveras city will launch   a new effort to take on the word gap Providence will distribute small recording devices  essentially word pedometers  that tuck into the vest of a childs clothing These will automatically record and calculate the number of words spoken and the number of times a parent and child quickly ask and answer each others questions We are very hopeful that we can be the laboratory here in Providence and as we have success we can share it with the rest of the country Taveras says The idea was inspired in part by a research program called   in Chicago Aneisha Newell says that program taught her to talk to her young daughter in new ways She says she never realized bath time  with colors and shapes of bubbles and toys to describe  could be a teachable moment She ended up breaking the programs record for the most words spoken And then there was the moment her daughter  not yet  years old  used the word ridiculous correctly Newell was amazed It was just something that made me feel good as a parent she says Progress like Newells stems from a special kind of parentchild interaction says Dana Suskind a professor of surgery and pediatrics at the University of Chicago who started the  Million Words program We cant just have people saying  million times stop it Its got to be much more she says The parent should tune in to what the child is looking at talk about it and ask questions that can create a sort of serve and return between parent and child Suskind says that research shows overhearing a cell phone conversation or sitting in front of a television program doesnt cut it when it comes to building a childs brain She and others hope to expand their style of training to day care centers and beyond She says she hopes to eventually have it be routine for parents to learn about this at their newborns first hearing screening She wants them to understand that their talk matters well before their baby starts talking back
