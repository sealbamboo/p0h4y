Judith Stein got a call from her mother recently reporting that a friend was in the hospital Be sure shes admitted Ms Stein said  As   she has gotten all too savvy about this stuff Of course shes admitted her mother said Didnt I just tell you she was in the hospital But like a sharply growing number of Medicare beneficiaries her mothers friend would soon learn that she could spend a day or three in a hospital bed could be monitored and treated by doctors and nurses  and never be formally admitted to the hospital She was   and therefore an outpatient As I wrote last year the distinction can have serious consequences The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services tried to clarify this confusing situation in the spring with a policy popularly known as the twomidnight rule When a physician expects a patients stay to include at least two midnights that person is an inpatient whose care is covered under Medicare Part A which pays for hospitals If it doesnt last two midnights Medicare expects the person to be an outpatient and Part B which pays for doctors takes over Its rare to have hospital and nursing home administrators physicians and patient advocates all agreeing about a Medicare policy but in this case theres unanimity of dislike said   director of the Families and Health Care Project of the United Hospital Fund Despite   the rule took effect on Oct  but Medicare agreed to delay penalties for  days Meanwhile administrators at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore have taken to calling the policy the Cinderella Rule said Amy Deutschendorf senior director of clinical resource management If you cross two midnights youre an inpatient If not youre a pumpkin Being a pumpkin can cost patients a lot of money Under Part B theyre billed separately for every procedure and visit and drug and the copays can mount until patients owe hundreds or thousands of dollars  which they may only discover upon receiving the bills People are shocked Ms Levine said Nobody is required to tell them theyre outpatients Except in New York State where the governor just signed legislation requiring that Medicare beneficiaries be informed of their observation status and be able to appeal it More expensive though are the fees at rehab places or nursing homes which Medicare will pay for after three days of inpatient care Those whove been outpatients dont qualify for that benefit and can find themselves on the hook for fivefigure sums So patients are complaining and so are hospitals Older people in emergency rooms often have complex problems and they are strangers to the physicians who must decide whether to admit them or not Nobody looking at the patients who come through the door can predict whos going to be here for two midnights Ms Deutschendorf said Yet a hospital that admits patients who dont need two midnights worth of care may face Medicare audits denied payments fraud accusations and financial penalties Johns Hopkins at least gives observation patients an information sheet telling them theyre outpatients to forestall later shock But it causes them angst and results in deteriorating patientphysician relationships Ms Deutschendorf said She estimated that under the new rule observation stays will double We dont want to be the bad guys here she said Hospitals will lose money too it appears since Part A reimburses at higher rates than Part B An   at the University of Wisconsin Hospital recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that they accounted for more than a quarter of adult general medicine stays The hospital lost about  for each adult general medicine inpatient the difference between cost and reimbursement for observation patients it lost nearly    have found that observation costs less however Money matters of course but opponents of the twomidnight rule also point out that it lacks logic Hospital care is hospital care Ms Deutschendorf said But not always Say Patient X arrives at the emergency room complaining of chest pains at  pm on Tuesday and gets discharged from the hospital on Thursday morning after breakfast Patient X will have stayed for two midnights so he was an inpatient covered by Medicare Part A Say Patient Y arrives with the same condition five minutes later at three minutes past midnight on Wednesday morning and also leaves Thursday Patient Y stayed only one midnight so even if he received precisely the same care hes a pumpkin facing higher Part B copays Moreover if Patient X receives medically necessary services and gets discharged Friday morning instead of Thursday he will have stayed three days and so Medicare will cover rehab care if he cant safely go home Patient Y has been an outpatient so even after three days hell have to pay for rehab himself What patient advocates really want is to get rid of that threeday hospitalization requirement for the Medicare nursing home benefit But the odds dont look encouraging Last month a federal court in Connecticut   brought by the Center for Medicare Advocacy and the National Senior Citizens Law Center seeking to overturn the rule They have decided to appeal Therefore federal officials at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will not comment Legislation to allow any time spent in a hospital  as an inpatient or outpatient or both  to count toward the threeday requirement for skilled nursing coverage has gone nowhere in two Congresses but it has acquired more than  House sponsors from both parties and more than  in the Senate That may be the more likely situation someday Meanwhile families should at least ask as the staff members fasten the plastic ID bracelet around a relatives wrist Is she an inpatient Or an outpatient
