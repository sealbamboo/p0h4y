Acting Surgeon General Boris Lushniak is the latest in a long line of surgeons general who have tried to pound the final nails into the coffin of Americas smoking habit Enough is enough Lushniak   But theres no reason to think his   on smoking and health  the nd in a   that stretches back  years  will do the trick Smokings persistence isnt for lack of evidence about the harms it causes The latest report which tops  pages contains an impressive list of disorders newly deemed to be caused by smoking They include diabetes facial deformities in babies born to smoking mothers liver and colorectal cancer agerelated macular degeneration ectopic pregnancy rheumatoid arthritis and erectile dysfunction to name a few The newly recognized harms arent limited to smokers Secondhand smoke raises the risk of stroke by up to  percent Smoking really is even worse than we knew   director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells Shots Half of all longterm smokers will die from a smokingrelated disease with the annual toll now about  people Frieden says smoking is more lethal than it used to be Even though the Americans who smoke are smoking fewer cigarettes the risk of dying among smokers is increasing he notes quoting the new report The trend is striking Between  and  the risk of lung cancer among women jumped from about three times that of those who never smoked to  times Among men who smoke the lung cancer rate more than doubled from  times to  times the risk of neversmokers The CDC says changes in cigarette design and composition since the s have shifted the pattern of lung cancers from a type called squamous cell carcinomas to adenocarcinomas Thats one reason why smoking has become more deadly However the pattern of changes in risk and death rates in other diseases caused by smoking make it difficult to sort out what specific aspects of smoking are most responsible for increased risk of dying prematurely due to smoking CDC spokesman Joel London writes in an email Whatever the reason the report conveys a new sense of urgency If we dont act now Frieden says  million of our children will be killed by tobacco based on current rates of smoking among adolescents and young adults And   million children in middle and high school now smoke according to the new report  youths start smoking every day About  million US adults are smokers or  percent Thats progress compared with  percent at the time of the first surgeon generals report in  but its not going down fast enough to meet a  goal of  percent Many of the antismoking actions proposed in the report are familiar raise cigarette taxes fund more public education increase the legal age for buying cigarettes from  to  But theres one new wrinkle Behavioral psychologist   says this report makes a significant distinction between the harmfulness of burning tobacco and less harmful ways of delivering the nicotine that keeps people addicted The report concludes that cigarettes and other combusted tobacco products should be eliminated That is new because it implies that less harmful forms of getting ones nicotine  especially if one cannot quit smoking cigarettes  may be acceptable Abrams tells Shots Those allegedly less harmful   include   along with nicotine patches gums nasal sprays inhalers and lozenges Ecigarettes are electronic cigarettelike devices that dont burn tobacco They release nicotine in a vapor that doesnt contain the toxic chemicals that cause most of smokings harm Abrams helped write the reports last chapter on the changing landscape of tobacco control He works for   an antitobacco group set up as part of a    with the tobacco industry Abrams thinks ecigarettes could help wean millions away from cigarettes For the first time in a century he says we have an appealing alternative way to give addicted current smokers a satisfying way to give up their combusted products He calls this a   strategy that would be a big change from the totalabstinence approach of current tobacco control efforts Its sort of like condoms or cleanneedle exchanges to prevent HIV infection And it promises to be   The CDCs Frieden for one is a skeptic It might be possible that things like ecigarettes in the future will have a positive role he says As theyre being rolled out now I have grave concerns that theyre doing more harm than good
