American doctor and Ebola survivor   had senators in Congress riveted this week as he told them the story of a patient named Francis Francis lived in Liberias capital and as he lay dying of Ebola he told Brantly he knew how he had gotten infected while helping a sick neighbor into a taxi If someone had come alongside Francis and given him a little bit of education and provided him with the protective equipment he needed Brantly said his family would still have their father and their son and their brother  and the world might still have this good Samaritan That kind of protective equipment is in kits the US government will soon distribute to families in Liberia Whats inside one of these kits Its a bucket that contains a sprayer which is used for disinfectants rolls of bags for capturing infected garments or items says USAIDs   There are also gloves gowns masks soap and some chlorine she says USAID plans to distribute the kits to  households across Liberia The first  kits are arriving next week Lindborg says Kits like these have been distributed in previous Ebola outbreaks but never on this scale The big question is Can these kits help slow the spread of the virus In previous outbreaks the question was Is it better to try to take care of people at home with these sorts of kits or should we really focus on getting people into Ebola treatment units  says   an infectious disease specialist at Tulane University who is advising the US government on Ebola But thats not an option now with this outbreak There have been more than  Ebola cases reported across Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea More than  people have died the World Health Organization   Friday There are very few treatment centers in Liberia where more than half of the cases have occurred So people are taking care of their family members at home They dont have a choice On Tuesday President Obama   that the US military would help to build  new treatment centers with a total of  beds But thats going to take time Until we can do that I think we have to be honest Bausch says and we have to offer people protections and what care we can even though its far from ideal But the kits arent meant to provide treatment USAID says For instance they dont contain Tylenol for fevers Or rehydration salts to help replace fluids lost through vomiting and diarrhea The agency says the most important item in the kit is an information pamphlet telling people how to protect themselves Although the items in the kits wont completely protect a family member or friend caring for someone with Ebola Bausch says every little bit helps Rather than having five infected people from a sick person in a home if we can cut that down to three obviously thats a good thing Bausch says
