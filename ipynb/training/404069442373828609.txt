As a drug marijuana has certain effects and depending on why youre taking it some side effects And not everyone wants the whole package New research finds that for patients who consider weeds buzz an unwanted side effect the answer might be as simple as taking an ibuprofen with their tetrahydrocannibinol or THC A   published Thursday in the journal Cell both demonstrates and explains why common antiinflammatory drugs including ibuprofen and the prescription analgesics indomethacin and celecoxib marketed as Celebrex appear to kill marijuanas buzz and suppress its negative effects on cognition In so doing the research may clear the way for marijuana to play a growing role in treating Alzheimers disease and other neurodegenerative conditions If you want to get high weeds ability to mellow you out is the desired effect But with regular use marijuana stunts the growth of the tendrils that lash brain cells together and impairs memory and cognitive processing speed That package of effectandsideeffect appears to be inseparable But marijuana also has a notsowidely known effect it calms inflammation in the brain  a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers dementia multiple sclerosis and Parkinsons disease The problem is that for patients who might benefit from marijuanas inflammationdampening effect both the high and its downstream impact on brain cells and memory are distinctly unhelpful That package of effectandsideeffect it turns out can be separated and the unwanted side effect can be suppressed by inhibiting the induction of cyclooxygenase COX a complex neurochemical process usually set off by inflammation To their surprise the researchers found that the THC in marijuana actually increases the COX process  a finding that would suggest it has both inflammatory and antiinflammatory effects on the brain Add a COX inhibitor to the mix  or even a nonselective COX inhibitor such as ibuprofen  and the antiinflammatory effects of THC remain The buzz the lethargy and negative cognitive effects of longterm use however are extinguished While marijuana is approved for medicinal use in  US states and the District of Columbia THC  marketed as Marinol  is approved for marketing by the Food  Drug Administration only to patients with nausea and vomiting resulting from chemotherapy The federal agency cites its potential for abuse and its intoxicating side effects as limiting its effectiveness for a wider array of medicinal indications The researchers all from the Louisiana State Universitys School of Medicine conducted a series of experiments on cells in the lab and in mice To demonstrate the buzzkilling effects of suppressing the COX process they used mice bred without the gene that enables it and also suppressed the process with medications They also used mice to establish that the mechanics of THCs antiinflammatory effects are different from those of its intoxicating effects Mice bred to develop the betaamyloid plaques of Alzheimers disease were given THC and a COX inhibitor over many days and the researchers watched as the mix of medications reduced amyloid plaques In the process they noted the absence of the usual lethargy seen in stoned mice and of the memoryimpairing effects on brain cells that come with chronic use of THC Read more
