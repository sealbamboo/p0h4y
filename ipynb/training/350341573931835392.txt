Twenty percent of strokes hit people under age  and the cause of many of those strokes remains a mystery Having had a concussion or other traumatic brain injury might make the risk of a stroke more likely a study says Back in  researchers in Taiwan had   an association between traumatic brain injury and stroke by combing through hospital records Its one of those Oh really findings that gets scientists itching to check it out themselves Researchers at the University of Michigan and the   took on the challenge They dug through billing records from emergency rooms in California from  to  They found more than  people who had come to the ER with a traumatic brain injury Those people were  percent more likely to have a stroke afterwards than people who hadnt had a traumatic brain injury A little over one percent of them ended up having a stroke later on The   were published online in the journal   The researchers found that people under age  were more likely to have a stroke after a TBI than were people over  That said the  for someone under age  is low so raising the relative risk by  percent has very little impact on an individuals risk Still there are a lot of people out there who have had a concussion or other brain injury at some point in their lives To find out how much we should be concerned Shots called up   the studys lead author and just days away from becoming an assistant professor at the University of Michigan He says that when he saw the Taiwanese study he spotted some goofs in the methodology that he figured accounted for the finding I thought we would not find the same thing he says So he was surprised to find an association between TBI and stroke in the California data and even more surprised to find that it persisted despite efforts to find other reasons I think the associations real Burke told Shots The question is what does it mean What it doesnt necessarily mean is that TBIs cause strokes or even increase the risk of stroke It may be that people who have TBIs are already in poor health or that their general health declines after the brain injury increasing stroke riskThis study couldnt measure that If TBI does turn out to increase stroke risk the most plausible reason would be that the TBI injures blood vessels in the brain making them more vulnerable The increased risk was found in   which is caused by a blood clot blocking a vessel in the brain People who have had a concussion or other brain injury shouldnt fret Burke says Instead they should do what we should all do reduce stroke risk by maintaining a healthful blood pressure and be aware of   since immediate treatment of ischemic stroke with a clotbusting drug greatly reduces the risk of disability and death
