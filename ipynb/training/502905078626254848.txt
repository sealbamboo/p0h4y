A fungus called   can cause lifethreatening infections especially in people with compromised immune systems Onethird of AIDSrelated deaths are thought to be caused by the fungus But though people in Southern California have been getting sick from   for years nobody knew how Eucalyptus trees were a prime suspect since they harbor the fungus in Australia But even though eucalyptus trees grow like crazy in Southern California the fungus hasnt been found on eucalyptus there A different form of the  has been making people sick in the Pacific Northwest where it grows on Douglas fir trees But there are no Doug firs in Los Angeles We had a good idea that the fungus was going to be associated with trees says   a postdoctoral fellow at Duke University who studies   We just didnt know what trees And she didnt have the time to find out But someone did Elan Filler a th grader who was looking for a science fair project Her dad   an infectious disease specialist at the University of California Los Angeles ran into   Springers advisor at a conference and told him about Elan Heitman told Springer Elan Filler and Springer connected on email and figured out a plan Soon Elan was making her way around greater Los Angeles swabbing tree trunks and growing out the fungus in Petri dishes None of the eucalyptus trees in the first batch she gathered tested positive for   so she expanded her tests to include more types of trees Springer analyzed the genetic fingerprints of fungi in the samples that Elan sent to North Carolina Bingo   from three trees Canary Island pine New Zealand pohutukawa and American sweet gum matched almost exactly with   from infected patients And the tree samples matched not just those from recent patients but from people who were sick  to  years ago Thus this strain of   has been causing health problems in California for at least that long The  were published Thursday in  People living or traveling in California should be aware of the risk of   from   Springer tells Shots especially if they have HIVAIDS cancer or other illnesses that can suppress the immune system When you travel and youre exposed to these reservoirs you have the potential to be vulnerable to these infections Early   helps reduce the risk of death or disability according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Elan Filler is named as an author on the study not a bad credit for someone who just turned  I was very lucky that she was interested in doing this and that she did a fantastic job Springer says of her junior colleague Indeed This spring Filler now a high school junior won the Los Angeles County science fair for another project on pathogenic fungi and attended the big daddy of science fairs the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair
