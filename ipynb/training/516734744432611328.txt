More than half of stillbirths in the UK could be prevented if the NHS implemented additional scans a leading obstetrician has told Panorama Each year more than  babies are stillborn in the UK one of the worst rates in the developed world  Prof Kypros Nicolaides says offering all women Doppler scans which measure blood flow between the placenta and foetus could save  babies a year The Department of Health said it has asked him to submit his research  Threequarters of a million babies are born in the UK each year One in  dies before birth mostly to mothers with no known risk factors  Many deaths are caused by a failure in the mothers placenta  if the blood flow is abnormal babies are starved of food and oxygen  Often the problems occur towards the end of pregnancy but if identified the baby can be monitored carefully and delivered by Caesarean before the placenta fails This can be spotted by a Doppler scan but most hospitals use these only on the  of women who are deemed high risk  as per national guidelines  All pregnant women who attend Prof Nicolaides NHS clinic at Kings College Hospital in London are offered the Doppler scan at   and  weeks of pregnancy Prof Nicolaides is regarded by many as the father of foetal medicine as he was the scientist and obstetrician who developed the week Downs Syndrome scan still given to every pregnant woman in the UK He has been researching Doppler scans for  years and believes extending the programme across the UK could cut the stillbirth rate by as much as   potentially  babies a year Mayan was my first baby I always felt fear People would talk about how they could feel their baby kicking hard But I only felt flutters I raised my concerns with the midwife She put me at ease saying some babies dont kick hard I wasnt offered any extra scans Then one morning at  weeks I woke up feeling odd I hadnt felt my son move I went to the hospital It never occurred to me my son would be dead The midwife couldnt find a heartbeat That was when they told me I was sent home for two days Then I had to give birth to him After Mayan was born I was put in the bereavement suite for five hours My husband bathed and dressed our baby He looked perfect But I just wanted to go home I didnt want Mayan to have a postmortem But I did send my placenta for postmortem The postmortem results said my placenta was too small I always felt my baby was very small But the midwives never questioned the size of my bump The midwives measured me with tape but I wasnt offered any kind of scan Ive since found out that if Id had later scans Mayans difficulties in the womb would have been spotted He could have been born earlier and lived in an incubator He could have survived We have demonstrated through extensive research that you can identify more than  of those cases from the week assessment Prof Nicolaides said We can easily avoid them and we can do so through very simple adjustments in the way we deliver antenatal care He offers the additional scans with the support of Kings administrators but consultants at other hospitals have been told to stop because they were acting outside NHS practice guidelines Anne Mackie director of programmes at the UK National Screening Committee said We will make contact with Prof Nicolaides and attempt to understand what he proposes Any proposal is assessed against our robust set of internationally recognised criteria before we can recommend any screening but we always welcome new evidence St Georges Hospital in London has also introduced the scan to all firsttime mothers at  weeks which costs  per mother if given at the same time as a foetal anomaly scan Since this introduction the hospital has seen its stillbirth rate drop by  in three years  Prof Basky Thilaganthana a leading obstetrician based at St Georges agrees a lot of trusts would love to have a figure like that But he says a clinical control trial is needed before the Doppler scan can be rolled out across the UK   In the meantime NHS England is encouraging hospital trusts to adopt an even cheaper method of cutting stillbirth rates  by up to  So far almost twothirds of hospital trusts have signed up Prof Jason Gardosi director of the Perinatal Institute in Birmingham set up the Growth Assisted Protocol GAP which costs p per pregnancy It works by giving each mother a customised growth chart developed using her height weight at beginning of pregnancy ethnic origin and how many children she has had It tells her how large her baby is expected to be for each week in the pregnancy and if the babys growth falls outside the expected norm for that individual woman the mother is given extra scans to check that the baby is thriving  If the baby needs help he or she can be treated in the womb The baby is delivered early if careful monitoring shows that the baby is still struggling A Department of Health spokesman said The NHS is working on better ways of detecting growth restriction in unborn babies NHS Englands Strategic Clinical Networks for maternity and children are working to increase training for staff and to introduce a specific package to improve detection of growth restriction The NHS is a safe place to give birth with women reporting high levels of trust and confidence in staff Watch Panorama Born Asleep
