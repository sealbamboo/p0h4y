Agapi Stassinopoulos and her sister Ariana Huffington were raised by an extraordinary woman who encouraged them to live with open hearts have faith in their talents and ask for what they want in life Their beloved   Elli Stassinopoulos passed away  years ago but it is apparent her soulful wisdom translated into a healthy approach to life for both of her accomplished daughters Each in her own way has inspired others and had great impact Agapi as a bestselling author and inspirational speaker who spent  years sharing the wisdom of the Greek goddesses in her books and performances and Arianna as a highpowered and respected media star who founded The Huffington Post and now guides AOL Agapis new book   Hay House offers a revealing look into their childhood and how it was shaped by a courageous mother who encouraged her girls to truly celebrate life with joy  despite any challenges that might come their way Agapi weaves a fascinating portrait of the seeds of empowerment planted by their mom despite her own pain and heartache Agapi and Ariannas parents met shortly after the end of World War II  when her mother was recovering from her work with the Red Cross and her dad Constantine Stassinopoulos had just been released from a concentration camp where he had been imprisoned for publishing an underground newspaper in support of the resistance They fell deeply in love but their   was stormy Her father left when Agapi was  and Arianna was  leaving a wound that would take a long time to heal In the end he asked for forgiveness but his departure left the family with few financial resources Somehow her mother always made things work When Agapi was  for example she Arianna then  and their mother were on the way to a George Bernard Shaw play in Athens when her mom realized shed left behind her purse which contained money the tickets and the keys to the house Rather than panic she said Well find a solution Elli went to the supers apartment to borrow money for cab fare and dinner After the meal they headed to the theater and she charmed the manager into letting them have their seats even without the tickets And when they got home she crossed the street to the local fire station and asked the chief to send a ladder and a firefighter up to their third floor window and then open the door from inside to let them in The chief went into the apartment himself She was so amazing thats why I wanted to share her wisdom Agapi told   in a recent interview She showed a tremendous trust in the universe and in life that things will work out Agapi who has a Masters degree in Spiritual Psychology from the University of Santa Monica and is a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London also draws on her Greek culture to encourage readers to embrace healthy approaches to life In her Huffington Post blog and in her book her favorite tips include Here are highlights from our talk with her  Things happen throughout the day that we do not voice  not that we have to pay homage or build a temple to our feelings but we have to honor our emotions and give them their right place and time Many times we get tired or afraid or we feel like we dont want to go to work and face people or are overwhelmed by negative emotions Maybe we need more attention more love more companionship or we want someone to listen to us Whatever it is we often deny it and just say Im fine We get on with our day but we dont voice what is really true inside We put it under the bed and close the door  or we lock it in the closet That is one way we bind our hearts Also so many people feel alone because they are not really   themselves It is a binding when you check out on yourself withdraw or judge yourself  Yes thats life in Greece There is an exuberance that helps with emotional health Nobody ever just   Nobody is ever fine There is communication People interact When you run into someone on the street or in a store and you ask How are you you hear Im upset Im tired Im fed up Im frustrated The idea is to put words on how youre feeling And then if you name it you take authority over it  One day I knocked on a door and there was nothing There was suffocation inside Finally little by little I started to open what I called the river or faucet within I realized I had things to say and I could say them that I was permitted to say them I realized that all of my life was a blessing because the journey led me to   I discovered were not what we appear to be There is a gap between what happens inside ourselves our inner life and what we present outside I think everybody has this  this being we are inside thats very vulnerable and very human Unbinding is joining the flow of life and embracing how you really feel and who you really are  Yes For example when I was in England in drama school I tried to be more English to fit in to the school The principal actually said to me We got you into the drama school because we liked   We dont want you to conform and be like us We want you to give us what you have  this juiciness this exuberance I think all my life I tried to fit in I tried to fit in the acting world in Hollywood and because I was not getting hired I started to feel less than When we dont fit in we start to adjust ourselves My mother used to say Find yourself and let others fit in to you Its about your truth  I would call it your inheritance Its your birthright We are all part of the cosmos part of the breath of life Therefore I know in my heart of hearts that we have that energy that love that spirit inside of us It causes us to forgive ourselves for anything we may be holding against ourselves This is the path of healing of selfesteem of feeling good about yourself of taking yourself into account of honoring yourself and having a lot of compassion for yourself If people had more compassion for themselves and each other this world would be so wonderful  My mom raised us with a sense of learning to have a good time and to celebrate In the midst of her struggles  financial and with my Dad who betrayed her and broke her heart in many ways  she had faith to bring the joy back in our lives and bring a sense of celebration For her having a good time was very important She would say to me Darling if youre not enjoying yourself dont go If this person is bringing your energy down get out of there If it is a toxic person you might as well be by yourself and enjoy your own company I would say to her Mommy youre by yourself are you not lonely And she would say Im by myself but I am not alone because I am   myself She had this amazing perspective  She felt that she was really in control and could make herself happy So if you are feeling disappointed or depressed she would say Change the channel She had her own   and frustrations but as life went on she followed the wisdom of Jiddu Krishnamurti and other teachers She had a philosophy of loving nature She would walk barefooted on the earth when it rained and look up and say Blessings blessings blessings If she felt depressed she would go the supermarket and buy things for other people She would do things that would reach out and touch people That was her way of connecting For her part of the emotional health is when we connect  It ultimately comes to two channels Are you connected or are you disconnected I find that when I am disconnected Ill tell my sister or my   Im really off So ask How do you reconnect Perhaps you can reconnect through your breath through resting by making yourself something great to eat or through creativity When I get really low and feeling out of sorts I start to write or I start to help someone else and suddenly everything connects  We are very close  and very different We have each others hearts Weve have a tremendous love and protection for each other and its one of the greatest blessings in my life and in her life Arianna had grounding in the world She was very assertive and very fast forward I was more of the artistic type the dreamer and had a tremendous sensitivity Im still sensitive but Ive become much stronger She mentored me in finding my strengths the world She would say things like Dont do this because people want you to do it  do what you want to do Do the things that are true for you So she helped me be true to myself and strengthened me I brought a lot of nurturing to her life  a lot of playfulness and fun because I have a very   She is much more of the Athena Shes able to let go of things very fast while I process more Part of her gift is also validating other people  thats what Arianna does a lot  Exactly She never compared us I was great at ballet and she never said to Arianna Dance like your sister dances Shes so good and charismatic She said Darling dance is not for youyoure not going to do dancing She set us up to love and support each other  Looking at others as role models is great You can look at Madonna and say Isnt this inspirational that in her fifties shes kept herself in top shape Maybe we cant dance at the Super Bowl but perhaps we can go exercise If we look at others as inspiration its wonderful My mother used to say I love myself enough Think about what gives you pleasure and get into the habit of doing things that uplift you Put yourself on your todo list  Yes Make yourself No  We think its selfish or that were not worthy Being healthy every day is really a very practical thing and boils down to How you eat how you sleep how you feed your body what your thoughts are what you tell yourself your relationship to spirit and the friends that nurture you Ultimately what nurtures us is being loving because love is the well inside of us We bind it by thinking that it is outside but it isnt Our hearts are naturally loving From my perspective what makes people extraordinary is their ability to love If we have lived a life of love acceptance giving kindness and tenderness thats what we take with us I watched my parents take their last breaths and in that moment there is nothing else but love  Unbinding the Heart
