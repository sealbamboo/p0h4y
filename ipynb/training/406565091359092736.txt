An invention to help with obstructed labor has turned some heads  and not just because the idea came from a party trick on YouTube The   created by Argentine car mechanic Jorge Odon   a folded plastic sleeve around the babys head A little bit of air is then pumped between the two plastic layers cushioning the babys head and allowing it to be sucked out This   for removing a cork from an empty wine bottle works the same way The device has been embraced by the World Health Organization and is being   by the global medical technology company BD Once clinical trials are done the WHO and individual countries will have to approve it before its sold BD hasnt said how much it will charge but each one is expected to cost less than  to make If proven safe and effective a   on Odons invention said the Odon Device will be the first innovation in operative vaginal delivery since the development of forceps centuries ago and vacuum extractor decades ago The Odon device shows that good ideas can come from anyone and anywhere says   director of USAIDs Center for Accelerating Innovation and Impact If youre in the business of innovating she says theres no need to strive for mechanical complexity Some of the biggest breakthroughs are cheap and simple And she says the strategy for scaling something up for worldwide use is just as important as the innovation itself One of the crowning innovations in preventing death during childbirth was convincing doctors to   in between handling corpses and delivering babies And many argue that fancier tools are just part of a tradition of   that circumvented the   gravity With that in mind here are five ideas that struck us as innovative and surprising some more likely to succeed than others A team at the University of California San Francisco created a   to check whether a woman is about to go into labor The device can detect changes in the collagen of the cervix The softening of collagen as the cervix opens is a telltale sign a babys on its way Information from the caps sensors can be transmitted to a nearby cellphone which can send the data to a doctor The device can be inserted briefly once a day without a professionals help A team at Massachusetts General Hospital developed a   to stop postpartum hemorrhage It consists of a condom tied to a catheter Water from the catheter fills the condom in the uterus creating pressure that can stop the bleeding The kit has been tested successfully in South Sudan and Kenya A similar tool in the US can cost more than  each Mass General says compared with less than  each for the simple balloon kit Athletes stretch their muscles before a race why not do the same before birth Thats the thinking behind a device by Materna Medical currently being evaluated in clinical trials in Australia Over the course of one to three hours during early labor it   the vaginal canal from the usual diameter of  centimeters to the fully expanded size required to pass a baby about  to  centimeters Though the product description includes bracing terms like forcecontrolled and semiautomatic its supposed to make birth gentler on Mom This   can inflate to the size of a football In practice it doesnt get wider than a standard grapefruit In the weeks leading up to delivery the Germanmade pelvic floor muscle exerciser is intended to stretch vaginal muscles so that they dont tear during birth The invention was supposedly inspired by the traditional use of gourds in some African countries for the same purpose Patented in  by George and Charlotte Blonsky the Blonsky Device is an apparatus for facilitating the birth of a child by centrifugal force It looks medieval and works like a centrifuge The soontobemother is strapped to a table which rotates at high speed until the baby shoots out into a carefully placed net  about as close as birth gets to a slam dunk The inventors   an Ig Nobel Prize for their um ingenuity and were honored with a miniopera about the patent
