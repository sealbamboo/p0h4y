Many children cannot run as fast as their parents could when they were young a study of global fitness says  Experts say the work  being presented at the   annual meeting  suggests childrens fitness levels may be declining  Researchers analysed data spanning  years and involving more than  million children in  countries  On average children today run a mile  seconds slower than did their counterparts  years ago they said Across nations cardiovascular endurance  gauged by how far children can run in a set time  has dwindled consistently by about  every decade according to the findings  The decline is seen in boys and girls and across all ages from nine to  years and is linked to obesity with some countries faring worse than others Lead researcher Dr Grant Tomkinson of the University of South Australias School of Health Sciences said In fact about  to  of the declines in endurance running performance can be explained by increases in fat mass The problem is largely one of Western countries but some parts of Asia like South Korea mainland China and Hong Kong are also seeing this phenomenon  Dr Tomkinson said children needed to be inspired and encouraged to do more vigorous exercise  If not the public health consequences could be dire If a young person is generally unfit now then they are more likely to develop conditions like heart disease later in life said Dr Tomkinson  To stay healthy children and young people need to do    such as walking or cycling to school and running in the playground  every day It can be done in small chunks rather than one session Prof Michael Gwitz of the American Heart Association said The type of exercise is really important He says exercise must be something that makes you sweat and is sustained and dynamic to promote cardiovascular fitness Simply going to the gym or belonging to a school sports team might not be enough unless you are moving around a lot  Christopher Allen of the British Heart Foundation said Its well established that being physically inactive in childhood can have serious health implications later in life  Keeping active can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and the sooner kids start the better  By encouraging children to get active we can help protect their hearts as they grow up Parents schools and community groups can all help kids on their way to  minutes exercise a day
