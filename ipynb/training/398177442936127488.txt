A big polluter could be blazing inside your kitchen its blue flames glowing under your tea kettle or frying pan A new study says cooking with a gas stove can expose you to unhealthy levels of air pollution After testing gas ranges to determine their pollution output researchers used data on more than  Southern California households and their cooking habits to estimate peoples exposure to air pollutants in the kitchen during a typical week in the winter Even in Los Angeles those pollutants dont exceed air quality standards outdoors said Brett Singer a staff scientist who studies indoor air quality at Berkeley Lab But inside homes they do The findings have wide implications because half of California homes have gas burners and most of them do not use range hoods that capture fumes and vent them to the outside About onethird of households nationwide use gas burners for cooking according to   published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives In all the scientists estimate that as many as  million Californians are exposed to levels of nitrogen dioxide above health standards as a result of cooking with gas burners Nationally there could be tens of millions more The concern over stovetops may seem surprising because air pollution has typically been viewed as an outdoor problem  something spewed out by smokestacks and exhaust pipes said Jennifer Logue a research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and lead author of the study But cooking on a gas burner inside your home means burning fuel in a much more confined space where the resulting pollutants cant easily escape or dilute particularly if there is no ventilation to the outside she said Luckily there are simple ways to limit your exposure First use a range hood Even a moderately effective one will substantially cut concentrations of pollutants in your home researchers said Cooking on the back burners can help too because they sit directly under the ventilation system This is not meant to scare people away from cooking Logue said People are very used to cooking so they dont think about it They dont use their range hood because they dont consider it a hazard Our study really looked at that problem and how significant it is
