The number of Boston bombing victims still in the hospital dropped to  as of Wednesday evening The great majority have gone home or to a rehab facility Thats what has happened with   a motherdaughter pair who ended up in the same hospital room after being struck down by the first marathon bomb blast Celeste required amputations of both legs while Sydney a high school senior nearly bled to death after being struck by shrapnel Celeste whos  is impatient to get on with her life This is the worst part she tells Shots You know waiting to heal Because theres basically nothing I can do but just allowing my body to heal right now  the Boston Medical Center orthopedic surgeon who amputated her lower legs says the next phase of Celestes recovery will be a kind of holding pattern Making sure that the wounds heal he says that she maintains her mobility that she does exercises so that she doesnt lose her aerobic fitness Celeste cant be fitted with her first set of artificial legs for six to eight weeks Then shell begin a long period when the stumps of her own legs change constantly as the muscles of her legs shrink The limb changes size Creevy says and the prosthesis has to be adjusted and adjusted and adjusted Usually it eventually doesnt fit and somewhere around six eight or nine months you have to make another prosthesis She might not be steady on that second set of legs until next spring Eighteenyearold Sydney will have a faster convalescence She didnt require an amputation but her right leg was severely damaged Vascular surgeon   at Boston Medical Center says a razorsharp piece of metal the size of an iPhone  probably a fragment of the    sliced through major blood vessels in Sydneys thigh The hole in her thigh was the size of a small melon Farber says It was very large Even when we controlled the main artery and vein there was a lot of bleeding from the muscle because the shrapnel really did a job on her muscle Farber says he was able to close the wound without a skin graft Despite damage to her leg and foot he says shell be OK I think that shes going to recover well he says Its hard to predict but I suspect that shes going to recover most if not all function But the Corcorans healing is not just physical They have to recover emotionally as well That involves coping with their feelings about whoever did this to them Celeste has complicated feelings about the surviving brother accused of the crime Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Those feelings include anger On some level sure thats a natural reaction she says You know if they didnt do that I wouldnt be like this But I pity them I dont wish them any ill Does that mean she wouldnt wish for the death penalty if Tsarnaev were convicted I wouldnt want to be the one to make that decision she says If our legal system were to come to that end then so be it But Im glad that I dont have to be his judge and jury Most of all Celeste wants to put Tsarnaev out of her mind I dont want him to affect my life anymore she says I dont want to waste time thinking of this person Sydney Corcorans feelings are different I am angry and I dont think that theres going to be a time when I wont be she says Maybe it will fade but I think a part of me will always be a little angry Sydney definitely doesnt think Tsarnaev should be condemned to death if hes convicted I think its just too barbaric she says I would just wish that the younger boy would just live out his life and just have to live with the fact that he did this I dont think that a death penalty would help I would rather he would just live a very long life having to cope with this Shortly after this conversation Celeste and Sydney Corcoran said goodbye to Boston Medical Center to start the next phase of their recovery Riding hospital gurneys they passed through the emergency department where they arrived  days ago at the height of the crisis Dozens of nurses doctors and technicians who helped take care of them burst into prolonged applause You guys Celeste told them I dont know if you know the impact you have in everybodys life You see people come and go And maybe people cant thank you But we thank you from the bottom of our hearts Then she cut off further ceremony We ready I gotta stop crying she said And it was out the doors to ambulances waiting to take them to   on Boston Harbor
