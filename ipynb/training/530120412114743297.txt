Colon cancer a disease usually associated with middle age and the elderly is showing up in younger Americans new research shows Its not an alarming number yet and doesnt mean that people under  need to start getting colonoscopies doctors stressed But the trend is troubling and doctors may need to think colon cancer when younger people show up with symptoms Particularly in people between ages  and  we estimate a doubling in incidence rate of colorectal cancer said Dr George Chang of the MD Anderson Cancer Center who led the study Chang said he started the study after noticing he was operating on younger patients with colon cancer Many didnt have a family history of the disease which troubled him People with an inherited genetic tendency to cancer can develop tumors young but its less common without a DNA mutation My impression is that we have been seeing more young people today than we saw a decade ago Chang told NBC News We did our study using population data to confirm if what we were seeing in our own hospital was true for the country as a whole They looked at  patients diagnosed with colon cancer between  and  The numbers confirm what other experts have seen  colon cancer rates are going down steadily in the population as a whole Colonoscopies are responsible for a lot of this as they allow doctors to remove precancerous growths called polyps before they can ever become cancer But there was an increase in people under  Colon cancer rates rose by nearly  percent among people aged  to  over that time If the trends continue they report in the journal JAMA Surgery the number of colon cancer cases in people aged  to  will spike by nearly  percent by  and  percent by  Were talking small numbers but theyre important numbers when we talk about them possibly increasing over time Chang said Colon cancer is a big killer  the No  cause of cancer death in the United States More than  people will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year and  will die of it The numbers for people under  are very small however About  people under  get colon cancer every year and just  people under  But those numbers can add up said Chang In absolute terms we may end up with numbers that no longer will seem so small he said I wouldnt go ringing the fire bells today based on these small numbers but its something we should be aware of Whats causing the increase is not clear but several cancer experts noted that colon cancer is often caused by diet and a lack of exercise Clearly lifestyle factors impact colorectal incidence said Dr Len Lichtenfeld of the American Cancer Society We cant say for certain if thats whats causing this increase and which lifestyle factor is responsible based on this study but we do know theres been a fundamental change in our behaviors and we have to pay attention to these factors Chang said doctors should not rule out colon cancer in young people with symptoms We need to make sure were all thinking about colorectal cancer as a potential problem so that when a younger patient presents with symptoms we dont discount the possibility of colorectal cancer he said Theres been a number of national initiatives to improve diet and lifestyle and we need to promote those efforts That is the lowhanging fruit this is not strictly a colorectal phenomenon we would probably observe similar findings with other cancers if we looked for it he added
