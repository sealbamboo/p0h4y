For years Ive had a patient who is a gym teacher As you might expect hes pretty fit Well into his s he can do an impressive number of pushups as he demonstrated one morning in our exam room He surprised me in a different way at an appointment several months ago He pulled out results from medical tests that hed had done at his church He and many of his fellow congregants had each paid about  for screening tests that they were told could see if they were at risk for strokes clogged leg arteries and other problems Hed had an   which measures the hearts electrical activity Hed also had ultrasound tests performed on the big arteries in his body  the ones on both sides of his neck that feed the brain the   and the   the largest blood vessel in the human body The man was in good health He didnt smoke wasnt overweight and exercised regularly I wouldnt have ordered these tests for him They come with a risk of false alarms And in my patients case there were no medically compelling reasons for them He was disappointed when the tests showed mild carotid artery disease on one side of his neck As someone who prided himself on his health and fitness he was disturbed to learn that his results indicated that he was at risk for a stroke Though his report described the risk as mild all that mattered to him were the words disease and stroke By the time he came to see me I had to work pretty hard to calm him down My experience with this patient and others like him led to me look at the   for Life Line Screening the company that performed his tests There I found testimonials from customers who felt screening had saved their lives or at least uncovered problems before they became lifethreatening A   acknowledges there is debate about the importance  of screening for vascular disease in general The statement concludes with an admonition to always consult with your doctor as we are the ones who know you best My opinion was that my patient could have done without the tests The US Preventive Services Task Force which is the most unbiased source of recommendations on preventive care   carotid screening in healthy people too So what is the evidence for Life Lines approach Dr Stephen Brunton a family doctor whos an advisor to the company says Life Lines   distinguishes it from competitors and provides a counterargument to critics Our standards are wider based on the data weve collected he told Shots Life Line has screened more than  million people over two decades and willingly shares their data with independent researchers who have performed multiple analyses The companys conclusion vascular disease is more   than conventional medical opinion suggests But theres another issue Life Line also has relationships with some    who stand to benefit from referrals of anxious customers like my patient the gym teacher for further testing and treatment The company says theres no conflict No money changes hands in these relationships said Joelle Reizes the companys communications director We partner with hospitals to answer the criticism that we leave patients hanging after we provide them results If a screening customer doesnt have a primary care physician then a hospital partner can help link to one through their network Still relationships between hospitals and screening companies have come under   as Public Citizen a consumer advocacy group has criticized hospitals partnering with HealthFair a competitor of Life Line Screening Public Citizen recently sent   to  hospitals in eight states asking them to sever ties with HealthFair citing the widespread consensus among medical experts  that communitywide cardiovascular health screening programs are unethical and are much more likely to do harm than good In my practice I strive to achieve the best results for patients using the best available medical science I also try to minimize harm As we often say each patient is different Some of us want every morsel of information about ourselves while others prefer to know only whats necessary or likely to inspire action In the case of my gym teacherpatient less would clearly have been more
