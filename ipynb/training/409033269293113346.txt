Here I am just another Puerto Rican in the Bronx watching the Yankees Every one of those people has a beer in their hand she rambled on noting how Puerto Ricans are big baseball fans What is it about Puerto Ricans and drinking  That was the same day she said Rose I dont think Im going to make it  And then she didnt  Elaine  when she died was a welleducated Latina who had devoted her career to reporting on the neglect of poor ethnic communities Now shed ended her life like the anecdotal lead to one of her stories  this one on how Latinos are dying from alcoholismrelated cirrhosis at higher rates than other ethnic or racial groups and no one seems to know precisely why   Latino men die at  times the rate of whites and Latinas at  times the rate according to statistics compiled by the National Institutes of Health Both genders die from alcoholismrelated cirrhosis at twice the rate of AfricanAmericans Only Native Americans suffer mortality rates at higher levels You probably have a bed here where you put the Puerto Rican from the Bronx she had yelled sarcastically irascible during her first visit to a New York emergency room She wasnt far off when it comes to cirrhosis  Puerto Ricans have a higher rate of alcohol abuse than other Latinos says Dr Raul Caetano who has studied alcohol abuse in minority groups for the University of Texas There are few explanations as to why  Yes its binge drinking and drinking in general but as to why no one knows Caetano said   Some of the problem may begin on the island and get worse as Puerto Ricans move stateside says Hector Diaz who coauthored a  book on alcohol abuse among Puerto Ricans  In Latin America the tendency is for people to drink in large amounts but less frequently When they drink they get drunk Diaz said Then they come to the US where people drink with more frequency and Latinos adopt both habits Diaz who has a doctorate in social work believes that colonization and migration leave some Puerto Ricans feeling like they are immigrants even though they are born US citizens They feel beaten down as they face new economic and social challenges without the strong family structures they left behind on the island  All that drives people nuts he said bluntly You are always having to reinvent yourself He thinks studying why Latinos and Puerto Ricans in particular seem prone to drink will help social workers like him develop better prevention and treatment    Elaine knew all about Puerto Ricans fighting off a culture of drinking In the weeks before she was diagnosed she raged about a dustup between some Puerto Rican leaders and Coors The beer company had apologized after some Puerto Ricans felt insulted by a Coors can emblazoned with the Puerto Rican flag in honor of the communitys  annual pride parade The parade theme was Salud Celebrating Your Health  The hypocrisy of this she would say screaming at the TV set noting the Puerto Ricans organizing the parade supported Coors Im going to have my students look into it  Coors later   noted its sponsorship of scholarships for Latinos and said it was trying to celebrate culture It stopped production of the cans Elaine had left fulltime journalism to teach journalism at Lehman College and was hoping her students would adopt her passion for covering racial and ethnic minorities  She noted that in  Puerto Ricans were divided over another Coors ad campaign titled Emboricuate  Boriqua is a slang term for Puerto Ricans and Emboriquate was an obvious play on the Spanish word Emborrachate meaning get drunk Coors later apologized for offending anyone and dropped the ad and the partnership between the Puerto Rican parade and the beer company continued  Even as she talked about the communitys divisions though Elaine never fully acknowledged she had a drinking problem   Alcohol abuse is often a disease that can hide in plain sight in Latino communities says Judith Arroyo who studies minority health disparities for the    Latinos sometimes diminish heavy drinking said Arroyo believing that people who drink excessively once a month or every six weeks have nothing more significant than un vicio just a vice  Elaines family didnt see it coming until very late Shed have a little traguito drink as they say but I didnt think she was an addict said her brother Randy Rivera  Elaine came from a solid workingclass family from Cleveland a destination for Puerto Ricans searching for manufacturing jobs in years past She called it the Puerto Rican Brady Bunch  three boys and three girls living in a house with one bathroom  Last Christmas her brother said she came home looking white like a ghost She looked swollen She didnt eat well at dinner The family always bought a bottle of liquor for guests and when her brother woke up the morning after her arrival it was mysteriously empty  The year before their sister Joyce had died from cirrhosis Randy Rivera remembers trying to wrench a bottle of alcohol from Joyces hands  I told Joyce The only way youll stop is in the grave and that turned out to be true her brother said They recognized the physical signs in Elaine but didnt connect it to heavy drinking   We knew Joyce was an alcoholic She wouldnt go to rehab It was gradual but we knew it was her destiny said her other sister Marisel Rivera  With Elaine we didnt know the severity of her drinking Shed be up late drinking when she visited but we thought she was just stressed from work Now I cant believe this disease has taken two of my sisters  The next time Elaines family visited she was in Mount Sinai Hospital having fluid drained from her body because her liver was not filtering fluids adequately Not targeting discreet communities for early prevention can have devastating consequences once they are diagnosed with cirrhosis  Dr Gene Im who treated Elaine at Mount Sinai in New York said concerns over continued alcoholic behavior among cirrhosis patients means most doctors wont provide lifesaving transplants unless a patient has stopped drinking for six months Elaine was in rehabilitation when she died suddenly Im describes cirrhosis as a particularly cruel disease because its caused by scarring in the liver as its trying to regenerate and maintain its function against the onslaught of abuse It basically hurts itself trying to survive  This comes about over decades of injury to the liver and often times its silent Im says  The millions of people in the United States who suffer from aloholrelated cirrhosis an indicator of heavy drinking face more than just a grave health risk particularly if they are a member of a vulnerable minority group Drinking excessively has also been linked to increased criminality family and work life issues and health consequences  Alcoholism is one of the preventable agents that keeps Latino people from being able to advance in this country Arroyo said It affects families its money that should be spent on education and providing a good household If we can address and prevent this I truly believe we would see Latinos advance economically much more rapidly in this country  While liver disease results from longterm abuse Arroyo said not enough research has been done as to whether higher rates of hepatitis C and fatty liver disease among Latinos weaken the liver and increase the rates of cirrhosis  She also said that poor diet and lack of exercise might also be contributing factors Latinos suffer alcohol use disorders both dependency and abuse in smaller numbers but for those of us who drink tomamos con ganas we do it with gusto she said And there are all those things that can contribute  Elaine was a journalist a profession where muchromanticized pub crawls are legendary As I told her former colleagues of her death many asked whether something else might have caused cirrhosis or how much drinking might make you sick When I told them the autopsy firmly connected her death to longterm alcohol consumption they seemed incredulous  Hers had been a slow unintentional suicide aided by the many drinks she shared with her reporter buddies in celebration of the last big story In that other culture of hers no one had seen it coming either  Elaines friends and family gather will Saturday to celebrate her life and work and raise money for a  for poor minority journalism students devoted to continuing her work I find it all so heartcrushing I cant bring myself to join the speechmaking There will just be too much talk of the importance of her kind of reporting but little if any about why she died  Ill remember her by telling the story of how her easy smile and zest for justice was snuffed out by an awful disease plaguing her own community I just wish she were here to have written it herself
