If youre wondering if having kids will ruin your life or make it much happier a new study has this to offer It depends We find that in terms of life evaluation people with kids and people without kids are not very different said Arthur Stone of Stony Brook University But people with kids have more joys and happiness as well as more negative emotions like anger worry and stress Stone and his coauthor Angus Deaton of Princeton University are the latest researchers to chime in on the correlation between lifesatisfaction and parenting As they note in a paper published this week in the journal PNAS the results of previous studies on this topic have often been contradictory  although many of them have found an association between parenting and a lower sense of wellbeing For this study Stone and Deaton used data from the ongoing GallupHealthways Wellbeing Index which has collected information from  million Americans In the researchers first pass through the data they found that people most likely to be parents adults between the ages of  and  who live with a child under the age of  reported a higher sense of lifesatisfaction than people in the same age group who did not live with children So parents are happier right Not so fast Stone and Deaton also found that the people most likely to be parents were also more likely to be better off financially married more religious healthier and less likely to smoke than those who do not live with children Since all of these characteristics are associated with a better sense of wellbeing the researchers went through the data again this time controlling for these characteristics With the controls in place they found that people in both groups reported a similar sense of wellbeing However in the paper they also note No matter what the controls children are always associated with both more positive and more negative emotions That sounds about right When the researchers looked at similar data collected by Gallup from countries around the world they found that in poorer countries with higher fertility rates being a parent is associated with lower lifesatisfaction They think this is because people in these countries have less control over whether they become parents The researchers conclude that in the United States and other wealthy countries parenthood is often a deliberate choice So if you have children because you wanted children you are likely just as satisfied with your life as a friend who does not have children because he or she did not want to have them A lot of people start out thinking that having children must make people happy Stone said After all the species needs it to continue But there is no reason to think that people who decide to have children are any happier than people who decide not to have children Its like apples and oranges and I wouldnt think that people who like apples are any happier than people who like oranges
