What might have been a routine update on the state of the federal budget Tuesday instead became the newest front in the ongoing political war over President Obamas signature health care law At issue a revised estimate about how many people would voluntarily leave the workforce because they can get health care without necessarily holding down a job The Congressional Budget Office originally predicted that the availability of subsidies for lowincome Americans to buy health insurance would result in about  people leaving fulltime work by  The revised estimate increases that number to about  million Republicans pounced pointing at the nonpartisan offices estimate as proof of the Affordable Care Acts damaging effects on the economy In a statement House Speaker John Boehner said The middle class is getting squeezed in this economy and this CBO report confirms that Obamacare is making it worse Texas Republican John Cornyn took to the Senate floor with the same message The presidents own health care policy  is killing fulltime work and putting people in parttime work he said Obamas White House wasted little time responding sending Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman to the daily press briefing There Furman turned Cornyns charge on its head arguing that if some people are able to work part time and spend more time with their children or if others can leave a job to start a business of their own without fear of losing health insurance then these are good things happening because of the Affordable Care Act This is a choice on the part of workers Furman said I have no doubt that if for example we got rid of Social Security and Medicare there are many yearolds that would choose to work more I dont think anyone would say that was a compelling argument to eliminate Social Security and Medicare Furman said The White House also pointed out that on the topic of a longtime and separate Republican charge  that the law encourages businesses to lay off or reduce the hours of workers  the CBO found little evidence of this happening CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf also said during a news conference that the existence of employees who have the ability to choose not to work is proof that they will be better off The Affordable Care Act is reducing the labor supply of lowerincome people in our estimates partly because it is making them better off he said It is providing a valuable benefit to them On the larger question of whether the health care law helps or hurts the budget picture the CBO is sticking to its last analysis done in  that the law overall reduces federal deficits Elmendorf said
