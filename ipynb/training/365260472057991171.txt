Higher bloodsugar levels even those well short of diabetes seem to raise the risk of developing dementia a major new study finds Researchers say it suggests a novel way to try to prevent Alzheimers disease  by keeping glucose at a healthy level  Alzheimers is by far the most common form of dementia and its long been known that diabetes makes it more likely The new study tracked blood sugar over time in all sorts of people  with and without diabetes  to see how it affects risk for the mindrobbing disease  The results challenge current thinking by showing that its not just the high glucose levels of diabetes that are a concern said the studys leader Dr Paul Crane of the University of Washington in Seattle  Its a nice clean pattern  risk rises as blood sugar does said Dallas Anderson a scientist at the National Institute on Aging the federal agency that paid for the study  This is part of a larger picture and adds evidence that exercising and controlling blood pressure blood sugar and cholesterol are a viable way to delay or prevent dementia he said  Because so many attempts to develop effective drugs have failed It looks like at the moment sort of our best bet Anderson said We have to do something If we just do nothing and wait around till theres some kind of cocktail of pills we could be waiting a long time  About  million people worldwide have dementia in the United States about  million have Alzheimers disease What causes it isnt known Current treatments just temporarily ease symptoms People who have diabetes dont make enough insulin or their bodies dont use insulin well to turn food into energy That causes sugar in the blood to rise which can damage the kidneys and other organs  possibly the brain researchers say  The new study published in Thursdays New England Journal of Medicine just tracked people and did not test whether lowering someones blood sugar would help treat or prevent dementia That would have to be tested in a new study and people should not seek bloodsugar tests they wouldnt normally get otherwise Crane said  We dont know from a study like this whether bringing down the glucose level will prevent or somehow modify dementia but its always a good idea to avoid developing diabetes he said  Eating well exercising and controlling weight all help to keep blood sugar in line  The study involved  people  and older in the Group Health Cooperative a Seattlearea health care system At the start  participants had diabetes the rest did not They each had at least five bloodsugar tests within a few years of starting the study and more after it was underway Researchers averaged these levels over time to even out spikes and dips from testing at various times of day or before or after a meal  Participants were given standard tests for thinking skills every two years and asked about smoking exercise and other things that affect dementia risk  After nearly seven years of followup  or one quarter of them had developed dementia  mostly Alzheimers disease Among participants who started out without diabetes those with higher glucose levels over the previous five years had an  percent greater risk of developing dementia than those with lower glucose levels  Among participants with diabetes at the outset those with higher blood sugar were  percent more likely to develop dementia than diabetics at the lower end of the glucose spectrum  The effect of blood sugar on dementia risk was seen even when researchers took into account whether participants had the apoE gene which raises the risk for Alzheimers  At least for diabetics the results suggest that good bloodsugar control is important for cognition Crane said  For those without diabetes it may be that with the brain every additional bit of blood sugar that you have is associated with higher risk he said It changes how we think about thresholds how we think about what is normal what is abnormal
