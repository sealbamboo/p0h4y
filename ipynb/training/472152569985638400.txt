Richard III whose skeleton  only last year buried under a parking lot really was twisted a new analysis shows Researchers could tell from the skeletal remains that that king vilified by Shakespeare had scoliosis a curvature of the spine It wasnt nearly as bad as Shakespeare portrayed it though Richard III was far from being a hunchback But a new analysis shows that his spine was not only curved but twisted into a spiral shape a team at the University of Leicester reports in the Lancet medical journal That said it wouldnt have been very obvious and certainly didnt slow the troubled monarch they said Although the scoliosis looks dramatic it probably did not cause a major physical deformity says the universitys Dr Jo Appleby who led the study This is because he had a wellbalanced curve The condition would have meant that his trunk was short in comparison to the length of his limbs and his right shoulder would have been slightly higher than the left but this could have been disguised by custommade armor and by having a good tailor Applebys team used computed tomography CT scans to analyze the spine of the king who died in battle in  and whose remains were   if not to lore until February  Medical and history buffs alike can   at the D images generated by the project Obviously the skeleton was flattened out when it was in the ground We had a good idea of the sideways aspect of the curve but we didnt know the precise nature of the spiral aspect of the condition Appleby said in a statement The arthritis in the spine meant it could only be reconstructed in a specific way meaning that we can get a very accurate idea of the shape of the curve Its really good to be able to produce this D reconstruction rather than a D picture as you get a good sense of how the spine would have actually appeared Historians have hung on to   from the University of Leicester team Examination of Richard IIIs remains shows that he had a scoliosis thus confirming that the Shakespearean description of a bunchbackd toad is a complete fabrication  yet more proof that while the plays are splendid dramas they are also most certainly fiction not fact said Phil Stone chairman of the Richard III Society History tells us that Richard III was a great warrior Clearly he was little inconvenienced by his spinal problem Stone added
