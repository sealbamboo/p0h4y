Merck & Co. said Friday it agreed to pay $100 million to resolve all product-liability lawsuits alleging that the company's NuvaRing contraceptive caused blood clots which in some cases were fatal or led to heart attacks.. Merck said it denies fault under the agreement, which would resolve cases filed in state and federal courts, as well as certain unfiled claims. Merck said 3,800 people are eligible to participate in the settlement, and 95% need to participate for the deal to take effect.
