Since the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jet more than two weeks ago passengers relatives  and much of the planet  have been gripped by uncertainty about the fate of those aboard whipsawed by conflicting reports and speculation On Monday some received stunning news  Malaysia Airlines told the relatives that the plane has been lost and that none of those on board have survived It was a shocking moment  perhaps even more so for the way it was delivered Malaysia Airlines said it informed   in person and by phone But experts in disaster response and grief questioned the humanity of the textmessage notification Told of the text Karla Vermeulen a professor of psychology and the assistant director of the Institute for Disaster Mental Health at the State University of New York at New Paltz exclaimed Oh wow That strikes me as efficient but very inappropriate Vermeulen said To break that big a piece of news that devastating by text seems pretty tone deaf and insensitive A text message she explained is incapable of communicating emotion no matter what words are used in the text Human beings have evolved to sense and communicate emotion with our faces primarily our eyes Research has shown that texting is no substitute Thats one reason why for example the military notifies families of a loved ones death in person In an airline disaster in the US relatives   from an airline employee Red Cross volunteer or other official Some airlines run drills for such an eventuality Even though this bad news was hardly unexpected Vermeulen said People will have strong reactions They fall down they cry To do this in a vacuum staring at the phone with no personal support there seems like a secondary trauma Other experts pointed out that some families may have told authorities that they wished to receive news via text Both Merritt Schreiber the director of psychological programs for the University of California Irvines Center for Disaster Medical Services and Robin Goodman a psychologist with A Caring Hand bereavement services in New York City explained that its not uncommon for survivors to preauthorize such communications partly because it allows families to learn news before reading or hearing it in mass media And the complexity of this situation is kind of unique Schreiber added Still said Kenneth Doka a professor at the College of New Rochelle and the senior consultant to the Hospice Foundation of America despite the logistical challenges of families being in China Malaysia and elsewhere I cant think of a worse way to do it At least they should have gotten a phone call from a person Exactly how this method of notification will affect survivors in the long term is unknown Inperson compassion is always preferable Schreiber said but even with it the loss is still there James Halpern who responded to the Sandy Hook school shootings and the recent Harlem gas explosion teared up when contacted by NBCNews and told of the text message notification People whose loved ones are victims of disasters and tragedies experience a shattering of fundamental assumptions about themselves and the world when they get this information that somebody you love has died in a crash or some other disaster Halpern said That kind of trauma is certainly not helped with a text message Survivors have questions  many questions How was the conclusion made Who made it What does it mean Are authorities sure What happens now What do I do A text leaves no opportunity to ask such questions or to vent This is especially important given the miscommunication surrounding MH  As a representative of Chinese families said in a statement released Monday since the disappearance they have lied and hid the truth The representative went on to accuse authorities of delays that families believe may have cost lives A text does nothing to help soothe those kinds of feelings or engender trust On the other hand the mere presence of another person can offer warmth and comfort said Halpern director of the New Paltz institute A personal touch is a first step in recovery Vermeulen explained Its a reminder that I have lost everything yet this person is here being kind to me talking to me paying attention to my reactions So the entire world is not in chaos even though my world is
