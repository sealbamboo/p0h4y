Health officials have reported the   virus or MERS in the United States Its in a health care worker who traveled to Indiana from Riyadh Saudi Arabia last month Here are five things you need to know about MERS was first seen in Saudi Arabia in  Since then it has spread to  countries most in the Middle East but   and Asia and now including the United States Its a coronavirus a distant relative of the SARS  severe acute respiratory syndrome virus  that infected  people around the world and killed nearly  before it was stopped WHO reports more than  confirmed cases and  deaths since the virus was identified in  But Saudi Arabia alone has reported  cases with  deaths  thats a roughly onethird death rate Tests of people who have been in contact with patients show some apparently get infected and do not get sick so its hard to know what the actual death rate is Most who die have been either elderly or had another illness such as diabetes or kidney failure But Dr Anne Schuchat of the US Centers for Disease Control and preventions says thats still bad For respiratory viruses that have symptoms this is a very severe clinical presentation she told reporters Health officials have closely studied the known patients and the people who become infected usually have been in   Theres been no documented spread on an airplane for instance A patient in France who died infected a person who shared his hospital room and family clusters have been reported from Saudi Arabia We believe that if good infection control precautions are used during healthcare the risk to healthcare workers is also exceedingly low says Dr William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University an infectious diseases expert Theres no vaccine against MERS although some groups are working on one and antiviral drugs dont appear to be of much use against it either The CDC has told US hospitals to take strict precautions if someone shows up with symptoms and has recently traveled to the Middle East Health care workers in contact with such patients should wear special face masks gloves and gowns and follow other protocols to protect themselves and other patients Schuchat says the patient in Indiana is getting supplemental oxygen but is not on a ventilator although severe cases have needed respiratory support The latest research   but many patients have had no known contact with camels Camel meat or milk might be a source and the virus can live on surfaces and potentially could spread when people touch an infected surface SARS was eventually traced to an animal called a civet often sold in Asian markets as food Some health officials say its possible MERS has been circulating but no one knew what it was because there wasnt a test for it Many respiratory diseases are never diagnosed
