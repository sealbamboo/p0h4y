The High Court will rule later on a widows attempt to prevent her dead husbands sperm from being destroyed Beth Warrens husband died from a brain tumour two years ago and she has been told that his sperm cannot be stored beyond April   The Birmingham womans lawyers say the regulations defy common sense  Warren Brewer  had his sperm frozen before having radiotherapy treatment for cancer and signed forms saying his wife could use it if he died However regulations state sperm and eggs can be stored for decades but individuals must update their consent every few years That is no longer possible since Mr Brewers death  so under current rules if the sperm is not used within  months it will be destroyed Ms Warren  said she is not yet ready to have her dead husbands child and may never decide to  but wants to keep her options open The fertility regulator says it has no discretion to extend the storage period  The case reopens a longstanding debate about the ethics of posthumous conception In  the courts ruled Diane Blood should be allowed to take her dead husbands sperm abroad In that case there was never any written consent Ms Blood went on to have two sons
