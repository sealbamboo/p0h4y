As a neurosurgeon in Connecticut Dr Katrina Firlik saw too many patients make the same mistakes over and over again At her hospital in Greenwich shed see patients with hemorrhagic strokes that could have been prevented They didnt take their hypertension medications for the last couple decades she says Firlik wanted to try to stop these problems In  she cofounded the company HealthPrize with two other health care entrepreneurs   and   to create an app that would motivate people to take their meds HealthPrize offers reward points much like Candy Crush or Fruit Ninja to get people to stick with their prescriptions The company has recently partnered with West Pharmaceutical Services a company that makes specialized devices for drugs that are injected such as insulin The customized tools ping a patients smartphone when a drug has been injected HealthPrize tracks the pings to verify that people have taken their medicines Patients who dont take their medicines as   saw are at risk for strokes heart attacks blood clots and even death The failure to follow through on doctors prescriptions leads to problems that cost the US health care system more than  billion a year according to a   conducted by the New England Healthcare Institute The costs include additional hospital admissions and extra emergency room visits The reasons patients dont take their drugs range from unwillingness to fork over a copay to worries about side effects Another reason is that many chronic conditions such as high blood pressure dont have symptoms And unlike an antibiotic or painkiller the drugs people take to control many chronic conditions dont make them feel better Cholesterollowering statins are among the mostprescribed drugs in the US but about  percent of patients   them as they should The No  reason people dont take statins is because they dont really believe they need them says   founder of RxAnte a company that consults health groups on what types of patients dont take their medications People dont think theyre going to get a heart attack or a stroke so they pass on the pills Thats why startups like HealthPrize and Mango Health use rewards to make taking medicines part of a larger game to give people a boost of motivation Running through HealthPrizes blood are ties to Priceline and research in consumer motivation casinos and gaming We understand consumers when it comes to Las Vegas vending machines lottery tickets says Firlik Similarly Mango Healths brightly colored fruit logo and friendly mobile interface sprang from the minds of former gaming industry executives It makes sense to use a gaming angle to get you to take your meds says Jason Oberfest the CEO of Mango Health because our demographic looks very similar to mobile games He describes the average user of the Mango Health app as a woman early to mids who enjoys Instagram and uses mobile banking apps She would like a simple app on her phone to help her manage her recently diagnosed condition and the drugs her doctor told her she needs to start taking HealthPrize and Mango Health partner with health care groups such as pharmaceutical companies health insurance companies or physicians to offer specific incentives for medical conditions and associated prescriptions They verify that patients are refilling their prescriptions through the drug companies or pharmacies while patients enter data on an app or mobile website saying they took their medication Patients who take their medicines can collect various rewards including gift cards to Amazon or Starbucks cookbooks or donations to their favorite charities Its the immediacy of the reward thats critical says Firlik For HealthPrize the most common items that are redeemed are for  or  gift cards Depending on the app the bill for the rewards is footed by a pharmaceutical company HealthPrize or the company itself Mango Health In a study of  patients using HealthPrize over  months they were on average  percent more likely to take their blood pressure medication than patients taking the same drugs but not in the program according to the company In a study of  patients taking an acne prescription those using HealthPrize refilled their prescription nearly three times as much as those not using it Mango Healths first six months of data indicate that the rates of patients taking their medication with Mango Health are  to  percent higher than those not enrolled in the program However neither HealthPrize nor Mango Health has published peerreviewed studies which leaves some cautious of the claims Its hard for me to imagine the apps overcoming understanding the need for treatment or fear of side effects says Benner Those are in our experience best addressed by health care professionals However Benner says he hopes the companies will sharpen their focus on people who could get help from apps Theyre just not going to be appropriate or effective for everybody he says But for those experiencing their first longterm everyday pill an app could provide just the kick they need
