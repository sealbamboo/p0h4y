Daniel Kish has been blind since he was  months old but if you were to watch him from a distance you wouldnt know it Walking down the street the yearold looks like anyone else When he reaches the corner of an intersection he waits for traffic to pass and then proceeds on his way As he walks he dodges the signposts and mailboxes that line the sidewalk He can even describe the size of the buildings he passes and tell you if theyre made from brick or glass  Kish can do this because hes taught himself how to echolocate using sounds to position himself in his environment By clicking his tongue and paying close attention to the echo he can identify trees buildings and people  Similar to the sonar that bats and dolphins use Kish argues echolocation is a skill that all people possess it just needs to be developed Without sight Kish says the seeing part of the brain learns to gather information from nonvisual senses like hearing and touch But echolocation is much more than just a theoretical concept for Kish Hes the head of an organization called World Access for the Blind a traveling academy of trainers that teaches people with blindness or impaired vision how to see using sound  At a recent class in Burlington Vermont he taught the basics to two teenagers They began by learning how to position themselves in the center of a room Then Kish had them find the corners in an open hotel lobby Corners are cool because theyre easy to find and you can hear them in very big places or when very theyre far away he says Within two hours Kish and his students were walking down Church Street a busy restaurant arcade in the center of the city For  yearold Alek Wolfe it was the first time he could walk around unaccompanied by his mother Though his mom wasnt far behind Alek walked unescorted and the young teenager was ecstatic with what felt like independence  I love it he said while walking with traffic less than ten feet away  The class is part of a program by the Vermont Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired Dan Norris one of the supervisors who organized the event explains that a lot of teenagers in our school get mobility training instead of drivers ed Kish says that echolocation is unique from traditional mobility training especially for blind teenagers because it encourages people to move around under their own direction  I didnt have formal mobility training when I was younger he says If I had I probably wouldnt be who I am because formal mobility training back in those days  and it still is to some extent today  is highly structured highly regimented  Kish who taught himself how to echolocate as a child argues that mobility training overemphasizes the mechanics of skills rather than activation of the brain My brain was activated in the same way that the brains of sighted children are activated If Kish has his way blind children would learn echolocation much earlier in their lives and its become his mission to teach echolocation to as many people as possible  Through   approximately  people from over  countries about half from the US have received training in Kishs echolocation program In addition the organization has worked with many thousands of instructors who work with blind students says Kish whos grueling schedule keeps him constantly flying between his home in Los Angeles his classes in Europe and his clients in Australia  Despite this progress Kish is still something of an outsider among advocates for the blind According to the National Federation for the Blind the use of echolocation is common in mobility training but is limited to listening to the sound of cane taps footsteps and similar environmental sounds Kish calls this passive echolocation and agrees that it can be useful  Nonetheless Kish believes that his clicking technique which he calls flash sonar lends itself to a more precise understanding of the world The more you become attuned to your signal the easier it is to extract an echo based on the attuned signal from the noise says Kish By using an active click he says you gain an added degree of independence  We assume that dependency  the fostering of dependency and the fostering of restriction  will lead to independence and will lead to freedom he says But dependency cannot lead to independence and restriction and limitation cannot lead to freedom Related
