 The high resolution of cardiac MR imaging revealed structural and functional damage to the hearts of obese adolescents prior to bariatric surgery and reversal of that damage after surgery a small study found At baseline the  obese adolescents in the study  with a mean body mass index of  kgm   had evidence of heart enlargement with a mean left ventricular LV mass of  g versus  g in normalweight controls according to Marc P Michalsky MD and colleagues from the Ohio State University College of Medicine in Columbus Relative to subjectspecific expected normal weight values the obese patients averaged an additional  g of LV mass a result that was quite striking they wrote in the January issue of the Journal of Pediatric Surgery Researchers had followup imaging data on five patients whom they tracked because of their positive adenosine stress tests prior to surgery Followup imaging at a mean of  months showed reductions in LV mass in the range of  to  g in four patients while three had complete resolution of the subendocardial ischemia and the remaining two showed a marked improvement The primary observations we want to present in this publication are that extremely obese adolescents have enlarged hearts at rest and in many cases stressinduced perfusion deficits which are hallmark characteristics of adult heart patients Michalsky told   Thus far it appears that the subendocardial ischemia when present can be reversed following bariatric surgery and may be more dynamic or reversible during weight loss A larger study presented at the  American Heart Association meeting by Holly Ippisch MD of Cincinnati Childrens Hospital and colleagues also found   in severely obese adolescents at  months that persisted out to  years Michalsky and colleagues emphasized the importance of using cardiac MRI in very obese adolescents because of its ability to deliver highfidelity images of cardiac structure and function particularly compared with transthoracic echocardiography Cardiac MRI is not impeded by extensive thoracic fat deposits and chest wall expansion unlike acoustic imaging methods they wrote They also noted that many cardiac conditions in adults are associated with chronic LV enlargement including chronic   acute MI arrhythmia stroke and sudden cardiac death But none of these adolescent patients showed any signs of scarring a feature that is widely believed to be irreversible and predictive of heart failure and sudden death in the adult population which supports the hypothesis that early intervention such as adolescent weightloss surgery may have advantages with regards to cardiac recovery they wrote In this preliminary study the researchers retrospectively analyzed data from  severely obese adolescents nine girls mean age  Patients had undergone either RouxenY gastric bypass or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding at Nationwide Childrens Hospital in Columbus Ohio in  All patients had at least one of the following comorbid conditions hypertension dyslipidemia acanthosis nigricans insulin resistance and obstructive sleep apnea Two girls had polycystic ovary disease which has been shown to be associated with obesity Along with greater LV mass the obese patients had greater LV enddiastolic volume at baseline relative to expected normalweight values  mL versus  mL Again researchers noted the striking  mL difference between what would be the expected normal LV enddiastolic volume and what they found in the obese patients However they did not identify a consistent pattern of change in LV enddiastolic volume most likely secondary to the extremely low number of subjects that underwent followup analysis Michalsky said Obesity also affected LV ejection fraction as the patients had a mean value of  percent compared with  percent for expected normative values Functionally all patients were at a disadvantage as they averaged a  percent lower myocardial perfusion reserve index compared with the calculated expected normative values Researchers wondered if there were markers they could link with the structural and functional changes Their analysis found that an increase in LV mass was directly correlated with systolic blood pressure There were no other statistically significant relationships that could be associated with the structural and functional changes in these individuals These data need to be confirmed in larger studies the researchers said They also noted that the study is limited by its retrospective nature and small patient sample Source
