veryones talking about the importance of big data in healthcare Yet as the data piles up  most of it is isolated in different silos and health systems are struggling to turn big data from a concept into a reality Heres how I see it having a substantial impact on the health of populations today and in the future Most healthcare organisations today are using two sets of data retrospective data basic eventbased information collected from medical records and realtime clinical data the information captured and presented at the point of care imaging blood pressure oxygen saturation heart rate etc For example if a diabetic patient enters the hospital complaining about numbness in their toes instead of immediately assuming the cause is their diabetes the clinician could monitor their blood flow and oxygen saturation and potentially determine if theres something more threatening around the corner like an aneurism or a stroke Pioneering technologies have succeeded in putting these two data pieces together in a way that allows clinicians to grasp the relevant information and use it to identify trends that will impact the future of healthcare  otherwise known as predictive analytics So for example if more diabetic patients start to present a similar trend of numbness in their toes the coupling of realtime and retrospective data can potentially help doctors analyse how treatments will work on a particular population This gives hospitals a much stronger capability to develop preventative and longerterm services customised for their patients But what if we take data a step further and introduce gene sequencing into the picture Today gene sequencing is used primarily to determine the course of treatment for cancer patients As gene sequencing becomes more common the cost may fall making it more likely that well see gene sequencing become a routine part of a patients health record Imagine the kind of impact this data will have on treating infectious diseases where hours and even minutes matter The next time theres a disease outbreak we could potentially know the genome of the infectious organism the susceptibility of the organism to various antibiotic therapies and therefore determine the correct course of action without wasting precious resources in trial and error Undoubtedly we have yet to determine the most practical costeffective way to manage this kind of data To put it into perspective the human body contains nearly tr gigabytes of information Thats the equivalent of bn fullyloaded GB Apple iPads which would fill the entire area of Wembley Stadium to the brim  times Imagine collecting that kind of data for an entire population Theres no doubt that this is a mammoth task and while we might not be there yet we are certainly getting closer There are still challenges ahead organisations are learning lessons from the early adopters and trying to determine the best ways to cooperate and share data Undoubtedly the amount of investment required to make big data technologies work is more than what a single segment of the market can afford That means all stakeholders including pharmaceuticals will have to work towards a common vision But with publicprivate partnerships paving the way for payers and providers to work more closely together we are heading towards success and more importantly better patient care
