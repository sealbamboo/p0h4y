   worried about encroaching baldness take heart A genetic analysis of tissue taken from both bald and hairier spots on mens scalps has identified a protein involved in male pattern hair loss The researchers note that drugs that inhibit the protein are already in development and its possible those drugs could one day be used to help men preserve their head of hair In the study researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania did an analysis of more than  genes and honed in on one that produces an enzyme that produces a protein known as PGD That protein is present in much higher levels in bald spots When scientists placed PGD on hair follicles in a petri dish they found the protein inhibited hair growth Researchers then tested the protein on mice genetically engineered to lack a receptor for PGD and found that hair growth was unaffected But when PGD was applied to mice that have a different receptor GPR the mice grew less hair PGD is a type of   or a  like substance known to be involved in many body functions including regulating the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle tissue Drugs that inhibit PGD for example are being studied for use in preventing airway constriction in asthma Several companies have compounds in development that block the receptor for PGD Those compounds are being studied to treat asthma said senior study author Dr George Cotsarelis chair and professor of dermatology at University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia We think using these compounds topically    could slow down and possibly reverse baldness The study is published in the March  issue of the journal   About  percent of white men have some degree of hair loss before age  according to background information in the study In balding men hair follicles dont disappear but they shrink and produce very small even microscopic hairs Cotsarelis explained The belief is that something is inhibiting the follicle from growing a normal hair One of those factors seems to be PGD which was found near stem cells in the follicle which are important in hair growth Cotsarelis explained Dr Sanusi Umar a dermatologist in Redondo Beach Calif and associate faculty at University of California Los Angeles said its long been known that prostaglandins are involved with hair   while this study shows that the opposite may also be true For example Latisse bimatoprost ophthalmic solution is a synthetic prostaglandin mimicking PGF that encourages eyelash growth while Rogaine minoxidil is thought to work by promoting the activity of another prostaglandin PGE Umar noted This study tells the other side of the story he said Yet Umar urged men not to toss out their   yet Yes this may open another front from which hair loss may be treated It is not likely to be the panacea however he added There are likely multiple prostaglandins involved with inhibiting or promoting hair growth he pointed out Steroids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs also inhibit PGD but have not been shown to consistently grow hair Umar noted It is more likely that a number of end factors contribute to hair loss with factors like PGD inhibiting hair growth and others such as PGE and PGF promoting it he said PGD inhibition may emerge as part of a combined approach used in combination with agents that work via different mechanisms    as a more effective approach to hair loss treatment
