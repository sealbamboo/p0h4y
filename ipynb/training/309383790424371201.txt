Whether the money to finance the Mars mission materializes remains to be seen but if it does happen Who would these space adventurers be and how would they cope Its never been tried before so really no one knows  A rigorous process will be put in place for selecting the crew Poynter said A man and a woman are sought for the roles to represent humanity she said a married couple is preferred but not required  You want to make sure that you start out with a relationship between the two people that go on this mission that is on really solid footing that they know how to pick themselves up after a fallingout Poynter said  Poynter said she and husband Taber MacCallum CEO of Paragon are intrigued by the idea of being the pioneers to go on the mission They have experience in close quarters having spent two years with six other people sealed inside   a research facility situated on a   in Arizona in the early s  Its always helpful to have somebody help buoy you in difficult times and problemsolve with and to share the marvelous moments with as well she said of living there with her husband I think it really helped us be productive crew members  Friends who have known each other for decades or siblings who get along well and are comfortable spending long periods of time with one another would also be suitable for this sort of situation said Jason Kring assistant professor at EmbryRiddle Aeronautical University who is not involved with the mission But there is some evidence from extreme environments on Earth to support the married couple idea says Lawrence Palinkas of the University of Southern California who has studied more than  Americans who have spent winters in Antarctica over a fourdecade period    Based on Palinkas studies at the South Pole the most stable individuals and those with the most stable relationships are middleaged married couples  That works out well for space travel given that older people have less time left in their lives for space radiation to potentially cause cancer Kring said Radiation is also associated with infertility so the couple should not be seeking to have children after the mission Prolonged separation from family and friends back home is a huge source of stress for people in isolated confined environments Palinkas said Having a close confidant in space would allow them to share their daytoday experiences with someone they love and trust  NASA astronaut   who has logged more than  hours in space agreed Often work that is as demanding as ours in terms of time away from family  think it might be great to be able to spend that kind of time with your sweetheart Of course the behavioral quirks and annoyances that you might easily brush aside on Earth would be magnified in a confined space over  days Even in a healthy marital relationship there can be such a thing as too much contact Palinkas said  Nobody really knows the ideal size of a crew to travel this long but Peter Suedfeld professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia is skeptical about having just two people If one of them is emotionally unavailable the other is out of luck As for whether sex has ever been tried in space there are rumors but no official acknowledgment Suedfeld said When both of you are under stress  and these two people would be under the same level of stress the same kind of stress  each of them would want emotional support and be too focused on their own problems to give it to the other Suedfeld said  In his view its better to have a team with some amount of diversity where no one background or nationality predominates The International Space Station usually has a crew of six these days and thats worked out well he said There are other challenges If one person were to get sick the remaining crew member would need to take over all tasks to keep the vehicle operational Kring said In Biosphere  which is much bigger than a space capsule Poynter and MacCallum never got on each others nerves she said it was others who irked them so the couple could rally together  But whether any given couple who goes to Mars would still want to be together after  days is anyones guess experts say Scientists do not have data from actual missions to Mars but situations of isolation and confinement on Earth give us some clues as to how things might go  a collaboration between the Russian European and Chinese space agencies a crew of six men was locked in a chamber near Moscow for  days to simulate a Mars trip The crew received no fresh food or fresh air and could not see the sun  A recent study in the journal   found that most crew members experienced sleep disturbances of some kind but found a trend toward increased sleep and rest as the mission went on One crew member appeared to live on a hour day instead of  Researchers also noted behavioral aspects of torpor in the crew akin to hibernation of some birds and animals  In his Antarctica studies Palinkas and colleagues found that in a psychologically healthy group about  of people experience clinically significant psychological symptoms These include depression anxiety substance abuse problems sleep disorders and adjustment disorders relating to not getting along with crewmates   However most people do well he said and see a lot of benefit from participating in the experience  definitely an increase in feelings of selfconfidence selfefficacy  the belief that if they can handle this they can pretty much handle anything  In Biosphere  where Poynters days involved pruning shears plants and a twoway radio the crew of eight didnt exactly live in psychological peace  Poynter remembers standing in the sweet potato field one day and it was like a time portal opened In her mind she was a child again having an argument with one of her brothers Such vivid flashbacks have also occurred to people living in Antarctica she said The Biosphere  group eventually sought and received psychological counseling via telephone  Weve got to select for people that can maintain upbeat and happy attitude in the face of adversity and that are resilient Poynter said Aboard the International Space Station astronauts often enjoy just gazing out the window at Earth from afar   has a   that he uses to post extraordinary photos of the planet  But a couple en route to Mars would see Earth shrink until its a dot among many others in the lonely sky Theres going to be Im quite sure a feeling of separation that no one has experienced before Suedfeld said  Dont forget the communication delay A message may take as long as  minutes to travel to Earth and back and there may be times when communication with the ground is not possible at all If a crew member is having a breakdown and someone on Earth is trying to counsel him or her Kring says it will take  minutes for a message such as try to think calming thoughts to reach the spacefarer and another  minutes for an acknowledgment to get back to Earth  One solution to the boredom question could be timerelease entertainment packages Suedfeld said In other words some movies or music will not become unlocked until a given amount of time has passed so that the couple doesnt blow through all of their entertainment at once Poynter said the Biosphere  crew created music using the sounds from the animals and machinery in the biosphere Musicmaking or reading would be options on the Mars journey too she said  Eventually presumably Mars would come into view To look down on Mars and be the first people to see potentially our future home planet  Poynter interrupted herself to let out a highpitched Oooo  gives me chills just thinking about it  Besides mental factors gravity differences in space present a slew of physiological challenges that arent easily simulated on Earth over long periods of time Theres evidence that the visual system can be impaired and the weakening of bones and muscle may occur Kring said  How the two people aboard the space capsule would deal with these sorts of issues on top of mental stress remains to be seen  as does whether the mission will actually launch as envisioned in January  Im all for supporting this and I certainly am a big proponent of human spaceflight but I wonder if all of this can be figured out in five years Kring said
