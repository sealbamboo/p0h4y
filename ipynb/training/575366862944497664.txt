Calorie counts on a menu are a good start. But a 2014 study found that diners are even more motivated to order healthy when those numbers are translated into miles of physical activity. Every 100 calories is roughly equivalent to jogging one mile. The next time you're waffling between a 600-calorie sandwich and an 800-calorie pizza slice, try thinking about the two extra miles it would take to run off the slice. (If you're still craving the mozzarella and doughy goodness, it's worth the calorie splurge.)
