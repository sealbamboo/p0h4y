The World Cup is down to four teams Argentina Germany Brazil and the Netherlands Weve seen how these nations perform on the soccer field But how do they perform in the fields of health and development The big loser in the semifinals of the World Cup is also lagging behind on the poverty ladder Roughly  percent of Brazils population   million people  live on less than  a day In Argentina the figure is below  percent In Germany and the Netherlands its basically zero No wonder Brazilians were so upset that the government spent billions of dollars on soccer stadiums Theres a tie for first place here The average German and Dutch citizen can expect to live to age  In Argentina the number is  Bringing up the rear once again is Brazil at  But all four nations are relatively close to the country with the highest life expectancy Japan at  years And theyre decades ahead of the country with the lowest Sierra Leone at  Whos been hacking down the most trees In terms of deforestation rate the loser is Argentina which has been clearing nearly  percent of its trees each year for the past decade Next worst is Brazil which has been felling about  of  percent of its forested land annually But because Brazil has more forested land than the other three countries   million square miles including the Amazon  its the loser in terms of total trees chopped Germany has been perfectly conserving its forested land for a decade  a zero percent change And the Netherlands is actually slowly growing its forests Germany is the biggest polluter of the four by a wide margin  metric tons of carbon dioxide per year Next is Brazil at  Argentina and the Netherlands are neck and neck with Argentina emitting slightly less CO  per year  to  Just as they did in the World Cup semifinal the Argentines have managed to edge out the Dutch Okay so goats and soda are not actual development indicators But when youre writing for a blog called Goats and Soda how can you ignore them And theyre certainly fun to think about In terms of soda consumption Argentina takes the cake  and washes it down with a Coke Argentines consume on average around  gallons of soda a year Thats more than one ounce can a day Next comes Germany at  gallons Brazil slurps down  and the Netherlands  None of these countries however can touch the United States where the average person downs more than  gallons of soda a year USA USA Last but not least meat Its a bit harder to award a trophy for goat eating Goat is combined with mutton in meat consumption statistics In that category the Dutch are the winners  pounds per person per year For overall meat consumption Argentina claims first place by devouring  pounds of meat a person each year  more than half a pound of meat per day Next is Germany at  pounds then Brazil at  and the Netherlands at  Unlike the real World Cup theres no clear winner in our health and development tournament Germany and the Netherlands lead in most categories  no surprise there  followed by Argentina Brazil lags behind But if you look at  over the past decade Brazil comes out on top in many categories For example the nation has cut its infant mortality rates from  percent to  percent over the past two decades  a  percent reduction No other nation in the final four can make that claim
