Dance through the chaos Breathe through everything Ive got four kids  including a yearold going on   and this is my second marriage I know theres not going to be balance in every day so I dont beat myself up Im an idealist I strive and dream big But I focus on the stuff that really matters and I let everything else roll off Truly truly truly In our house with four kids its tough to remember were a couple not just peoples parents We try to have a regular date night but sometimes it doesnt happen so we make sure we connect every week Maybe its a lunch Maybe its dinner after the kids fall asleep Sometimes its with another couple Its just the fact that we got up got dressed and got out of our sweats Lunch is usually my largest meal I love sushi Or Ill do a huge salad with mixed greens and vegetables like cucumbers and Im not afraid of avocados Then I top it with a really nice piece of salmon or other fish   Pay for that class buy that DVD commit with a girlfriend As working women and moms we make it to all our meetings get our kids to every appointment But you have to make yourself a priority Just commit Write it down Make a plan I try to do my workouts early in the day after I drop my kids off at school so theyre just done I think if you procrastinate your workout as evening falls its just never gonna happen Also I want that energy I want that adrenaline Ive been baking asparagus in the oven which is so yummy and healthy because you dont need all the oil and it cooks beautifully You can even put a little Parmesan on top I love a great bath says Brooke I explain to my kids I do so many things for you guys I just need you to give me  minutesâ€‰ Her ingredients for a perfect dip  Zoneout music Easy listening mellow instrumental no lyrics Nothing to think about  Epsom salts I use them all the time and you can get them at any drugstore for  Theyre great for muscle aches and soreness  Spa addons I will light candles put on a facial mask and create this whole spa thing at home It is just as good as the real deal  except that I have to keep the kids out My husband is French and we love to cook and eat flavorful food We try to eat a Mediterranean diet  lots of greens lots of fish lots of vegetables Its really all about portion control   We flavor with salts and rubs rather than drowning things in sauces I use a lot of harissa  its a Middle Eastern spice like a chili paste Its great on sandwiches and its ideal on vegetables if you just put a little bit of olive oil in them If your body is really craving something you might need it Last night my mom came over and made homemade meatballs and Bolognese which is so not on the plan But I had a couple of meatballs and a little less pasta Do it in moderation then get back on track I keep a smart snack pack in my SUV Then my kids arent running into the gas station and buying chips It might contain these foods  Fresh fruit and dried roasted seaweed packs Which thank God my kids eat  Nuts Usually almonds  My girlfriends popcorn recipe Its the best in the world  I make it at home and put it in baggies You pop kernels using regular olive oil not extravirgin then you season with pink Himalayan salt I try to remain neutral on DWTS but I get emotionally connected to a few contestants Rob Kardashian was one When he started he had no confidence then he learned to dance and became this stud Its amazing to see people face their fears and transform themselves The s are a reality check Thats when some people are trying to look  I would like to slow down my aging process but I dont want to look like a pumpkin all swollen I dont want to fill every flaw in my face A few Laughs But you have to embrace Mother Nature a little Im a woman Im a wife Im a mother of four I dont want to look like a yearold anymore I want to be my best healthy self
