Hello, everyone, and nice to see you again. How was the weekend break? We hope you found it relaxing and invigorating because that relentless barage of meetings and deadlines has now returned. To fortify yourself, why not join us for a refreshing cup of stimulation? You know, something to fire the neurons. While you ponder the possibility, here are a few tidbits to get you started. So dig in and, of course, we hope you have a smashing day.  Cheers…. Among the noteworthy items we’ve noticed is that, once again, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is signaling plans to crack down on pay-to-delays in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year. Also, the FDA has, for the second time this year, approved an antibiotic for skin infections that are resistant to older antibiotics and often acquired in hospitals. Also, AstraZeneca is considering selling revenue streams tied to certain products as a strategy to fend off another takeover bid from Pfizer.
