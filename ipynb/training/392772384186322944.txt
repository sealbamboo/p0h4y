WASHINGTON  Momtobe closing in on her due date The nations obstetricians are getting more precise about exactly how close makes for a fullterm pregnancy On average a pregnancy lasts  weeks counting from the first day of the womans last menstrual period Thats how a due date is estimated  A baby is considered preterm if he or she is born before  weeks of pregnancy Until now a term baby was defined as one born anytime from  weeks to  weeks a few weeks before or after the calculated due date  Now the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is refining the definition of a term pregnancy to make clear that even at the end of the last trimester a little more time in the womb can be better for a babys health and development  Weeks matter said Dr Jeffrey Ecker of Massachusetts General Hospital who chaired the ACOG committee that came up with the more specific labels Since babies outcomes can differ lets not call it all the same  The new definitions released Tuesday in the journal Obstetrics  Gynecology  In recent years doctors groups and the March of Dimes have stressed that elective deliveries  inductions and Csections scheduled without a medical reason  shouldnt happen before the th week of pregnancy Research shows that babies born at  weeks have more of a risk of complications such as difficulty breathing than those born just two weeks later  Ecker said the new definitions will help doctors communicate that message  The March of Dimes welcomed the change saying it eliminates confusion about how long an uncomplicated healthy pregnancy should lastÂ
