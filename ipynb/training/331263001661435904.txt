For all her talent and determination to help children eat better Michelle Obama could still pick up a few pointers from Helen ButleroffLeahy a yearold former Rockette turned registered dietitian  devotes her time to teaching children in disadvantaged neighborhoods about eating healthfully and exercising regularly Her lessons take the form of musical productions rehearsed in classrooms and on the stages of  New York City public schools so far Children from each school do gymnastics and dance to a rapbased script by Roumel Reaux that entertains while explaining the essentials of good nutrition The minute production by Ms ButleroffLeahy is called My Plate The New Food Guide Musical Truth be told Ms ButleroffLeahys lessons both nutritional and dramatic could benefit American children in every socioeconomic group for none are immune to the foods laden with sugar salt and calories that pervade our society both within and outside schools I had the opportunity to watch her in action last month at P S  in Bushwick Brooklyn where enthusiastic yearolds from four secondgrade classes joined four professionals to proclaim the virtues of eating for the health of it Tramaine Montell Ford a dancer who performed in the movie Hairspray portrayed an angelic bad habit breaker intent on reforming two junkfood junkies The actors demonstrated the stultifying effects of poor nutrition followed by Mr Fords energizing message The action then focused on food groups that foster good health grains whole please for breakfast lunch dinner and snacks vegetables especially darkgreen and orange and fruits all colors are nutritious and delicious for myriad health essentials protein meats beans and nuts for the strength to get up and go and dairy light or skim for strong bones To celebrate vegetables for example greenshirted youngsters danced to Rock Around the Clock did cartwheels and jumping jacks and spun hula hoops while other children in red and yellow shirts did breakdancing to Mr Fords rap about  different vegetables which he called one of natures greatest wonders Ms ButleroffLeahy spends three hours a week for  weeks in each school devoting half an hour in each of three classes to handson nutrition lessons and the remaining halfhour to learning and rehearsing the musical The school then tries to incorporate nutrition information into other lessons and lunchroom offerings Cheryl AultBarker the principal of PS  said a salad bar now competes successfully with the usual school lunch fare at her school Still dancerlean with a cheerleaders energy Ms ButleroffLeahy said her mission was to help counter the citys rising rates of childhood   and its soonerorlater consequences including     and heart disease Children learn best through active participation and repetition both in the classroom and on the stage Ms ButleroffLeahy said The youngsters teachers and parents many with their own significant weight issues learn alongside the children who bring their classroom lessons home One mother at PS  proudly reported that shed switched from whole milk to  percent and one of the boys said he now has wholewheat bread and oat cereal for breakfast The project is underwritten by the Ficalora Family Foundation in association with Ms ButleroffLeahys nonprofit company the Nutrition and Fitness Education Initiative Inc and is supplemented by small grants from New York State and the citys Department of Education which contributes  to the school Each production start to final applause costs about  Ms ButleroffLeahy she said she hoped to be able to bring her musical message about healthy eating and   to many more schools throughout the country Of course hers is but one of many philanthropic projects local and national aimed at countering the often atrocious eating habits of children by arming them with the information and enthusiasm they need to make better food choices The Childrens Aid Society for example has a   initiative that sponsors an Iron GoChef competition to teach wellness with nutrition and healthy cooking programs for young children The initiative includes a week nutrition and fitness curriculum for schools and a sixweek wellness program for parents that emphasizes movement stress reduction and healthy cooking The Agriculture Department which oversees schoolbased food programs has recently updated the nutrition standards for school meals and is considering guidelines to ensure that the snacks and drinks available in schools also support good health New menus or school breakfasts and lunches became effective at the start of the current school year They include more fruits vegetables and whole grains and are designed to provide nutrientdense meals from a variety of foods in amounts that support healthy weights for children of different ages Students must select at least half a cup of fruit or vegetables at both lunch and breakfast There are graduated reductions in salt and limits on saturated fats and fruit juices milk can be only unflavored lowfat or flavored and unflavored fatfree Within two years all grains served must be whole grainrich School meals provide up to half the calories children consume and foods that support good nutrition improve childrens behavior performance and overall cognitive development according to the   The alliance which maintains that schools are powerful places to shape the health education and wellbeing of our children helps more than  schools across the country create environments that encourage healthy eating and physical activity But however hard schools may try their efforts can be easily undermined by pervasive societal influences For example while Nickelodeon has made some improvements in the kinds of foods advertised during its television programs for children a new analysis of food ads during  hours of programs by the Center for Science in the Public Interest found that nearly  percent are for junk Nickelodeon congratulates itself for running the occasional public service announcement promoting physical activity but for each of those messages its running  ads for junk food said Margo G Wooten the centers director for nutrition policy The network has made improvements In  an analysis by the center found that  percent of food ads on Nickelodeon were for unhealthy foods but a similar sampling in  showed a decline to  percent which may reflect growing pressure on the food industry to reduce marketing to children Nickelodeon could take a lesson from junkfoodfree Qubo a block of programming for children on the ION Television network Or perhaps Nickelodeons advertising executives should sit in on one of Ms ButleroffLeahys school productions
