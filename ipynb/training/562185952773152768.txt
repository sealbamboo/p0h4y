A paralysed former Royal Marine has lifted an object with his hand for the first time in seven years thanks to technology developed in Plymouth Dominic Lovett  who was partially paralysed in an accident has been testing a mechanical hand that uses neck muscles to move the fingers The socalled handroid was developed by Plymouth firm Advanced Control Research ACR ACR is now working on a powered elbow to help him with lifting objects Mr Lovett who has been unable to grip objects since the accident said the hand had surpassed my expectations Mr Lovett who was based in Stonehouse in Plymouth became partially paralysed after jumping headfirst into a snowdrift while celebrating with marine colleagues during training in Norway in  But the snow was only m ft deep and he broke his spinal cord He has been working with Prof Roland Burns of ACR on developing the skeletontype system that fits over over his left hand When a muscle in the human body contracts it generates a small electrical signal The signal can be detected by surface sensors and is used to control the hand Mr Lovett said Its hard to put into words the empowerment of being able to do it yourself rather than relying on someone else They have come up trumps so I am very thankful to Professor Burns Prof Burns said Were delighted the system is working Weve scoured the world and as far as were aware there is noone else working in this area No conventional treatment for Mr Lovett was available on the NHS so much of the  cost of developing the hand has come from friends and charities including the Royal Marines Charitable Trust Fund Mr Lovett is now living in Birmingham where he is training to be a counsellor for other injured service people
