A nasty spat has broken out between the generic pharmaceutical industry and an international organization that develops widely accepted standards for developing prescription drugs.. The International Generic Pharmaceutical Alliance, an umbrella group for trade associations from the U.S., Europe, Canada and other countries, is miffed that the International Conference on Harmonization has refused to give generic drug makers a position on the all-important steering committee that oversees decisionsÂ on drug safety, efficacy, clinical trials and manufacturing practices.
