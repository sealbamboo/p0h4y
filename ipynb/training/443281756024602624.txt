MPs are set to debate a controversial measure which would give ministers sweeping powers to close hospitals  Clause  of the Care Bill would allow administrators appointed to oversee NHS trusts in England that are struggling financially to make decisions over the future of neighbouring trusts as well  The measure is the governments response to a court ruling last year It said ministers acted illegally in proposing a downgrading of maternity and AE services at Lewisham hospital  The measure would allow Trust Special Administrators appointed by the Health Secretary in England to take over any NHS trust that is failing financially and push through whatever other local changes they think are necessary  Last year a court ruled that Jeremy Hunt had acted illegally when he tried to do just this  by approving the closure of services in one southeast London trust  Lewisham  to save a neighbouring trust that was going bust  Queen Elizabeth Hospital Woolwich  Ministers argue that patient care can be affected by what happens in neighbouring NHS hospitals so it makes sense to consider the wider local health economy  And they insist the Trust Special Administrator TSA will have to consult the public commissioners and staff  including clinicians of the trust in difficulty and other affected trusts  to make sure their recommendations deliver the best possible care for patients wherever they live But unions and patient groups have campaigned against the measure arguing it will mean hospitals could be closed with minimal local consultation  and the legislation may have an impact on hospital services across England The Labour Party which is opposing the measure says services at dozens of otherwise financially sound hospitals could be put at risk Labour have tabled two amendments to the clause one to delete it altogether and another which will still allow local service providers to have a say in the running of their local NHS services The NHS Confederation which represents NHS hospital trusts said an amendment was needed that would require the TSA to consult with and consider the views of the organisations affected by any broader changes Jos Bell of the Save Lewisham Hospital campaign group said No hospital in England will be safe under a clause  regime  It could be any hospital anywhere  Hospitals that are successful should never be put in this position Clause  should be thrown out TUC General Secretary Frances OGrady said If this Bill becomes law wellperforming and popular hospitals will be at risk of having their services shut down without their agreement and without proper consultation with staff commissioner patients and the public Were calling on MPs to abide by their commitment to put patients and clinical staff at the heart of decisionmaking within the NHS and oppose the governments illthought out hospital closure clause Rachael Maskell head of health for Unite said No decision about me without me is what the government promised when it forced through the Health and Social Care Act in  against the views of clinicians and NHS campaigners alike Now it wants to rush through hospital closures in  days with only one clinically focused meeting It could be dismissed as bonkers if it wasnt so dangerous The government must scrap clause  of the Care Bill and talk to the clinical experts MPs and peers have had the wool pulled over their eyes once already with the Health and Social Care Act they should not let themselves be fooled again
