Scientists have demonstrated that boys well men really do have cooties a simplified term for bacteria that can spread to girls OK women by kissing them In fact a second intimate kiss can transfer a whopping  bacteria from one mouth to another according to a   in the journal Microbiome  An earlier version of this post said one volunteers claim of kissing his partner  times a day would add up to  minutes of kissing It would be  seconds or  minutes and  seconds  A team of Dutch researchers recruited  couples who happened to be visiting the   in Amsterdam on a summer day All  volunteers whose ages ranged from  to  allowed the researchers to wipe their tongues with a cotton swab several times They also agreed to spit into sterile tubes and answer questions about their kissing habits Then the volunteers engaged in some public displays of affection a second kiss involving full tongue contact and saliva exchange and had their tongues swabbed again According to the bacterial analysis a fresh kiss barely budged the similarity index value That suggests that the overlap in tongue bacteria is probably a longterm effect of couples living together  sharing meals toothpaste and other items from daily life A single kiss had no immediate effect on the composition of bacteria in the saliva samples the researchers found But swapping spit certainly entails swapping bacteria as well The more often a couple kissed the more similar the bacteria in their saliva samples The scientists calculated that couples had to kiss at least nine times a day to achieve an MH value below  And heres a bonus finding The men said they kissed their partners an average of  times a day while the women recalled kissing only five times a day The researchers concluded that the men were most likely exaggerating the frequency of their romantic encounters Most egregiously one male volunteer said he averaged  intimate kisses per day The researchers declared this estimate unrealistically high Besides his partner said they kissed only eight times per day
