The UK has one of the highest rates of death for children under five in Western Europe according to new research published in The Lancet In  the mortality rate for underfives in the UK was  deaths per   more than double the rate of  per  in Iceland the country with the lowest rate Poverty and smoking in pregnancy are two of many factors cited by experts  shows the UK rate is still low by global standards The analysis of data on  countries was carried out by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME at the University of Washington Seattle USA  It showed that the UK had worse rates than nearly every other western European nation for early neonatal deaths   between zero and six days postneonatal deaths death between  and  days and for childhood deaths death between one and four years  The UKs rate is comparable with Serbia and Poland  Austria Belgium Cyprus Greece Ireland Israel the Netherlands and Switzerland all had rates between  and  deaths per  children aged under five However figures for the rest of Europe are higher In Central Europe the average mortality rate was  deaths per  births while for Eastern Europe it stood at   deaths per  births The country with the highest child death rate in the world in  was GuineaBissau at more than  deaths per  while the lowest was Singapore at about two deaths per  Dr Christopher Murray director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME the lead author of the study said We were surprised by these findings because the UK has made so many significant advances in public health over the years The higherthanexpected child death rates in the UK are a reminder to all of us that even as we are seeing child mortality decline worldwide countries need to examine what they are doing to make sure more children grow into adulthood Across the world child deaths rates have been falling since  But in the UK the rate has slowed and the decline in  was half that seen between  and  Dr Ingrid Wolfe of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health which itself recently analysed the UKs child mortality rate said Weve known for some time that the UK has high child mortality rates compared to some of the best performing countries in Europe  but these latest figures put us rock bottom of the Western European league table even compared to the European average let alone the top performing countries   Over a third of all child deaths in the UK are in underfives so we need to think seriously about how we can prevent these   Many are due to risky behaviours during pregnancy for example smoking which is more common among women who are socially disadvantaged so already at higher risk She added Crucially risk of child death disproportionately affects poorer families  So the focus has to be on reducing the growing gap between rich and poor   Britain is one of the most unequal societies in Western Europe  and its no coincidence that our child mortality rate is also the worst Andy Cole chief executive of premature baby charity Bliss said It remains an appalling reality that babies and children in the UK still have a significantly greater chance of dying than those in Western Europe  There are a combination of reasons for this including the need to support expectant mothers to make healthy choices such as stopping smoking and drinking alcohol  There is also a substantial gap before we reach safe staffing levels in all neonatal and maternity services throughout the UK plus there needs to be much better identification and referral of those women at greater risk of preterm birth or complex pregnancies   A national strategy to reduce infant mortality by at least  in the next decade must be a priority for government A Department of Health spokesperson said Deaths in infants children and young people are falling but we recognise that more needs to be done  That is why we are investing more in services and training particularly ensuring that that GPs have stronger skills to care for children and young people with long term conditions in the community
