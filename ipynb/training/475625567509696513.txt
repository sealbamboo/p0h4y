For decades inpatient rehab has been one of the goto treatments for substance addiction Nearly two million Americans seek treatment for addiction each year but theres a movement in the medical community to change how we perceive the condition  and how to treat it The most famous of of rehab centers is the one named after former first lady Betty Ford who was addicted to alcohol and painkillers My family saw the problem and they got professional help to come in and help them do what we refer to as an intervention she told CBS News Opened in  troubled celebrities have flocked to the Betty Ford Center along with others looking for an intensive rehabilitation that takes them out of their regular lives Just last month Betty Ford merged with Hazelden treatment centers to create the largest nonprofit treatment organization in the country There has been a growing chorus of medical professionals however who say inpatient rehab centers provide only a temporary fix that can sometimes evaporate when patients go back into the real world We used to understand addiction  years ago as a bad habit low character development and poor impulse control says Tom McClellan CEO and cofounder of the Treatment Research Institute in Philadelphia He says inpatient rehab came out of a belief that to get better you just had to be a better person So what was envisioned was a program that first tore the patient down stripped the patient of his bad habits and then reconstructed a person who was more socially responsible more honest and had better character he says Today McClellan says addiction needs to be treated like diabetes He says it would be unthinkable for someone to go to their priest to find a cure for diabetes Thats not unthinkable in addiction because the public just doesnt understand it as a chronic illness he says Addiction did feel like a chronic disease to Shane Linehan He spent  years as a Minnesota police officer and had a series of close calls He says his head was a mess he didnt sleep and had panic attacks constantly To calm himself down he drank  a lot Rather than killing myself I decided to try to drink myself healthy Linehan says Only a drunk could make that logical assumption right Linehan started using prescription drugs and eventually he had to face what had become a serious addiction His girlfriend tossed him out She said go clean or dont come home he says So I went to treatment Linehan enrolled in a day residential program at Hazelden in St Paul Minn While he says it put him on more solid footing as soon as he left the safe confines of the rehab center things started to unravel When I left there life happened he says All of those things those piles of debris that at one point were a life were still there and I had to start going through them and put some pieces back together And along the way I had trigger after trigger after trigger Linehan relapsed and started taking vicodin again He sought help again but he was done with inpatient rehab He had spent a lot of time and money and it hadnt worked for him so this time he took a different option He ended up at Alltyr a new addiction clinic that opened last year in St Paul that takes a radically different approach to addiction treatment Alltyr patients dont pack a bag and check into a residential facility They dont go to group therapy and they dont expect to get sober in  days Instead patients schedule regular appointments with a doctor who is more likely to give them a prescription instead of motivational advice CEO and founder Mark Willenbring says Alltyr does not do rehab and that the company is the alternative to rehab Our goal is to engage the patient in a recovery process Willenbring says We dont have a particular approach we dont tell people what to do For those patients looking for a little more structure Willenbring says he does guide people of course If they ask me what my recommendation is I have no problem giving them that he says At Alltyr that can mean a whole variety of medications that treat addiction to alcohol and opioids as well as anxiety and depression Some of them are approved by the FDA some of them arent Willenbring says traditional rehab centers shy away from medications and rely too heavily on talk therapy which he says isnt a proven way to kick an addiction Dr Marvin Seppala the chief medical officer of the newly merged HazeldenBetty Ford Center disagrees While he admits there are not a lot of studies that prove the effectiveness of group therapy he says it still has a place This is a disease not just of the brain but also of the soul Seppala says The persons life is in the balance their relationships are in the balance and if we only give them a medication and dont account for all of that its just not going to work out over time As for Linehan hes been seeing Dr Willenbring at Alltyr for the last five months Hes feeling good and hasnt relapsed but says that for him sobriety doesnt look like the advertisements on TV its more basic than that A good doctor a good psychologist and a really good AA group he says
