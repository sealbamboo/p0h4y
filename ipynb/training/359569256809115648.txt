Breakfast has long gotten a good rap for everything from   to improving   And ever since the   in California back in the s linked breakfast  along with a host of other habits  to a longer lifespan theres been a societal push towards breaking the fast Its such a simple lifestyle change that people can make says researcher   of the Harvard School of Public Health Rimm is the coauthor of fresh research that links yet another significant benefit to eating a morning meal reducing the risk of heart attack The new study published in the journal   finds that men who routinely skipped breakfast had a  percent higher risk of having a heart attack or dying from coronary heart disease compared to men who ate breakfast The longterm year study included nearly  men Dont skip breakfast concludes study author   a research fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health Now a lot of folks may be wondering Is there something truly beneficial about the timing of breakfast Or is it just the case that people who eat a morning meal also tend to have a lot of other good habits such as exercising more and smoking less compared to those who skip Rimm and his colleagues took pains to account for the fact that the breakfast eaters in their study were different Still the findings held It was somewhat surprising to us that even after we statistically accounted for differences in diet smoking patterns and exercise patterns  you still see an elevated risk of heart attack among the nonbreakfast eaters Rimm says The researchers arent certain what accounts for the benefits but they believe several biological mechanisms could be at play Cahill says when you prolong fasting by skipping breakfast you can put a strain on the body And over many years  it can lead to insulin sensitivity which can lead to type diabetes and it can lead to high blood pressure she says which over time can lead to heart disease In other words shes making the case that the timing of meals really does seem to matter We really saw that breakfast itself was important concludes Cahill Whether its skipping breakfast in the morning or eating very late at night this pattern of eating may lead to adverse metabolic effects that set the stage for heart disease Researchers who study circadian rhythms say these findings make sense given that the act of eating plays a critical role in resetting our internal clocks For a very long time we thought that light is the cue that resets the brain clock says   an associate professor in the Regulatory Biology Laboratory at the Salk Institute But slowly we are learning that actually its food thats the biggest cue to reset the clock He says the resetting of the clock is key since it helps our bodies perform optimally If you change the timing of food on different days then the clock is not getting the same cue everyday Panda says so the clock goes haywire and our body becomes less efficient in processing the food Now there are plenty of healthy people out there who dont eat a meal right after waking up    I dont tend to wake up real hungry says   a professor of nutrition at the University of Vermont and a spokesperson for the American Heart Association Johnson says she usually eats a midmorning breakfast and this is OK She says she is convinced by the body of evidence that breakfast has its benefits but her advice Dont force it If youre not a breakfast eater dont just add the calories on top of what youre doing and expect youre going to be be miraculously healthier says Johnson She says when it comes to eating in the morning let hunger pangs be your guide
