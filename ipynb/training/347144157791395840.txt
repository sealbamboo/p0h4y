The House has passed one of the most farreaching abortion bills in decades But its unlikely to ever become law By a mostly partyline vote Tuesday of  lawmakers passed the   which would ban nearly all abortions starting  weeks after fertilization At  weeks maybe sooner the baby feels pain said physician and Rep John Fleming RLa on the House floor And so I would just submit to you today Mr Speaker this bill is not just about abortion its about pain its about torture to that young life The contention that fetuses can feel pain starting at  weeks is   But its been used as a justification to pass   over the past several years Bringing the federal bill to the House floor now was meant to capitalize on the publicity surrounding last months murder convictions of   according to House Speaker John Boehner After this Kermit Gosnell trial and some of the horrific acts that were going on a vast majority of the American people believe in the substance of this bill and so do I Boehner said at his weekly news conference Democrats however say theres one huge and glaring problem with the bill Its unconstitutional The bill bans abortions prior to  weeks said Democratic Rep Jerrold Nadler of New York ranking member of the Constitution Subcommittee of the   Since   it has been wellsettled law that no bill is constitutional that bans abortions before viability which is later than that Most experts agree that viability begins   depending on how you count But Democrats use the abortionban bill to make a larger point as well that Republicans are continuing this year where they left off last year   This bill is extreme an unprecedented reach into womens lives and a clear indication that the wellbeing of women in this country is not something that Republicans care to protect said Florida Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz who is also the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee And Republicans perhaps inadvertently played into Democrats hands During committee consideration of the abortion ban last week the bills sponsor Arizona Republican Trent Franks tried to fend off an amendment that would have provided an exception for victims of rape or incest In arguing against the exception   You know the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy is very low Franks later said he was trying to say that most women who get pregnant as a result of rape have abortions well before they are six months pregnant But the PR damage was done Republican leaders late last week decided   on the floor Instead they turned to Tennessee Republican Rep Marsha Blackburn a longtime antiabortion voice They also added exceptions to the bill for rape and incest But Democrats were outraged at the choice of Blackburn to handle the bill because shes not even a member of the Judiciary Committee that considered it And if that is not PR I dont know what is said Rep Louise Slaughter DNY cochairwoman of the House ProChoice Caucus And if that is not simply trying to fool you I dont know what else that is On the other hand Republican leaders couldnt have chosen a woman from the Judiciary Committee because the Republicans on the panel are all male Still the entire effort was likely all for show The Senate is not expected to take up the bill And President Obama   against it on Monday
