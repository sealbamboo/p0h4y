Its your birthday You hate attention But you  love cake So before you stuff your gullet with red velvet deliciousness youd better suffer through the annual offkey embarrassment of everyone singing Happy Birthday to you  and then blow out the candles and make a wish too Thats because   suggests that performing a ritual before eating  even a silly thing like our American birthday traditions  actually makes the food taste better Youre already doing this and not just with birthday celebrations  and even if you dont realize it You clink glasses together and say cheers before sharing a drink with friends You take apart wooden chopsticks and rub the sticks together before digging into sushi Or maybe you Instagram every meal before taking a bite Around the world plenty of other cultures have this figured out  take the preparation and presentation behind a traditional Japanese tea ceremony for just one example  All of these things are helping us to be more mindful about what were about to eat or drink which means well enjoy and savor the food or beverage more as this new research demonstrates We found that peoples attention is piqued when they perform a ritual and that helps them to be more involved in what they are eating or drinking said Kathleen D Vohs professor of marketing at the University of Minnesotas Carlson School of Management and lead author of the new study in an email Even new rituals  that people never had done before  when done before eating or drinking make food taste better In one experiment researchers recruited  researchers and told them to eat a chocolate bar about half were given instructions on a ritual to follow before eating it They were told Without unwrapping the chocolate bar break it in half Unwrap half of the bar and eat it Then unwrap the other half and eat it The others were just told to relax for a bit and then eat the candy like a regular person As it turned out the people who had done the weird little songanddance routine before eating the chocolate ended up saying that they enjoyed it more than those who ate the chocolate normally They also took longer to eat it and said they would pay more for the chocolate And this doesnt just apply to candy similar experiments in the study were done using lemonade and even carrots The reason  we enjoy food and drink more when we go through a system of rites first appears to be that we like to feel more involved in what were consuming Rituals seem to improve the consumption experience because they lead to greater involvement and interest the authors write in the paper published this month in the journal Psychological Science When people perform a ritual their intrinsic interest increases which in turn leads to more enjoyable consumption  Next Vohs would like to test whether this concept can be used to help people avoid overeating and shed also like to see if it can get people to enjoy and happily consume foods they usually hate  Rituals can make some of lifes little and greatest pleasures  enjoying a meal or a nice beverage  more enjoyable So use them  make use of rituals you already use and start new ones Vohs said Make a ritual around eating each night Set the table bless the food use a tablecloth etc
