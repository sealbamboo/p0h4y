They found that shift work was associated with impaired cognition and the impairment was worse in those who had done it for longer The impact was particularly marked in those who had worked abnormal hours for more than  years  with a loss in intellectual abilities equivalent to the brain having aged  years The only encouraging finding for shift workers is that the decline can be reversed by a switch to regular hours The bad news It takes at least five years the findings suggest except for processing speeds The authors say their research is the first published study into the reversibility of the chronic impact of shift work on the brain after the shift work finishes For the study the participants were asked to carry out cognitive tests intended to assess long and shortterm memory processing speeds and overall cognitive ability on three occasions in   and   Just under half of the sample  people had worked shifts for at least  days of the year  Participants were aged exactly    and  at the time of the first set of tests In all just under  people were assessed at all three time points Around a fifth of those in work and a similar proportion of those who had retired had worked a shift pattern that rotated between mornings afternoons and nights The researchers from the University of Swansea and the University of Toulouse say this is an observational study so no definitive conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect  However they suggest that disruption to the body clock could generate physiological stressors which may in turn affect the functioning of the brain Humans are wired to sleep at night by their circadian rhythm a hour cycle that brings about physical mental and behavioral changes in the body The circadian rhythm affects sleep cycles hormone releases body temperature and various processes Besides the intellectual impact disrupting it has been associated with health problems including ulcers heart disease and breast cancer Other research has also linked vitamin D deficiency caused by reduced exposure to daylight to poorer thinking skills the researchers say  The cognitive impairment observed in the present study may have important safety consequences not only for the individuals concerned but also for society as a whole given the increasing number of jobs in high hazard situations that are performed at night the researchers warn At the very least the findings suggest that monitoring the health of people who have worked shift patterns for  years would be worthwhile they say Its a message that merits attention It has been remarked that accidents tend to happen late in the night or in the early morning  as with the Three Mile Island disaster in  and the Chernobyl disaster in
