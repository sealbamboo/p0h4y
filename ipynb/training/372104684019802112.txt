NEW YORK  Many medications can be used safely by women who are breastfeeding and the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh most harms related to babies exposure a panel of pediatricians said today In a clinical report the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP Committee on Drugs said mothers may be inappropriately advised to stop breastfeeding or to stop taking their medications for fear the drugs will be passed through breast milk and harm infants  Sometimes people are told that because physicians may be worried about the risks the drug may pose  and arent necessarily thinking about the potential benefit of breastfeeding Dr Hari Cheryl Sachs the lead author on the report said  That benefit includes a lower risk of ear infections asthma and sudden infant death syndrome according to the US Department of Health and Human Services  Sachs said properties of the drug itself whether its being used on a long or shortterm basis and the age and health of the infant all affect how safe it is to use medication while breastfeeding  Its hard to make a blanket recommendation on what drugs are fine for the mother because its going to depend on multiple factors Sachs from the Pediatric and Maternal Health Team in the Food and Drug Administrations Center for Drug Evaluation and Research told Reuters Health  Its always a riskbenefit decision  She and her colleagues on the AAP committee said women seeking information on specific medicines should talk with their doctors and visit the National Institutes of Healthrun website    That site includes the most uptodate scientific knowledge on how much of a given drug is passed to an infant during breastfeeding its effects on babies and possible alternatives to consider  In its report published Monday in Pediatrics the committee focused on a few classes of drugs including antidepressants narcotics and smoking cessation aids  Limited information is available on the longterm effects of antidepressants on babies it wrote and because the drugs take a long time to break down levels could build up in infants bodies  Caution is advised for certain powerful painkillers such as codeine and hydrocodone  but others including morphine are considered safer when used at the lowest possible dose and for the shortest possible time pediatricians said  Nicotine replacement therapy especially gum and lozenges is typically considered safe to use during breastfeeding according to the committee However the FDA discourages the use of stopsmoking drugs such as varenicline marketed in the US as Chantix among women who breastfeed  The risk of exposure to any drug for babies needs to be weighed against the drugs importance for the mother as well as the benefits of breastfeeding researchers noted  The starting point of the report stressing that the vast majority of drugs are compatible with breastfeeding is very important in trying to reverse the high level of anxiety and misperception of breastfeeding mothers and many health professionals Dr Gideon Koren director of the Motherisk Program at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto told Reuters Health in an email  Koren who wasnt involved in the AAP publication also pointed people to the LactMed database but said he believes the new clinical report will be widely used and cited  Women who are breastfeeding should tell their doctors about any overthecounter drugs and herbal remedies they may be using Sachs said in addition to prescription medications  SOURCE httpbitlyHMKf Pediatrics online August  Â
