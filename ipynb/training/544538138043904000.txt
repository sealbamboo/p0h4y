Despite a national crackdown on prescription drug abuse doctors churned out an everlarger number of prescriptions for the mostpotent controlled substances to Medicare patients new data show In addition ProPublica found the most prolific prescribers of such drugs as oxycodone fentanyl morphine and Ritalin often have worrisome records In  the most recent year for which data is available Medicare covered nearly  million prescriptions for powerful narcotic painkillers and stimulants with the highest potential for abuse and dependence Thats up  percent over  compared to a  percent increase in Medicare prescriptions overall Even taking into account an increase in the number of Medicare enrollees the prescribing rate rose slightly for these drugs which are classified as Schedule  controlled substances by the Drug Enforcement Administration Twelve of Medicares top  prescribers of Schedule  drugs in  have faced disciplinary actions by their state medical boards or criminal charges related to their medical practices and another had documents seized from his office by federal agents The No  prescriber    of Huntsville Ala with more than  Schedule  prescriptions in   had his controlled substances certificate suspended by the state medical board in March  He surrendered his medical license four months later Aggarwal could not be reached for comment Prescribing high volumes of Schedule  drugs can indicate a doctor is running a pill mill said Dr Andrew Kolodny chief medical officer of Phoenix House a New Yorkbased drug treatment provider Government regulators should do more to monitor prescribing patterns and intervene proactively if they appear aberrant he said We wait til these doctors kill people said Kolodny founder of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing which advocates for tighter regulation of painkillers It doesnt make any sense Medicares drug program known as Part D now covers about  million seniors and disabled people and pays for more than one of every four prescriptions dispensed in this country Concerns about oversight of controlled substances date back to at least    of opioids in Part D and called on Medicare to take action Within the past year Medicare has started to use prescribing data to identify potentially problematic doctors as have some state medical boards Beginning in mid Medicare will have the authority to kick doctors out of the program if they prescribe in abusive ways Its a real area of concern for us said Dr Shantanu Agrawal director of the Center for Program Integrity within the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services The  data shows the upward trend line for prescriptions of controlled substances before these initiatives took hold The Drug Enforcement Administration classifies certain potent drugs based on their potential for abuse and sets limits on prescribing for each group Drugs classified as Schedule  require written prescriptions and cannot be refilled ProPublica reported in  that   or take action against providers whose patterns were troubling even if they had been charged with Medicare fraud or kicked out of state Medicaid programs Shelinder Aggarwals Medicare prescribing history had plenty of red flags The pain medicine specialist has consistently shown up in Medicares data as a top prescriber of narcotics By  the year before he stopped practicing more than  percent of his Medicare patients received at least one prescription for a Schedule  drug in many cases oxycodone It took complaints from pharmacies near Aggarwals office to alert the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners to his unusual prescribing habits said Larry Dixon the boards executive director Board investigators subsequently made undercover visits to the doctors office and videotaped him prescribing drugs without an exam If you paid  in cash they would put a VIP stamp on your medical records and you didnt ever have to have an appointment Dixon said Medicares Part D data draws a roadmap to the doctors who prescribe controlled substances most frequently In   providers wrote at least  prescriptions for Schedule  drugs ProPublicas analysis shows They were concentrated in a handful of states Florida led the country with  providers followed by Tennessee with  Look up your doctor using our   tool About one in five doctors who wrote at least  prescriptions for Schedule  drugs have faced some kind of sanction or investigation ProPublica found In September Medicare sent  letters to doctors who   than others in their medical specialty and state Officials hope the initiative will cause doctors to examine their prescribing and make changes Simply being an outlier doesnt establish that youre doing something wrong said CMS Agrawal What we are trying to do is give physicians the ability to assess themselves given their comparative data Medicare also has sent information on  prescribers for possible investigation to the inspector general of the US Department of Health and Human Services and on one doctor to a state medical board Some medical licensing boards are also expanding their efforts to use data to spot problematic prescribing North Carolinas medical board has proposed new regulations allowing the agency that runs the states prescription drug monitoring program to share data with the board The board currently can only access the data when it is pursuing an active investigation into a particular physician Similarly Alabamas legislature recently authorized its medical board to regulate pain medicine clinics and proactively access data from its prescription monitoring database Dixon the Alabama boards executive director and Henderson said their states changes are not meant to impede legitimate care by doctors Most of these people are just as genuine as you could possibly hope Dixon said Data alone can be misleading Dr Mark Ellis a pain specialist in Athens Ga was the thirdhighest prescriber of Schedule  drugs in the country in  with more than  prescriptions But unlike many states Georgia does not allow nurse practitioners and physician assistants to write prescriptions for these controlled substances on their own requiring them to be signed by a physician As a result Ellis said he was credited with the prescribing of four other professionals in his practice Ellis was fined by Georgias medical board in July  for working with a physician assistant without consent from the board With scrutiny of painkiller prescribing on the rise Ellis said he attempts to ensure that patients are taking not selling their pills by requiring frequent drug testing Rules put in place by several states have reduced prescribing of narcotics experts say New York Kentucky and Tennessee now require that doctors check databases that track every controlled substance prescription in their states before prescribing such drugs to patients for the first time and at certain intervals afterward Other states are considering or are in the process of implementing similar rules Mandatory checks are the mosteffective single tool weve found yet to address this problem said John Eadie director of the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Center of Excellence at Brandeis University
