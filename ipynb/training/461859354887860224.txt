Children regardless of race or social class are victimized at higher rates than adults according to the   Some children in this country also   on a daily basis which can have longterm psychological consequences The recession didnt reverse the trend and thats unusual   more violence and crime occurs during economic downturns  We often expect stress and dislocation that happens during a recession can exacerbate conflicts and crime and violence but it seems not to have been the case for the most part in the most recent recession said the studys lead author  This study confirms what we have noticed from a variety of other sources that childrens safety has improved since  said Finkelhor director of the  at the University of New Hampshire   This was true even for   who live in neighborhoods where violent crime rates are disproportionately high   also were safer according to this study   The results do mirror the larger trend that some sociologists call   Rates of violence in general have decreased since the s and experts dont know exactly why  Finkelhor and his coauthors shared a few theories on why violence against children has declined  One is that many public health programs specifically designed to curb violence against children work  Studies show some programs which include   and domestic violence awareness initiatives have had success Another theory is that more people are on psychiatric medicine that reduces aggressive behavior The study showed  of children were taking psychiatric medication in  by  that had increased to  More adults are also taking medication for depression and anxiety which may also reduce family violence      Finkelhor thinks technology may also play an unexpected role in violence reduction    More children have cell phones he said which means more can call for help if they sense danger  Social media may also play a role A lot of people think that the Internet made kids more vulnerable and has induced them into taking more risks There may be some of that Finkelhor said It can also open kids up to an avenue of online bullying  But with so many kids preoccupied with social media the risktaking behavior that comes along with adolescence may now be more in the virtual realm than in reality  If they are taking those risks in their bedroom there may be a delay in their actual behavior Finkelhor said which can leave youths vulnerable to violence or crime Kids who spend a lot of time online also have a lot less time to be bored Boredom can led to crime and violence for some children Finkelhor theorized The study should give the public hope said   director of the Center for Healthy Development at Georgia State University who wrote an editorial accompanying the study    Of course one instance of violence is too many one child being bullied is too many Lutzker said But these results show we are making tremendous progress  He urges people to keep this trend in perspective however The United States is far more violent than other developed countries and we hold the record for the number of people we incarcerate Lutzker said   He and Finkelhor noted the study lacks comparative data about children under age  Statistically those children are at a   for death from maltreatment That data are now being collected Finkelhor said so researchers should have a better understanding of violence and its impact on this age group in the future  Both academics are hopeful that this positive trend can continue   Behavior we see in childhood often continues into adulthood Finkelhor said In other words if children of this generation experience less violence in theory they will be less violent to the next generation and so on  Finkelhor said he thinks the findings hint at a broader trend that tends to get overlooked in the modern media landscape  I think there is a kind of alarmism which tends to pervade a lot of coverage and certainly when I talk with my undergraduates they think things are getting worse Finkelhor said  Other positive trends for children he believes have been overlooked  the high school dropout rate is decreasing the number of missing children is down overall teen sexual behavior is getting more responsible the use of contraception is up teen pregnancies are down and a variety of mental health indicators for children are moving in a positive direction with improvement in the suicide rate   I havent seen this get enough attention Finkelhor said  And he makes a prediction We may look back at this era in a much more positive light than we feel about it now as we are currently going through it
