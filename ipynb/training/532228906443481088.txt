For those on the front lines of fighting hunger in America the past halfdecade has been like running on empty The Great Recession that began in  left millions of families struggling with   like whether to pay for housing or dinner But the latest   on food insecurity in America offers a hint of hope The percentage of Americans who say they did not have enough money to buy food for themselves or their families in the last  months dropped to its lowest level since    percent down from  percent in  the poll found I absolutely would describe it as a glimmer of hope says Elaine Waxman vice president of research and nutrition at Feeding America a network of US food banks Waxman oversaw the release this summer of   the largest study of charitable food assistance in the country That survey which was conducted in  found that more than  in  Americans used a food pantry last year    The new Gallup poll picks up where Hunger in America left off polling people from January to October of this year And the message says Waxman is that maybe things are finally starting to get back on track I think its some good news that we are beginning to see a little movement she says because weve been stuck at earlier recession levels for so long The Gallup survey numbers on food insecurity are higher than those released by the US Department of Agriculture in September which found that  percent of American households werent getting enough to eat Why the difference Gallup asks a single question while USDA asks a battery of questions that tend to weed out those families who are straddling the line between struggling and getting by  barely And this is the income group that seems to be benefiting finally from the economic recovery According to Gallup the biggest drop in food insecurity this year was experienced by households earning between  and  a year One thing that may be working in these families favor is the rollout of the Affordable Care Act suggests   founding director of the Center for Poverty Research at the University of Kentucky This is the group that historically made too much for Medicaid he notes But if these families are getting health care under Obamacare he says its freeing up money to buy food whereas before they had to use that to buy prescription medicine Thats just Ziliaks hunch  he has no hard data to back it up yet he says  but it jibes with the latest Hunger in America report which found that  percent of food bank users had had to choose between paying for food and health care in the previous  months Obamacare didnt really kick in until this year While the Gallup findings provide some reason from optimism its hardly time to celebrate According to   the percentage of families who said they were struggling to get enough to eat in    percent  remains stubbornly high compared with prerecessionary levels when about  percent of households reported food insecurity In other words the need is still very much there Anecdotally were hearing from some food banks that some people are coming less frequently says Waxman But theyre still coming
