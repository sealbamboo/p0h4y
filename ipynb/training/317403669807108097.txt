Burns are nasty injuries  theyre painful and if youre not careful they can quickly get infected Two children die from burn injuries every day   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention A surprising number of these deaths originate with tap water that is way too hot The problem a new study suggests is that many water heaters are set dangerously high  is a scientist at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health who studies home injury risks Shields wanted to look at home water heaters because she says she couldnt understand why tap water burns are still common causing an estimated  hospital admissions and  deaths per year You see back in  the Consumer Product Safety Commission   that water heater manufacturers preset the maximum temperature at  degrees Fahrenheit to prevent burns And the manufacturers voluntarily followed those recommendations  supposedly But a lot of people have continued to be scalded by water coming from the shower or tap We expected to see a drop off in burns after the old heaters were phased out Shields tells Shots but that hasnt happened So Shields and her colleagues surveyed nearly  homes in Baltimore to find out whether water heaters were actually set at  degrees They found that the heater setting was unsafely high in  percent of the homes including  percent with temperatures at or above  degrees Fahrenheit This is really dangerous for an older person or a young child Shields says Young children are especially at risk for scald burns because their skin is thinner the elderly are also at a higher risk because they can be less sensitive to temperature so may be slower to move away from the scalding water The problem in many homes Shields says is that most water heaters dont even have a thermostat that adjusts to a specific temperature So to avoid tap water burns Shields recommends testing your water heater by letting the hot water run from the tap for three minutes then checking the water temperature with a candy thermometer If its too hot lower the gauge on the heater she says Then test it a second time to make sure youve really gotten it down to  degrees The   appears in the March issue of the
