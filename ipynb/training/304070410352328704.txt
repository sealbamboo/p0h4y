 A man who finds his wifes salary is eclipsing his own may feel that earnings difference in the bedroom  and not in a good way Thats according to a new study that found that men who made less than their wives were more prone to require impotence drugs compared to when the income gap was the other way around Admittedly the difference wasnt much Men who were outearned by their wives were  percent more likely to take drugs for   said study coauthor Lamar Pierce an associate professor of strategy at Washington University in St Louis However even a relatively small difference in income between the spouses boosted the odds that a man might need pharmaceutical help in the bedroom Men who make even  less a year than their wives are  percent more likely to take ED medications than men who make  more he noted The study was published online recently in the   A shift in the marital   seemed to be key According to Pierce the findings did not apply to couples where the woman already made more than the man going into the marriage Men who knowingly married a female primary breadwinner appear to suffer no costs from being outearned Pierce and coauthors wrote in the study Nor did the findings apply to unmarried couples who were living together To Pierce that suggests that marriage is an important social construct dictating his role as primary breadwinner The study was done in Denmark which is viewed as a socially progressive country Pierce said He believes the findings would apply in the United States and probably even be more robust among American couples In the past  years the percent of American wives who make more than their husbands has risen from  percent to  percent said Pierce citing research by others The new study focused on two databases One included demographic information such as income and other details for all Danish citizens Another included all medical prescriptions for the population Pierce looked at data from  to and zeroed in on more than  couples aged  to  where both partners worked full time Men were not the only ones affected psychologically by income differences within marriage For example Pierce found that wives who outearned their husbands were themselves more likely to take medications for insomnia and anxiety Outearned husbands were also more likely to take anxiety and depression medications compared to situations where the male was the major breadwinner The research suggests a link between marital income disparities and impotence but it cannot prove causeandeffect Pierce stressed He did add that he factored out issues such as health problems which might affect income and the link still held He cant explain for sure why the outearned men turn to impotence drugs We cant directly say this is a result of them being emasculated but it may be he said Another expert sees two possible explanations One might be that it is threatening for men to be outearned by their wives and that threat is carried all the way into the bedroom which leads him to be less able to perform well sexually said Kathleen Vohs a professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management Her work focuses on the impact of incomemoney on human psychology Another explanation she said which is similar but not quite is that the husband might use the ED medication as a way to   that he is not emasculated in the bedroom Pierce said its important not to suggest that the trend toward female breadwinners is socially harmful Many men are perfectly fine with and very proud of a spouse who earns more he said However he said it is important for couples to think about this before they marry and to marry someone with whom each is comfortable with the others potential   now and in the future And Vohs had this advice for men outearned by their spouse Try not to take the discrepancy in income as having anything to do with your   she said Try to remember that your partner loves you for who you are and not for how much money you earn  Copyright     All rights reserved
