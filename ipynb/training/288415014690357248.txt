Whats the coolest new gadget at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week Its too soon to tell But I have an early favorite for the title of oddest new gadget the   and HAPIspoon They may sound like characters from a nursery rhyme but this fork and spoon connect to the Internet and can monitor and record how you eat The HAPI utensils measure how long your meals last how long you pause between each bite and how many mouthfuls of food you consume If these utensils think you are eating too fast they will vibrate  it feels kind of like a silent ring on a cellphone  to let you know to slow down Unfortunately they are not yet programmed to beep or issue electric shock if you chew with your mouth open However you can plug them into your computer when you are done with your meal and upload the data about what you just ate And you can share it all on Twitter As odd as the HAPI utensils may be they actually touch on a couple of major themes here this year One is that computers and sensors are being built into everything from forks to ski goggles The second trend that the HAPI utensils epitomize is the proliferation of gadgets designed to monitor your weight or how much you exercise or to keep tabs on your eating habits Most of these little gadgets make it possible to post all of this information online  or analyze it on your smartphone A company called   helped kick off this trend a couple of years ago by launching an Internetconnected scale Withings is back with more monitoring devices But its a crowded field There are at least a halfdozen companies from   to   to Nikes   competing to make little gadgets or bracelets that can measure how fast you run or how many steps you take your pulse or even your sleep I met one poor woman who worked for Withings public relations who has now been posting her weight on Facebook for years All of which makes me wonder if these products really appeal to anyone There are millions of dieters in America but do they really want to share details about every pound lost or gained And of course there are hardcore athletes who want to collect detailed data on every workout but thats not exactly a mass market This category hasnt really broken through to the mainstream So perhaps it shouldnt be surprising that some companies that make these devices are   about using them to create employee incentive programs For me though that tiptoes right up to the creepy line But enough about exercise and eating right CES wouldnt be CES without something for the couch potato There are literally acres of TVs in every possible flavor from D to the new superhighdef K televisions One of the tech trends Im interested in is the ongoing effort to get your TV to play nicely with your smartphone tablet or PC So far one of the most interesting and surprising things in this space has come from Nvidia Its graphic processors power countless video games and   on the planet But Sunday Nvidia launched its first ever consumer gaming device It allows gamers to stream either Android games or PC games from this little tablet     right onto their bigscreen TV in their living room But thats not the Shields only trick Basically the Shield is an Android tablet with game controllers attached But it can also tap into PCs equipped with Nvidias latest processors and can access all the movies and content in the Google Play store  and throw all of that content up on your TV You should be able to sit on your couch and if you decide that you would like to share the movie that you are watching on television you simply have to beam it to your television said   Nvidias cofounder and CEO For a device like the Shield to become a commercial success it has to be incredibly simple to use It just has to work Judging from Nvidias demo Sunday night its not there yet There were some hiccups  long pauses and awkward moments  while executives onstage tried but failed to connect the device to a PC and a TV But even if this particular gadget doesnt catch on I think its clearly pointing in the direction consumer electronics are headed
