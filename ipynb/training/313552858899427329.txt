Nothing sends more kids to the hospital than   So when doctors at   in Boston noticed they kept seeing an unusually high number of asthmatic kids from certain lowincome neighborhoods they wondered if they could do something about the environment these kids were living in Its wellknown that   are   by dust mold pests such as mice and cockroaches polluted air and other environmental aggravations To help parents get rid of those triggers Childrens Hospital developed the   The program first identifies frequent fliers  children who show up often at the hospitals emergency room with asthma attacks Many of them get admitted repeatedly to bring their asthma under control Then program staffers contact the parents Its a teachable moment says program director   Its a time when families are very open to wanting to do something new and different to help their child stay out of the hospital The next step is a home visit from a community health worker like Margie Lorenzi who recently paid a call on Maria TexeiraGomes of Dorchester a neighborhood in Boston Gomes yearold son Matheo has had asthma nearly all his life After he was hospitalized last fall she agreed to accept Lorenzis help in identifying and eliminating the things in her household that kept triggering his asthma attacks This was Lorenzis third visit to the Gomes household  a small tidy house with a view of the Boston skyline Well just go over the triggers like we did the first time and the second time around and see what changes youve implemented within the home Lorenzi said as the two women settled around the kitchen table an air purifier humming on a nearby counter Gomes said she had made lots of changes We have the   vacuum which is what I use to dust and vacuum the home Gomes said I try to vacuum when Matheo is at school Gomes a social worker said she has stopped using room deodorants and no longer lights candles They can aggravate asthma Just being diligent and thinking about his needs she said Gomes now uses a vinegarandwater solution to clean in order to avoid harsh chemicals You know within our culture we like to do this excessive cleaning with bleach and Lysol and all that stuff she said So I try to minimize it Lorenzi ran through a checklist of other triggers No mold No cockroaches What about mice Gomes answered no to each Then Lorenzi checked under the sink and in the bathroom looking for trouble She was pleased to see that Gomes had gotten rid of the living room carpet that harbored allergens that she vacuums curtains and window blinds to reduce dust that Matheos toys and shoes are stored in dustproof plastic bins provided by the Asthma Initiative and that Grandmas cat stays upstairs in her apartment at all times All of these changes seemed to be paying off That was apparent when Lorenzi calculated something called an Asthma Control Score for Matheo How much of the time did the asthma keep him from going to school and keep you from going to work Lorenzi asked None of the time Gomes said Awesome And during the past four weeks how much of the time did he have shortness of breath that you noticed Would you say once a day Three to six times a week Once or twice a week Or not at all Not at all Gomes replied Im liking this Lorenzi laughed Matheos score turned out to be   which means his asthma is wellcontrolled On Lorenzis last visit it was  not wellcontrolled Matheo used to end up in the hospital every time he had a cold and in between there were many trips to the emergency room But no longer He still has to take asthma medicine  but less often His asthma isnt waking him up at night anymore And once a week he goes swimming The Community Asthma Initiative has served more than a thousand families over the past seven years It costs about  per family  not only for staff time but also for things like plastic bins a special mattress and pillow covers and the vacuum cleaner that filters out fine dust Its not cheap  and its not something hospitals typically do But just a few visits over a years time make a demonstrable difference For every dollar spent Elizabeth Woods tells Shots you save  for hospitalizations and emergency room visits The programs performance was detailed in a   published last year by the journal   Theres a  percent reduction in patients with any emergency room visits Woods adds and an  percent reduction in patients with any hospitalizations And that doesnt include the savings from lower use of medications or the cost of time off work for parents caring for a sick child The program is beginning to catch on around the country Woods says she knows of startups and keen interest in Alabama Tennessee Rhode Island Illinois Indiana Delaware Florida and Ohio Woods hopes to persuade Medicaid and other insurers to pay for this sort of simple reengineering of the home environment  pioneered by the Boston program  so they dont have to pay so much for treating asthma attacks
