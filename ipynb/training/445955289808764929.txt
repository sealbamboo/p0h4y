Many of us have long been told that saturated fat the type found in meat butter and cheese causes heart disease But a large and exhaustive new analysis by a team of international scientists found no evidence that eating saturated fat increased heart attacks and other cardiac events The new findings are part of a growing body of research that has challenged the accepted wisdom that saturated fat is inherently bad for you and will continue the debate about what foods are best to eat For decades health officials have urged the public to avoid saturated fat as much as possible saying it should be replaced with the unsaturated fats in foods like nuts fish seeds and vegetable oils But the new research published on Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine did not find that people who ate higher levels of saturated fat had more heart disease than those who ate less Nor did it find less disease in those eating higher amounts of unsaturated fat including monounsaturated fat like olive oil or polyunsaturated fat like corn oil My take on this would be that its not saturated fat that we should worry about in our diets said Dr Rajiv Chowdhury the lead author of the new study and a cardiovascular epidemiologist in the department of public health and primary care at Cambridge University But Dr Frank Hu a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health said the findings should not be taken as a green light to eat more steak butter and other foods rich in saturated fat He said that looking at individual fats and other nutrient groups in isolation could be misleading because when people cut down on fats they tend to eat more bread cold cereal and other refined carbohydrates that can also be bad for cardiovascular health The single macronutrient approach is outdated said Dr Hu who was not involved in the study I think future dietary guidelines will put more and more emphasis on real food rather than giving an absolute upper limit or cutoff point for certain macronutrients He said people should try to eat foods that are typical of the Mediterranean diet like nuts fish avocado highfiber grains and olive oil A   which was not included in the current analysis found that a Mediterranean diet with more nuts and extra virgin olive oil reduced heart attacks and strokes when compared with a lower fat diet with more starches Alice H Lichtenstein a nutritional biochemist at Tufts University agreed that it would be unfortunate if these results were interpreted to suggest that people can go back to eating butter and cheese with abandon citing evidence that replacing saturated fat with foods that are high in polyunsaturated fats  instead of simply eating more carbohydrates  reduces cardiovascular risk Dr Lichtenstein who was not involved in the latest study was the lead author of the American Heart Associations dietary guidelines which recommend that people restrict saturated fat to   or roughly two tablespoons of butter or two ounces of Cheddar cheese for the typical person eating about  calories a day The heart association states that restricting saturated fat and eating more unsaturated fat beans and vegetables   In the new research Dr Chowdhury and his colleagues sought to evaluate the best evidence to date drawing on nearly  studies involving more than a half million people They looked not only at what people reportedly ate but at more objective measures such as the composition of fatty acids in their bloodstreams and in their fat tissue The scientists also reviewed evidence from  randomized controlled trials  the gold standard in scientific research  that assessed whether taking polyunsaturated fat supplements like fish oil promoted heart health The researchers did find a link between trans fats the now widely maligned partially hydrogenated oils that had long been added to processed foods and heart disease But they found no evidence of dangers from saturated fat or benefits from other kinds of fats The primary reason saturated fat has historically had a bad reputation is that it increases   cholesterol or LDL the kind that raises the risk for heart attacks But the relationship between saturated fat and LDL is complex said Dr Chowdhury In addition to raising LDL cholesterol saturated fat also increases high  or HDL the socalled good cholesterol And the LDL that it raises is a subtype of big fluffy particles that are generally benign Doctors refer to a preponderance of these particles as LDL pattern A The smallest and densest form of LDL is more dangerous These particles are easily oxidized and are more likely to set off inflammation and contribute to the buildup of arterynarrowing plaque An LDL profile that consists mostly of these particles known as pattern B usually coincides with high triglycerides and low levels of HDL both risk factors for heart attacks and stroke The smaller more arteryclogging particles are increased not by saturated fat but by sugary foods and an excess of carbohydrates Dr Chowdhury said Its the high carbohydrate or sugary diet that should be the focus of dietary guidelines he said If anything is driving your lowdensity lipoproteins in a more adverse way its carbohydrates While the new research showed no relationship overall between saturated or polyunsaturated fat intake and cardiac events there are numerous unique fatty acids within these two groups and there was some indication that they are not all equal When the researchers looked at fatty acids in the bloodstream for example they found that margaric acid a saturated fat in milk and dairy products was associated with lower cardiovascular risk Two types of omega fatty acids the polyunsaturated fats found in fish were also protective But a number of the omega polyunsaturated fatty acids commonly found in vegetable oils and processed foods may pose risks the findings suggested The researchers then looked at data from the randomized trials to see if taking supplements like fish oil produced any cardiovascular benefits It did not But Dr Chowdhury said there might be a good explanation for this discrepancy The supplement trials mostly involved people who had preexisting heart disease or were at high risk of developing it while the other studies involved generally healthy populations So it is possible that the benefits of omega fatty acids lie in preventing heart disease rather than treating or reversing it At least two large clinical trials designed to see if this is the case are currently underway
