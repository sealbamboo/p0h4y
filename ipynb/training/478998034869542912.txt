"I'm still looking for answers, because it was a confusing and difficult time.", Asked specifically what she wants to know, Clinton said: "There's a lot we don't know," such as who was behind the attack and what was their motivation., Clinton has long said Benghazi was her biggest regret from her tenure at State and regularly says that the decisions of the day were made "based on imperfect information," and that despite the right intentions come with "unforeseen consequences, unpredictable twists and turns.", Asked if she should have ordered Stevens to leave Libya, given that it was the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Clinton said, "If any of us had known, we would have certainly cautioned and maybe even directed people to shelter in place ... and wait to see what was going to happen.",  ,  Clinton said on Tuesday that the United States needs to have "a more thoughtful conversation" on guns and blasted gun rights activists., "We cannot let a minority of people -- and that's what it is, it is a minority of people -- hold a viewpoint that terrorizes the majority of people," she said., Those comments are the strongest she has made in favor of gun control during her book tour and plant Clinton firmly with those who support tougher restrictions., "We're going to have to do a better job protecting the vast majority of our citizens, including our children, from that very, very, very small group that is unfortunately prone to violence and now with automatic weapons can wreak so much more violence than they ever could have before," Clinton said. , Clinton has said during her paid speaking tour over the past six months that the United States needs "to , that anybody can have a gun, anywhere, anytime.", In the weeks and months after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Democrats -- led by President Barack Obama -- looked to spearhead efforts to strengthen gun laws and expand background checks of firearm sales. , Despite public support for the background check provision, a compromise plan failed to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate in April of last year, and efforts since then have been minimal., Clinton has backed those efforts and during the town hall, she backed reinstating the ban on assault weapons and banning high-capacity magazines.,  During her book tour, Clinton had come out firmly in support of immigration reform and even bashed its opponents, labeling them as people who "don't seem to understand one of our strongest and most important attributes is that we are still a nation of immigrants.", But on Tuesday, Clinton gave an answer that is sure to rile some in her base when she defended Obama's deportation practices., "We have to understand the difficulty that President Obama finds himself in because there are laws that impose certain obligations on him," Clinton said in response to a questioner who called Obama the "deporter-in-chief.", But she was pressed by Amanpour about tens of thousands of children fleeing Central American countries and crossing the southern border into the United States.

"But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families.", On this problem particularly, Clinton later said, "We have so to send a clear message, just because your child gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay. So, we don't want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey.", While campaigning for president in 2007, Clinton was positively against decriminalizing marijuana., "I don't think we should decriminalize it," Clinton said at the time. "But we ought to do research (into) what, if any, benefits it has.", After Tuesday's town hall, it appears Clinton has evolved on the issue, though., "On recreational, you know, states are the laboratories of democracy," Clinton said.

I want to wait and see what the evidence is.", In 2012, voters in Washington and Colorado passed ballot initiatives that legalized small amounts of marijuana for recreational use.

"I didn't do it when I was young. I'm not going to start now," she said with a laugh., Marijuana now joins same-sex marriage as another issue on which Clinton has evolved as the country's opinion has., According to a January CNN/ORC International poll on marijuana, 55% of those questioned nationally said marijuana should be made legal, with 44% disagreeing. In 1987, only 16% of Americans backed legalization., Clinton backed same-sex marriage in 2013, just weeks after leaving the State Department. At that time, public opinion on the issue had began to shift toward allowing same-sex marriage and Clinton adjusted her position after most in her party had., The change seemed to win over some in the crowd, too. "I think she has evolved a lot," said Daniel Cohen of Chapel Hill, North Carolina., As Clinton's book was about to hit stores, both Obama and Clinton aides wanted no daylight between the former rivals.

"What they (Iran) want to do in Baghdad is basically to envelop (Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki) in the Iranian embrace, maybe even use their own troops in Iraq, as they did in Syria. That is a very difficult position to put the United States in.", The United States and Iran have held "very brief discussions" about Iraq., A U.S.-Iran partnership would be problematic for Clinton. , already have questions about Clinton's State Department record and her work with Iran.
