Between the answers and dodges though Clinton sounded acted and presented herself very much like a candidate not solely as a former secretary of state She was careful at times about not going too far on an issue and when asked about forward looking policy questions she regularly used the word we Clinton also entertained questions about  She said shes not going to be rushed to decide on whether to run for president and that she was not moving any closer to making a decision Here are six key moments where citizen Clinton sounded like candidate Clinton Since leaving the State Department in  the deadly Benghazi terror attack has been the most talked about question around Clinton  Conservatives see it as her biggest weakness while liberals say it shows how worried the right is about a Clinton presidency On Tuesday Clinton said shes very pleased that special forces captured Ahmed Abu Khatallah a militia leader alleged to have been a mastermind of the armed assault on the US diplomatic compound in eastern Libya in September  that killed four Americans including Ambassador Christopher Stevens Her comments lined up with much of what she has said previously She defended the fact that Americans were in Benghazi in the first place but said not everything around what occurred is clear yet There are answers not all of them not enough frankly Clinton said Im still looking for answers because it was a confusing and difficult time Asked specifically what she wants to know Clinton said Theres a lot we dont know such as who was behind the attack and what was their motivation Clinton has long said Benghazi was her biggest regret from her tenure at State and regularly says that the decisions of the day were made based on imperfect information and that despite the right intentions come with unforeseen consequences unpredictable twists and turns Asked if she should have ordered Stevens to leave Libya given that it was the anniversary of the  attacks Clinton said If any of us had known we would have certainly cautioned and maybe even directed people to shelter in place  and wait to see what was going to happen    Clinton said on Tuesday that the United States needs to have a more thoughtful conversation on guns and blasted gun rights activists We cannot let a minority of people  and thats what it is it is a minority of people  hold a viewpoint that terrorizes the majority of people she said Those comments are the strongest she has made in favor of gun control during her book tour and plant Clinton firmly with those who support tougher restrictions Were going to have to do a better job protecting the vast majority of our citizens including our children from that very very very small group that is unfortunately prone to violence and now with automatic weapons can wreak so much more violence than they ever could have before Clinton said  Clinton has said during her paid speaking tour over the past six months that the United States needs to  that anybody can have a gun anywhere anytime In the weeks and months after the  Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting Democrats  led by President Barack Obama  looked to spearhead efforts to strengthen gun laws and expand background checks of firearm sales  Despite public support for the background check provision a compromise plan failed to pass the Democraticcontrolled Senate in April of last year and efforts since then have been minimal Clinton has backed those efforts and during the town hall she backed reinstating the ban on assault weapons and banning highcapacity magazines  During her book tour Clinton had come out firmly in support of immigration reform and even bashed its opponents labeling them as people who dont seem to understand one of our strongest and most important attributes is that we are still a nation of immigrants But on Tuesday Clinton gave an answer that is sure to rile some in her base when she defended Obamas deportation practices We have to understand the difficulty that President Obama finds himself in because there are laws that impose certain obligations on him Clinton said in response to a questioner who called Obama the deporterinchief But she was pressed by Amanpour about tens of thousands of children fleeing Central American countries and crossing the southern border into the United States Its become a major problem that some liken to a humanitarian crisis The Obama administration has stepped up efforts to begin deportation proceedings and Clinton supports sending them home if possible They should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back Clinton said But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families On this problem particularly Clinton later said We have so to send a clear message just because your child gets across the border that doesnt mean the child gets to stay So we dont want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey While campaigning for president in  Clinton was positively against decriminalizing marijuana I dont think we should decriminalize it Clinton said at the time But we ought to do research into what if any benefits it has After Tuesdays town hall it appears Clinton has evolved on the issue though On recreational you know states are the laboratories of democracy Clinton said We have at least two states that are experimenting with that right now I want to wait and see what the evidence is In  voters in Washington and Colorado passed ballot initiatives that legalized small amounts of marijuana for recreational use Other states have allowed usage for medical reasons Clinton said Tuesday that she doesnt think weve done enough research yet on medical marijuana questions but said that there should be availability of marijuana under appropriate circumstances As for smoking pot herself Clinton declined I didnt do it when I was young Im not going to start now she said with a laugh Marijuana now joins samesex marriage as another issue on which Clinton has evolved as the countrys opinion has According to a January CNNORC International poll on marijuana  of those questioned nationally said marijuana should be made legal with  disagreeing In  only  of Americans backed legalization Clinton backed samesex marriage in  just weeks after leaving the State Department At that time public opinion on the issue had began to shift toward allowing samesex marriage and Clinton adjusted her position after most in her party had The change seemed to win over some in the crowd too I think she has evolved a lot said Daniel Cohen of Chapel Hill North Carolina As Clintons book was about to hit stores both Obama and Clinton aides wanted no daylight between the former rivals The messaging was that Obamas team of rivals was unrivaled during Clintons four years at State But at the town hall  as well as in her book  Clinton distanced herself from Obama particularly on the approach to the civil war in Syria We pushed very hard Clinton said about her view that the United States should arm and help rebels that were fighting Syrian government forces But as I say in my book I believe that Harry Truman was right the buck stops with the president Clinton added that she told Obama that the United States should have armed rebels you know two plus years ago Asked if the White Houses decision not to get involved in Syria beyond the limited help that has been given to rebels was a failure Clinton said she thinks it is too soon to tell In the past though Clinton has said that the rise of terrorist groups in Syria has allowed for the rise of Islamists in Iraq While Clinton distanced herself from Obama on Syria she also pulled herself closer and defended Obama on another issue Clinton firmly planted herself last week with the White House and those who say the United States should not provide military assistance  particularly airstrikes  to the Iraqi government in response to the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and other militants But the story has already moved  Now Secretary of State John Kerry Clintons successor says the United States could end up cooperating with Iran to stop the militant threat On Tuesday she cased doubt on cooperating with Iran in an answer that was as much foreign policy as it was political I  am not prepared to say that we go in with Iran right now until we have a better idea what were getting ourselves into Clinton said What they Iran want to do in Baghdad is basically to envelop Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri alMaliki in the Iranian embrace maybe even use their own troops in Iraq as they did in Syria That is a very difficult position to put the United States in The United States and Iran have held very brief discussions about Iraq A USIran partnership would be problematic for Clinton  already have questions about Clintons State Department record and her work with Iran Clinton has touted her ties to Israel and her mistrust of Iran in speeches to Jewish organizations
