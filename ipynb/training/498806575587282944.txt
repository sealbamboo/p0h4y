NPRs Ofeibea QuistArcton is in Freetown the capital of Sierra Leone covering the Ebola outbreak that began earlier this year in Guinea and has spread to neighboring countries When we reached her by phone on Sunday she was in a car trying to fight an infestation of ants Back in her hotel she shared her impressions Yep I went to listen to sermons just to see if Ebola was mentioned The Roman Catholic Church has a prayer they say at the end of every Mass against the dreadful disease of Ebola Hear our humble cry and save our country from the Ebola disaster By the power of your divine touch heal all those who have been affected by the Ebola virus and totally free them from the clutches of the evil one Ebola No crying But it was heartfelt Everybody repeated it Its printed at the back of the Sunday liturgical celebration May your spirit repel and destroy the harm of this dreadful disease In Guinea there didnt seem to be a huge amount of panic There was fear In Sierra Leone Im finding fear panic suspicion denial a whole mix What surprised me is the level of denial There are substantial public service announcements posters with very graphic illustrations of the symptoms of Ebola and yet people can look you in the eye and say Nobody in my family has had Ebola I havent seen it with my own eyes I dont think Ebola exists At least nobody here in Freetown is saying its the white health workers fault as we found in Guinea But there have still been attacks on health centers and ambulances in Sierra Leones Ebola epicenters in the east which have now been sealed off by troops This has become a talking point  not so much on the street but certainly in social media which is very active here in Sierra Leone and in the diaspora The same for Liberia Its coming into the general consciousness people are discussing How come its foreigners Westerners They havent said white people per se because Sierra Leoneans are very courteous but you know thats what they mean They are asking how come its Western health workers who have access to the drug  we have health workers here too in West Africa who are dying With gloves antibacterial gel I dont know whether it has the alcohol content it should have to be effective chlorine wipes masks for my mouth Ive even got thermometers And other peoples goodwill I dont want to pass it on to anyone if I should be infected and I know Sierra Leoneans dont want to pass it on to me You can be as judicious as you try to be but you just dont know Sierra Leoneans are the most friendly people in the world But   It has finally clicked People are finally understanding that even though youre friendly you dont shake hands Nobodys shaking hands Sierra Leoneans are very big huggers But theres no hugging not even air kissing Although the smiles are still huge and sincere Theyre grateful to have journalists here they say to cut through the misinformation on all sides But Im also being told Make sure you tell the whole truth about whats happening here Oh yes People are saying Were praying Its through prayer and through carefully listening to instructions and following them that people have hope So you do find buckets of chlorinated water outside hotels shops peoples homes government and other offices People are doing their little bit Yes wash your hands especially when entering And its prominent on the awareness posters Wash your hands often with soap and water Its an effective barrier Its rainy season and its pouring down Sometimes it makes things feel worse And then the sun comes out and shines you feel a little better When I was in the car battling the ants it was lashing rain But the sun has just come out
