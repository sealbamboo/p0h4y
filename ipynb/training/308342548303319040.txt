Scientists believe a little girl born with HIV has been cured of the infection Shes the first child and only the second person in the world known to have been cured since the virus touched off a global pandemic nearly  years ago Doctors arent releasing the childs name but we know she was born in Mississippi and is now   years old  and healthy Scientists presented details of the case Sunday at a   in Atlanta The case has big implications While   such children are born each year in the US an estimated  children around the world get infected with HIV at or around birth every year most of them in subSaharan Africa And while   to prevent these mothertochild infections many thousands of children will certainly get infected in coming years Until now such children have been considered permanently infected Specialists thought they needed lifelong antiviral drugs to prevent HIV from destroying their immune system and killing them via AIDS The Mississippi childs surprising cure came about from happenstance  and the quick thinking of a University of Mississippi pediatric infectious disease specialist Hannah Gay The child came to our attention as a highrisk exposure to maternal HIV Gay tells Shots Her mother hadnt had any prenatal care she says so didnt get antiviral drugs during pregnancy The fact that the newborn tested positive for HIV within  hours of birth is a sign she was probably infected in utero HIV specialists say Gay decided to begin treating the child immediately with the first dose of antivirals given within  hours of birth Thats faster than most infants born with HIV get treated and specialists think its one important factor in the childs cure In addition Gay gave higherthanusual therapeutic doses of three powerful HIV drugs rather than the prophylactic doses usually given in these circumstances Over the months the baby thrived and standard tests could detect no virus in her blood which is the normal result from antiviral treatment Then her mother stopped bringing the child in for checkups The babys mom was having some life changes thats about all I can say Gay reports I saw her at  months and then after that did not see her for several months And we were unable to locate her for a while Gay enlisted the help of Mississippi state health authorities to track down the child When they found her the mother said she had stopped giving the child antiviral drugs six or seven months earlier At that point Gay expected to find that the childs blood was teeming with HIV But to her astonishment tests couldnt find any virus My first thought was Oh my goodness Ive been treating a child whos not actually infected  Gay says But a look at the earlier blood work confirmed the child had been infected with HIV at birth So Gay then thought the lab must have made a mistake with the new blood samples So she ran those tests again When all those came back negative I knew something odd was afoot Gay says She contacted an old friend   at the University of Massachusetts who has been studying pediatric HIVAIDS for two decades That was last August Since then Luzuriagas lab and labs in     and   have run ultrasensitive tests on the babys blood A couple of tests have intermittently found pieces of HIV DNA and RNA but no evidence that the virus is actively replicating in the childs cells Luzuriaga tells Shots this amounts to whats called a functional cure She says that means control of viral replication and lack of rebound once they come off antiretroviral medications The only other such case known to AIDS researchers is the socalled    Timothy Brown of San Francisco But his treatment involved a bone marrow transplant in Germany  essentially he was given the immune system of a donor whos genetically resistant to HIV Thats not something that can be easily duplicated By contrast the Mississippi childs cure involved readily available medications Luzuriaga says researchers believe they have ruled out other possible reasons for the unexpected cure For instance the mother did not have a less virulent strain of HIV And the child does not have known mutations in her immunity genes that confer protection against HIV We think it was that very early and aggressive treatment she says that curtailed the formation of viral reservoirs  that is hideouts for the virus within the childs immune cells Previous research indicates that once these hideouts are established it can take   or more of steady threedrug antiviral treatment to eliminate them Luzuriaga says the toddlers cure has electrified researchers searching for an HIV cure Its exciting to us she says Because if we were able to replicate this I think it would be very good news Dr Deborah Persaud of Johns Hopkins University Medical School who presented the case at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections calls the Mississippi cure definitely a gamechanger This case is sort of the inspiration and provides the rationale to really move forward Persaud tells Shots Kevin Robert Frost of the Foundation for AIDS Research or amfAR agrees that the finding will stimulate a lot of further work The group helped fund studies to determine if the Mississippi toddler is really cured If this approach is proven effective we could dramatically change the way children born with HIV are treated he tells Shots Plans are under way to mount studies to see if early aggressive treatment can cure other children of HIV But Persaud says it will be awhile before researchers can figure out when it might be safe to stop antiviral drugs deliberately This research will undboubtedly be highpriority given the birth of nearly  HIVinfected newborns a day in the developing world AIDS researchers foresee a day when the same treatment could give many of these children a lifetime free of toxic and costly antiviral drugs
