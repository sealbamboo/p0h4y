Theres no shortage of advice about what to eat homecooked food less  much less  processed food But with work or soccer practice or whatever it is that cuts into our time its not always easy figuring out what the family should consume Many recommendations seem unrealistic and make for plenty of guilt and not much good food So we asked nutritionists Elizabeth Lee a registered dietitian in Orange County and cofounder of Dietitians for Professional Integrity and Andy Bellatti a registered dietitian based in Las Vegas who often writes about food marketing to look around the supermarket for some conveniences that wont break the health bank Steelcut oats They can be started the night before Boil water add oats turn off the heat and leave until morning then cook for about five minutes and quickcooking oats If they are too time consuming Bellatti recommends a cold cereal called Uncle Sam because its low in sugar high in fiber and has flax seeds Eat it with fresh fruit Dr McDougalls soups Bellatti says they are low in sodium with healthy doses of fiber and protein Some versions are bean or whole grainbased And the spices come in a packet that lets the diner decide how much to use There are so many soups on the market that are sodium bombs he explains Frozen fruit and vegetables Look for brands and packages with nothing added Lee says Theyre an easy way to add produce to the diet As an example she suggests layering fruit and yogurt or adding vegetables to pasta sauce In a similar vein she gives a thumbs up to those trays of cutup carrots and celery as well as cooked and packaged beets or peeled chunks of winter squash Fantastic World Foods The brand includes vegan falafel and veggie burger mixes a tofu scrambler and taco mix Bellatti says that while not everyone is familiar with falafel its easy to make Just add water to the mix and cook the beanbased patties in a skillet or the oven The patties are often fried but dont need to be San Gennaro polenta It comes in a tube and is easy to slice and heat in a pan or oven for a glutenfree meal with wholegrain corn Bellatti says If you want to add a jarred tomato sauce he suggests Muir Glen Artisan Bistro frozen meals Bellatti notes that Artisan Bistro sells such healthful fare as kale sundried tomatopesto chicken  calories grassfed beef with mushroom sauce  calories and wild Alaska salmon  calories Ezekiel bread A hearty sproutedgrain sandwich bread often sold refrigerated Bellatti and Lee also suggest natural peanut butter which generally is made with just peanuts and salt Look for jars with the layer of oil on top People often think that means something is wrong but it doesnt Lee says Other easy grains include Uncle Bens brown basmati Ready Rice and Seeds of Change brand quinoa and brown rice with garlic Both take  seconds in the microwave Popcorn Its one of those foods with a health aura Lee says In bagged popcorn look for plain and lowsalt varieties For a kids party she suggests putting out plain popped corn and letting kids flavor it with nuts herbs and grated Parmesan cheese Dianas Bananas Dark chocolatecovered frozen bananas Theyre great for people who want something sweet without much of a splurge after dinner Bellatti says Nuts and seeds Theyre easy to pack or keep in a desk at work They also can be added to salads pastas or rice and used for pestos Look for those without flavoring and for economy buy them from bulk bins Hummus and salsa Lee says they can be used as dips but hummus works also in place of mayonnaise in salads and on sandwiches diluted with a little lemon juice or water for an appealing consistency And salsa goes well in omelets or on vegetables she says Buy chunkier fresh versions she adds Wholly Guacamole Its sold refrigerated in fullsize and mini containers and unlike some brands Bellatti says this one has no sour cream added Another plus the fat in avocados is hearthealthy A couple of general shopping tips Dont just check calories Fifty avocado calories are not the same as  Cheetos calories registered dietitian Elizabeth Lee says And if the calorie count seems low and the dish sounds lush like fettucine Alfredo Lee advises asking yourself How do you think they did that Dont be fooled by packaging such as farm scenes on bags or labels on package fronts that suggest health benefits Lee called out the Jolly Time Healthy Pop Butter microwave package which touts an endorsement from Weight Watchers and says its  fat free It says  grams of trans fats on the package front and on the nutrition facts panel But the ingredients include partially hydrogenated soybean oil adds a dietarily insignificant amount of trans fat per serving Oils that are partially hydrogenated create artificial trans fats which are not healthful even in small amounts registered dietitian Andy Bellatti says Federal rules allow companies to say they have  grams per serving if the total is less than  grams And of course experts note that many people eat more than one serving Theres also no butter listed though natural flavors are Bellatti notes that some microwave popcorns are more healthful than others but popcorn is so easy to make and very inexpensive Microwave poppers that require no oil are available for  to  Twitter
