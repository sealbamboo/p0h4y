Cuts to animal health surveillance mean Britain is at a much greater risk of outbreaks of devastating diseases such as mad cow disease experts say The Royal College of Pathologists RCP says human health could be at risk The RCP is calling for an urgent review of plans to cut the number of animal health surveillance laboratories in England and Wales from  to seven  The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Defra says the cuts are part of an improved approach Pathologists in these laboratories identified tracked and helped formulate a response to bovine spongiform encephalopathy BSE which first emerged in cattle in   Variant CreutzfeldtJakob disease vCJD  the human form of BSE  has killed  people many of them teenagers  Most recently the Animal Health and Laboratories Agency AHVLA spotted the crossover of tuberculosis TB from pet cats to humans  The agency has also identified outbreaks of other diseases such as swine fever Schmallenberg virus and blue tongue The RCP warns the proposed cuts will slow down the ability to detect animal infections  It warns it will lead to an irreversible loss of expertise and make Britain more vulnerable to BSEtype diseases in the future RCP president Dr Archie Prentice said The risk is that if we cant detect an animal infection quickly it can then spread throughout animal livestock which is worth bn to this country  More importantly the risk is that it can spread to humans before it can be identified in the animal stock We are going to be using a system that is not as good as before  We are always going to see new organisms that we havent seen before and we are always going to see old organisms that we thought had been brought under control reappearing  So if you dont have this early detection system around your chance of picking this up is much less He added I dont know anybody who is happy about this  We know from what some of the officials at Defra and AHVLA have told us that they wouldnt do this if they hadnt been under such pressure to cut costs Juan Lubroth chief veterinary officer at the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations told the BBC the downsizing was not what the world or the UK needs He said This is the wrong direction By saving millions of pounds you put at risk billions of pounds With a growing world population and a growing demand for food and agricultural products the trend for the last  years has been more and more of a spillover of animal diseases affecting humans We need these laboratories to be able to respond quickly and prevent pathogens spreading across borders Paul Peduzie from Calne Wiltshire lost his son Edward to vCJD Edward was  when he contracted the disease and  when he died in   He told the BBC the downsizing of the surveillance network would inevitably mean that more children or adults will end up like my son It makes me feel very sad he said When we get five or  years down the line and people are dying again its too late to rectify it   We have the ability to do it now Dont throw it away its just not worth it  I suppose it may be to some of these people if its not your family that suffers  But to me I dont care whose family it is from the bottom to the top Testing is worth it Mr Peduzie said the disease was horrendous to watch By the end Edward was unable to talk or move his lungs had to be constantly drained and he had to be fed intravenously  A child is the most precious thing to be taken away Mr Peduzie said Too much is talked about the cost of these things When you actually look at the cost its very small  For the life of just one person its money well spent The changes mean vets will have to have extra training in pathology and that autopsies may have to be carried out on site on a farm or in a slaughterhouse  In some cases farmers themselves will have to find a way to securely transport larger livestock carcasses to a centre further away  Nick Blaney is a vet who works in and around Stratford on Avon The local surveillance centre Luddington is due to close on Tuesday  Pathology is now going to be restricted to carcasses you can pick up and put in the car or send in the post he said  To see the service dismantled like this I feel very bitter  We are losing access to a very important function  They have a level of equipment and expertise that is second to none in the world  Along with being very important to our clients this has a national implication  We live in a time with increasing concerns about food security  Surely this is the very moment when you need to know whats going on in terms of emerging disease patterns in agriculture  However according to the AHVLA this is an improved approach to surveillance  It will not just rely on government postmortems but draw on the expertise of private vets universities and the livestock industry  An AHVLA official said Far from a loss of expertise there is a greater emphasis on developing the specific skills of pathology and epidemiology within AHVLA which are so highly valued  By introducing more postmortem providers farmers access to pathology will be improved In areas less accessible to a postmortem centre a carcass collection and transport system funded by AHVLA will be introduced  The recent case of   in cats was first discovered by a private vet and is an example of how collaborative working is essential for effective surveillance  Surveillance for serious diseases such as BSE foot and mouth and avian influenza is not affected by the changes and AHVLA will continue to investigate all reports of notifiable animal disease
