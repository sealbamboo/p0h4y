If you need to urinate frequentlyparticularly if you often have to get up at night to use the bathroomit could be a symptom of diabetes 
                   
                  The kidneys kick into high gear to get rid of all that extra glucose in the blood hence the urge to relieve yourself sometimes several times during the night 
                   
                  The excessive thirst means your body is trying to replenish those lost fluids 
                   
                  These two symptoms go hand in hand and are some of your bodys ways of trying to manage high blood sugar explains Dr CollazoClavell Overly high blood sugar levels can also cause rapid weight loss say  to  pounds over two or three monthsbut this is not a healthy weight loss 
                   
                  Because the insulin hormone isnt getting glucose into the cells where it can be used as energy the body thinks its starving and starts breaking down protein from the muscles as an alternate source of fuel 
                   
                  The kidneys are also working overtime to eliminate the excess sugar and this leads to a loss of calories and can harm the kidneys These are processes that require a lot of energy Dr CollazoClavell notes You create a calorie deficit Excessive pangs of hunger another sign of diabetes can come from sharp peaks and lows in blood sugar levels 
                   
                  When blood sugar levels plummet the body thinks it hasnt been fed and craves more of the glucose that cells need to function Itchy skin perhaps the result of dry skin or poor circulation can often be a warning sign of diabetes as are other skin conditions such as acanthosis nigricans 
                   
                  This is a darkening of the skin around the neck or armpit area Dr CollazoClavell says People who have this already have an insulin resistance process occurring even though their blood sugar might not be high When I see this I want to check their blood sugar Infections cuts and bruises that dont heal quickly are another classic sign of diabetes 
                   
                  This usually happens because the blood vessels are being damaged by the excessive amounts of glucose traveling the veins and arteries 
                   
                  This makes it hard for bloodneeded to facilitate healingto reach different areas of the body Diabetes is considered an immunosuppressed state Dr CollazoClavell explains That means heightened susceptibility to a variety of infections although the most common are yeast candida and other fungal infections she says Fungi and bacteria both thrive in sugarrich environments 
                   
                  Women in particular need to watch out for vaginal candida infections When people have high blood sugar levels depending on how long its been they can get used to chronically not feeling well says Dr CollazoClavell Sometimes thats what brings them into the office 
                   
                  Getting up to go to the bathroom several times during the night will make anyone tired as will the extra effort your body is expending to compensate for its glucose deficiency 
                   
                  And being tired will make you irritable We see people whose blood sugar has been really high and when we bring the blood sugar down its not uncommon that I hear I didnt realize how bad I felt she says Having distorted vision and seeing floaters or occasional flashes of light are a direct result of high blood sugar levels 
                   
                  Blurry vision is a refraction problem When the glucose in the blood is high it changes the shape of the lens and the eye Dr CollazoClavell explains 
                   
                  The good news is that this symptom is reversible once blood sugar levels are returned to normal or near normal But let your blood sugar go unchecked for long periods and the glucose will cause permanent damage possibly even blindness And thats not reversible Tingling and numbness in the hands and feet along with burning pain or swelling are signs that nerves are being damaged by diabetes 
                   
                  If the symptoms are recent its more likely to be reversible Dr CollazoClavell says 
                   
                  Still as with vision if blood sugar levels are allowed to run rampant for too long neuropathy nerve damage will be permanent Thats why we try to control blood sugar as quickly and as well as possible she says  are used to check for diabetes but a single test result is never enough on its own to diagnose diabetes the test has to be repeated 
                   
                  One is the fasting plasma glucose test which checks your blood sugar after a night or eight hours of not eating 
                   
                  Blood glucose above  milligrams per deciliter mgdL on two occasions means you have diabetes 
                   
                  The normal cutoff is  mgdL while a blood sugar level of  to  mgdL is considered   a serious condition on its own
