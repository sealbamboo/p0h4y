The forgetfulness that comes with age may be reversible researchers reported on Wednesday They found the brain cells involved in normal agerelated memory loss dont die Theyre just turned down The researchers found a single gene associated with the normal but infuriating loss of memory that torments most people as they age  and found it might be possible to restore its function If a drug is found to do that it would for all intents and purposes be a memory pill While many people are working on a cure for Alzheimers disease this study led by Dr Eric Kandel of Columbia University in New York points to a way to help healthy people keep their minds sharp Our study provides compelling evidence that agerelated memory loss is a syndrome in its own right apart from Alzheimers Kandel said in a statement In addition to the implications for the study diagnosis and treatment of memory disorders these results have public health consequences Kandel who shared a Nobel Prize in  for his work on memory says his team is already looking for drugs that might turn this gene back on They started by looking at the brains of eight people aged  to  who died with no evidence of brain disease They took samples from the dentate gyrus a part of the brain thats affected by aging  Just about every cell in the body carries two copies of each gene but different genes are turned up or down in different types of cells This is called gene expression Kandels team looked to see which genes were expressed more or less depending on age A gene called RbAp was clearly more active in the brains of the younger people than the older people the team reports in the journal Science Translational Medicine It didnt seem to change in a different part of the brain  The team doublechecked in a second batch of  human brains from people aged  to  Again the older they were the less RbAp they found in the dentate gyrus Checks in mice showed the same pattern And while mice dont get Alzheimers the way people do they do lose memory as they get older They made genetically engineered mice in which they could control how active RbAp was When RbAp was cranked up to normal levels the mice were able to remember how to navigate a maze like normal young mice  The mice also passed another memory test better when RbAp was turned on normally At levels seen in aged mice they sometimes forgot objects they had seen the day before Mice are curious and sniff new objects  mice with crankeddown RbAp ran over to objects they had seen before as if they were new Tests with normal mice showed that old mice acted just like mice whose RbAp was turned down The final test was to see if forgetful mice could be cured by turning RbAp back on Using gene therapy the team restored the gene in old mice It no longer has memory loss Kandel said We were astonished that not only did this improve the mices performance on the memory tests but their performance was comparable to that of young mice said Elias Pavlopoulos who worked on the study Gene therapy doesnt work well in people yet and its not practical on a large scale But Kandel thinks its possible to use drugs to turn it back on in older people We certainly will try he said in a telephone interview This gene is a likely target There may very well be other players The other question is why the gene gets turned down as people and mice get older We dont know says Kandel Is it a dietary factor Is it an environmental factor There are lots of processes in your body that age But the brain cells themselves arent dead  unlike in Alzheimers And Kandel says much work has been done on the pathway that controls this gene There might be drugs that can interrupt the process that turns the gene down he said Now we have a good target and with the mouse weve developed we have a way to screen therapies that might be effective be they pharmaceuticals nutraceuticals or physical and cognitive exercises said Dr Scott Small director of Columbias Alzheimers research center who worked on the study
