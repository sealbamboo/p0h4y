Even as an outbreak of parasiteborne illness continues to sicken more US consumers state and federal officials are refusing to identify the brand or producer of prepackaged salad mix blamed for illnesses  leaving diners to guess which leafy greens have made people sick and wondering once again how to keep themselves safe  The cyclospora outbreak that has sickened nearly  people in  states is renewing questions about whether its best to wash bagged salad or eat it straight from the package In this case the rare parasite is a tenacious bug said Steven Mandernach Iowas top food inspector Its really tough to wash off he said  Investigators found that the culprit salad mix came from both retail stores and restaurants and was consumed by diners and home cooks Mandernach said In all situations there likely wasnt much consumers could do to prevent infection because the mix came prepackaged straight from the supplier  But critics say if people knew what brand and manufacturer were behind the outbreak they wouldnt have to worry about washing  Its ridiculous said Bill Marler a Seattle lawyer who specializes in food safety cases Consumers have a right to know Presumably you wouldnt want to buy produce from a manufacturer that has been poisoning you Iowa officials who first confirmed that bagged lettuce is the culprit in the outbreak of cyclospora food poisoning that has sickened at least  people in that state said Tuesday that theres no compelling health reason to name the brand or the firm We only release that information if there is a public health risk said David Werning spokesman for the Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals At this point with the prepackaged salad mix no longer available we do not have that risk Nebraska officials who also tagged bagged lettuce in the outbreak remained mum too on the source Federal health officials maintained their position that while the salad mix may be linked to state illnesses its still not clear whether its the overall source in the cyclospora outbreak  or outbreaks  that have hospitalized  people so far  The national investigation is ongoing and at this point we dont have enough information to implicate a food vehicle in the outbreak Alan Dowell a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an email It is also still unclear if all of the cases are related to the same outbreak FDA has not yet determined that the evidence is sufficient to implicate a particular product said Pat ElHinnawy an agency spokeswoman  The prepackaged salad contains a mix of iceberg and romaine lettuce as well as carrots and red cabbage Iowa health officials said Tuesday Because most of the cyclospora infections occurred in midJune and early July the perishable product is likely off the shelves and through the supply chain No recalls have been issued for any implicated salad mix  Thus there is no ongoing threat to the public health which would require the identification of a particular brand store or restaurant where the salad mixture was available Iowa health officials said in a statement In addition these sites could not have taken any action to prevent contamination of the mixture since it came prepackaged and readytoeat But critics like Marler say thats still no reason to withhold the name of the product and the manufacturer responsible for those illnesses Even if the salad mix is not available consumers could learn whether the company involved has a history of food safety problems and decide whether to continue buying the product or patronizing the places where it was served For the government to make that decision for the public that we dont have the right to know to make that decision for our families its wrong Marler said It appears to most people that thats really a decision in favor of business instead of the public Meanwhile consumers who want to eat their veggies but are now worried about bagged salad are revisiting the question of whether to wash Many shoppers believe that its best to wash bagged greens again before eating but food safety experts  and recent research  confirm that rewashing bagged lettuce may be riskier than consuming it straight from the bag FDA officials advise that theres no need to rewash bagged lettuce If the package indicates that the contents are prewashed and readytoeat you can use the produce without further washing Christine Bruhn a researcher in food science and technology at UC Davis told NBC News that she relies on bagged lettuce despite repeated recalls of the greens She said big produce firms do the best job of cleaning greens with validated processes and chlorinated water Home cooks and restaurant workers are much more likely to taint their salads through crosscontamination in their own kitchens Sinks counters knives and other surfaces in home kitchens are more likely to contain bacteria and other germs that transmit illness than the lettuce in the bags In  a panel convened for the International Association for Food Protection concluded that leafy greens in sealed bags   and that the risk from outside contamination may outweigh any safety benefit that further washing may confer FDA and CDC officials said theyre continuing to investigate the outbreak which has reported cases in the following states Iowa Nebraska Texas Wisconsin Arkansas Connecticut Florida Georgia Illinois Kansas Minnesota Missouri New Jersey New York and Ohio
