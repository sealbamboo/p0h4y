Youve probably seen the labels on meat in the store Raised without antibiotics Theyre a selling point for people who dont like how many drugs are used on chickens turkey hogs and beef cattle  as well as prominent   are calling for stricter rules on how these drugs are used At the moment there are few restrictions on agricultural use farmers can buy most antibiotics for the animals over the counter Theres a passionate but often confusing debate about this Here at The Salt weve decided to spend some time digging into this issue to provide more clarity To be honest we needed a little clarity ourselves Today were starting with one very narrow question What exactly is the danger of antibiotic use on the farm Also why do scientists disagree about how big that danger might be Lets start on the farm Craig Rowles hog operation in Carroll Iowa He takes me into a large room the nursery filled with  little pigs Theyre a month old just weaned from their mothers a week earlier This is when theyre most likely to get sick And Rowles tells me that some are sick with the flu He wont try to treat the flu directly but he does try to keep it from leading to more deadly bacterial infections So hes giving all the pigs in this barn two different antibiotics in their drinking water tetracycline which is an older antibiotic and tylvalosin a newer drug part of the class of antibiotics called macrolides which includes the human drug azithromycin Theyll get those drugs for seven to  days  or maybe longer if they still seem in danger When they need it we treat them If they dont need it we dont Rowles says A couple of months from now when these pigs leave the nursery theyll start getting another antibiotic in their feed even if theyre healthy This drug virginiamycin is supposed to help pigs grow faster or use feed more efficiently This pattern of antibiotic use is fairly typical Most chicken farmers pig farmers and beef producers use antibiotics to treat disease prevent disease and promote faster growth The percentage of antibiotics used for growth promotion is a matter of dispute because the Food and Drug Administrations annual   on antibiotic use in farm animals doesnt provide that data Some critics have claimed that it makes up most antibiotic use on the farm A   of antibiotic use in the pork industry found that the share was about  percent It all adds up to a statistic that shocks many people and its quoted often by critics of antibiotic use on the farm  percent of all the antibiotics in the United States go into farm animals But this is where the big argument starts Scientists disagree about whether this is something that we should worry about The worry is not so much that antibiotics will be in the meat we eat By the time an animal is slaughtered those residues are supposed to be gone According to the Department of Agriculture almost all of the time they are The concern is around a different risk That using antibiotics on the farm will mean that these drugs wont work when we humans need them because in theory the more an antibiotic is given to animals the more quickly bacteria will adapt and become resistant to it Heres an example A few months ago a patient was going through chemotherapy at the National Institutes of Health near Washington DC He came down with a terrible case of diarrhea He constantly needed to be rehydrated We moved him to the ICU for a little bit of monitoring for a while says Elise OConnell a physician in training at the NIH who was caring for the patient Tests revealed that the man was infected with campylobacter a bacteria that you usually pick up from contaminated chicken or turkey This seemed odd until the physicians realized that this patients family had brought in some food from home and that another member of the family whod eaten that dish also had gotten sick for a couple of days The choice of treatment seemed obvious We started him on an antibiotic called azithromycin recalls OConnell At first the patient got better  and then he got worse again Azithromycin wasnt working OConnell switched to a different antibiotic and that one did work So why didnt azithromycin work Possibly because on a farm somewhere chickens were getting treated with macrolide antibiotics  very similar to azithromycin Campylobacter in the chicken may have become resistant to these antibiotics then hitched a ride aboard meat to OConnells patient Thats the risk many people working in public health say is very real But theres passionate disagreement about how worrisome it is and what we should do about it On the one hand we have   a veterinarian at Iowa State University whos generally sympathetic to meat producers He points out that its not enough just to show that something can happen In order to make effective sciencebased decisions we have to move beyond the cans to actually calculating the probabilities he says Think of all the things that have to come together before this actually would happen he says First of all bacteria have to become resistant to an antibiotic thats actually used to treat people But in fact around threequarters of the antibiotics that farmers use on animals are not used at all by humans or are used infrequently such as tetracyclines or virginiamycin So only a small portion of farm use could create bacteria that are resistant to drugs that youll use And then youve got to get those bacteria off the farm And then someone has to get sick with those bacteria he continues This also shouldnt happen very often he says if people are careful about cooking and handling meat Finally you have to get so sick from the contaminated meat that you need antibiotics That doesnt happen very often either OConnells patient needed treatment because he was in chemotherapy his immune system was compromised The point is this whole chain of events is rare Hurd says Its not a big danger to the public All published peerreviewed scientific articles to date have demonstrated negligible risk from onfarm antibiotic use he says  a veterinarian who is now working with the Pew Health Group and a critic of antibiotic use on the farm is unimpressed by Hurds analysis If you just look at  does this antibiotic given to this animal make this person sick so we cant treat them with that same antibiotic  thats such a very narrow piece of this whole interconnected puzzle she says First of all this kind of case may not happen often but its a big deal if it happens to you she says But there are other risks that cant be so easily calculated For instance bacteria have the peculiar ability to share genes including genes that make them resistant to particular antibiotics So there can be drugresistant bacteria on meat that dont make us sick Once in your gut they could pass along their drugresistance to bacteria that can make us sick The other thing to remember is that most of the bacteria dont end in our meat Hansen says Thats the good news Most of the bacteria in animals stay in their manure and dont end up on your meat But that manure ends up somewhere Its spread on fields it can go into waterways Theres not much research on this but it probably increases the number of antibioticresistant bacteria everywhere When and how might some of those bacteria make us sick We dont really know Hansen says but its not a risk we should take If we dont have all the information we need to know for sure whether something is bad or not lets give the environment and the people and the animals the benefit of the doubt and not continue to do something that might be harmful she says So this is where the argument ends up When risks are uncertain what do you do The Food and Drug Administration is working on rules that would stop antibiotics from being used just to help animals grow faster The rules may also require farmers to get a veterinarians approval before using most of these drugs Hansen wants the agency to go further and allow antibiotic use only when animals are sick or clearly in danger of getting sick Scott Hurd disagrees he says if farmers cant use antibiotics to prevent disease outbreaks theyll end up with more sick animals And thats not good for farmers or consumers Its a balance between agriculture and human medicine Its also a balance between capturing the benefits of these wonder drugs now and keeping them working in the future
