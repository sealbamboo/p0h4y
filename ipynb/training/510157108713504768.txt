Just  children have confirmed cases of enterovirusD according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention but hospitals around the country say they are treating hundreds more children who have been sickened by the rare virus We have some of these cases now in our ICU says   a pediatric pulmonologist and chairman of Cleveland Clinics pediatric institute Children with the virus can have serious trouble breathing he says enough so that they have to be put on a ventilator or lung bypass machine But Ohio isnt on the CDCs list of six states with confirmed cases of enterovirusD  they are Colorado Illinois Iowa Kansas Kentucky and Missouri Official numbers always lag in a fastmoving outbreak but the gap appears to be particularly big with   That may be because it appears to spread easily because milder cases often look like a cold and because theres no swift test to identify it It would be great to have a rapid test because we could identify children more at risk of rapidly developing symptoms Piedimonte told Shots Hes particularly concerned because children can get worse suddenly and have trouble breathing They then need immediate medical care What the Cleveland Clinic and other hospitals have is a PCR test that can tell if the bug in question is an   but not if its EVD Those samples get sent to the CDC for further testing To be honest everyone weve tested with the exception of one since Sept  has tested positive with this Elizabeth Ann Esterl pediatric nurse manager at National Jewish Health in Denver a hospital that specializes in asthma and respiratory disease tells Shots Children with asthma appear to be particularly vulnerable to EVD with onehalf to twothirds of cases in children with asthma Although the CDC has confirmed   Esterl says she thinks National Jewish has seen  cases And other childrens hospitals in the Denver area say theyve seen hundreds more This virus knows no boundaries Esterl says If you think you dont have it in your area just wait Because theres no vaccine or specific medication for enterovirusD the lack of a rapid test doesnt affect treatment Instead children are being given fluids oxygen and other supportive care while they fight the virus The good news is that it looks like its selflimiting and in a few days they get better Piedimonte says But that doesnt mean that parents should just wait it out if their child seems to be getting worse he cautions When someone has the symptoms of a bad cold that seems to be progressing fast report as soon as possible to an emergency room Piedimonte says Time is of the essence in case a child requires oxygen and other care As more samples make their way to state health departments and the CDC epidemiologists will have a better idea of why EVD has suddenly morphed from being a rare and rarely dangerous virus to a surprisingly vigorous foe We want to reduce the spread by doing things we know how to do Esterl says Number one on her list Hand washing Children should cover their coughs she says and consider skipping school even if it just seems like a mild cold Its a great time to watch movies at home
