When some people are in pain the experience is so intense that they cant think of anything else But others can turn their minds elsewhere and feel better Why The difference may be due in part to brain wiring researchers say and knowing more about how it works may someday make it easier to match people with effective pain treatments Prescription painkillers like Vicodin dont work for everyone and alternative treatments like meditation or cognitive behavioral therapy work for some but not all Right now doctors cant tell in advance which pain treatment will work best for a patient The problem intrigued   a neuroscientist at the University of Torontos Centre for the Study of Pain who was in misery from a pinched nerve in her neck But grant application deadlines loomed so she just kept working I tried a lot of painkillers and it didnt do much Davis tells Shots But she noticed that when she was focused on her work the pain didnt bother her as much I dont know if the pain went away but I certainly didnt notice it So Aaron Kucyi a graduate student in Davis lab recreated the painful experience with small electric shocks to volunteers wrists After each zap the researchers asked how the test subjects were feeling and what they were thinking about Some peoples thoughts wandered from the pain while others couldnt disengage Then they gave people cognitive tests while zapping them The mindwanderers did well The people focused on the pain floundered This isnt standardissue daydreaming Davis says Mindwandering away from pain is different than daydreaming in general Diving deeper the researchers put  of the study participants in an MRI scanner to see what was going on They found that people who were good at letting their minds wander away from pain had more nerve connections to a brain region that produces painkilling substances The brain made that connection using a system called the   which people typically use for thinking And finally they used newer MRI technology to see how flexible people could be in responding to pain The mindwanderers were more flexible Overall most people in the study fell somewhere in the middle doing some mindwandering and some focusing on pain Davis says that suggests that for most people there is a range of pain management techniques that could work People who mindwander they might be more able to vary their response to pain on their own Davis speculates They also might be more adept at learning paincontrol methods like yoga meditation or cognitive behavioral therapy And nonwanderers may need different forms of help This is preliminary science For now its probably not useful in personalizing pain treatment outside the research lab But it marks a potential path away from a onesizefitsall approach to pain management that often fails to connect people with treatments that help
