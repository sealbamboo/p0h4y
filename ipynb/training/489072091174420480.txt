I had never tried camu camu when The Salt asked me about it Here in Brazil in fact hardly anyone has heard of it But I went to Sao Paulo City Market the best place to shop for exotic fruits in the city on a mission to find it No luck Vendors said Id come at the wrong season and even in our summer months it would be hard to find Id have better luck in Peru where some people use it to make juice and jam or mix it in with ice cream or yogurt It seems like consumers outside South America are far more excited about this strange red and purple berry than we are And thats mostly due to its superhigh concentration of vitamin C Every  grams of camu camu has up to  grams of vitamin C says Jaime Aguiar a researcher at the National Institute of Amazonian Research in Manaus Brazil Thats  times more than the amount of vitamin C youd find in  grams of lemon Its also chock   which scientists say may help protect cells from the effects of aging The US European Union and Japan have become the biggest importers of this Amazonian berry Consumers in these countries usually take it as a supplement in powder form since fresh berries are very fragile and difficult to transport In Peru the largest producer and exporter of the berry annual revenue from the camu camu trade has grown from about  in  to over  million in  according to government figures But camu camu still remains a fringe health food mainly because people have yet to figure out the best way to mass produce it For now camu camu berries grow wild on trees that grow along flooded rivers in Amazon rain forests Aguiar and other researchers are trying to figure out the best ways to cultivate these trees and amp up production And theyre making some progress The wild tree fruits once a year weve gotten it to fruit three times a year Aguiar says But it may be awhile before supplements or food products made with the berries appear alongside aai in American health food stores Its only natural that marketers of camu camu aspire to the international success of aai another sour Amazonian berry thats typically mixed with sugar and made into a sorbet or juice The highantioxidant superfruit really took off in the US a few years ago and can now be found everywhere from local coops to   Once it became famous outside Brazil it became popular locally as well Researchers from Embrapa a Brazilian governmentrun agricultural research institute domesticated wild aai palms for largescale production Theyre also among the scientists trying to figure out how to grow more camu camu As camu camu becomes more popular abroad perhaps South Americans will start consuming more of it too But so far its been a hard sell says Maila Carolina da Silva at Ceagesp the largest wholesale food market in Latin America located in Sao Paulo She says   used to sell camu camu grown by farmers in Sao Paulo The health benefits of camu camu were touted on TV programs and many people tried it But consumers didnt come back to buy it a second time she says They were not used to the sour flavor Plus she says the fruits are very expensive and fragile I know farmers who are cutting down their camu camu trees she adds Douglas Bello a farmer says making camu camu palatable is a challenge for Brazilian chefs He has over  camu camu trees and he sells the berries to a juice store that blends them together with other fruits
