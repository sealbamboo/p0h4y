Everyone knows fast food isnt healthy and its been linked to weight gain and the obesity epidemic After all most fast food is laden with fat sugar salt and processed carbs  all the stuff any doctor can tell you to cut back on But a new study from US and Irish researchers puts a precise number on it They found that for every extra fastfood transaction in a country  every time someone bought a hamburger or a serving of fried chicken  the average BMI went up by  They say this means governments need to make fast food less attractive to their citizens The takehome message is that although freemarket policies are not to be demonized it appears quite clear that in order to fight the obesity epidemic a stronger role of government intervention is necessary says Dr Roberto De Vogli of the department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California Davis who headed up the study Body mass index or BMI is the globally accepted measure of obesity Its a calculated ratio of height to weight Someone who is  feet  inches tall and weighs  pounds has a BMI of  considered a healthy weight Add a pound and the same person has a BMI of  and is considered overweight At  pounds this person has a BMI of  and is considered obese De Voglis team got data on the number of fastfood transactions per capita from  to  in  highincome countries and compared them with average BMI in the same countries over the same time While the average number of annual fast food transactions per capita increased from  to  average BMI increased from  to  they reported in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization Every unit of increase in annual fastfood transactions per capita was associated with an increase of  points of BMI they found De Vogli says they took into account all sorts of factors such as how much exercise people got in each country urbanization age and so on As countries get richer people eat less at home and eat out more and fastfood outlets invariably become part of the mix At the same time people drive more and walk less but De Vogli says the calculations account for this One thing they dont account for is other potential sources of junk food he said To be completely fair to the fastfood industry highly processed food all those types of processed products are also higher where there is higher fastfood consumption he told NBC News So we will look at that next The United States was already saturated with fast food when the study started so there wasnt much change More than twothirds of Americans are overweight or obese  De Voglis team found the sharpest increases in both fastfood intake and BMI were in Canada Australia Ireland and New Zealand The more aggressive marketliberalized countries have a higher consumption of fast food De Vogli said The lowest increases were in countries with more stringent market regulation such as Italy the Netherlands Greece and Belgium Trade protection might not always be a good thing but our study found consumption of fast food was much lower in countries that have higher regulation China is one developing country that has recently embraced fast food and also noted a sharp rise in obesity but De Vogli says his team only looked at members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Unless governments take steps to regulate their economies the invisible hand of the market will continue to promote obesity worldwide with disastrous consequences for future public health and economic productivity De Vogli said The team also looked at data from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization and found people ate a little less animal fat  something that should be good for health On average intake of animal fats decreased slightly from  calories per capita per day in  to  in  But people were still overeating  a lot On average people ate  calories per capita per day in  and  in  But most people only need  to  calories a day This study shows how important public policies are for addressing the epidemic of obesity said Dr Francesco Branca director of the Department of Nutrition for Health and Development at WHO Policies targeting food and nutrition are needed across several sectors including agriculture industry health social welfare and education Branca said De Vogli recommends policies protecting small farmers and encouraging people to eat local produce US officials are debating policies such as taxes on sugars or sodas and cities such as New York have banned the unhealthiest trans fats from food and the Food and Drug Administration   Some US food makers have worked to  they produce and the federal government says Americans are a little more
