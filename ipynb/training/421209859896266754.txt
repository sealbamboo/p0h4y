Changes to the way GPs are paid will allow them to spend more time with patients says the health minister Mark Drakeford claims a new contract negotiated with doctors leaders removes a treadmill of bureaucracy The money GP surgeries received until now depended on how they performed against  different measures  Under the new contract  measures will be cut reducing form filling to free more time with patients says the British Medical Association BMA  There will also be new financial incentives to encourage surgeries located close to each other to work together The new contract also aims to provide better care for people with earlystage cancer for those at the end of their lives or the frail or elderly The Welsh government says the changes should also help reduce the pressure on hospital AE departments Charlotte Jones chair of the BMAs Welsh GP committee said the contract has removed some of the bureaucratic tickboxing type of medicine and targets that weve had to provide Speaking on BBC Radio Wales she said doctors will be able to return to looking after the individual patient which will then mean that there will be more capacity within general practice surgeries to provide more care for the patients The whole GP practice team will see the benefits of this which should increase additional capacity because as we know GP practices are under enormous strain like the emergency departments are at this current time We do hope that the feedback from patients will be that they have seen the positive effects of it as well as the GPs going back to being able to manage the individual and not chasing targets However the deal which comes into effect in April will not lead to weekend surgeries or more outofhours opening But Mr Drakeford insists patients will find it easier to get appointments with reduced red tape Highlighting the m appointments made with GPs last year in Wales he said So actually patients are seeing GPs in huge numbers but sometimes you do wait In some ways the opening hours issue is a bit of a distraction to the more fundamental question of how people get to see their GPs when they need to He said the deal would not mean GPs getting more money In  the average salary in Wales for a GP responsible for running a practice was  while the average pay for a family doctor employed by the surgery stood at   The global sum the total amount of money remains the same he added  Its just that what people get paid for and how they get paid has been renegotiated to allow us to modernise the contract and to prioritise those things which we know really matter to patients
