ts encouraging to hear leading politicians now talk and pledge openly about mental healthcare In the past year or so the state of our services  particularly for children and young people  has slowly risen up the political agenda Its a scandal that it has taken near systemic collapse to achieve this but when even Norman Lamb minister of state for care and support is able to conclude that childrens mental health services are not fit for purpose it is clear were about to hit bottom Maybe we already have Multiple investigations and reviews have found the same failings which might be summarised as the result of chronic longterm underinvestment in the face of growing demand   issues represent about a third of our overall burden of disease in the UK and cost more than bn a year Spending on services represents only  of the total   budget with  of clinical commissioning groups spending less than  of their budget in this way Worse given half of all adult mental health problems excluding dementia start before age  and threequarters by  its hard to understand why only  of these already limited funds go toward child and adolescent mental health These are services which have also had to manage cuts of m since  Funding for mental health research represents  of overall health research spending It is this basic poverty of resources and new learning from which all other challenges flow both for young people who experience unbearably long waits for limited treatment options and for services with diminished budgets trying to manage the increasing demand for them Fifty years ago a group of individuals in Bristol had an idea called Off the Record It was  and remains  the idea that young people have need of support that is accessible to them independently of adult permission judgment or referral Though there have been changes to the way we do things at Off the Record Bristol they have always been with the aim of preserving and improving the idea of free selfreferral support that is integrated confidential and available until your th birthday Increasingly though we find ourselves struggling to hold on to these ideals Not for want of money or will but because we are being overwhelmed by the number of young people unable to access other parts of the mental health system The increasing numbers of at risk young people coming through our door at Off the Record are fresh from AE The assessments and intake of mental health colleagues with highly pressurised caseloads mean only the most unwell young people meet the threshold for their services The simple answer to this pressure would be to introduce our own exclusion criteria and to limit demand by only accepting a narrow band of presentations or wellness that is a good fit for our service But that would mean turning away those most in need It would mean mirroring other parts of a failing and often abusive system and abandoning the essence of what Off the Record is This cannot be the right way forward but not taking it means we must walk a more challenging path Instead we must try to embrace risk view it as an opportunity to learn and to do more and do it better improving and widening our offer to local young people Its difficult work in an underresourced system that will take time and yes human error to get right In one other very important sense mental health is not equivalent to physical health Despite the medical language that defines the field there are no scientific tests to determine the existence of particular mental illnesses  present their emotional and psychological worlds in ways that are sensitive to both the meaning they give their mental health and the uneven distribution of power in society and among individuals  including health professionals Objectivity is a myth and risk and human error are inherent If you work in the field and this pressurised context the simplistic and reductive narrative around mental health in the media is so frustrating The preoccupation with danger only reinforces the societal stigma that surrounds psychological and emotional suffering The individualisation of illness obscures suffering Meanwhile the language and culture of blame when things go wrong undermines the work of mental health professionals To have the context of human suffering as well as the reality of underresourced underresearched and overstretched services reduced to one of personal failure creates more stressed defensive professionals and even poorer services Theres no magic wand for someone experiencing a mental health difficulty save timely access to appropriately resourced services In an ideal world these would also be codesigned by those that need them and based on a rich dynamic tradition and programme of research Since we lack the political introspection to ask more profound questions about the health of our increasingly unequal socioeconomic world and the cause of mental ill health this basic issue of resources seems to me the most urgent place for our politicians to fix their gaze If we are going to continue to organise our society in such a way as to make the incidence of poor mental health more likely then we cant ignore the human and financial cost of not providing adequate public services to mitigate the consequences In anticipation of the predictable groans about austerity deficits and doing more with less  an unprecedented upward redistribution of wealth has taken place since  I suggest that the arithmetic is simple
