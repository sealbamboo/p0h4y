DCON kills rats and mice the label reads And according to state and federal officials it can kill hawks owls eagles foxes bobcats mountain lions and other nontargeted wildlife too So can competing brands Pesticide manufacturers have been selling a new generation of more potent anticoagulants because mice and rats have built up some resistance to the old standby warfarin These supertoxic rat poisons have a longer halflife before they break down meaning they are more effective at working their way up the food chain  not only killing rodents but their natural predators The California Department of Fish and Game has confirmed  cases of nontargeted wildlife being exposed to the anticoagulants that work by causing animals to bleed to death The list is long It includes the San Joaquin kit fox as well as the coyote red fox gray fox black bear badger fox squirrel mountain lion bobcat golden eagle great horned owl barn owl and turkey vulture according to a letter issued last year by the Fish and Game director It noted that  of   protected as endangered of extinction have been exposed to these powerful anticoagulants as have  of raptors in San Diego County It cited the statistics to urge the California Department of Pesticide Regulation to restrict the sale of the rodenticides mostly to professional pestcontrol operators rather than making them available to urban and suburban homeowners The US Environmental Protection Agency has also been   of  such rodenticides to average consumers and to require loose bait and pellets to be secured in bait stations that are inaccessible to children and pets The   The American Assn of Poison Control Centers receives  to  reports a year of children under the age of  being exposed to these poisons Manufacturers are pushing back with lawyers and lobbyists Reckitt Benckiser the maker of dCON argues that   the potential risk of the secondgeneration pesticides It states that the EPA standards which first approved this new generation of rodenticides shows its existing products provide far greater benefits than risks to users to children and wildlife That doesnt sit well with wildlife rehabilitation workers at   which runs a wildanimal hospital in San Rafael It has found that  of the predators that come through its doors test positive for rat poison These are animals that we rely on to do our natural rodent control and we are poisoning them said Kelle Kacmarcik a Wildcare manager Thats shocking in a place like liberal welleducated Marin County Meanwhile other public health and conservation groups have joined the fight this week The Center for Biological Diversity the American Bird Conservancy California for Pesticide Reform and Earthjustice are now pushing for a ban on the supertoxic poisons You dont have to use the worst of the worst that not only endanger wildlife but human health said Jonathan Evans an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity Evans said he was sympathetic to those who wanted to rid their homes of rats and mice Oldfashioned snaptraps work well in rodent control he said as does sealing up buildings to make them rodentproof removing sources of food and nesting material And then theres relying on natural predators such as owls coyotes bobcats and foxes kenweisslatimescom
