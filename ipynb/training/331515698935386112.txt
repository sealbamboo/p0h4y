So you know all that talk about how the boatload of money going to health care will   if something isnt done soon Well it turns out that while politicians were bickering the problem started taking care of itself Well a little bit While not solved the growth in health spending has definitely slowed Thats the consensus of a series of studies out in the past few week The latest bunch are in this   of the policy journal   The   by a group of researchers from Harvard Medical School found   before them that the slowdown in health inflation between  and  was due in large part to the lagging economy Specifically a combination of people losing health insurance during the recession and employers passing along more health costs to workers who still had coverage But unlike many previous studies the researchers found that there are other things going on as well  things that could persist and keep health spending rising more slowly going forward And how do they know Because when they adjusted their results to account for the rising outofpocket spending by people with insurance costs still rose more slowly than they had earlier in the decade So what might be causing this The researchers have some theories This slowdown may be a reflection of broader trends toward slower diffusion of technology or more fiscally conservative practice patterns by health care providers they wrote Similarly a   from researchers with the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Altarum Institute found that just over threequarters of the recent slowdown in health spending has been due to the weak economy And some of the remaining  percent has been due to increased costsharing by individuals But they also found that some of it their study methodology did not allow this to be separated out was due to other changes including how care is paid for and delivered Finally   also in the current   and also from Harvard although from the economics department rather than the medical school quantifies the savings that could result from the slowing trends Those authors estimate that if less rapid development of imaging technology and new drugs combined with increased patient costsharing and greater efficiency by health care providers continue public health spending could be as much as  billion less than currently predicted Businesses and individuals would see significant savings as well Such lower levels of health care spending would have an enormous impact on the US economy and on government and household finances wrote David Cutler who advised President Obama as a candidate and Nikhil Sahni But while some economists are beginning to speculate in public that slower health care spending might be here to stay others are much more guarded in    in the past We have seen this movie before wrote Kaiser Family Foundations Drew Altman and Larry Levitt in the     about their study The idea that we have licked the problem of health care cost increases is no more probable today than it was in the past Our nation has made no fundamental change in how health care is paid for or delivered
