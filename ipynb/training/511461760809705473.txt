Like any piece of clothing the hijab isnt one size fits all Women around the world choose to wear  or not to wear  a headscarf or veil for many reasons Some see the hijab as a way to identify with the Muslim community or to assert themselves as a human being instead of a sexual object Others   the garment strips them of their individuality or turns them into a reluctant spokeswoman for the faith The reasons why women wear the hijab are incredibly complex says psychologist   at the University of Westminster in London They cant be boiled down to one or two things Last year Swami and one of his graduate students wondered if the hijab might have a positive influence on how women view their bodies There had been three or four previous studies showing that more modest or conservative clothing is associated with a healthier body image he says So the team surveyed nearly  Muslim women in Britain About  said they never used the hijab The others said they wore it at least sometimes Swami and his colleagues also asked the women a whole slew of questions to measure how they felt about their bodies The difference between the two groups was small But across all parameters the women who wore the hijab at least some of the time had more positive views of their bodies on average They had less desire to be thin They appreciated their bodies more And they werent as influenced by media messages about beauty standards The takehome message I think is maybe that individuals who challenge societys norms of beauty seem to have better body images Swami tells NPR The hijab allows you to do that in a certain way in Britain  Feminism does the same thing The study   in the August issue of the  couldnt tell whether the hijab was the cause of the improved selfesteem And previous studies had suggested that women who are more religious have better body images But Swami thinks the hijab could protect women against dangerous pressures to be thin The hijab seems to have a buffer on body image he says If somebody is objectifying a woman the hijab might offer a sort of protection  Any clothing like this would help to reduce sexualization of the body The study looked only at women in Britain where wearing the hijab is optional In some Muslim countries women are required by law to wear full burqas covering their faces and bodies And in others such as France its   to wear a facecovering veil Its dangerous to transpose the findings of our study to other places besides Britain Swami says The hijabs effect on the body isnt likely to be the same where women are required to wear it  or arent allowed to wear it he says  who studies gender and womens issues at Western Michigan University says shes not surprised the hijab is linked to a better body image Wearing the hijab eliminates many of the hassles women have to go through  such as dyeing their hair she says For example youre getting old and gray hairs when you wear the hijab you might not think about dyeing your hair because nobody sees it anyway So wearing the hijab can be very liberating for some women she says It allows them  and others around them  to focus on their minds not their bodies There is a stereotype that women who wear the hijab are oppressed Ruby says that we Muslim women have no agency or power But all societies and cultures have their own dress code she says They all have a way to construct femininity and masculinity Muslim societies arent exceptional in that respect she says But we dont see them in that way because of the tension between the West and the Middle East We dont question why woman in the West wear miniskirts and plunging necklines she says So why do we question the hijab
