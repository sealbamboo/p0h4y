Nike says its new activitytracking Fuelband SE will motivate people to exercise even more But can a wristband really lead to better health Back in  Nike vicepresident of digital sport Stefan Olander and his team had an idea what if a person could track how much theyve moved in a day just by glancing at their wrist And so the Nike Fuelband was born Released in  in a simple sleek black plastic design that flashed from red to green once a persons daily fitness goal had been met the first Fuelband sold out in hours The pitch was this by wearing a Fuelband and monitoring fitness data via an app or on the web anyone  from a professional athlete to Mr Olander himself  could work out a better more effective path to health In todays society we are overwhelmed with complexity says Mr Olander With the Fuelband he says Nike really tries to filter out what doesnt matter and just give you what you need in order to stay motivated So whats different this time around Nike says that in addition to making physical improvements to the latest Fuelband  better waterproofing stainless steel screws  it has also analysed the data from the first wave of Fuelband adopters to see ways in which the band and its supporting iOS app and website could be improved They found that  of their  million users exercised  but they didnt necessarily consistently move the recommended five minutes every hour Now the wristband buzzes to alert its wearer if he or she hasnt got up in a while But Nike is not the only company experimenting with wearable technology  particularly as estimates about the potential growth in the industry range from bn to bn bn to bn in the next five years Competitor Fitbit recently released a new model and Jawbone iHealth Garmin Withings and Adidas are among other firms to offer dedicated fitnessmeasuring gadgets  Samsung and Sony recently released a smartwatch that can monitor a users steps and even Apple  whose boss Tim Cook sits on Nikes board of directors  has expressed an interest in a device But beyond these gadgets Nikes main competition might not be a rival band but the smartphone Smartphones are going to start doing more of the tracking and more people have them already and dont have to buy separate devices says Sara Watson a fellow at Harvard Universitys Berkman Center for Internet and Society Already there is a spate of apps  from MyMee to MapMyRun  capitalising on these builtin features Beyond the competition there is also the basic question can wearing a wristband really make you healthier  The notion of tracking itself has been around a long time  this is not something new says Michael Kim a former Microsoft Xbox executive who is now the head of Kairos Labs  The problem is tracking does not create new behaviour change  it tracks what you already do as a behaviour says Mr Kim whose firm works to help people cement their habits But some doctors say the bands can help those who are already interested in exercise better tailor their workouts We have done a number of athletic performance tracking projects with people says Dr Paul Abramson a physician in San Francisco who uses tracking technologies in his practice Things like the Fuelband or more complex versions of them can be very useful for people who want to exercise more Companies are also showing an interest in tracking sensors In  Bank of America equipped dozens of its call centre staff with special badges to study the way they interacted with each other as part of efforts to boost productivity One technology consultant suggested several firms were now interested in using fitness equipment as a way of encouraging their staff to bond At a symposium event last week I was talking to a couple of companies that were trying to improve employee engagement and theres some thinking that not only are healthier employees more productive but that their sharing of information about how much they are walking how much they are riding etc is becoming the new water cooler moment says Mike Gotta from Gartner However he cautions that managers should resist the temptation to see the gadgets as the human equivalent of the black boxes used by some car insurance companies to track driver behaviour A few months back one firm made the news for saying If you dont meet certain criteria were going to charge you more per month for your healthcare That kind of behaviour could create a backlash Mr Gotta warns  But if firms give these analytics to the employees for their own selfimprovement and are relatively handsoff then the workers will share the information themselves and that could create better relationships across teams Experts also note that gadgets like the Fuelband still have plenty of room for improvement At present the measurements it captures are not always precise  Rivals are attempting to address this by offering a wider range of sensors Withings for example has built a heartrate monitor into its Pulse tracker Polars Loop carries out a similar trick by connecting its wristband to a separate accessory Fitbit includes an altimeter in its new Force wristband to count the number of stairs climbed while Motorolas Motoactv can be linked up with bicyclefitted sensors that measure how fast the equipment is being pedalled and its speed of travel Sensors that measure skin temperature perspiration and the electrical activity produced by muscles offer further opportunities The fitness space has spawned a whole host of explorations of tracking devices in other areas says Steve Dean a partner at Prehype and a founder of the Quantified Self group in New York which meets to discuss personal data tracking projects and technologies Its almost like theres an endless amount of things that we can instrument on our body
