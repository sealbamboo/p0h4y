Selfcastration suicide and waves of desperation are byproducts of the denial of sex hormones to inmates yearning to switch genders advocates say But outside the walls debate has been stirred on whether the prison system is the right place to help chemically escort a man to womanhood or vice versa and critics question if any taxpayer money should pay for the hormones used to help inmates undergo sex changes  Thursdays revelation that convicted secret leaker Bradley Manning  and begin hormone therapy ignited talk about what happens when prison doctors refuse hormones to inmates with gender identity disorder GID depression death wishes purposely amputated genitalia and for those already en route to a new gender the return or disappearance of certain male or female traits  from body hair to muscles to breasts  The Army does not provide hormone therapy to such prisoners At the very least this significantly delays Mannings plan to physically morph into Chelsea  as hes been sentenced to  years in Fort Leavenworth prison  You begin to feel like you might as well just die said Miss Major  who claims her estrogen prescription was withheld by the medical staff during a fiveyear stint at a New York prison for a prostitution conviction Major had started taking the pills years before to look like the woman she always felt she was internally Housed in isolation and without the drugs her breasts grew smaller manly hair again coated her arms and legs and her emotions ran wild  Its like a roller coaster ride without anything to hang on to You have no control over whats happening to you Its devastating You dont know who you are anymore added Major who today lives in Oakland Calif and advocates for transgender people including exinmates  Already battling a deep disconnect with selfidentity then suddenly being removed from the medications meant to alter their genders some inmates literally attack the issue in the bloodiest ways lopping off their sex organs About  such selfmutilations have been documented in US prisons said Dr Lori Kohler a staff physician for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and a national expert on medical management of transgender prisoners  In California Kohler has helped oversee hormone meds for about  inmates out of a total population of  The vast majority of those  were born as males and want to become females taking estrogen and growing female curves while housed in mens prisons  Withdrawing from estrogen can cause significant depression and a general mood disorder much like what many women experience with menopause Kohler said When theyre off hormones people say they dont feel right they feel terrible In one case Kohler followed an inmate sliced off his penis and testicles while serving in a prison in another state after being transferred to California that inmate was placed in a womens correctional facility  They dont see it as selfmutilating They feel like theyre righting a wrong correcting themselves Kohler said This is a true issue for people yet its just so easily ignored and dismissed Denying it is like saying I dont believe in diabetes  The drugs cost about  per month for female hormones estrogen and about  to  a month for male hormones testosterone she said Such medical care in prison comes at the taxpayers expense Prior to  federal inmates who entered that system taking sexchange hormones were allowed to maintain those doses but US corrections officials denied the start of new hormone regimens for existing prisoners A lawsuit filed by Bostonbased attorney Jennifer Levi on behalf of an inmate caused the prison bureau to reverse that stand and treat gender identity disorder even after its diagnosed in prison Yet the administering of hormones to transgender inmates remains inconsistent across state prisons Some do it some dont said Levi director of the Transgender Rights Project at Gay  Lesbian Advocates  Defenders GLAD  The reality is the underlying medical condition of gender dysphoria is highly stigmatized and widely misunderstood So people with no expertise including prison staff often reject the seriousness of the underlying medical condition just because of bias and discrimination Levi said  Transgender groups consider denying hormones in cases like Mannings cruel and unusual punishment and argue that hormone treatment for gender identity disorder is standard medicine and should be allowed in military prisons as in federal prisons Mannings request may be the first time this has come up for a military prisoner But a large question remains among many critics outside the advocacy circuit Should prisons be doling out sexchange drugs  It does cause all kinds of security issues for us said Brian Dawe executive director of American Correctional Officer a group that works to promote the safety and working conditions of corrections workers Theres also amount of cost to the taxpayers which we care about because were not only correctional officers were also taxpayers But correctional officers dont make moral or sociological judgments on it said Dawe who worked as one in Massachusetts for  years Thats up to the public
