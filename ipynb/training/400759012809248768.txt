The Obama administration released its much anticipated enrollment numbers for the first month of the troubled HealthCaregov website Wednesday And as predicted the numbers were disappointing Just over  people managed to navigate the process and choose a health plan between Oct  and Nov    people to be precise But barely a quarter of those  enrolled through the federal website thats signing up people in  of the states The rest enrolled through state marketplaces Earlier this week people were leaking numbers that suggested that the number who enrolled via the federal exchange was about   is even lower than that On the other hand what it really tells us is that the   website wasnt working so people couldnt choose a plan Thats not exactly breaking news On the state side some states have been reporting their enrollment numbers all along The one state we hadnt heard from was California On Wednesday federal officials reported that  people had enrolled in California  nearly half of the  total for the  states included in this report Questions remain of course including exactly what the administration is counting in these numbers In order to be formally counted as enrolled in a health plan at least by an insurance company you have to pay the first months premium But coverage doesnt begin until Jan  at the earliest Very few people are going to sign up in October and front out money three months in advance So the administration is counting what are being called shopping cart people They are those who have completed the enrollment process and chosen a plan but have not necessarily paid their first months premium We now know that a lot of people are qualifying for Medicaid coverage or the Childrens Health Insurance Program  people have been deemed eligible for these programs so far About  have enrolled through the state exchanges and  on the federal exchange Thats probably because in some states there was a big outreach effort to find people eligible for Medicaid or childrens insurance Also the part of the state and federal exchanges that determines eligibility for Medicaid was working pretty well in October compared with the part on the federal website that determines subsidies Just about every health care analyst points out that you shouldnt expect a lot of people to sign up during the first month of a sixmonth signup period So the numbers probably would have been pretty small even if everything had been working just fine What this does tell us however is that there will be more pressure on the system particularly the federal website as we go forward Thats especially true if theres a surge of people who want to have insurance that begins Jan  They have to sign up by Dec  And if that website isnt working as promised by the end of this month  or even if it is  there could be a huge demand that could very well overwhelm the system
