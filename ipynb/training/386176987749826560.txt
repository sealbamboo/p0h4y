Smith thanked the doctor and hung up the phone  Baby hopefully we can get you a cure now he said as he hugged and kissed his daughter  McKenna has neurofibromatosis a rare genetic disorder Countless tumors in various parts of her body tangle around her nerves and grow into her soft tissue One tumor the size of a grapefruit crushed her esophagus and her carotid artery when she was  years old Another tumor collapsed a lobe of her right lung  The growths are starting to cut off sensation to her right arm and left leg soon she will lose function of them entirely Shes on four different pain medications including two types of morphine  McKenna has had two surgeries and  rounds of radiation The tumors have continued to grow She underwent medical experiments to use the drugs thalidomide and Gleevac Both were a failure  Doctors have told Smith his daughter will likely die before her th birthday She turns  today  This NIH trial is her last hope Smith said  The Smiths boarded a plane Monday from their home in Cape Coral Florida to head to Bethesda But during the trip  even as they checked in at the Childrens Inn at NIH  they werent feeling hopeful that McKenna would be able to start taking the experimental drug called hydrogen sulfate on Friday as scheduled  Hydrogen sulfate or AZD has been tested in adults and children with cancer NIH doctors think it might be able to prevent benign tumors like McKennas from growing or at least shrink the tumors and slow down their growth Smith feared the government shutdown would keep McKenna from being able to start the study at all  McKenna is one of about  new patients including some  children who come every week to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda Maryland to begin clinical trials These patients are being told   until the government starts up again to start their trials according to NIH spokesman John Burklow Taking care of McKenna as well as her disabled grandmother is a fulltime job for Smith a single father An Army veteran hes used to hard work and trying times but as he waited Monday Tuesday and Wednesday for word from the doctors he grew more and more worried  and angry  On Wednesday he tweeted governmentshutdown needs  end Now hurting sick people have the House come here to apologize to my young daughter  others  Finally were here and our government cant get its act together he told CNN  Then at  pm Wednesday there was a turnaround For reasons that are unclear McKennas doctors said she would be able to start taking the hydrogen sulfate on Friday as scheduled No one knows how many other new patients like McKenna also managed to get into their NIH studies despite the government shutdown  If a child or adult patient is in desperate need for treatment those people will be handled in a different manner Burklow said and will more than likely be seen by physicians or nurses at the NIH Clinical Center  While relieved that his daughter can start the trial Smith worries about the kids who wont be able to There are the other patients like McKenna who were supposed to start this week at the NIH Clinical Center and if the shutdown continues another  patients every week will face the same dilemma  Even though McKennas been lucky the shutdown has still made her trip more difficult With  of NIHs employees on furlough the testing takes much longer than it should An eye doctors appointment this week for example should have taken one hour but lasted more than three  Exhausted and in pain McKenna had to take a dose of morphine to get through it  And then another setback this one unrelated to the shutdown doctors found a new tumor in McKennas eye This medical complication means she might not be able to get the drug Friday as planned Smith said he knows what he would do if he could talk to members of Congress in person  Id put my daughter in their face and Id say Why are you putting politics above my daughters life or any other childs life he said This is not a game  McKenna said her message to Congress would be much shorter  This is stupid
