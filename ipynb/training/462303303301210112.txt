Its bad enough to be sick at home in your own bed but so much worse when on vacation People often buy travel insurance so they dont lose the money they spent on airfare and hotels if they cant travel due to illness But if that illness happens to be a mental health issue dont expect travel insurance to cover it And since mental health problems are so common that means that a lot of people may be left holding the bag Heres one example Last fall New York resident Judy Shaffer booked a tour to Sicily and Rome for herself and her husband She bought travel insurance too Then the Shaffers decided they couldnt travel because their son Evan who is in his s was going through a medication change for a diagnosed mental illness Shaffer and her husband John were advised not to leave their son alone Theres no way we were going on this trip and leaving him Shaffer said Shaffer put in a claim for  with the travel insurer but the claim was denied Her sons psychiatrist even wrote a letter in support of her appeal stating that he thought it is discriminatory and possibly illegal regarding medical parity laws to deny travel insurance reimbursement for such a medical situation even if the underlying disorder is a psychiatric one The insurer CSA Travel Protection of San Diego Calif responded in a letter Please note that while your policy offers coverage for sickness injury or death it does not provide coverage for the risk of a sickness Shaffer never got her money back and shes not the only person with such complaints The National Alliance on Mental Illness has received about  complaints about travel insurance discrimination over the past year If I fall down and break my leg I can get my money back but if I have an anxiety attack and fall into depression forget it Shaffer said Thats serious Shaffer has since booked a Russian cruise scheduled for this June and between her and her travel agent they couldnt find a single company that would cover mental health issues like the one Shaffer experienced with her son I was shocked says Carla Koller the agent who helped arrange Shaffers cruise We cover for all kinds of illnesses why not this Under the   and   health insurance companies are required to provide mental health coverage if they cover physical illnesses But travel insurance isnt included in those laws Its discriminatory but insurance companies make their own decisions says Mark Heyrman a clinical professor of law at the University of Chicago Law School who researches mental health law Travel insurance policies typically only cover common risks in order to keep costs down according to Linda Kundell a spokeswoman for the   If insurance companies take on added risk it raises the cost of premium for consumers she told Shots When deciding on travel insurance people should consider what kinds of  might come up while on the trip and make a list of   to ask insurance providers Kundell says Consider what you may end up encountering and what it could cost you she says Also dont forget to shop around One thing to watch out for Policies that cover physical illnesses may not include mental illness though many of the symptoms can be physical by nature Travel insurance is regulated at the state level While each state requires vendors to be licensed in the state where the insurance is being sold their regulations and the types of policies sold vary widely Phone calls to state insurance regulators show just how confusing that can be for consumers If theres any consolation its that travel insurance policies also routinely exclude other common issues that can interfere with a trip including pregnancy and job layoffs
