The hunt for a cure for type  diabetes has recently taken a tremendous step forward scientists have said  The disease is caused by the immune system destroying the cells that control blood sugar levels  A team at Harvard University used stem cells to produce hundreds of millions of the cells in the laboratory Tests on mice showed the cells could treat the disease which experts described as potentially a major medical breakthrough Beta cells in the pancreas pump out insulin to bring down blood sugar levels  But the bodys own immune system can turn against the beta cells destroying them and leaving people with a potentially fatal disease because they cannot regulate their blood sugar levels  It is different to the far more common type  diabetes which is largely due to an unhealthy lifestyle The team at Harvard was led by Prof Doug Melton who began the search for a cure when his son was diagnosed  years ago He then had a daughter who also developed type  He is attempting to replace the approximately  million missing beta cells using stem cell technology He found the perfect cocktail of chemicals to transform embryonic stem cells into functioning beta cells Tests on mice with type  diabetes   showed that the labmade cells could produce insulin and control blood sugar levels for several months Dr Melton said It was gratifying to know that we could do something that we always thought was possible We are now just one preclinical step away from the finish line However his children were not quite so impressed I think like all kids they always assumed that if I said Id do this Id do it If the beta cells were injected into a person they would still face an immune assault and ultimately would be destroyed  More research is needed before this could become a cure Sarah Johnson from the charity JDRF which funded the study told the BBC This isnt a cure it is a great move along the path It is a tremendous step forward Replacing the cells that produce insulin as well as turning off the immune response that causes type  diabetes is the longterm goal Prof Chris Mason a stem cell scientist at University College London said A scientific breakthrough is to make functional cells that cure a diabetic mouse but a major medical breakthrough is to be able to manufacture at large enough scale the functional cells to treat all diabetics  This research is therefore a scientific and potentially a major medical breakthrough If this scalable technology is proven to work in both the clinic and in the manufacturing facility the impact on the treatment of diabetes will be a medical gamechanger on a par with antibiotics and bacterial infections Dr Gillian Morrison from the University of Edinburgh agreed that this represents a real advance in the field She said The next important challenge will be to find ways to maintain these cells inside the body so they are protected from the immune response and have longterm function
