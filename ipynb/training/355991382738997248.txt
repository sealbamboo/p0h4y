I guess doctors especially doctorsintraining have to get used to sudden inexplicable endings You are trained to heal Thats the goal thats the point But every so often you dont win Something you didnt see coming comes I dont know which hurts more the suddenly or the why If the patient is clearly dying its easier You can prepare But if a patient is mending then the questions Shara asks in this quiet poem she wrote on her blog at     can boomerang why you why now Shara Yurkiewiecz is a third year medical student in Boston She writes about what its like to be in training She wants to do this doctoring thing well but she doesnt always know how She feels so much The stakes are huge Sometimes as youll see here she is simply stunned By Shara Yurkiewicz We met on my birthday and  your age trailed mine by a week  Your past medical history bare  you let me see you sick  You let me feel the margins  of your spleen  your sexual history  your confusion over why this  and why you  and what now  and what next I hated the political sticker on your phone   and your fever untouched by medications  and the number of times I told you I didnt know   People think Im weird dont they you asked me  Finally an answer I knew  Yeah  Your immune system  or your travel history  or your damn bad luck I punctuated your sleep   as a broken alarm clock  not set by you  plus or minus  am Questions through a fog of semiconsciousness  penlight in pupils  hammer on knees  wandering stethoscope on chest and back You told me why you lay awake at night  afraid of falling unconscious and  staying there  I told you why I hated medicine  to please not tell anyone and  you didnt I dont mean to sound negative you told me  When Was it when you cried  when you learned to rewiggle your toes  Was it when you laughed  when I helped you walk  with tiny steps  with wobbling gait  while looking down at feet that  couldnt quite feel the ground  Was it when you promised  that you would rock climb again Was it on the last day I saw you  Standing up  for the first time  Clothes on over your gown  for the first time  Your silhouette against the afternoon sun  ready to walk out into it  on a healed body  You did  for the first time Two sundowns go by and  I awaken at  am  My unbroken alarm clock  urges me out of bed  to the hospital where you lie in bed  unawakening  For the next hour  I brush my teeth  dress  walk  hum  while one mile away  they pound on your chest I arrive at the hospital as you leave  Plus or minus  am Wherever you are now  I remember where I left you  Standing with the sun against your back
