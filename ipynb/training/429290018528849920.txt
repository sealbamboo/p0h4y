  One of the things I appreciate about this producelimited time of year is that it forces me to devote a week of Recipes for Health to cabbage I love this nutrientdense cruciferous vegetable for many reasons the way it sweetens as it cooks in the pan the price per pound the way it is comfortable in a soup or a pie a stew a gratin or a salad a stirfry or a timbale Yet I sometimes forget to pay attention to cabbage It can be overshadowed by other winter vegetables like kale its more fashionable cousin The extraordinary health benefits of cabbage reside mainly in its abundant polyphenols and glucosinilates These micronutrients are proving to have antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties that help the body fight disease Cabbage is also an excellent source of vitamin C and a good source of vitamin A  I was all set to focus on recipes from Russia and Eastern Europe this week and I did come up with some fabulous pirozhki the classic Russian little oval pies But as so often happens when I am exploring recipes and experimenting in my kitchen I could not get away from the Mediterranean where cabbage is also widely appreciated So this week you will taste a delicious soup that is seasoned with Parmesan rinds Italian bruschetta topped with pancooked cabbage as well as a spicy Tunisian chakchoukah a vegetable stew that is traditionally mainly peppers and tomatoes but in this version features cabbage peppers and tomatoes with eggs poached right in the stew  A comforting soup with texture and bulk provided by barley  A light timbale with a sweet delicate flavor  A richtasting Eastern European pastry that isnt rich at all  Longsimmered cabbage provides a sweet flavor for this bruschetta  This is a spicy Tunisian pepper stew with poached eggs
