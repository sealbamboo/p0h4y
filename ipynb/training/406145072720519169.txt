Think back to an important event in your life a graduation a birth a special Thanksgiving dinner Chances are youre remembering not only what happened but also where it happened And now scientists think they know why As we form socalled episodic memories the brain appears to be using special cells in the hippocampus to geotag each event   in   The process is similar to what some digital cameras do when they tag each picture with information about where the image was taken As a result of this automatic geotagging memories about places and events are fused together says   a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the studys authors You come to a location where something happened and it reminds you of an event he says Or you think of an event and it reminds you of the place where it happened Kahana was part of an international team of scientists that figured out how the brains geotagging system works by studying seven epileptic patients in Germany The patients were awaiting surgery and had wires in their brains that allowed the researchers to measure the activity of individual brain cells That gave Kahanas team a way to watch what happened as memories were formed and retrieved Patients in the study played a video game involving a virtual town In the early stages of the game you drive around the town and you learn where the different locations are that matter Kahana says Once the players had formed a mental map of the town the game had them drive to specific locations like the toy store or the flower shop or the bakery Meanwhile the researchers were monitoring activity in each players hippocampus which is where the brain creates the mental maps that help us navigate These maps rely on special place cells that become active when we reach a specific location And the researchers were able to identify place cells in each player that responded to specific locations in the virtual town Once these cells were identified the players began the last part of the video game Now each time they arrived at a location they learned what item they had delivered there So when you get to the bakery a voice will come on and tell you youve just delivered a zucchini says Kahana This created mental links between places like the bakery and events like delivering a zucchini Then came the hard part finding evidence of those links in the brain  To do this the researchers monitored the activity of place cells while players recalled specific objects they had delivered And the team found that just before a person remembered they had delivered a zucchini there was a burst of activity in the cells associated with the bakery  the place where the delivery was made This suggests the hippocampus is constantly using place cells to geotag events in our lives Kahana says The finding reveals a lot about how the brain provides context to episodic memories says   of Boston University Knowing where something happened is one important bit of context But its also important to know when something happened he says Cells that act as time stamps havent been found yet in a human brain Eichenbaum says But he has found cells that perform this function   So it seems like the hippocampus maps things in time Eichenbaum says very much the way it maps in space
