A child falls out of a tree with a sickening thud while his father is preoccupied on his mobile phone  In a kitchen a woman trained in emergency first aid rushes outside to help but instead of coming to their aid she gathers in washing from the rain She is not the boys mother but she would have known what to do The father is left kneeling by his unconscious son blood trickling from his lips screaming for help  which has been running on television channels in recent weeks is powerful the message hardhitting What parent would not want to know how to save the boy Yet the first aid charity says that more than half of parents  lack the skills necessary to save their child in the event of a lifethreatening accident It was their reason for commissioning the advert in the first place More worryingly perhaps the charity says that although most parents claim to know basic first aid many say they would not touch or move the boy until an ambulance arrived  which would be the wrong thing to do It says the correct procedure to save the boy is to follow the important first steps of first aid by checking for injuries and bleeding opening his airway and checking his breathing The charity also explains in their video how to put the boy in the recovery position and it says to call  So Sue Killen chief executive of St John Ambulance is understandably happy that the response to the advertising campaign has been positive  She says We know some people were a little shocked by the advert but as one Twitter user said Id rather be scared by an ad than scared because I couldnt save someone  Were really pleased with the way people have responded and that tens of thousands more people can be the difference between life and death But not everyone is convinced that the tone of the advert was correct  Emma Hammett who is a first aid trainer with her own company First Aid for Life said the advert had quite a scary message which left her feeling horrible A lot of people missed the point that the woman in the advert wasnt the mum of the boy  The way the advert was presented its not an easy thing to share Mumsnet still isnt talking about it She says happier stories are easier to talk about particularly if they have a feelgood factor But figures from St John Ambulance show that people are responding to the advert More than  people have logged on to the charitys website to find out how to   in the advert Thousands of new followers of St John Ambulance on Facebook and Twitter suggest that the message has reached a wider audience And a  rise in bookings on St John Ambulance first aid courses since the campaign aired shows that people are actually prepared to learn some new skills So perhaps the shock tactics in the ad worked Emma Sheppard acting director of brand communications and fundraising at St John Ambulance thinks so We dont want to be shocking for the sake of it but weve found that people have an apathy towards first aid and a powerful message is proven to get people to take action  Many people think someone who knows what to do is going to be there  Unfortunately thats not always going to be the case and thats the point we try and get across in the advert The thinking behind the ad she says is to put people in the characters shoes and make them confront the idea that noone could be around to help them in an emergency Other organisations have used different tactics to get across an important message  In  for instance the British Heart Foundation used former footballer Vinnie Jones to front a campaign to educate people about handsonly cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR as opposed to mouthtomouth resuscitation which they felt was preventing bystanders from giving vital CPR in a medical emergency The wellknown face of a player with a hardman reputation showing people how to save lives made people laugh  and log on to learn more The BHF says the advert has now been viewed nearly four million times on YouTube and the training film has clocked up three million views alone It also says that at least  lives that have been saved as a result of the advert and one of those survivors featured in the second TV ad  From the evidence it appears that both approaches to getting across an important public health message on TV work In the end Sue Killen of St John Ambulance says there is no excuse for not knowing exactly how to save someones life Its devastating to find that over half of parents wouldnt have the first aid confidence to save their own childs life  And its not just parents Over  of people admit that it would take something as severe as the death of a loved one to make them learn first aid
