The dairy industry has a problem Despite   demonstrating milks nutritional benefits people are drinking less and less of it Even children are increasingly opting for water or other lowcal options  including   and artificially sweetened sports drinks So how can milk  especially school kids favorite    compete in the lowcal arena The dairy industry has a strategy Swap the sugar thats added to flavored milks for a zerocalorie sweetener such as   or other options such as plantbased   Now in order to pull this off the dairy industry has some regulatory hoops to jump through Currently if dairy producers want to add an artificial or nocal sweetener the resulting beverage is no longer allowed to be called milk it wouldnt meet the FDAs technical definition of milk So the dairy industry is   the Food and Drug Administration to change the standard of what qualifies as milk The industry wants the iconic MILK label to remain on the front of the package without any mention of the reduced calories  or the added artificial sweeteners at least not on the front label And the FDA has opened up this petition for public comment Kids dont like the term lowcalorie  says Greg Miller of the National Dairy Council Its a turnoff Some school districts have banned flavored milk because of the highcalorie content And some   suggest that when you take chocolate milk out of schools consumption of milk declines During a phone interview Miller told The Salt that the industrys petition is aimed at offering school districts a lowercalorie milk option that kids will actually want to drink Miller says the petition does not seek to change existing regulations that require added sweeteners such as aspartame or stevia to be named in the list of ingredients  usually found on the back of a container We are not trying to be sneaky Miller says But so far lots of folks seem skeptical of the plan More than  people have joined a new   organized by SumOfUsorg a consumer advocacy group opposing the dairy industrys petition And nutrition experts are weighing in too including   of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has studied the links between sugary drinks and obesity If the goal is to reduce the amount of calories that kids get from sweetened beverages then removing sugar from flavored milk is one option he says If the option is flavored milk with diet sweetener vs regular sugar then diet sweetener is favored he wrote to us in an email But he says theres no evidence that kids need flavored milk such as chocolate milk It has not been shown to increase milk intake he says The dairy industry disagrees And the dairy industrys petition is also facing opposition from school food advocates I think its unconscionable says school chef   whos been working to reform the way kids eat at school She argues that parents and students will have a hard time discerning whats in the milk This is nothing but a marketing ploy by the dairy industry to support milk sales Cooper tells The Salt via email We all need to let the USDA know that we oppose hiding ingredients in milk as a way to increase profits for the dairy industry As a mom I understand why parents want to know whether the chocolate milk their kids are being served at school contains artificial sweeteners such as aspartame And the question lots of parents are asking is one of transparency Can we   expect kids to read the fine print on the back of the bottle to know what theyre getting But Miller says if school districts were to choose to add a noncaloric sweetener to chocolate milk parents would not be left in the dark School administrators would likely inform parents of the change by putting it on menus websites and newsletters What do you think
