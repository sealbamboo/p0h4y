After a roughly sixhour operation surgeons at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles have successfully inserted a device in the brain stem of a deaf yearold boy in the hope that it will help him to hear The operation the first in a clinical trial supported by the National Institutes of Health could help set a precedent for the safety and efficacy of a surgery that has been performed for years abroad but is considered risky by some in the US It is being led by researchers from the House Clinic in Los Angeles and USC This is a great relief said Auguste Majkowskis mother Sophie Gareau shortly after the surgery on Tuesday Gareau who traveled from Montreal for the procedure wept after hearing from one of the doctors that her sons operation went well Auguste a lively toddler with a love of firetrucks and boundless energy was born deaf After he was diagnosed when he was a year and a half old doctors surgically introduced a cochlear implant to help him hear The implant uses an electrode array inserted into the inner ear or cochlea to directly stimulate the auditory nerve whenever the device picks up sound But Augustes cochlear implant didnt work The auditory nerve leading from the cochlea to the brain stem appeared to be missing  and without a natural wire to transmit sound to the brain stem the device was of no use I had to deal with that Gareau said Its not easy to think somethings going to work and then its not working  But the fact that Auguste had already had a cochlear implant actually made him a good candidate for the study said House Clinic neurotologist Eric Wilkinson one of the lead researchers for the clinical trial and one of the surgeons who performed Augustes operation It showed that as far as hearing devices went the ABI truly was the familys only option You dont want to put a brainstem implant in if you dont have to he said Its more involved theres more risk its a bigger surgery The auditory brain stem implant or ABI offers a way to bypass that missing wire Surgeons place a device on the cochlear nucleus the part of the brain stem that receives sound and use a network of electrodes to stimulate this spot directly Surgeons have used this device for years on people who have lost hearing because of an accident or a rare type of tumor that affects the auditory nerve and who would not benefit from a cochlear implant But it cant help adults who have been deaf all their lives because their brains have developed without exposure to sound In order to work in people who are born deaf the device has to be implanted when they are very young To date most ABI surgeries on young children have been done in Europe A few operations have been performed on young children in the United States but this would be the first NIHfunded FDAapproved clinical trial to test it in kids who were born deaf said USC audiologist Laurie Eisenberg Eisenberg is one of the lead investigators on the study which seeks to implant the device in  young children If the study shows its safe and effective it could help clear the way for the implant surgery on young children to become a more accepted procedure in the US This surgery could be a great alternative for families just as long as they know the potential risks and potential benefits said Dr Walter Kutz a neurotologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center who was not involved in the research It could really change their lives for the better The team of surgeons shook hands with Augustes parents Tuesday afternoon after completing the operation and successfully testing the ABI device to see whether the brain responded Gareau and her husband Christophe Majkowski hugged tightly in a waiting room when they heard the news Augustes new ABI is scheduled to be turned on in midJune
