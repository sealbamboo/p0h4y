Jack Scoville was buying himself a chocolate bar a few weeks ago  Hersheys milk  at a corner store in Chicago And he noticed the price was just a bit higher than hes used to paying  or  cents more His first thought was not to blame a greedy store owner or the executives in Hershey Pa He blamed Ebola  is a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group and he looks at the cocoa commodities market Last month cocoa contracts  the price that chocolate suppliers agree to pay for raw cocoa  spiked in large part because of Ebola fears The price made the move to threeyear highs in response to the Ebola crisis on fears that it could spread into Ivory Coast and Ghana says Scoville Ivory Coast and Ghana together produce more than half the worlds cocoa And theyre both next door to Ebolaaffected Liberia and Guinea Now the fear isnt that you can get Ebola from chocolate Everyone Ive interviewed on this story urged me to remind my readers that YOU CANNOT GET EBOLA FROM CHOCOLATE The fear rather was that if Ebola were to jump over the border to Ivory Coast those cocoa farmers would scatter to avoid exposure to the virus The cocoa fruits  the seeds of that fruit that we call the cocoa bean  would stay unpicked And Halloween would become as expensive as Christmas That says Scoville would be the fear Or at least that was the fear until the end of September Then suddenly the fear vanished The price of cocoa futures eased back Maybe the reason was that weeks had passed and Ebola hadnt jumped the border Or maybe it was because Ivory Coast had reassured traders by locking down its land borders allowing almost no human traffic from Ebolaaffected countries The market feels like we dodged a bullet says Scoville That doesnt mean that Bart Simpson will be guaranteed that he can lay his fingers on an affordable Butterfinger in the months ahead Those sealed borders could still have an impact on chocolate prices Most of the workers who harvest cocoa in Ivory Coast are migrants from Liberia and Guinea Now they cant cross the border to pick the pods And picking season is the beginning of October If Cote dIvoires agriculture sector loses all of its laborers  that will have a huge impact in terms of the crop and what can actually be harvested says Edward George head of group research for   a panAfrican bank Ecobank researchers predict that farms will procure podpickers from elsewhere But they cant be sure how the season will go And the reason is related to Ebola Usually at this time of year chocolate companies send swarms of agronomists into West Africa to count trees and pods and then use mathematical modeling to predict to great accuracy the worlds supply of cocoa this year Because of Ebola many of those podcounters never boarded the plane even to Ebolafree Ivory Coast and Ghana This information is not coming in says George So this entire cocoa season we could be walking on in the dark Which led me to the most important question of all of my chocolate interviews Should I stock up on  chocolate bars just in case Yes was Georges response Although he was quick to add Except it doesnt keep that well So I dont know Unless youre planning to eat  chocolate bars in a couple of months To put all this in perspective though consider If cocoa prices do spike people will eat less chocolate But when closed borders are keeping migrant workers from reaching the fields and sending their wages home some families arent eating at all
