A closely watched trial that many hoped would help clarify a contentious battle over access to generic drugs instead ended in disappointment last week. In fact, the outcome only seems to have underscored the difficulty in sorting out so-called pay-to-delay deals, a topic that has embroiled the pharmaceutical industry, regulators and the courts for years.. The case decided last week—in which AstraZeneca PLC and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. were accused of illegally delaying a generic version of AstraZeneca’s Nexium heartburn pill—offered the prospect of some much-needed clarity since it was the first to go to trial since the ruling. Instead, the federal court jury in Boston offered a mixed bag.
