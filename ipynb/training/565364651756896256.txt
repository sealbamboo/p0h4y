A   can be hard enough to get on your own Add in the challenge of sleeping with a partner who snores hogs the covers or can only nod off to the sound of the nightly newsor has issues with   sleep patterns and needsand its no wonder so many partners are   In fact about  of American couples retreat to separate sleeping quarters according to the National Sleep Foundation That can be an effective solution for some spouses but it can also take a toll on your bond and intimacy says Michael Breus PhD clinical psychologist and sleep specialist and author of   If his and hers beds dont appeal to you youve still got options Read on for easy expertbacked ways to navigate your different sleep styles and score the snoozetime you both deserve About  million adults snore regularly according to the National Sleep Foundation resulting in   for their bedmates   themselves Men are more likely to saw away and snoring tends to worsen with age The sound comes from vibrations made as you breathe through narrowed airways while sleeping says Breus Congestion is often a trigger so is drinking alcohol close to bedtime Even sleeping on your back can be to blame which is why nonsnoring partners often roll or push the snorer over to get some peace and quiet If addressing these issues doesnt help have your partner check in with a sleep doctor Snoring can be a sign of sleep apnea a serious but treatable condition that causes breathing to stop several times per night In the meantime Breus suggests the snorefree partner drown out the buzz by surrounding their ears with a wall of pillows The sound will bounce back in the other direction reducing the noise enough so youre more likely to drift off he says The optimum temperature for sleep ranges from  to  degrees fahrenheit says Breus But that wont persuade a partner who craves a toastywarm   to stop secretly hiking the thermostat nor will it stop a chillloving spouse from throwing open the window Call a compromise Pick a temperature between your two preferences The person who likes it warmer has the option of putting on another blanket or thicker pajamas while the coldpreferring partner can sleep outside the sheets or duvet suggests Breus Upgrading to a bigger bed might also help A larger bed means more room so the person who wants it cooler isnt as affected by the others body heat says Janet Kennedy PhD clinical psychologist and sleep specialist in New York City and author of   When spouses dont agree on how to handle a child who has had a bad dream or has a potty emergency conflict can ensuenot to mention nextday exhaustion Sometimes only one parent ends up taking care of the childs needs and that can build resentment says Kennedy Or one partner is fine with the child coming into their bed for the rest of the night while the other parent wants the bedroom offlimits Kennedy suggests reaching a solution outside of the bedroom when you and your partner are rested and thinking rationally You need to be on the same page about how to handle this situation so you set boundaries for your kids but also share the responsibility of a middleofthenight interruption she advises Otherwise not only will you both be   the conflict can potentially shake up your bond Some people love a soft sinkintoit bed others require bedding as firm as a board before they can start counting sheep Luckily   have caught on to this and options that address both preferences exist The Sleep Number Bed is popular because you can make one side firmer and the other softer so spouses dont have to resort to separate beds says Breus Memory foam mattresses are also couplefriendly because they mold to your weight and body size without affecting the partner lying alongside You could also look into a splitking bed that features a kingsize frame with two sidebyside separate mattresses These beds can be pricey but think of it as an investment in your health and relationship not just another piece of furniture This ones tricky we all have an internal clock that generally determines what time we turn in for the night and wake up in the morning Yet its almost impossible to change your   says Breus Make a deal the latertobed partner promises to be extra quiet and not do anything in the bedroom that can cause the other to wake then in the morning the early riser promises to do the same for the partner sleeping in If you need to rise first offer to not hit the snooze button too often so it goes off a bunch of times and disturbs the other person says Kennedy Similarly night owls should use headphones to listen to music or watch TV while the other spouse is snoozing advises Breus Schedule time in bed to be intimate or to talk at a neutral time like early in the evening or later in the morning so one partner isnt wired while the other is too tired Preferring a dark bedroom makes sense darkness is a cue to your brain to ramp up production of the hormone melatonin which helps your body wind down says Breus Thing is some people are conditioned to   with a light on If you and your partner are in opposing camps compromise by agreeing to keep a very small lowwattage lamp or nightlight plugged in or use a clipon booklight that can be directed away from the other partner says Breus And eye masks look silly but dont discount themthey can be surprisingly good at blocking out light Breus also recommends a new type of lightbulb for your bedside lamp Goodnight Bulbs use a special bulb that cuts down on blue light the kind emitted from TV screens and smartphones that has been implicated in insomnia Without that blue light its easier for the darknesswanting spouse to doze off Even the closest couples can have different presleep intimacy preferences One partner might like   before bed and falling asleep in the others arms while the other feels crowded and cant relax unless he or she turns away says Kennedy While that might feel like rejection or a reflection that you two arent as connected as you thought Kennedy cautions against viewing it that way Its just a difference in sleep styles she says Heres a fair middle ground Agree to cuddle until the snuggler drifts off at which point the other person can retreat to their side of the bed and sleep solo for the rest of the night she says Or have a distinct  to  minute snuggle time during which you two can touch and talk and then officially move to opposite sides of the bed once the time has passed You both have your intimacy needs meet and can easily drift off to dreamland If one of you is conditioned to fall asleep to Jimmy Kimmels voice on latenight TV while the other needs silence you might need to look into headphones especially the wireless kind A timer is also a good idea agree to set it for  or  minutes by which time the TV watcher will have sacked out anyway says Breus If the noise cant be totally shut out agree to keep the TV volume low then bring a fan into the bedroom next to your side and keep it on all night Its a simple whitenoise infusion that can drown out the voices on the tube If youre out of options foam earplugs you can buy in a drugstore can be surprisingly effective Ever wake up in the middle of a sleep session to find yourself shivering because the comforter you had cocooned yourself in hours ago is now encased around your partner like a burrito Sounds like youre sleeping with a blanket hogthough its not necessarily a deliberate move on your bedmates part If the tug of war over covers happens regularly its no surprise youre fatigued says Breus The solution is to have his and hers covers one top sheet blanket andor comforter for you and another stack for him Its harder for one partner to steal the covers from the other if you each have your own layers Everyone changes position at least a few times as they cycle through a night of sleep But women tend to be more sensitive to their partners movements and that means theyre more likely to be woken up by the kicking jostles or twitchy motions of a restless sleeper says Breus Layering up in separate blankets can help minimize the disruption since his or her legs and arms will be wrapped under a different comforter and sheet set Or consider a foam mattress like a TempurPedicthe lack of springs cuts down on excessive bounce and motion says Kennedy A larger bed also allows you to maintain an arms length of distance so the other person can thrash all over the place and not make contact with you
