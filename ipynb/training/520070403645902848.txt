MADRID—The Spanish nursing aide infected with Ebola believes she might have caught the virus by touching her face with a gloved hand after treating a missionary brought here from Sierra Leone, a doctor said Wednesday.. “That’s what she recalls and what she has told me three times,” Germán Ramírez Olivencia said at a news conference, offering the first possible explanation of how Ebola spread for the first time beyond West Africa. “It appears that we’ve found the origin.”
