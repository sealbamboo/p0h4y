Recruitment agencies should ensure care workers can speak English before placing them in vulnerable peoples homes a government adviser has said Dr Shereen Hussein scientific adviser to the Department of Health told BBC Radio  live that poor language skills could lead to bad care and abuse Figures from Kings College London say  of care workers are migrants Care minister Norman Lamb said communication skills would be required for the new Care Certificate The brother of one dementia sufferer told the BBC his carers struggled to communicate Phil whose full name we have withheld has a yearold brother with a severe form of dementia He employed carers for  months to oversee the care of his brother but grew frustrated with the quality of the staff  He told  live Breakfast the situation grew so problematic he took the decision to put his brother in a care home The dynamic between the carers and a frightened man who was suffering with dementia didnt work most of the time he said Almost all the carers were from overseas mainly from Poland I found some of them exceptionally difficult to understand which meant my brother in his condition was never going to understand them and the reaction from him was to hide or get slightly violent Dr Hussein of Kings College Londons Social Care Workforce Research Unit advises the Department of Health in England and said that changes to immigration policy and the relaxation of EU labour rules has altered the profile of migrants who work as carers in the UK   She said Migrants from outside the European Union have a long history of working in the UKs care sector and have always had to  prove their efficiency in the English language before securing jobs in the industry but this is not the case with new arrivals from EU countries  This means new migrants can be vulnerable when theyre placed in peoples homes  and carers have reported instances of racism and discrimination that stem from communication problems In some UK cities it is thought around half of care workers are foreign nationals  Dr Hussein added It would be really beneficial to have a standard interview process to establish English language proficiency communication skills and softer skills of all care workers aiming to work in the sector At the moment vulnerable workers are placed in the homes of vulnerable adults with complex needs and sometimes communication problems can result in bad treatment for both parties BBC Radio  live Breakfast   from Hungary who gave examples of times where they struggled to communicate with clients  Hajnalka Deak who came to the UK to work as a care worker in  said To do the job you have to understand the doctors instructions report to relatives and speak to the agencies   You have to help clients do things they cant do for themselves and its essential to understand their instructions right away   I remember once I worked with a wheelchairuser  I had to strap him in the the car unfortunately I couldnt understand the exact instructions and we had to stay at home and couldnt go anywhere  I felt partly embarrassed and partly frustrated  But Edna Maharig who has joint HungarianJordanian nationality and worked as a carer from  until last week told  live having a grasp of the English language is not the most important thing when it comes to being a good carer There are certain terms and technical words that we dont understand and thats difficult but its more important to have empathy and understand your role as a carer she said Dr Hussein told  live Breakfast the onus should be on the care agencies to prove their recruits can speak the English required for the job and not the workers themselves She said We know that migrants form a very considerable part of social care workforce and their work is really valuable and important to the system But we also know the work is reliant on very good communication skills This standardised interview would not be a deterrent for migrant workers but it will mean care agencies identify areas where induction and training is needed before they go to peoples own homes and provide intimate care to them Care agencies are contracted by local authorities to supply home care to elderly and vulnerable adults  Councils in England have been hit by more than bn in budget cuts for adult social care since   Colin Angel of the UK Home Care Association which represents the interests of care agencies said Dr Hussein has identified an issue at a time when public spending on social care is extremely constrained and with the low rates that local authorities are currently paying for home care its extremely difficult for agencies to increase the amount of paid training Terms and conditions of the workforce are being pushed closer to the national minimum wage under the strain of spending cuts At the weekend the BBC learned   meaning new care workers will have to earn a training certificate in topics such as dementia care and patient dignity within  months of starting a job from March   English language proficiency is not included in this training remit however according to Dr Hussein Care minister Norman Lamb said For people to get the care they want they need to be able to communicate with their care workers Employers are responsible for recruiting staff that can competently speak and read English but communication will be a key part of the new Care Certificate   This certificate will show the people who use care services that the person in front of them has been trained to a specific set of standards and knows how to act with compassion and respect The Labour Party has launched its own review into exploitation in the care sector overseen by Baroness Kingsmill which is due to be published later this month
