A patients wife was on the phone her voice hesitant unhappy She didnt bother with small talk I need to talk to you about Toms drinking she said Only the pure shock of the moment justifies the first words out of my mouth Tom Youre kidding me said I Every family has a tortured soul in a closet whose door doesnt quite close The demons inside are all too visible to friends and family neighbors and doormen even the staff of the emergency room To the outside world though not a hint of a problem displays and that includes colleagues clients and always especially the doctor It is an extraordinary phenomenon this saving of face in the doctors office amusing and distressing in equal parts spilling into every kind of medical evaluation At its most basic it is the patient recovering from the flu who announces  we must hear it once a day  I was so sick last week I didnt know what to do So where were you Oh I didnt want you to see me like that The same instinct lies behind the heartbreaking valor of the demented as they struggle to conceal every lost thought the dying who determinedly focus the conversation on any subject but mortality the substance users who jump through hoops to avoid medical help for their medical problem There are some tools to trap the elusive user but not nearly enough The standard implements of the trade sometimes come through A physical exam can turn up the needle users track marks or the alcoholics swollen salivary glands Routine lab work occasionally yields clues as can studiedly casual chat What are you up to this weekend A variety of more pointed questions Do you ever need a drink to get going in the morning have been scientifically validated to pick up many serious problems But even good tools are useless when nobody bothers to use them A   from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that of the  million problem drinkers in the country only one in six have come clean to a health professional Doctors are often just not in the mood for a long fraught investigation They may feel too much empathy and respect for a patient who is clearly a pillar of the community They may be up to their armpits in the patients other problems as I was with Toms predictably forgetting as   that addiction can be the source of most of those problems Then suddenly an unfamiliar voice is on the phone and everything becomes crystal clear  clear but alas certainly no easier as evidenced by my next words to Toms wife Im so sorry I cant talk to you about that Three separate considerations canceled our conversation before it began First discussions behind an adult patients back are always a terrible idea No matter how well intentioned they instantly deform the connection between doctor and patient transforming one into a pediatrician and the other into a child Of course since neither is either this new relationship seldom works out and the nonchild heads right out and finds a new doctor Ethical standards also hold that most aspects of the adult patients health are private not to be discussed even with a loving spouse without specific permission This mandate lapses only when patients are confused or comatose and urgent medical decisions have to be made A clear imminent danger to the concerned party can also justify a breach If Toms wife was a nondriver and he was planning to take her on a long crosscountry road trip weaving down Interstate  with a quart of vodka in his lap then a lengthy conversation might be in order Absent this kind of danger Toms business remains his own And finally the law is now involved With the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of  or Hipaa the federal government weighed in on patient privacy to everyones great confusion The convolutions of this legislation are often misinterpreted to affirm that no one can talk to anyone about anyone elses health without written consent In fact   as long as the patient is consulted first and has no objections Still the law makes everyone just a little more cautious I told Toms wife Id get back to her At his next appointment I told Tom she had called I didnt say about what Mind if I talk to her Or maybe she can come to your next appointment with you And Tom firmly and politely said absolutely not So thats where it ended I never met his wife never heard that sad voice on the phone again But Tom suddenly found our health conversations heading in an entirely new direction It turns out that even when moral legal and professional considerations all forbade me to say a single word nothing stopped me from listening and nothing made me forget
