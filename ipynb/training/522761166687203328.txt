Texans on both sides of the abortion issue are taking stock after the US Supreme Court intervened in a lawsuit over a state law that would require clinics that provide abortion services to conform to standards for ambulatory surgery centers The court issued an order late Tuesday saying  Texas clinics that had to close can reopen their doors for now The clinics had shut down Oct  because they couldnt meet the standards of ambulatory surgery centers Thats one of the Texas laws requirements But now the US Supreme Court has said those clinics can continue to operate while the law is appealed I was really surprised and really delighted in a way I hadnt expected said Amy Hagstrom Miller founder and chief executive of   Whole Womans is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit for this case The company once had six clinics in Texas but the law forced all but one to close Miller said she will reopen her clinic in McAllen by Friday which would make services available to lowincome women in the Rio Grande Valley Women in the area had to travel to San Antonio but many couldnt afford the trip or take time off from work she said To begin with there were only two clinic facilities in the Rio Grande Valley and both of us had to close which meant that women had to travel upwards of  miles roundtrip in order to get an abortion safely Hagstrom said Hagstrom is also working to reopen a second clinic in Fort Worth But even with this ruling the legal fight in Texas appears to have fundamentally changed the landscape for abortion providers and not all the clinics are likely reopen Whole Womans clinic in Austin no longer has a lease or a state license The company once had a clinic in Beaumont but doctors there cant obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals so Miller closed it in March In addition any clinic that reopens might have to close again if the th Circuit Court of Appeals eventually rules the Texas law can stand  in Houston was one of only eight places left in the state to get an abortion after the noncompliant clinics closed Oct  Limiting abortion access to eight in Texas  eight simply isnt enough said Rochelle Tafolla a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman We were overwhelmed with phone calls Texas is the countrys secondmost populous state with about  million people When the other clinics closed Planned Parenthood received over  calls in just one day about six times the normal volume Some women whose appointments were canceled drove to the Houston clinic off the Gulf Freeway Women were scared they were nervous they didnt understand what was happening Tafolla said Were just thrilled the court stepped in to stop this terrible law and we hope that it will eventually and ultimately be overturned The Supreme Courts intervention means that the cycle of emergency motions is over The th Circuit has agreed to expedite the full appeal which could be heard as soon as December Houstonbased   supports the law and its strict new rules for providers Emily Horne a legislative associate says the surgery center rule will make abortion safer for women Horne said its discouraging that some clinics can now reopen because she believes they dont offer good medical care But she remains optimistic the law will stand in the long term The encouraging thing for us is that this case is still before the th Circuit and the th Circuit has already said a lot of positive things about the states merit and likelihood of success Horne said And none of that actually changed with what the Supreme Court said
