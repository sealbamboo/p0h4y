HelloFlos new ad for period starter kits is getting a lot of hype and deservedly so as it is a refreshing break from any other ad campaign about the agony surrounding the curse of Eve As something along the lines of a   skit the commercial is funny And Im sure this is the spirit in which it was created and in which we are meant to watch I did laugh but there was just something   about it When I was growing up my period starter kit was a Judy Blume book and the warped wisdom of my tween friends My mother never said boo about Flo There were no   No   When Flo arrived I was  To be honest Flo was kind of a letdown I was home alone and more impressed with myself than with Flo for I had conquered womanhood without crying or dying I told my mom as sort of an ohheybytheway and that was it Life went on And menstruation went on and on and on and on and I learned that Flo was not always a letdown I now have a daughter who is  We have talked at length about Flo In fact we have talked so much about Flo that every time I say the Fword her eyeballs shoot straight up into her brain and her body flops around bonelessly Commercial Katie on the other hand is a girl who wants her period bad enough to lie about it I get it She wants to belong Her friends are getting Flo and she doesnt want to be the one left holding the pad Shes super sassy alright in that special Floish way Moms angry with Katie for lying and angry about her tone Most reaction to the ad sings the praises of Mom and denounces Katie as a bratty tween Sure at face value thats true But at Katies age fitting in is a top priority  one important enough to lie for Is that really so unusual Do kids never act secretive or lie in order to be accepted by their friends My problem is with Katies mom who treats the situation as if she and her daughter are peers in battle Parenting a tween should not be about oneupping It is about noticing when your child is upset enough to be defensive and upset enough to lie when she feels left out It is about recognizing when your child has gone off course and focusing on trying to get her back on But that would have made for a boring commercial so instead we watch Katies mom invest a lot of time and a few hundred bucks for a boy band a red velvet fountain a popout cake and a vagician just to teach her daughter a lesson When Katie confesses Mom unleashes her victorious Imalwaysrightsodontmesswithme chortle and gives Katie her real gift which is the betterbargain  period starter kit The motherdaughter dynamic is as mystifying as it is personal but seeing this oftcomplicated bond portrayed as a healthy rivalry is somewhat troublesome Most unsettling though is the commercials depiction of punishmentbyhumiliation Tampon and pad commercials have always been bizarre what with the blue liquid and cheerleaders and slomo twirling but theyve always had this undertone of hiding something Its refreshing that HelloFlo tries to buck that trend with its first moon party but the purpose of the party is not to celebrate Katies coming of age  its to punish her for lying And not by say taking her phone but by making fun of her period in front of everyone from Katies friends the very people she wants to impress to Moms coworkers This humiliation leads right back to step one wanting to hide because of your period Back in real life my daughter and I were in the tampon aisle of the grocery store I had not stopped to consider moon products in a long time but I had been thinking about the HelloFlo commercial so this time I really took a look There were so many to choose from So so many Did periods really vary this much My brain was exploding My daughter just said I like the one with glitter Even that confused me Glitter Why would you need glitter on a maxi pad I asked her I dont know she said Youre the mom Added to the stress of Flos imposing product wall I could not handle the pressure of explaining the glitter Why   glitter a viable marketing strategy On the other hand out of all of the pads that is the one my daughter picked It was for tweens We rushed home and tore open the box even before putting the milk away We tore open a pad too There was no glitter We ran into the back yard and tilted it at various angles under the sun Why would they DO that wailed my daughter FRAUD I screamed to the trees She ran into the house and came back with a bottle of rainbow glitter which she merrily sprinkled all over the pad Then we laughed and leaped around like cheerleaders singing GLITTah is coming OUT of our PAHNTS I guess every mother and daughter faces Flo in their own way Later I asked my daughter to watch the commercial with me Whats it about she asked suspiciously The Fword I confessed meekly I witnessed the low halfhuman growl the fluttering eyelashes and the whites of her eyes Overall she just seemed befuddled declaring the uterus pinata and panties on a streamer strange She said she had no interest in a period starter kit because she didnt want random people sending her things for her private parts But the commercial wasnt aimed at her it was aimed at me Of course it was because what mom wouldnt want to see herself portrayed as one step ahead of her kid doling out exactly what she deserved HelloFlos message seems to be Lets make your period fun Because it   nice to get a little sunshine during an otherwise lousy situation And really is there  good way to advertise a tampon So far HelloFlo has done it better than anyone else The commercials have lightened the mood if nothing else and made the subject easier to talk about At the same time I think HelloFlos latest commercial misses the mark in some crucial comingofage areas One is its lack of compassion for an anxious tween girl who is lying to fit in And the other is opening up the topic by yet again associating menstruation with humiliation and punishment If you and your daughter are going to get through this womanhood thing together youve got to be on the same side Flo is mighty but not mightier than that
