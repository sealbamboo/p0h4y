If the constant cold werent enough a brutal winter has many speculating that the polar vortex will be replaced by a pollen vortex leaving allergy sufferers sniffling and miserable Alesia Kotek is ready for the worst She and her yearold daughter Caitlin share allergies to grass and trees  and Caitlin started getting itchy watery eyes this spring while snow was still on the ground outside their Cleveland Ohio home Im very nervous about this year with our allergies Alesia Kotek said The long cold winter felt by much of the US may indeed have an effect on this years spring allergy season But is this shaping up to be the worst allergy season on record That depends on what you mean by worst Experts say that for much of the country winters extended cold could lead to a shorter but more intense allergy season And it was certainly a memorably freezing season for much of the US with many states seeing record cold temperatures and heavy snow And the bitter cold continued to linger The National Weather Service reports that this was the rd coldest March on record Because warm dry days are ideal for pollen release allergy season is getting a late start In the past weve seen maple pollen as early as late February says Dr David Shulan a fellow with the American Academy of Allergy Asthma  Immunology but with this cold weather nothing was pollinating until mid to late April Susan Kosisky a microbiologist and chief of the United States Army Centralized Allergen Extract Laboratory reports that daily average pollen counts from her laboratory in Silver Spring Md have been  percent or below what is normal for this time of year which she attributes to cold temperatures But before you throw away the tissues experts say the slow start could mean a more intense wallop It will be a shorter period by a number of weeks but you will see it all hitting very intensely says Dr Shulan Dr Rachel Szekely an allergist at Cleveland Clinic explains that a wet winter means healthy tree roots And although we cant predict exactly how plants will behave experts say that the trees are simply waiting for warmer drier days to release their pollen While tree species usually stagger their pollen release throughout the season the cold weather means that trees that normally release earlier will probably be releasing at the same time as trees that dispense pollen later in the season Its like winding up a spring and letting it go all at once said Shulan We cant say for sure what will happen because pollen release is very much dependent on the weather Pollen grains are small and very light so they use wind to spread If it stays this cold and wet we wont see much pollen says Kosisky but if we can put together a string of warmer sunny dry days  we will probably see aboveaverage pollen A few warm days have given a glimpse into what this more intense allergy season could look like A couple sunny breezy days in New York City led to intense tree pollen release according to Shulan And when temperatures in Washington DC reached  degrees on Sunday our pollen counts soared said Kosisky Soaring pollen counts are bad news for patients like the Kotek family who enjoy being outside Caitlin likes to swim play basketball with her brother and ride her bike Before getting allergy shots Caitlins symptoms were so bad that she had allergyinduced asthma and was having serious breathing trouble So how can allergy sufferers prepare for potentially brutal pollen release Besides keeping up with regular allergy medications   Keep your windows closed to keep out the pollen grains If its hot consider using air conditioning which cuts down on pollen and mold by about  percent said Shulan So while many are eagerly greeting an end to a seemingly endless winter it will be a tradeoff for patients with seasonal allergies A spell of idyllic warm dry weather might lead to a potpourri of trees releasing above average amounts of pollen said Kosisky So allergy sufferers should be prepared she warns because there will be plenty of pollen for everyone Kotek says that she and her family dont let allergies stop them from their outdoorsy lifestyle  but she knows enough to be prepared Were never optimistic with our allergies she said
