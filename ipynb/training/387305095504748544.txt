Up to  customers of a body piercing shop which had its electricity disconnected in August could be at risk of infection council officials say Blackpool Council urged anyone who had used the Blackpool Body Piercing Clinic in Springfield Road in the past two months to get a health check It said electricity was needed to power an autoclave device to sterilise piercing tools and jewellery The clinics owner James Woods said I havent done anything wrong  The British Body Piercing Association BBPA said it was possible for piercers to work without an autoclave and avoid the need for electricity The authority said it believed the number of customers pierced was fewer than  but there was no way of knowing the exact total until people came forward Blackpool Council said it issued a notice to owner Mr Woods under the Health And Safety At Work Act ordering him to stop work until an electricity supply was reconnected It said that was because the electricity was needed to power an autoclave which sterilises the piercing tools and jewellery to kill all bacteria viruses fungi and spores The owner was also ordered to thoroughly clean the piercing rooms and arrange for a reinspection of the premises prior to reopening Mr Woods said he had been piercing for  years and had been taking instruments home to autoclave for a couple of weeks while the electricity was off He said Its a witch hunt This could completely ruin me because noone has given me chance to say my part Its not right However the council said it believed the owner continued to carry out piercings Dr Arif Rajpura Blackpool Councils director of public health said As a result of these concerns we believe there may be a risk of infection to those people who have been pierced since the disconnection on  August I would stress this is a precautionary measure However it is important that people heed this advice and take a proactive approach to looking after their health He urged anyone affected to contact Public Health England which will then refer them to their doctor The council said it was now pursuing enforcement action against the owner Keith Fakenbridge the founder of the BBPA refused to comment on this case but said providing there was enough light piercers could use singleuse disposable needles disposable clamps and presterilised jewellery He said gas could be used to heat water Mr Fakenbridge added Of course the piercing area would still need to be kept sterile using antibacterial sprays bleach disposing of tissues clamps and gloves into a biohazard waste bin and the needle placed into a sharps box but you do not need electricity for that
