See that guy over there he whispered to me in a voice so low I had to lean closer to hear He thinks Im CIA Mike and I had arrived a few hours earlier for our vacation in Saigon exhausted and blearyeyed after  hours of flying from our home in New York City  We had eaten dinner and were sipping beers in the caf at our hotel I glanced in the direction Mike was staring All I saw was a something Vietnamese man reading a magazine  There was no way that this man thought Mike  a curlyhaired jeans and Tshirtclad freelance copy editor  was in the CIA Then I looked into Mikes eyes His pupils were completely dilated I felt unsteady Mike just peered at me his eyes wide with fear I could see that something was wrong with him but I didnt know what I was naive mental illness didnt even cross my mind I simply thought that if we could cut our vacation short and get him back to familiar surroundings in New York everything would be fine  But Mike calmed down insisting that he was OK and that he wanted to stay in Vietnam I complied as I often did  In those days I was painfully passive certain that it was best for both of us that Mike made the decisions And for much of the rest of the trip I was grateful that we hadnt taken drastic action  Mike was back to his delightful and charming self We had pho for lunch one day a noodle soup pronounced fuh and made up puns about it  Id fuhgotten how tasty this is Mike said to me and I laughed However I purposely ignored some of his more curious behaviors checking the hotel locks and windows multiple times shushing me even when we were alone in our room He had never acted like this before what I didnt realize was that a new paranoia had taken up residence in Mikes mind  and it was never going away Mike and I met in  when we were college students in New Orleans Our relationship turned romantic quickly  Wed sit in the sun in his quad or mine or read books side by side on his futon snuggled under his childhood tigerprint blanket  After graduation we traveled for a year strapping on backpacks and bumming around various parts of the world Then in  we moved to Manhattan where we both got jobs and shared an apartment  We didnt really have separate lives Wed often meet for lunch just to catch up on the few hours wed spent apart Neither of us went out without the other If Mike was meeting up with his friends Id tag along If I had a girls night planned Mike would come too  I was terribly insecure  I didnt feel smart or clever and I knew that Mike was smart and clever So I deferred to him whenever I could Once I wanted to try a yoga class So I spent hours convincing Mike to come along It didnt occur to me that I could try a class on my own We even shared an email account It was only years later as Mike grew ill that I realized that my dependency was unhealthy When we returned home to New York after our trip to Saigon Mike seemed normal  But a few months later when Mike was  his strange behavior returned  At first the changes were subtle  We had a crate where we kept important papers  tax forms passports  and he became obsessed with rummaging through it  His voice changed too in a way that was imperceptible to anyone but me His tone was deadened When he joked he lacked his previous enthusiasm I only began to worry in earnest on the night he stayed out until dawn without warning  When he finally came back he kissed me on the forehead like hed just finished a day at the office  Furious I told him how distraught Id been In response all he said was Its OK I was out for a stroll Then he shot me an eerie fake smile  None of this was like Mike  I suddenly wondered what else he might do Would he make an offensive comment to a stranger and trigger a fight Would he wander into traffic Increasingly concerned I called his parents who lived in New Jersey and didnt know anything had been the matter with their son  An hour later they pulled up in front of our building and we drove straight to the familys primarycare doctor  He suggested a battery of tests and a hospital stay to rule out physiological explanations for Mikes behavior  But he clearly suspected mental illness and recommended that Mike go to a psychiatric ward Shocking though it may seem thats when it first occurred to me that Mikes mind was the problem I was both relieved hey at least it probably wasnt a brain tumor and terrified Mike was diagnosed with severe depression and was put on an antidepressant  But he didnt last long in the psych ward He checked himself out two days after his arrival insisting he wasnt sick And after about a month at home thanks to medication and weekly therapy Mike again seemed like himself  I was so optimistic about his recovery in fact that about a year later when he spontaneously asked me to marry him I said yes The next day December   we took our vows at City Hall  Five months later I became pregnant I was ecstatic at the prospect of starting a family  convinced that we would be fantastic parents and that Mikes illness was behind us for good  But my sense of certainty was crushed just a few minutes after our daughter Lizzie was born on February   As I lay in the hospital bed Mike leaned over and said I heard the baby talk to me I couldnt believe it He had gone off his medication without my realizing it  I begged him to go back on the drugs and he listened But he seemed less stable than before as though he might lose control at any moment  As in Saigon he constantly checked our locks and shushed me He struggled to bond with Lizzie He held her in a rocking chair and read her books but often had a totally blank expression on his face  I never felt comfortable leaving Lizzie alone with Mike His mind always seemed elsewhere When Lizzie was about  months old Mike went off his medication yet again and was hospitalized  This time he received a new diagnosis the one he still has today severe bipolar disorder which is a mental illness characterized by long periods of depression followed by shorter bouts of mania  The diagnosis scared me Although about  million Americans have bipolar disorder Id never known someone with it  Perhaps for that reason I saw the disease as shameful I couldnt bear to tell my mom and dad or my friends that Mike was no longer just depressed Meanwhile Mike wasnt getting better Instead of nine good months at a time hed have five then two  largely because he kept refusing to take his Zyprexa pills swearing that he wasnt ill  Panicked I visited countless doctors read countless books and visited support groups in an effort to find him and myself real help  Mike didnt want to hear about any of it He stopped working and spent hours lying on the floor listening to Ziggy Stardust over and over Then one weekend in the spring of  I reached a tipping point  Mike was driving the two of us to a nearby grocery store He seemed a bit withdrawn but still communicative So I was unprepared when suddenly he blew through a stop sign  I shouted for him to brake but he didnt seem to hear STOP I screamed again petrified after he ran another When he finally did stop I got out of the car and walked home shaken  I didnt know what to do The answer became clear the next day when our family went to the park Threeyearold Lizzie held out her hands to Mike shouting Daddy up He just walked right by her and I saw her face fall  That night as I tucked her into bed she said I dont like Daddy really much Her words got to me What kind of example was I setting by not putting my daughter first I made a silent vow to take control of my life One day later I stood before a New York City Supreme Court judge and requested to have Mike committed I told him voice quavering that Mike was a danger to himself and others citing the stopsign incident and his inconsistency with his medication as evidence  The order was granted  Police officers came to our apartment and took Mike to the hospital he resisted at first but eventually the officers convinced him to comply I told Mike that if he stayed there and got help  and kept going to his psychiatrist after he was released  Id be there for him If not Id leave I knew what would happen and it did He checked himself out of the hospital after  hours which was legal under the terms of the commitment order  And true to my word I took Lizzie and left  Six months later I filed for legal separation and two years after that we divorced It wasnt easy I held on to a lot of guilt for ending the marriage  I felt that I shouldnt have abandoned someone who was ill someone whom I had loved for so long I felt it was my duty to make Mike better  However I also was relieved  for me and for Lizzie  To her Mike had been so emotionally absent that his physical disappearance seemed like the next logical step  As for me I felt like a great weight had been lifted and I could finally enjoy life again I remember walking down the street feeling like I could float away After the marriage ended I needed to talk about Mikes mental illness  It was as if Id explode if I didnt I found I was far from alone  One friend told me about her debilitating postpartum depression An acquaintance who was married with two kids told me she had bipolar disorder  But she saw a therapist regularly and understood that she needed medication Her case made me fully understand the severity of Mikes condition and of his denial Seventeen years into his illness Mike still cycles on and off his medications  When hes off he tends to fixate on bizarre ideas Hes prone to announcing via email that hes an heir to an oil fortune or a Mayflower descendant  Mikes mother with whom I remain close is his legal guardian and helps him function He still cannot work Ive moved on I married a wonderful man Jeff who has been a full parent to Lizzie  Our relationship is truly equal We make all our decisions together Lizzie and I see Mike only about once a year due to his erratic behavior And in between visits we dont keep in touch I hear about Mike periodically through his mother Lizzie knows that he has bipolar disorder and that theres a genetic component to the illness  Will I get it she asked me a few years ago when she was  I told her probably not but that regardless its usually treatable We talk openly I never want her to feel mental illness is something that should be hidden as I once did But I also dont want her to believe that an increased chance of mental illness is the only thing she inherited from Mike  So I tell her about his keen intelligence our exciting travelsand the relationship we once shared And when she laughs and jokes sometimes I catch a glimpse of that man my first love Its a bittersweet moment but one I wouldnt trade for the world Affecting about  of the United States population bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness distinguished by severe mood swings and drastic changes in energy level Sufferers typically endure long periods of clinical depression followed by short spells of mania which can be experienced as euphoria or irritability  Its also possible for bipolar people to feel manic and depressed at the same time says Dr Igor Galynker the director of the Family Center for Bipolar Disorder at Beth Israel Hospital in New York  Mike suffers from the severest form of the disease type  in which the manic episodes can require hospitalization and feature psychosis like Mikes delusional thoughts Type  sufferers also require medication but their symptoms are less dramatic There is no known cause but a family history of the disease makes a person more likely to get it A parent with type  or type  bipolar has about a  chance of having a child who suffers from the illness says Galynker With the right combination of mood stabilizers antidepressants and antipsychotic medications the symptoms can lessen allowing bipolar sufferers types  and  to lead relatively normal lives  Unfortunately many of the drugs have marked side effects including painful rashes diabetes and weight gain which is why some patients struggle to stick with their regimens Denial of the illness is another reason If you suspect that you or a loved one may have bipolar disorder talk to your primarycare doctor about how to proceed To learn more visit the website of the
