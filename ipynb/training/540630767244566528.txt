For practically our whole history of cooking and eating weve gotten our spices and most flavors not to mention all of the other basic nutrients that keep us alive straight from plants But researchers and biotech companies are starting to produce some of these nutrients and flavors  especially the highpriced ones  in their laboratories Take for instance chemical compounds called   Healthconscious consumers are snapping them up because theres some evidence that these substances repair damaged cells in our body reducing the risk of cancer and heart problems Colorful berries like blueberries and raspberries for instance give us   Now anthocyanins are appearing as if by magic in   laboratory at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy NY Andrew Jones a graduate student here holds up a thick glass tube a little bigger than my thumb filled with a milky fluid You can see the slight change in color he says Its a little red Its a red compound that were producing The tube is teeming with a common and harmless strain of   bacteria But Koffas and Jones have inserted some extra genes which were originally identified in plants like raspberries   into these bacteria We engineer their genetic circuits so they can produce chemicals for us Koffas says These same genes exist in many plants that are high in anthocyanins Each gene churns out a specific enzyme and together the enzymes form a biochemical pathway Think of it as a chemical assembly line in the cell Step by step the enzymes build the healthpromoting anthocyanin compound This assembly line already exists in raspberries of course But Jones says there are big advantages to moving it into bacteria Plants take a long time to grow where   can grow overnight he says Microbial production is also more scalable Plants need light and land and a variety of nutrients to grow These microbes on the other hand have been converted into dedicated antioxidant factories Koffas and his university have patented this strain of   and licensed it to a company called Chromadex which is now scaling up the production process Were hoping that in a couple of years there will be microbially produced anthocyanins commercially available says Koffas The idea of using microbes to produce valuable molecules is not really new Biotech companies have been making   this way for several decades But only recently have they moved into the more familiar world of food ingredients  at the University of Alberta in Edmonton Canada says it should be possible to use microbes to make a whole variety of substances that we currently get from plants There are companies right now that are really hot on the heels of producing the unsaturated fatty acids the omegas that we get from fish People are looking at fermentation systems with algae he says Bressler says he has worked on producing some food ingredients through microbial fermentation Which ingredients I cant share that information he says The companies often dont want to identify what theyre making There are two reasons why companies dont want to talk about it Bressler says First theyre trying to hide valuable secrets such as what strain of bacteria theyre using Second theyre afraid of getting caught up in the controversy over genetically modified organisms  GMOs They dont really know how consumers will react to the idea of healthy oils or flavors coming from GM microbes And some   believe there may be risks involved in creating strains of yeast or bacteria with combinations of genes not found in nature One company that is happy to talk about its products is   based in Switzerland If were asking you to eat our product then fundamentally we owe it to you to explain how were making it says Neil Goldsmith the companys founder and CEO Evolva inserts new genes into ordinary bakers yeast to make its products It has two products on the market already The first is   an antioxidant found in the skins of red grapes which is sold as a nutritional supplement Evolva is also making    the main flavor compound in natural vanilla extract The companys microbemade flavor competes with synthetic vanillin which is made in chemical factories Within two years Evolva plans to sell a yeastproduced version of saffron an ancient spice thats   from a crocus flower Theres a lot of people who arent getting to use saffron because its so expensive Goldsmith says If we can make it more affordable then hopefully we can change that As for the safety concerns the Food and Drug Administration does not think what Evolva is doing is particularly risky It is reassembling biological building blocks including plant genes enzymes and microbes but all of those substances have been in the human diet for centuries
