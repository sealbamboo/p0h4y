Appearances to the contrary actress Cameron Diaz wasnt always the picture of health A few months of kung fu training changed all that and now shes written a guide for women to make smart decisions about their bodies For Diaz The Body Book is about dispelling confusion and letting people know how things work from the eyebrows on down Two years ago I was  and having conversations with other women my age and they kept saying the same things about how they were confused about their bodies and how to get them to where they wanted to be I thought it was crazy that someone could live their whole life in their own body and not know how it works But its because were not taught Were not given good information I was tired of hearing about women hating their bodies and being forced to compare it to other women Such comparison is a brutal assault on ones self Its about basic education Diets dont work When youre being told what to do and what to eat and checking off a list that someone else created youre not really thinking about what you need to be doing for yourself Youre just following someone elses lead We should all be experts in our own bodies and how they function I want people to be happy and healthy and productive and you cant tell them how to do that They have to learn it themselves so it all comes back to giving them the basics of how the body functions and letting them figure it out from there I dont give a diet or fitness plan I want people to learn critical thinking to figure out their own plan Or to be able to look at another plan and understand what parts are right for them and how to adapt it to fit their own needs When I was growing up kids just played outside I rode my bike everywhere we played in the park and on the street  There wasnt a moment we were inside because there was nothing to do inside I also ran track and played softball Things are much different now because kids have too many distractions In my s I slowed down I smoked and ate terrible and didnt have any ambition to do anything with my body That changed with Charlies Angels because I had to put my body through something extreme that Id never done before It was eight hours a day seven days a week for three months of kung fu training for the role that changed everything  It was movie kung fu but I learned what my body was capable of I never looked back after that Im into everything I just like being active I hike and do Pilates and weight train Wherever I am I try to keep active I look at New York as an opportunity to walk around fast and get my sweat on Just going to the gym to get my blood going and staying connected to my body even if its only for  minutes is really important I like to build strong muscles which is especially important at my age so Ive done some pretty intense weightlifting to build muscle Its something that I moved into naturally just from trying different things I love lifting heavy because when you build strength in your body its a great feeling so youre compelled to keep up with it Its the type of carbs that matter Carbs fuel our bodys energy needs If youre going to be active then its a great source of fuel for that People can experiment and try different diets because we all vary but for people who exercise a lot I think carbs are a good fuel choice
