Drugs used to treat the flu really did save the lives of seriously ill people during the influenza pandemic of   in     suggests Adults who promptly received doses of     or related drugs were half as likely to die in the hospital as people who were not treated The study analyzed  different studies from  countries to reach this conclusion Why you might wonder is it news that a drug approved to treat the flu actually worked Well theres been a simmering controversy particularly in Britain over whether the billions of dollars spent on these drugs has been worthwhile Some independent scientists have   the governments conclusions about the value of these medicines  in particular they question whether the drugs actually prevent flu This latest study is about treatment not   Many governments have stockpiles of Tamiflu that are close to expiry But until now they had no adequate data to assist them in deciding if lives were saved in  or not and whether they should replenish or not said   from the University of Nottingham in a statement accompanying his new paper on the subject The study is another in a line that shows these drugs do indeed benefit people who get sick with the flu  at least adults Findings for children were not definitive The  epidemic a type of swine flu   from Mexico and throughout a world that initially had no vaccine effective against the strain Untold millions of people fell ill Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   that between  and  people died from that pandemic flu Unlike most strains of flu which are worst among people older than  this strain sickened primarily people younger than that People who ended up in the hospital were often treated with antiviral drugs called neuraminidase inhibitors including brandnames Tamiflu and Relenza NguyenVanTams study found that adults who were treated with the drug within two days of diagnosis reduced their risk of death by half compared with people who didnt get treated at all And promptness counts As expected early treatment seems to be optimal and treatment shouldnt be delayed by even one day to wait for diagnostic test results writes Alicia Fry of the CDC in an editorial accompanying the study She adds that there still might be some benefit to treating people after that especially if they are severely ill Children didnt benefit so clearly from treatment The study hinted that the drug reduced the risk of death among children but the effect was too weak to measure with confidence Still Dr Fry writes that its worth treating children because the potential benefits outweigh the drugs low risks The CDC says most flu viruses circulating this year can be treated with Tamiflu and related drugs though   of flu are resistant to these medicines The study was funded by Hoffman La Roche which owns Genentech the maker of Tamiflu Thats a sensitive point because other scientists have  to get data out of Roche in order to make an independent assessment of Tamiflu Anticipating raised eyebrows the paper says The funder of the study had no role in the study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report The funder has not and will never have access to the data
