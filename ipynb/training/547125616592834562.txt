If you are dealt a crummy hand you might find yourself playing the cancer card  even if other people object Ive come to believe that in certain cases I not only could but should play the C card Before my mother died I regularly needed to respond to an official document from the German government A notary public had to certify her existence so she would receive the reparations sent to many Jews forced to flee the Nazis Filling out the certificate  it was called the Lebensbescheinigung or proof of being alive  always tripped me into irrationally intense distress and not only because it reminded me of her displacement When two months after the funeral she was sent a proofofbeingalive form I threw it in the trash That was the first time I played the C card I had no wish to keep the money illicitly but somehow mailing a letter with a death certificate felt deeply repugnant At a later date I simply returned a check with a Postit recording her date of death Cancer served as my excuse for not responding properly The word Lebensbescheinigung reminds me that I am the one who given enervating cancer treatments sometimes needs to prove to myself that I am alive Although medical protocols exert enormous control over my existence the C card offers me a chance to exploit cancer for my own purposes I have played it quite a bit to not participate to not travel to not stay on the phone with my recriminatory aunt to not do or say or eat anything I dont want to do or say or eat to split infinitives I can relate to Melvilles Bartleby the scrivener I frequently prefer not to Many people living with cancer use it as a ticket to reform their lives for example by delegating stressful responsibilities It gives them permission to engage in productive enterprises like starting a walking regimen or volunteering for a patient advocacy group But if you have lost your prediagnosis occupations and your life is a gamble the C card can additionally serve as a license to disregard the consequences Why worry about your cholesterol or a savings account Why not go ahead and reserve a weekly table at the best ice cream parlor in your neighborhood or purchase exorbitant tickets for a monthlong cruise of Alaska while you can still enjoy it Instant gratification generally derided as shortsighted can make sense to cancer patients who may also exploit the sympathy elicited by the visible effects of treatment According to a memoir of the standup comedian   he and his wife were speeding to the hospital when a policeman stopped them Mr Schimmel imagined what the officer was thinking Damn This guy looks like followed by an expletive What if hes dying chemos his only hope and he misses his treatment because Im writing him a speeding ticket I might be costing him his life Do I want that on my head That could send me straight to hell Cancer lets Mr Schimmel off the hook it is the ultimate Get Out of Jail Free card For others the C card stands for carpe diem Whether you love flyfishing pedicures rock music photography Bora Bora playing with the dog drinking bowling or bowling while drinking after a cancer diagnosis you may finally find the time to follow your desires Mine are sedentary and luckily inexpensive reading writing cooking for my children and stepchildren when they come to stay visiting with friends trembling with my husband through college basketball games on television There are moments though that I hate a deck stacked with C cards When my friend Jo needed to travel to Indianapolis for a needle biopsy I realized that this would be the first time I could not support her through a medical event For some  years I had been the designated caretaker through every one of her operations But weakened by too many treatments I was in no shape to drive her to and from the hospital The night after Jo told me that she would have insisted that I not accompany her I had a brief dream In it the phone rang and it was Jo She said only my first name but her voice cracked I woke distressed The next day Jo responded to my account Sunt lacrimae rerum she said These are the tears of things That is one reason shes a wonderful friend Heres another Jo understands the source of my loathing of legal forms Throughout my mothers perilous passage from Nazi Germany to America she had been tormented by the need for certification the official seals on identity cards and work licenses the red tape of permits and passport applications the multiple copies of affidavits of sponsors Once here on paper in file cabinets then overflowing into piles stacked everywhere in her apartment but also thank goodness in person she finally established and relished abundant proof that she was fully alive The hand my mother had been dealt was far worse than mine
