A controversial new rule for updating generic drug labeling that the FDA was expected to finalize next month will not be published until the fall of 2015, an agency spokeswoman says. The rule, which the FDA proposed last year, would allow generic drug makers to independently update safety warnings, something that only brand-name drug makers can currently do before receiving FDA permission.. The agency proposed the rule in response to a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision that federal law does not permit generic drug makers to make such changes independently and, therefore, they should not be held accountable for a failure to warn against a risk. The contentious nature of the debate – generic drug makers fear litigation while consumer advocates say patient safety is at risk – is apparently the reason for the delay.
