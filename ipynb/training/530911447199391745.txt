The testes have been identified as the most distinct type of human tissue by the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden  The team have detailed which proteins are active in which tissues of the human body It shows the testes needed the most distinct suite of proteins to function   has been described as a really important foundation for scientific research that could help develop new drugs  Human DNA contains the instructions for building about  proteins  the little bits of biological machinery that run our body The combination of proteins active in a cell decides its function  a cell for filtering the blood in the kidney works differently to a neuron in the brain  Scientists have now pieced together which proteins function where and hope the findings could have important implications for medicine  Surprisingly for us there is altogether very little proteins which are enriched in the different parts of the human body and almost half of the  genes are coding for proteins which are expressed in all cells and tissues of the body Prof Mathias Uhlen the project leader said These are described as housekeeping proteins necessary to keep every cell functioning  But  proteins were significantly more active in testicular tissue than anywhere else in the body The cerebral cortex of the brain had  the liver  and smooth muscle zero Prof Uhlen told the BBC News website If youre interested in the brain or neurological disorders or even degenerative diseases like Alzheimers obviously it is interesting to know which proteins are elevated in the brain He speculated the testes were unique because of the complicated method of producing sperm which need to have half as much DNA as a normal cell  Also there are about  proteins which are targets for all the pharmaceutical drugs so you can say where are these targets located in the human body because that gives you indications about side effects The team used antibodies designed to latch on to different proteins  They then exposed  types of tissue  representing all the major organs and tissues in the body  to the antibodies to see which ones stuck and therefore which proteins were active The team aim to develop a pathology atlas that will show what goes wrong during disease and which proteins are involved Dr Ewan Birney the associate director of the EMBLEuropean Bioinformatics Institute said the project would complement the rapid advances in understanding DNA He told the BBC Its looking great  its going to be a really important foundational resource on top of the bedrock of the Human Genome Project It is going to accelerate both basic and clinical research Its much closer to the action than genomes About half of proteins were really headscratching about what they do now there are proteins we know exist we know they do something but now we know where to look He argued the testes had more distinctive proteins because of their focus on producing large numbers of sperm without any errors in their genetic code Mutations in a normal cell may eventually lead to cancer However a mutation in sperm could stop it being able to fertilise an egg he said Meanwhile the unique brain proteins may be down to a sheer logistics problem involved in operating really long nerve cells stretching across the brain he argued
