To maximize your chances of fighting flab new research offers some simple advice Wake up early and go outside People who loaded up on light exposure at the beginning of the day were most likely to have a lower body mass index according to a study published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE That   was independent of how many calories the study participants consumed It may sound crazy but there is sound scientific evidence to back up the link Circadian rhythm plays an important role in regulating metabolism and studies have shown that exposure to morning light can influence body fat and the hormones that regulate appetite In one study for instance sleepdeprived subjects whose levels of the hormones leptin and ghrelin were out of whack saw those levels improve after being  after waking up In another study obese women who were exposed to bright light for   between the hours of  am and  am dropped some of their body fat after three weeks And studies in animals have found that altering light exposure changed their metabolism resulting in weight gain even when the animals consumed the same amount of calories as before With all this in mind researchers at Northwestern Universitys Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago persuaded  volunteers to wear a wrist monitor that measured their light exposure including its timing and intensity as well as their sleep patterns The volunteers were also asked to keep a detailed log of everything they ate and drank during a sevenday period The volunteers whose average age was  tended to be night owls  on average they went to sleep at  am and woke up at  am Compared to Americans as a whole they were thin with  reporting a body mass index of  or lower When the researchers analyzed the data they found only one variable that correlated to BMI MLiT That stands for mean lightÂ  timing above threshold and its a measurement that takes into account the timing length and brightness of each volunteers light exposure Translating that into practical terms the researchers said the key was to bask in light of at least  lux and that such basking was most valuable when the exposure came early in the day For every hour that light exposure was delayed BMI rose by  points The complete mathematical model took into account demographic factors like age and gender the amount of sleep and exercise volunteers got and the season of the year But of all these variables MLiT did the best job of predicting a persons BMI When the researchers limited their analysis to BMI and light exposure between the hours of  am and noon they found no significant correlation This suggested that light exposure throughout the day helps regulate body weight the researchers wrote But theres clearly something special about morning light Theyre not sure what it is but one possibility is the fact that morning light contains more wavelengths in the blue portion of the spectrum Blue light has been shown to have the strongest effect on the circadian system the study authors wrote It shouldnt be too hard to   to  lux A typical office is about that bright If you go outside youll get more than  lux in full daylight and if its overcast youll still get more than  lux Though more study is needed of course the researchers concluded that light is a powerful biological signal and appropriate timing intensity and duration of exposure may represent a potentially modifiable risk factor for the prevention and management of obesity in modern societies The study was funded by grants from various branches of the National Institutes of Health    and like   on Facebook
