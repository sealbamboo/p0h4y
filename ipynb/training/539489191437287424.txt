As part of a recently announced reorganization, GlaxoSmithKline is planning to cut hundreds of jobs in the U.S., and an announcement by Dierdre Connelly, who heads North American operations, is expected on Dec. 3, according to Bloomberg News. Some layoffs would not be surprising, given that the drug maker noted in late October the reorganization would reduce expenses by about $1.6 billion over the next three years.. The reorganization come as Glaxo navigates a challenging stretch. In the U.S., which is its biggest market, sales have been declining – they fell 11% in the third quarter this year – amid increasing competition for respiratory treatments. Revenue generated by these  medicines – its biggest product category – fell 8% to roughly $2.2 billion, thanks largely to slumping sales of Advair, its best-selling treatment. Advair sales dropped 13% to $1.5 billion, reflecting, in part, price cuts brought about by tougher negotiations with insurers.
