his week it was reported that   with many staff leaving their jobs for something less stressful This doesnt surprise me In this job you get treated like a robot Your health and wellbeing is completely disregarded I always wanted to be a paramedic and the job has given me the skills to help people who are in need and to save lives No two days are the same One moment youre dealing with someone who has had a stroke the next with someone with a broken limb That part of the job is really satisfying But since the s when I started our call volume has risen drastically Before we used to do five or six jobs a day now we are doing  or  On our shifts five hours without a break is the norm and we usually go six to seven hours Basic things like going to the toilet are set aside as emergency calls obviously take priority The situation often feels unsafe because we arent eating properly our minds arent working properly and we become dehydrated We are so busy that I know crews who have been on the road for  hours without a break Just as we clear the job and hand the patient over to the hospital another one comes in Its becoming diabolical The workload far exceeds the number of staff we have Our rosters are currently being reviewed and resources reconsidered The service is cutting back at certain times like nights and weekends is not increasing the number of vehicles we have and is putting less qualified people on shifts to fill the gaps While private companies are hired in under contracts to do our work we are being cut back This makes us feel extremely worried about the people we serve Because of   cuts the public are being put in very dangerous situations sometimes we are stuck outside a hospital with a patient for instance because there are no beds available We are running on the bare minimum all the time There are times Ive considered leaving the profession like so many others But I love arriving on a call and knowing I can help someone the confidence that patients have in you is indescribable That sense of purpose is what makes me put my uniform on every day But I know many people who have left the profession because they are fed up of the way theyve been treated Statistics are hard to come by but discussions with colleagues lead me to believe that the suicide rate among people who work in the emergency services is going up This may be partly because people dont have the chance to debrief after difficult calls to discuss what exactly went wrong This is a job where you might see someone who has had a cardiac arrest and the drugs you give them dont work There is nothing you can do its that persons time to pass away You are then faced with the family of the deceased and you try to console them Then you finish that job pack your equipment back into the van and move on to the next job which could be say a woman in labour So you go in minutes from tending to a loss of life to responding to a birth And you know full well that if you do something wrong it could affect that child for the rest of their life Theres pressure on you from the previous job and pressure in the current job and because there arent enough of us those pressures build up During a shift if theres time you can sit down and talk with the person you are working alongside and discuss what happened on a call This is known as a debrief But if emergency calls are coming in thick and fast you dont have that option You might discuss a difficult callout when you finally get time at the end of the shift But often there just isnt time There is a number youre given which you can call if necessary but if its a bad job you dont want to speak to a random person for moral support After bad jobs debriefs used to be the norm but nowadays they dont happen unless you specifically request them Another problem is our eightminute target When a  call is classified as lifethreatening we have to get to the patient eight minutes after it is placed We are told that we have to achieve this at least  of the time but there is no clinical evidence to support this specific limit and what is defined as an emergency varies across the country This leads to the extraordinary situation in which our response to a call can be deemed a success even if the patient dies yet if we arrive in eight minutes and one second and save a persons life this is marked down as a failure The clinical outcomes of what we do seem to be irrelevant the focus is on targets not saving lives Im not saying targets are bad But what we need are clinically proven targets rather than timedriven targets that have no clinical relevance Ill health has caused some of the people I know to give up  whether its problems with mental health and depression or physical problems related to lifting elderly people who have fallen over We are saving lives How much are we worth
