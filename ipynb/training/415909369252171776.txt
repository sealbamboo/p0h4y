When it comes to the rising prevalence of Type  diabetes there are many factors to blame Diet and exercise sit somewhere at the top of the list But the genes that some of us inherit from Mom and Dad also help determine whether we develop the disease and how early it crops up Now an international team of scientists have identified mutations in a gene that suggests an explanation for why Latinos are almost twice as likely to develop Type  diabetes as Caucasians and AfricanAmericans But heres the kicker You have to go further back on the family tree than your parents to find whos to blame for this genetic link to diabetes Think thousands of generations ago Harvard geneticist   and his colleagues uncovered hints that humans picked up the diabetes mutations from   our ancient cousins who went extinct about  years ago As far as I know this is the first time a version of a gene from Neanderthal has been connected to a modernday disease Altshuler tells Shots He and his colleagues   the findings Wednesday in the journal   A few years ago geneticists at the   in Germany sent shock waves through the scientific community when they   the genome of a Neanderthal from a fossil Hidden in the genetic code were patterns that matched those in human DNA And the data strongly suggested that humans were more than just friendly neighbors with Neanderthal Now its well accepted that humans interbred with Neanderthals Altshuler says On average most of us carry about  percent of Neanderthal DNA in our genome So its not surprising he says that  percent of our traits would be inherited from the ancient primates The new data dont mean that Neanderthals had diabetes Altshuler is quick to point out It just happens that this disease sequence came from them he says To identify genes that contribute to Latinos high rate of Type  diabetes Altshuler and his team analyzed DNA from over  residents of Mexico and people who lived in Latin America These people had a mix of European and Native American ancestry The team found many genes already known to be involved with diabetes such as one related to insulin production But a new one also popped up in the analysis a gene thats likely involved in fat metabolism Mutations in this gene increase a persons risk of getting Type  diabetes by about a  percent Altshuler and the team found If the person has two copies of the mutations one from each parent the risk rises by about  percent So for Mexican Americans their   for Type  diabetes goes from about  percent to  percent if they inherit two copies of the mutations For other Americans the risk gets boosted to about  percent from  percent This is a genetic factor that has a modest affect on the risk of getting the disease Not everybody that has it will have the disease Altshuler says But the genes are very common in Latinos and Asians About half of Latinos carry the disease mutations while  percent of Asians have it On the other hand only  percent of European Americans carry the mutations So the new genetic data help to explain a big chunk  perhaps almost a quarter  of the difference in Type  diabetes prevalence in Latinos versus European Americans The findings are important because they give us a new biological clue about a gene involved in diabetes which could lead to more treatments Altshuler says The Neanderthal connection is interesting but its not the essence of the work
