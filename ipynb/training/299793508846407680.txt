 Good news for anyone who likes chocolate with their coffee A surprising new study from Tel Aviv University found that dieters who include a small dessert item as part of a   will lose more weight and keep it off in the long run better as compared to dieters who take a more traditional approach In the study published in the journal   researchers followed two groups of overweight or obese people for weeks with all participants instructed to stick to calorie diet for men and calorie diet for women The first group ate a lowcarb calorie breakfast daily while the second group had a calorie morning meal high in protein and carbohydrates and always including a dessert item such as   Halfway through the study both groups lost an average of  pounds per person But it wasnt until the second week period that things got really interesting At the end of the second weeks the lowcarb group actually    pounds per person but the group who was eating a larger breakfast with sweets lost an additional  pounds each All in all the chocolateeaters lost an average of  pounds more per person than the other peer group The thought is that cutting out sweets entirely  as the lowcarb group was supposed to do  creates a psychological addiction to those foods Allowing for a small piece of cake a cookie or some chocolate at the beginning of the day when the dieters metabolism is highest allowed dieters to feel like they werent deprived even when they stuck to a reducedcalorie diet So is it the larger calorie intake in the morning or the sweets that mattered most In the past research results on the benefits of larger breakfasts have been mixed A recent study published in   found that people eat the same amount at lunch and dinner regardless of what they have for breakfast suggesting that large breakfasts can actually add up to weight   These findings reinforce the idea that its not what you eat but how much that matters most for weight loss Similarly a   published last month in the   concluded that the strongest predictor for weight loss is how faithfully dieters stick to lowcalorie plans not the composition of their diets So what it comes down to is this If a slice of cake in the morning will help you feel less deprived and allow you to stick to your diet more faithfully for the rest of the day go for it Just stick to one slice and skip afterdinner dessert
