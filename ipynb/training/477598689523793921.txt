Heres a new beforemeal snack A little intense exercise might be a good plan for people trying to control their blood sugar Researchers call it exercise snacking and say that a brief burst of intense exercise is more effective than a moderate daily minute workout at reducing glucose concentrations in people who are insulin resistant The researchers work was published in May in the journal of the European Assn for the Study of Diabetes Sustained hyperglycemia following meals is an important feature of insulin resistance researcher Monique Francois of the University of Otago Dunedin New Zealand said in a statement Reducing these postmeal spikes is important for reducing the risk of developing Type  diabetes and its associated complications The scientists recruited two women and seven men ages  to  they all had blood tests showing insulin resistance none were taking diabetes or heart medication Their mean body mass index was  which is obese Type  diabetes was detected in two of the people during the screening Type  diabetes and insulin resistance are increasing worldwide and exercise and diet are inexpensive and effective ways to combat them the researchers said But they added fewer than  of Americans and  of British adults meet activity recommendations Many people cite a lack of time as the reason So these scientists tried a plan that even the busiest person could slip into the day The study participants took part in three exercise programs The meals and timing were controlled In one plan the person did  minutes of moderateintensity exercise before dinner walking up an incline That means the heart rate was at  of its maximum In the second the person did six oneminute bursts of incline walking at  of maximum heart rate  minutes before a meal And in the third the person did six oneminute efforts alternating resistance training and incline walking  minutes before meals In the second and third plans blood sugar was reduced  three hours after the meal compared with not exercising before breakfast and  compared with the daily halfhour workout The effect at lunch was unclear the researchers said Among physical activity advocates such bursts of exercise are called highintensity interval training It has the researchers said been shown to be an efficient way to improve blood glucose control in people with Type  diabetes and as a way to reduce risk factors for other chronic diseases
