Crowdsourced review sites like Yelp can be just the trick for finding a great restaurant or avoiding a bad one But when it comes to finding a good doctor there still arent enough reviews on sites that rank doctors to make them reliable a study of urologists ratings suggests Urologists averaged just  reviews on the big online doctor rating sites like Healthgradescom Vitalscom and RateMDscom The paltry number of participants means that one cranky patients complaint  or a rave from one doctors relative can skew a rating You can have an angry patient go on and ruin your reputation or you can have office staff go on and make you look like the best thing around says Chandy Ellimoottil a resident in urology at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood Ill His   was published online in   The  urologists surveyed averaged  reviews on  physicianranking websites with total reviews per doctor ranging from  to zero The reviews were overwhelmingly positive at  percent But the negative reviews focused more on things like office decor than whether the doctor delivered good health care But this study suggests that information from crowdsourced doctorranking sites should be taken with a grain of salt Ellimoottil says He became interested in the topic when he Googled a prominent surgeon for a research project He had a Healthgrades ranking that was  out of  The next one down was Vitals and it was  out of  The reviews were  degrees different Another   in early  in the  found some correlation between online ratings and quality of Virginia doctors Overall the ratings were positive Patients were most critical about punctuality and staff Still like the study of urologists ratings this one found ratings were often based on the experience of just a few patients about three on average People may have figured this out for themselves according to a survey coming out later this month from the Pew Internet Project Researchers there found that while  percent of Internet users say they research products or services online just  percent say they have used online reviews and rankings for providers of health care Threequarters of Americans say they look for health information online but surprisingly little research has been done on whether doctorranking sites are reliable One  study of Britains national hospitalranking site linked positive reviews with   Another   from the University of California Davis found that people who rated themselves most satisfied with their doctors had higher health costs and higher death rates That second study didnt look at online ratings Most doctors are listed in online rankings but the information there is indeed sparse Shots checked out Ellimoottil on Healthgrades The site gave   which makes sense given that hes not yet running his own practice It also listed him as a general surgeon rather than a urologistThats probably because urologists spend their internship year in general surgery It hasnt been updated since I first started practicing says Ellimootil whos in his fourth year of residency New sites aimed at solving the problems with crowdsourced doctor rankings have cropped up including a new   from   The group has crunched numbers from heartsurgery records to come with rankings of bypass surgery groups Medicare has started collecting data on physician performance but so far the governments   website is useful only for finding doctors who accept Medicare for payment That should change in the near future as performance data mandated by the Affordable Care Act comes online But for now patients may want to revert to preInternet traditions asking the family doctor or friends for recommendations A doctor might not have gone to a fancy medical school Ellimoottil notes but if theyre at your bedside and theyre caring for you theyre there when you need them and they give good advice theyre involved in shared decisionmaking those are the qualities you want
