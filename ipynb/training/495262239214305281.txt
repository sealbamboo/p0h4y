
 I was inspired to work on summer salsas this week not just because of the heat wave that had  begun to settle over Los Angeles but also by a recipe called Tropical C Burst It was created by the Los Angeles  students Jenifer Mendez and Kimberly Sanchez for a national high school   competition in Washington  Cooking Up Change is a national healthy cooking competition that challenges teams of students to create menus that meet the national nutrition standards and budgetary restraints for school lunches Mendez and Sanchez both from  Manual Arts High School beat out students from other  Los Angeles high schools for the chance to compete in Washington They placed second over all Mendez and Sanchezs recipe is served as a fruit cup and will be on the menu at Los Angeles schools during the next academic  year The reason it inspired me to make some fruit salsas is because they season their fruit with a little bit of chili powder and cayenne I love the juiciness and sweetness of fruit against heat and pungency so I decided to make some salsas with fruit and chiles I worked with watermelon and with pineapple this week as well as with mangoes  Tomatoes being everywhere right now I also worked on some salsas that didnt include fruit I played around with my salsa fresca introducing a surprising ingredient  diced kohlrabi  that worked  nicely And I grilled  tomatoes chiles and corn for a complex salsa that Ill be serving for the rest of the summer with tacos chicken and fish  A sweet fruity flavor and a mix of textures set this salsa apart It goes great with salmon or just about any other fish  Grilling tomatoes jalapeos and corn makes for a nice mix of flavors The sweetness of the corn contrasts well with the charred and picante flavors of the salsa  Kohlrabi with its crisp texture is a pleasant surprise diced into this tomato salsa It goes well with chips nachos tacos and quesadillas or with fish and chicken  A mangos rich flavor is deepened through grilling in this salsa full of contrasts It also works if you do not want to grill the mango  Sweet juicy watermelon and spicy chiles combine to create a surprising summer salsa with a kick It goes especially well with grilled fish
