When you completely adore a pet and the person whos attached to it you might willingly suffer a stuffed nose Or you both might cycle through many kinds of pets until you find one that lets you breathe  Bethany and Ronald Johansen of Merchantville New Jersey married for  years know this well  Both love dogs and each grew up with a canine companion  but Ronalds landed him in the hospital His childhood asthmatic reactions were so bad that he once spent two months in an oxygen tent he said The family didnt realize until later that his symptoms stemmed from their Irish setter Kelly Bethany Johansen gave up her own dog of  years for the sake of her husbands health when they married  a sacrifice upsetting to both of them although the dog stayed with her parents and Bethany visited her every day during work lunch breaks The couple lived without pets for several years but both wanted to expand the family with animals  Its been a journey with pets in this house trying to find one that I can actually live with without it closing my throat Ronald Johansen  said  There was a hamster a rabbit and a guinea pig  all nogoes for Ronald although the hamster still stayed with the family in a separate room A hedgehog left sharp quills around the house that would stick to the childrens feet  There were dogs such as a Shih Tzu and a poodle said to be hypoallergenic because they dont shed as much as other canines But different people are allergic to different dog proteins and   it doesnt seem that any particular breed is generally best for allergic people  Ronald Johansen hasnt done well with any of them Sometimes his throat itches within minutes of being around a dog   It has been frustrating his wife  said He sees that its something thats important to me Its important to him  Giving up the large poodle named Javier was particularly rough on the couples son Isaac who would sit next to the dog in the backseat of the car and go to baseball games with him  The family has found homes for other pets that havent worked out  Allergists such as Dr Clifford Bassett director of Allergy  Asthma Care of New York and ACAAI fellow understand the plight of the allergic petlover  There are several lifestyle modifications that can provide some relief he said Bassett recommends getting a HEPA highefficiency particulate absorption air filter which can suck up irritating particles from dogs and cats as well as a HEPAtype vacuum cleaner  Carpeting collects pet dander so linoleum wood tile are preferred on floors Otherwise frequent vacuuming dusting and other cleaning can help make a room more allergyfriendly  Designating the bedroom as petfree can also help Bassett said Of course that can be difficult for those of us who like to cuddle with our furry friends  To treat symptoms a doctor may prescribe antihistamines prescription nasal sprays and eye drops as well as inhalers for asthma Depending on the person and the circumstances managing oneself this way may be enough  A longerterm solution is allergy shots which can be effective in building up a tolerance to pets They are particularly helpful when avoidance and medications are not successful Bassett said But the shots are an investment  you need to get them for at least three years although improvement shows after about six months of weekly injections according to ACAAI  Ronald Johansen took allergy shots just to be able to have cats around but said his dog allergy is so bad that he couldnt tolerate that therapy How well people respond to this immunotherapy depends on how sensitive the person was initially and how well theyre able to avoid environmental triggers ACAAI said  I like to tell people well do the shots if avoidance is not appropriate or avoidance is not possible Bassett said  Some people with allergies and asthma have such bad reactions that they should really avoid the offending animal altogether experts say particularly children who have severe asthma attacks  The Johansens are still exploring the animal kingdom but for now they have a combination thats healthy for everyone Their current cast of characters Two cats a chinchilla and a parrot in addition to four human children  Jordon Goulder  of Oakland California can also relate  When she met her boyfriend Etai Rahmil he had a cat Dilla She thought she would be too sick if she spent a lot of time at his house and wasnt sure the relationship would work out because of her cat allergy  Fast forward fourandahalf years The couple lives in a small apartment in northern California with not just one but two shorthaired tabby cats Rahmil helps out by handling the litter box and taking care of a lot of the dusting and vacuuming that would be hard on Goulder She feels better now that the couple lives together and without roommates  Goulders symptoms  including wheezing itchy skin runny eyes and sneezing  depend on how much she plays with the cats and whether she lets them sleep on her pillow or under the blankets with her which she often does  Goulder takes two different allergy medicines in addition to two inhalers Doctors usually tell her to give up the cats but some are sympathetic to her love of animals I would never recommend this lifestyle to another person but I love my cats and I wouldnt change my life for anything she wrote in her iReport Goulder also has asthma which can be aggravated by colds and other environmental factors but cats make it worse Twice during the course of their relationship she has woken up in the middle of the night with an asthma attack and had to go to the emergency room  Rahmil often questions the situation  but Goulder has been firm  Its kind of confusing for both of us He approaches me in a worried way like Is this the right option for us  Goulder said Im pretty stubborn Im always going to say Yes were keeping them  As for the Johansens they are considering adding a pig to their mix but they havent given up hope of owning a dog again They dont want to make any promises to their children that they cant keep but they are planning to visit another breeder so Ronald can test out his symptoms around another dog A dog is part of the family he said Its something Im just used to having and my wife is used to having I guess thats why we try so hard to get a dog Its part of us
