Two weeks after delivering her daughter Cindy Kern realized something was very wrong The yearold began experiencing numbness in her limbs and had severe chest pain  My heart felt like a PingPong ball  it was going crazy speeding up and slowing down she remembers  Kern went to see a cardiologist in their new home state of Texas She didnt know what to expect for years doctors had shrugged off her symptoms  She was stunned to learn that her problems were caused by heart disease The new mother had a left ventricular   a congenital disorder that affects a small percentage of people With LVNC muscle fibers in the lower left chamber of the heart do not turn into solid muscle as they should during normal development Instead the fibers remain and interfere with the hearts function Kerns cardiologist suspected that she also had   an abnormal heart rhythm disorder that could potentially cause sudden cardiac arrest  The diagnosis sent her into a spiral of depression  I thought I was going to die she says She had already put on  pounds during pregnancy and was now being told she couldnt do anything active that would strain her heart  Life became a series of tests and checkups shuffling in and out of the hospital She had to get an implantable cardioverter defibrillator ICD implanted and was put on heart medication to regulate her lifethreatening arrhythmias  Eventually Kern started seeing a counselor to deal with the emotional pain  That first year with my daughter I couldnt enjoy her because I was having problems and I was sick she says As she tried to cope with her new reality she turned to food Over the next four years her weight ballooned Food inactivity and even her heart medicine caused her to put on weight And her growing waistline was not helping her self esteem She became so heavy she couldnt bear to step on the scale and refused to pose in photographs with friends  At the start of  she came across a weightloss challenge on a couponing website The challenge was between a group of strangers online who counted calories to lose weight It didnt seem like something that would strain her heart so Kern decided to join the groups challenge  I thought Id try losing weight with people online I figured if I fail its not as bad because I dont really know them she says  So she cut her food intake by  calories a day eating only  calories and religiously documented everything she put in her mouth  A chocolate lover she got rid of all candy from her house And she stopped eating after her daughter  Oh the French fries  my kid with her Happy Meals would drive me crazy she says I would eat half her meal because she couldnt finish it  But with calorie counting there was no room for extra food She weighed in at  pounds at the start of the challenge In six weeks she had dropped  pounds winning the weightloss competition It was a boost of confidence that motivated her to take control of her life She was determined to get to a healthy weight not only for herself but also for her daughter  My mom and grandfather both died in their forties because of this and they didnt know they had heart disease she said A lot of people have the same kind of thing I have Its like a totally different ball game when youre trying to lose weight She made counting calories a routine logging her intake on sites like   or on her mobile phone But she wanted to do more She wanted to be active but didnt know how She asked her cardiologist about light exercise he thought it would be a good idea to try So Kern strapped on her tennis shoes and put Cindy in a stroller and walked down the street That was as far as she would go The fear that her heart would act up made her turn around But those first few steps were just the beginning She slowly built the courage to walk a little further each day around her neighborhood paying close attention to her body  Soon she was able to jump on the elliptical for five minutes at a time building up her endurance You got to go slowly she says  Losing weight was gradual for Kern who is  It took her two years to reach her goal weight of  pounds on October  Kern who started a new job at a patient advocacy company now focuses on maintaining her weight She joined a gym to build muscle and goes every day She still lives with her heart condition but losing the weight has helped keep her heath in check  Some days I go to the gym and my heart isnt cooperating It feels like it is rattling around she says You never push yourself with this disease They tell you to push yourself at the gym but you have to listen to your body Kern currently takes only half her heart medication Her cardiologist attributes her improved health to her weight loss She says the entire process changed the way she views life  When I was diagnosed with heart disease I literally thought that my life was over she said But the huge weightloss proved to me I could still do what I set my mind to Life wasnt over it could be wonderful
