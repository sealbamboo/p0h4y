has pledged new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation and to recruit  new home care workers Meanwhile David Cameron has outlined plans to cut the benefits cap to pay for more apprenticeships The cap encouraged work he said In other political developments All of the major Westminster parties have pledged what they say is enough money to maintain NHS services in the next Parliament  The Conservatives say they would ringfence and protect the NHS budget while the Liberal Democrats have promised to meet in full the bn extra NHS managers say is needed by  while UKIP has said it would commit an extra bn a year to the service Labour has promised to keep the NHS ringfence and spend an extra bn a year across the UK by  The problem facing the NHS is clear for all to see  Over the last  years the focus has shifted from curing illness such as infectious diseases to managing longterm illnesses like dementia for which there are no cures That requires much more joinedup working in the community to keep people well particularly supporting them in their own homes To achieve that Labour is talking about resetting the NHS and creating joint budgets with Englands councils which are in charge of care services It has echoes of what has already been done in Northern Ireland and is being rolled out in Scotland But the challenge is that people pay for their care  many the whole bill How that system can be combined with the freeatthepointofneed NHS is a major challenge  In a speech in Trafford Greater Manchester Mr Miliband said David Cameron had totally betrayed promises made on the NHS before the last election and the countrys most precious institution faced its most perilous moment in a generation  David Cameron says he cares about the NHS but that is not enough What tuition fees is for Nick Clegg the NHS has become for David Cameron It has become a question of trust Under a Labour government Mr Miliband said  extra home care workers would be recruited to treat terminally ill people in their own beds and social care workers would be helped to spend more than  minutes on home visits Limiting visits to  minutes was a symbol of what has gone wrong in the NHS where failure and false economies threaten the financial future of the service he said Promising to tackle what he said was an iron curtain between social and clinical care he said care workers often had to choose between preparing a meal for people they were visiting or taking them to the toilet because of time constraints We have got to join up services at every stage for home to hospital so people can get the care they need when they need it he said  This was not a tough crowd for Ed Miliband He spoke about creeping privatisation in the NHS as he outlined Labours year plan to rescue as he put it a precious health service Then he went further He appeared to attack privatisation overall  He said legislation under the coalition made the model for NHS reform the privatisation of utilities in the s saying we kind of know where that got us dont we He may have meant the electricity providers firms that he has repeatedly attacked but he wasnt specific So he appeared to be condemning whats happened at British Airways British Telecom and a host of others firms  And for the record he told me he doesnt use private healthcare and has never used private healthcare  The party which has already announced plans to recruit  more nurses and provide cancer tests and results within a week is putting the NHS at the heart of its campaign  But Mr Cameron attacked Labours record of running the health service in Wales saying waiting lists had gone up and problems at AE had multiplied I think we need to look at Labours record rather than its rhetoric he said  Im satisfied that we are putting the money into the NHS Yes we need to do better on AE but lets not forget that we have almost abolished mixedsex wards hospitalacquired infections are down by more than half we are treating something like six million more outpatients every year And former Labour health secretary Alan Milburn has questioned the oppositions focus on the NHS as a comfort zone campaign and warned the party is illprepared to carry out the necessary reforms to the NHS if elected  Labour is not a conservative party Labour should be about moving things forward not preserving them in aspic he told Radio s World at One programme  UKIP deputy chair Suzanne Evans said the NHS was creaking at the seams and needed a serious injection of cash to help sort out the mess both Labour and the Tories have got it into Mr Cameron has focused on the economy promising a law to reduce the annual household welfare cap to  from the current  in the first week of a Conservative government  that reforming the welfare system was the best way to tackle poverty and spread advantage  He said The criticism of our benefit cap which was set at  in many parts of the country was that it was too high  So we think that reducing it to  will help to get more families back into work and well use the savings from that money to make sure we train three million apprentices in the next Parliament After launching an online advertisement attacking both the Conservatives and Labour Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said Britain needs a liberal voice in government You have got the Conservatives haring off to the right now saying they are going to cut cut cut way beyond whats necessary youve got Labour saying they are going to borrow more money than is necessary he said The Lib Dems will cut less than the Conservatives and borrow less than Labour because thats the way you create a stronger economy and a fairer society
