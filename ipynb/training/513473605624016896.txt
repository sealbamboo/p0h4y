Families and communities have been devastated by the deaths caused by West Africas Ebola outbreak But the disease also has consequences for the regions way of life and in particular their traditional greetings One of the things the people of West Africa are very good at is greeting each other In most of the regions countries it would be positively rude to exchange a passing Britishstyle Hello how are you and walk on In West Africa the normal thing to do would be to stop reach out one hand or even two shake warmly and then embrace  This is followed by much backslapping more handshaking on points of agreement and even the odd high five  Its what children do its what men do its what elderly ladies do Well not any more Ebola is spread by contact with bodily fluids so these days people shun contact with others  including handshakes Of course the worst impact of this disease has been on those who have contracted it and their loved ones But the end of shaking hands has affected everyone everywhere in the region  The country thats been worst affected by Ebola  with the most deaths  is Liberia  After    to oversee the building of new treatment centres and help train medical staff in the country Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf broadcasted a Thankyou speech to the US She also told Liberians Ebola will not defeat us President Johnson Sirleaf had earlier said the disease was damaging Liberians way of life One thing she was surely referring to was the unusual Liberian handshake  Its been called the Liberian finger snap If that sounds painful it isnt But it is rather tricky to master  The finger snap involves clasping hands in the normal way But then  as the hands are released  each partner clicks the fingers of the other This produces two loud snapping sounds Its something of a point of honour to make the pair of snaps as strong  and therefore as loud  as possible The louder the snaps the greater the friendship But not any more  Ive visited Liberia many times and I find it impossible to imagine the country without a soundscape of finger snaps If I as a foreigner feel that way I cant begin to imagine how odd the lack of handshaking must feel for a Liberian  Its the same across the whole region In Frenchspeaking parts of West Africa the traditional greeting of three kisses on the cheek has stopped too Its as if this terrible disease not content with killing thousands of people wants to rip the beating heart out of a naturally friendly and communallyminded population Something similarly shocking is taking place this weekend in Liberias neighbour Sierra Leone It is being devastated by Ebola too with hospitals overflowing and food prices rising  In an effort to stop the spread of the disease the authorities ordered a nationwide   Everyone is supposed to stay in their homes while health workers mount a nationwide doortodoor check to seek out anyone infected  The operation is fraught with difficulties and dangers In the first place its far from clear if Sierra Leone has enough qualified health professionals to visit every house and hut in the land Or what will they do if they find potential patients  the treatment centres are already full to overflowing The Sierra Leone government says the desperate situation requires desperate measures But even if the lockdown works its another example of Ebola changing a countrys very way of life   Most of its population are very poor Many work as street traders or day labourers Very few people have large stocks of food in their cupboards and only a minority have luxuries like fridges So they simply have to go out every day to work and shop  otherwise their family will not get fed   Of course those worst affected by Ebola are the sick the dying and their families But everyone is being touched in other terribly important parts of their lives however seemingly mundane  from the simple handshake to doing the shopping The president of Liberia said in her speech We are fighting against Ebola We will win  If and when this happens one of the most precious things West Africans get back will be the ability to shake hands again  Saturdays at    or   Short editions MondayFriday  see World Service
