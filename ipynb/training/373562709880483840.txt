I thought about the boring selfabsorption of illness during a queasy day after eating a breakfast of smoked salmon leftovers from a party for outoftown visitors  What can a sick man say but that he is sick Samuel Johnson asked back in the th century  His thoughts are necessarily concentrated in himself he neither receives nor can give delight his inquiries are after alleviations of pain  I hoped an afternoon appointment to advise a graduate student would take my mind off cramps in my abdomen In the car driving to the office Im clammy and then freezing even though it is warm outside To the jubilation of family and friends the experimental drug I have been taking in a cancer clinical trial has been working But starting to shiver I begin to wonder if the daily pills have damaged my kidneys or bladder The thought brings waves of nausea and I realize that no way could I discuss a dissertationinprogress  So I drive back home cancel the appointment with the graduate student and email the nurseadministrator who regularly tests my urine and blood for the deleterious effects of my drug regimen Lets investigate further she responds Can you have labs done either today or tomorrow  Shaking and throbbing all over I write back that Im too sick to go to the hospital   Theres no fever but my bones ache horribly especially those in my lower back Even though my husband keeps on mentioning stomach flu give me a break  I know whats really going on Dizzy I fall off the terrible cliff of fear down into the abysmal forest of fright  My frozen appendages and hotcold chills pale in comparison to the intense back pain Obviously the cancer has returned Cant lower back pain be caused by kidney cancer Worse maybe it has metastasized to the bones Wrenched in heaves of anguish I understand why many patients call cancer The Beast It cannot be tamed or hunted down it hides lurks and then stalks It had been hibernating but now it has pounced Since I cannot sit or stand up I lie down under a quilt with a heating pad With my husband off for Gatorade I have an opportunity to learn how to deal with the eventual pain of dying from cancer I start breathing slowly and a mantra surfaces to steady me  Everything passes away This pain will pass away I will pass away  Somewhat quieted I then experience that horrible excess of saliva that tells you or at least it tells me that Im going to heave Running to the toilet I throw up three or four times After my husbands return I make for the blue couch quilt and heating pad in tow to moan through the evening news As I doze off and on the dazzling resources of the English language eclipse the scene in the bathroom vomiting barfing retching expelling upchucking puking disgorging gagging hurling spewing losing your lunch   By  pm Im fine It must have been the flu The next day I started to reflect on the paranoia of cancer patients Acne It must be skin cancer Tongue blister Cancer of the tongue Rib ache Cancer in the ribs Chest cough Cancer in the lungs   My condition brings to mind the old joke about the psychiatric patient who declared before dying Of course Im paranoid Something out there is trying to kill me    Add to pounds of paranoia a dollop of the solipsism of sickness The tunnel vision of cancer focuses me obsessively on myself Perhaps as Samuel Johnson intuited all diseases bring egotism in their wake For people in distress find it hard to think of anything else During remission and maintenance though cancer patients often dont feel sick And when we do we frequently experience only the inconsequential aches and pains of daily life Yet every twinge gets magnified into a nightmarish anticipation and vision of The Beasts return   Sipping the Gatorade I want to defy The Beast as long as possible by breaking the stranglehold of paranoia and solipsism so I can receive and give delight I determine to seek out new ways to banish myself from myself  not an easy task but a necessary one At the least I should continue to invent methods to expel cancer from the center of my consciousness  or else whats treatment for   One week later I received a recorded phone call from a local supermarket saying that the leftover smoked salmon I had eaten for breakfast the day of my illness had been recalled I cringed while considering the party at which I apparently had given myself a brief recess from selfabsorption and my guests a nasty dose of food poisoning
