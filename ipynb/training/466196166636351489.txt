The chief executive of AstraZeneca has warned that new drug development could be hit if it were taken over by Pfizer Pascal Soriot told MPs that a takeover would create huge disruption and distraction as scientists worried about their futures rather than development However Business Secretary Vince Cable later told the Business Committee that blocking a bid could be tricky The committee is taking evidence on the proposed takeover amid worries about the damage it could do to UK interests Earlier Pfizers chief Ian Read told the MPs that his company was not a ruthless costcutter and said the drugmaker acted with integrity  He repeated assurances that Pfizer would protect jobs and investment but admitted that a merger would mean a reduction in the combined companies spending on research and development Even though no formal offer from USbased Pfizer has been tabled the proposed bnplus takeover has generated huge controversy The Commons Science Committee will hold its own hearing on Wednesday Mr Soriot told the Business Committee that the uncertainty created by a takeover could undermine some of AstraZenecas work  Any distractions on work we are doing now could run the risk of delaying our drugs pipeline he said From the lab to the patient takes many years What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed because our companies were involved in saving taxes or saving costs It is logical to assume that a merger like this could mean substantial cost savings and cost savings could mean job losses he said Mr Soriot said the redomiciling of the newlymerged company to the UK  which Pfizer has said would still see its headquarters remain in New York  would cause substantial controversy likely to result in delays However he said that it would be the board of Astras duty to consider a formal offer from Pfizer despite rebuffing the US drugmakers approaches so far Its impossible to say we would never accept any offer he told a committee We are very well aware of our fiduciary duty However despite demands that the government should either block the bid or secure legal guarantees on jobs and investment Mr Cable told the committee that intervention was tricky The UK has public interest laws governing certain takeovers such as those involving defence and media interests but not for science Mr Cable said The framework which we have under the act as you know confines the public interest test quite narrowly and of course all of that takes place within the framework of European merger law The business secretary refused to be drawn on the precise legal and financial mechanisms that could make Pfizers assurances binding He said he would rather not expose the governments thinking on that in too much detail But he accepted that the government faced a dilemma between being open to the benefits of foreign investment and protecting wider national interests In response Labours shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said he was still to be convinced that an acquisition would be good for the UK I think what we heard at the hearing today reinforces the grave concerns we have about this deal and confirms many of the worst fears of many in the business and science community in the UK he said What do we know Pfizer confirmed that they will be cutting jobs theyve confirmed that there will be a cut in the spending of the combined merged entity theyve confirmed that the business AstraZeneca will be split up and they havent ruled out selling off parts of it in the future And he pointed to AstraZenecas assertion that the distraction of any deal could potentially inhibit the production of lifesaving drugs But business body the Institute of Directors said we should be alive to the consequences of mounting a British Inquisition for those who wish to do business in what is supposed to be an open economy If our politicians really want to whip up a storm around this issue theyd be better off scrutinising the role of institutional investors in the whole process added the bodys director general Simon Walker In particular the asset managers and asset owners that control so many of AstraZenecas shares  Earlier Mr Read mounted a strong defence of Pfizers record rejecting complaints that it had a poor track record on maintaining jobs and investments both in the UK and elsewhere Adrian Bailey chairman of the Business Committee asked Mr Read to respond to claims that Pfizer was like a praying mantis and a shark that needs feeding Mr Read said he was very proud of his  years at the firm describing it as a company of high integrity focused on patients and delivering drugs to patients He said he was not concerned about an attack on the company by Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt who referred to negative experiences after Pfizer took over Pharmacia  Mr Read said the comments were based on a misunderstanding of the facts over strategy and a promise to build a factory only if a product got regulatory approval Having set the facts right Im not concerned by the comments he said He added that a merged PfizerAstra would mean research expenditure would be lower than that of the two separate companies This he said was because one of the drivers of the proposed deal was to increase efficiency in order to keep both firms competitive in an increasingly tough marketplace Our commitment is to base  of our global research and development in the UK he said But without more due diligence on AstraZenecas books I cant tell you today how many people we are going to have in RD he added But the final jobs number would be substantial Mr Read promised I have not seen AstraZenecas books Some things are sightunseen But the numbers will be substantial We are a highly ethical company Pfizer is a company that keeps its promises Committee member Mike Crockart asked why the UK Government should support a Pfizer bid when you have a reputation of being ruthless costcutters and that seems to be borne out by what you have said today Mr Read replied that the takeover was an opportunity to domicile the largest pharmaceutical company in the world to bring the strength of the combined portfolios and to bring our financial strength into the UK and globally I think it will strengthen the scientific base in the UK a company our size making these sorts of commitments Before the committee hearing the President of the Royal Society Prof Sir Paul Nurse told the BBC that Pfizers fiveyear commitment to maintain research and jobs was vague and insufficient  Sir Paul who has submitted written evidence to the committee said Research is a longterm business I have researched for  years of my life I know that five years is not long enough term to be committed to They need to look at a year horizon at least if they are actually going to make an important impact on this area and produce the medicines that will help people On Tuesday Pfizer turned up the pressure on AstraZeneca by outlining its takeover proposals to Astras shareholders Pfizer laid out the strong strategic rationale of the bn takeover plan Astra responded by calling Pfizers takeover plan an opportunistic attempt to buy the company for a price that did not reflect the value of its exciting pipeline of new drugs Any deal would be the largest foreign takeover of a UK firm to date but the proposal has revived memories of when US food giant Kraft abandoned jobs pledges after it bought Cadbury
