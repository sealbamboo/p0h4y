A pioneering breast cancer treatment that replaces weeks of radiotherapy with a single targeted shot is set to be offered on the NHS The dose of radiation is delivered from inside the breast once a tumour has been removed in surgery  It would benefit up to  people and should also save the NHS money   from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE said it would improve patients quality of life The technique called intraoperative radiation is suitable only for patients who have caught their cancer early Currently those patients would have surgery to remove the tumour They would then face at least another  trips to hospital for radiotherapy to kill any remaining cancerous cells Intraoperative radiation is performed during surgery  Once the tumour is removed a probe is inserted into the breast and delivers radiation to the exact site of the cancer for about half an hour   suggest the technique has a similar level of effectiveness as conventional radiotherapy However as the technique has been developed recently there is no longterm data available As well as avoiding the inconvenience of regular hospital trips the single dose should avoid potential damage to organs such as the heart lung and oesophagus  which is a risk during radiation to the whole breast  NICE said the pros and cons should be made clear to patients  Prof Carole Longson director of health technology evaluation at NICE said Because it is still relatively new it is only right to recommend its use in a carefully controlled way  This will ensure patients are fully aware of the risks and benefits before choosing which treatment to have and allow doctors to gather more information about the treatment A typical radiotherapy department will spend around  of its time dealing with breast cancer  Previous estimates have suggested a shift to intraoperative radiation could free up resources and save the NHS m a year  But the equipment is expensive to start with  each probe would cost about  Prof Jeffrey Tobias who has pioneered the technique at University College London Hospitals told the BBCWere lagging behind were out of step its a great pity In Germany there are  centres capable of doing this in the UK there are six  So for us this is fantastic news because it will stimulate the uptake of something that started here  If approved the guidelines would be introduced in England towards the end of the year Wales and Northern Ireland tend to follow NICE guidelines at a later date while Scotland considers treatments separately Breakthrough Breast Cancer senior policy officer Sally Greenbrook said patients who needed radiotherapy were travelling to and from hospital every day five days a week for three weeks Thats hugely inconvenient  its disruptive to their lives its disruptive to their families lives she told the BBC This the new treatment means they can get on with rest of their treatment much quicker they can get on with the rest of their lives much quicker Emma Greenwood Cancer Research UKs head of policy said This could be good news for breast cancer patients  Giving radiotherapy in a single dose at the time of surgery potentially offers a huge benefit especially if it means fewer visits to hospital Its essential that those who receive this radiotherapy are followed up for a long period of time to ensure the single dose is as at least as effective as the standard treatment  Radiotherapy is already a very effective treatment and this technique could offer another valuable option for treating early breast cancer
