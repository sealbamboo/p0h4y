Hoping to reduce unnecessary antibiotics use the   on Monday issued new guidelines for how doctors should diagnose and treat ear infections Every year millions of parents take their children to the pediatrician for ear infections and most of them end up going home with antibiotics In fact ear infections are one of the most common reasons kids see doctors and the leading reason kids get antibiotics Parents if their child is up all night screaming and tugging the ear they want something to make the child feel better says   of the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center who helped write the   But about  percent of children get better on their own within two or three days and about  percent are better within a week to  days he says And he says there are some real downsides to using antibiotics when theyre not necessary They can cause upset stomachs allergic reactions and other problems And they can contribute to the development of superbugs  infections that are getting harder and harder to cure The bacteria that do survive the antibiotic get tough and next time you get an ear infection or any other type of infection theyre harder to manage Rosenfeld says The first thing the new guidelines say is Make sure the child really has an ear infection There are dozens of reasons an ear can hurt Rosenfeld says In this guideline we say Listen if youre not sure of the diagnosis dont even think about giving an antibiotic Please dont even think about it  The only way to know for sure is to take a close look at the eardrum and see if it is clearly bulging If its pushed outward  looks like it wants to pop  that is a very very accurate sign of an ear infection Rosenfeld says But even kids who really do have ear infections dont necessarily need antibiotics The guidelines say doctors have the option of just watching kids who dont have intense pain a high fever or other symptoms of a severe infection You dont have to freak out as a parent Ear infections tend to go away on their own quite often with just some pain medicine Rosenfeld says But there are some kids who definitely should get antibiotics such as those ages  months to  years who have infections in both ears or any child who has severe symptoms such as severe pain for several days and a fever of at least  degrees Any child who has a ruptured eardrum should also get antibiotics according to the guidelines If you have a severe infection no point discussing it further Those children are going to get antibiotics And the reason is theyll get the most benefit Rosenfeld says Other experts praised the guidelines But some worry they might make some doctors a little too hesitant to use antibiotics When the diagnosis is correct then antibiotic treatment is never wrong says   of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison Kids tend to recover more often and they recover more quickly if theyre treated appropriately with antibiotics Thats especially important for working parents Wald notes We live in a society where there is so much pressure for both parents to be working outside the home and its just complicated when our child is sick Besides which theres always parental anxiety and concern when their child is sick she says Rosenfeld stresses that doctors are free to figure out the best way to treat each child In many cases they can give parents a safety net or wait and see prescription and say Hold on to this antibiotic Give some pain medicine the first day or two And if theyre not better after two days then we do want you to let us know and start the antibiotic Rosenfeld says But if they are better just throw it out and theyll do fine The new guidelines also recommend ways parents can protect their kids from ear infections in the first place such as by breastfeeding and keeping kids away from cigarette smoke
