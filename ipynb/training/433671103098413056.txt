A Pennsylvania county judge has thrown out an assisted suicide case against a yearold nurse named Barbara Mancini who was accused of homicide last year for allegedly handing her yearold father a bottle of morphine The   is the latest in a series of   signaling a reluctance of courts and state legislatures to criminalize medical care that may hasten death Assisting in suicide is illegal in all but five states  Oregon Washington Montana Vermont and New Mexico Legal experts say Mancinis prosecution for allegedly assisting a suicide isnt unique but such cases are increasingly rare  a sign that attitudes about endoflife decisions are changing whatever most statutes say Pennsylvania   against Mancini last summer based on circumstances surrounding her fathers death in February  Joseph Yourshaw the father was a home hospice patient in failing health When a hospice nurse checked on him and found him unresponsive the hospice called  and had an ambulance take him to the hospital against the wishes of his family He was revived then died four days later Mancini was later charged with assisting his suicide by providing him with a lethal dose of morphine This case demonstrates that the government has no business interfering in families endoflife decisions Mickey MacIntyre of the advocacy group   said in a   This prosecution could have chilled endoflife decisions and pain care for millions of future terminally ill patients who simply want to die at home peacefully and with dignity In a scathing page opinion Judge Jacqueline Russell wrote that Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane didnt establish that Mancini had committed a crime  that she intended to help her ailing father commit suicide rather than simply to alleviate his pain An accused cannot be found to have aided and then caused a third person to attempt suicide without competent proof that an attempted suicide had indeed occurred Russell wrote She said the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relied on speculation and guess to support its prosecution of Mancini A jury may not receive a case where it must rely on conjecture to reach a verdict the judge wrote Russell said the commonwealths case appears to have been based on little independent investigation significant hearsay  including double hearsay received from third persons  speculation guess and Mancinis incriminating statements According to a hospice nurse and a police officer who talked to Mancini on Feb   she said she had given him an entire vial of morphine to end his life He had previously told family members and hospice workers that he wished to die Mancini doesnt deny giving him the morphine bottle but she denied that she intended to help him commit suicide and said she wanted only to relieve his pain The judge said that in pretrial proceedings last August prosecutors never established how much morphine Yourshaw took whether the amount was potentially lethal and whether Mancini knew he had taken enough to cause death Nor did the evidence indicate whether she actively participated in Mr Yourshaws actual ingestion of the morphine Rather  Mr Yourshaw was competent strongwilled ambulatory capable of retrieving and opening his bottle of medicine and consuming its contents Prosecutors said Mancinis plea to hospice personnel not to transport her father to the hospital and rescue him from an overdose with a morphine antidote was evidence of her criminal intent to help him die The judge rejected that argument Mr Yourshaw was in the endstage of his life he wanted to die at home and he did not want to be resuscitated when the time came that he was to die she wrote His daughter knew as did hospice personnel that it would be contrary to Mr Yourshaws wishes if he were taken to the hospital when in the final moments of his life In light of the evidence the Commonwealth produced and failed to produce Defendants conduct in not seeking emergency intervention under the circumstances cannot be deemed  a criminal act A county coroner ruled that Yourshaw died from a morphine overdose Mancinis lawyers challenged that conclusion saying that his death four days after he was taken to the hospital and resuscitated couldnt be blamed on the morphine dose he took at home The judge didnt address that issue since she ruled that prosecutors never established that a crime had occurred in the first place Anthony Forray a deputy attorney general who prosecuted the case   the evidence against Mancini in a pretrial hearing as overwhelming He contended that she pressured hospice personnel to prescribe the morphine and handed him a full bottle with a day supply knowing that it would kill him if he took it A spokesman for Attorney General Kane said Tuesday afternoon that his office had not reviewed Russells opinion and wanted to review it before making a comment Compassion and Choices which has supported Mancini and publicized the case nationally is urging Kane not to appeal its dismissal
