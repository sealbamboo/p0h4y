What about college students After all theyre the most   of digital technology and   sites Will their increased maturity and experience keep them safe Not so much according to a   from the University of Washington Questioning  girls enrolled in four colleges researchers found collegeage females just as likely to suffer the negative effects of cyberbullying as younger adolescents Thats a jump off the page said study coauthor Dr Megan Moreno This is the type of bullying that is going beyond those childhood and adolescent years and into young adulthood The study found college girls who reported being cyberbullied were three times more likely to meet clinical criteria for depression And if the cyberbullying was connected to unwanted sexual advances the odds of depression doubled A sixfold increase in the odds for depression when there was fallout from unwanted sexual advances or fallout from a romantic relationship was very striking said Moreno These are not innocuous actions These are actions that really can trigger depression and really can lead to damage to the people who are involved   A    about online harassment by the Pew Research Center found  of  yearoldwomen say theyve been stalked online while  say they were the target of online sexual harassment Some people have hypothesized that cyberbullying in that context  unwanted sexual advances  really starts to look like it should be on the spectrum of sexual violence rather than bullying said Moreno Cyberbullies suffer too Girls who bully have a four times higher risk for depression than those who dont The study also found theyre also more likely to have a drinking problem For problem alcohol abuse it was really the bullies that struggled and not the victims said Moreno  The study didnt take a look at other mental health impacts such as suicidal thoughts Moreno says that was deliberate  Those cases are so extreme  and they are so horrible  but at the same time what we were hearing from girls in our studies is this is something that is happening all the time to a lot of us and we want to know what else can happen said Moreno  If we dont kill ourselves are we at risk for something else is a frequent question Moreno hears Is there something else bad that happens to me as a victim or does something bad happen to that bully thats been picking on me  Girls who experience cyberbullying are encouraged to get help by visiting their college clinic to talk about their experience their growing feelings of depression or their substance abuse  There are potential health impacts says Moreno This should be in the public health arena Girls should not feel like they cant go to clinic and talk about their feelings Atlanta advocate Helen Ho agrees Shes the founding director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice and spends a good deal of her time on cyberbullying issues   shows Asian Americans are digitally bullied at least four times as often as other ethnicities One of the frustrating things about being an advocate against cyberbullying says Ho is that a lot of people dont realize how intense cyberbullying can be in this kind of hightechnology age and the physical as well as mental impact it can have For many of us who are adults and didnt grow up with online access we can see that distinction between online and offline very clearly adds Moreno But for youth there isnt a distinction We used to say either online or real world and youth say No no you dont get it online IS my real world
