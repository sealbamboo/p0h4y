Ten critical gaps in knowledge about the development of breast cancer must be addressed say leading experts Finding out how breast cancer spreads and evades therapy is a key concern they report in   Plugging the gaps in research would lead to improved clinical care for patients within five years their review of evidence suggests Projections suggest  UK lives will be lost by  at current progress rates say cancer charities In their review of recent progress in research more than  scientists doctors and healthcare professionals looked at how limitations in knowledge of breast cancer are affecting the setting of priorities for the future  They identified  key gaps that need be plugged Prof Alistair Thompson of the University of Dundee coauthor of the analysis said advances in science had transformed knowledge of breast cancers over the past four or five years  Were beginning to understand some of the greater complexities of what were having to deal with and unpick some of the mechanisms by which cancer cells work divide and spread he said Prof Thompson said the most important gap in research was to find out how cancer progresses  One real advantage to patients with breast cancer that had spread was to take a biopsy of the secondary tumour to see how much it had changed he said This would enable treatment to be better targeted in one in six women which could transform care he said Prof Sue Eccles of the Institute of Cancer Research coauthor of the analysis said it was also important to focus on prevention We need to understand more about preventing breast cancer in the first place and how women particularly those of high risk can be best informed about the lifestyle changes they might make or interventions available to them to reduce their risk For people unfortunate enough to suffer from breast cancer we need to find better ways of diagnosing it earlier and following it through from screening or imaging And finally we have to provide practical and effective support for all of those affected by breast cancer Baroness Delyth Morgan chief executive of the charity Breast Cancer Campaign said funding for breast cancer research had fallen in recent years Time is pressing she said  If we look at the impact of doing nothing of not moving forward then by  well have more than  million women living with breast cancer and between now and then we will lose around  lives and thats what were up against if we do nothing Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK with about  women diagnosed each year It is the second biggest cause of death from cancer in women with about  losing their lives from the disease
