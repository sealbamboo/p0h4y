Maybe Ive got too many election results on my brain But the Pew Research Centers   about how people are using their mobile phones to get health information sent me to the data from the exit polls Really Why The bottom line of the Pew report is that cellphone owners who are Latino African American between the ages of  or hold a college degree are also more likely to gather health information than other people on their mobile phones Pew says the various factors are independent so its not just that young people are more likely to have a smartphone for instance Each factor can amplify in Pews words the likelihood that people will use their phones to get health information As you might expect smartphone owners are even more likely to access health info with their devices than regular old cellphone owners are When it comes to health apps on smartphones women were more likely to use them than men The Pew survey of more than  people was done in August and early September Now lets review the profile of voters who went for President Obama in a big way according   He dominated among AfricanAmericans Latinos and Asians No Pew breakout for Asians Female voters also preferred Obama The president cleaned up among younger people getting  percent of votes cast by those ages  to  and a majority of votes from those  to  Romney claimed a majority among people  and up Among people with at least a college degree Obama got half the voters just a tad more than the  percent that went for Romney And as youd probably expect voters who thought health was the most important issue facing the country overwhelmingly went for Obama Lets be clear Im no   These are impressions not scientific comparisons Still it seemed to me there was enough demographic overlap to suggest that quite a few Obama supporters were probably punching away at their phones for health info while waiting in line to vote
