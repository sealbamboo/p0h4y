The Labour party has launched its pivotal election pledge on the   promising  more staff and the repeal of privatisation laws It also promises to make progress in achieving a single wholeperson care service with a focus on care within the home rather than in hospital and to end the culture of minute visits by care workers by recruiting an extra  and changing the incentive structure Labour said the number of days that patients were left in hospital because they could not be discharged was at a record high in the past year more than  million bed days were lost adding m to the NHS bill Given the current financial uncertainty however it is difficult to predict whether the country will be able to afford the suggested changes Here is a selection of views from the healthcare sector To share your thoughts tweet   or write in the comments section below  Although Labours announcement today seems appealing there needs to be more detail on how the proposals would be implemented and funded What has been set out would aim to end a historic divide between the NHS and social care systems However there would be significant challenges first in blending one system that is free at the point of use with another that is subject to meanstesting and second in yet another upheaval to administrative structures in the NHS which distracts from the issue of real reform in care to patients especially given the financial squeeze No more structural reorganisation should be the first element of any partys policy on the NHS Andy Burnham has set out an ambitious and wideranging vision for the NHS and social care It throws down the gauntlet to the other parties to set out their plans ahead of the general election Burnham is right to put integrated care at the heart of this vision This echoes the prescription for a single budget and single commissioner for health and social care set out by the   His emphasis on mental health was also very welcome While he was at pains to stress his plans would not result in another structural reorganisation it is not clear how change on this scale could be achieved without some changes to commissioning structures in particular  The elephant in the room is how this will be paid for Labour has not yet committed to finding the additional bn that was identified in the   as being needed to close the NHS funding gap by   The challenge for the Labour party is to demonstrate how it will provide the funding to implement such a positive vision of the future  On integration local leaders are already making progress on delivering better coordinated services for patients Labours plan rightly looks at how best to support local leaders across health and social care working together On new models of care care must be transformed around the needs of people patients and communities The only people who can determine the right provision locally are local leaders of health and social care in partnership with the public To ensure patients have access to the highest possible quality of service commissioners need the freedom to work with a whole range of providers of care including the profit and not for profit sector  It is good to see that the Labour party have acknowledged the resource and workforce pressures facing general practice and their pledge of  more GPs by   something the RCGP has long called for  is very welcome The GP workforce in England is currently straining under the increasing pressure of a growing and ageing population with more and more patients presenting with multiple and longterm conditions Family doctors and their teams currently make  million patient consultations every year  a rise of  million in the last five years  yet the share of the NHS budget that general practice receives has dropped to a recordlow  While more GPs are desperately needed it is essential that this is backed up with the supplementary resources needed for us to be able to deliver excellent care to our patients when they need it  Social care has suffered for years from chronic underfunding and we have reached the point today where many professionals fear they will no longer be able to help all those who desperately need their support Many older and disabled people who need help to do everyday things like getting up in the morning getting dressed having a meal and getting out of the house have already been cut out of the care system altogether This kind of support is vital without it alreadyvulnerable people are at risk of isolation loneliness and further health problems with no choice but to seek help from their GP or local AE department We need a care system that ensures everyone who needs support gets it Otherwise the pressures on an already stretched NHS will only get worse   The statement is largely silent on the two huge practical challenges funding and integration of health and social care On integration the statement promises integrated health and social care year of care budgets the expected savings from which would be used to fund other reforms such as an end to minute home care visits Yet without further reorganisation of two fundamentally different systems  the NHS which is free at the point of use and paid for through national taxation and social care which is meanstested and provided by councils  it is difficult to see how any government could introduce such budgets   Andy Burnham is right when he says in the plans that integrating health and care services cannot be imposed by topdown edict and timetables It must be driven at a local level and designed around local needs The commitment to implement the Five Year Forward View is a welcome recognition that one size does not fit all and the approach   has set out allows local health and care systems to work together to find the right local solutions   Labours plan presents a credible explanation of their understanding of the issues facing health and social care It would be helpful to have the same from the other political parties at this stage in the electoral cycle While more support outside hospital could improve peoples lives Labour needs to be more careful about assuming they will deliver shortterm savings In many countries politicians are stepping back from detailed operational management of complex health services But Labours proposals still feel somewhat topdown It is not clear why politicians should be in charge of specifying the numbers of staff to be recruited or when patients need to see their GPs This is a concern because nationally driven performance management can be just as disruptive as structural reorganisation  Labours vision of citizen and service user involvement seems underdeveloped new rights for patients and carers in the NHS constitution  while welcome  dont answer the question of how to give the constitution teeth It remains unclear whether Labour supports personal budgets in creating peoplepowered health There is a tension between the policy of the NHS as preferred provider and a powerful role for local voluntary organisations and it is not clear that Labour has fully risen to the funding challenges set out in the recent Five Year Forward View
