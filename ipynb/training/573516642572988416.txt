In a paper published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine authors wrote that  people in Britain were given a prime and boost course of the experimental vaccine Researchers said the shots stimulated a protective response from the bodys T cells  white blood cells that are critical to battling pathogens Although the vaccine caused headaches feverishness and fatigue in some subjects researchers said those adverse effects disappeared within two days Overall they said the vaccine was proved to be safe and well tolerated A larger Phase IIÂ  trial will now be performed on more than  test subjects at UC San Francisco and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health according to the National Institutes of Health We wont really know if it works  if it is able to prevent hepatitis C infection  until we have the results of the efficacy studies in the USA said Eleanor Barnes an immunology professor at and the papers senior author Hepatitis C is believed to affect  million people worldwide and is spread through contact with infected blood It often is associated with intravenous drug use and can lurk in the body for years before it is detected It is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis and can lead to liver failure and liver cancer New therapies for patients infected with the virus have proved effective but they are extremely costly  a week course of medication can cost up to  Although new oral antivirals are available  these are unaffordable and unavailable to most people are least effective in patients with advanced liver disease are associated with development of viral resistance and do not provide protection from reinfection the authors wrote For these reasons an effective vaccine to prevent chronic infection remains of clinical importance Researchers pointed out that  in  people who suffers a firsttime infection of the virus will clear it from his or her body naturally This strongly suggests the immune system can fight off the virus with help from a vaccine In this case the experimental vaccine includes an initial prime shot of a weakened chimpanzee cold virus that has been genetically modified to carry four proteins associated with hepatitis C A second boost shot to be given eight weeks later contains a modified vaccinia Ankara MVA virus with the same four proteins By injecting these viral proteins into the the body researchers hope that T cells will recognize them as potential future threats and marshal an immune cell attack on the virus Study authors said they were encouraged by the immune systems response following vaccination The T cell response is really high and whats promising is that this is a broad response Barnes said in a statement A range of different T cells are produced targeting different parts of the hepatitis C virus
