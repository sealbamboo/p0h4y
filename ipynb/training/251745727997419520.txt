The Food and Drug Administration isnt sure but Rita Desollar of Pekin Ill feels she knows what killed Heidi her yearold German shepherd She feels it was the chicken jerky strips she bought at her local Walgreens Desollar says on the Wednesday before Memorial Day she gave two pieces of Waggin Train jerky to Heidi as a treat A few days later Heidi was throwing up and in a lot of distress she says By the time the holiday rolled around on Monday Desollar says Heidi was convulsing in her bed She died that day before Desollar could even take her to the vet I didnt know what happened or why she tells The Salt I got on the Internet and I typed into Google What killed my dog What came up took my breath away Desollar found dozens of posts on various websites from people who claim their dogs got sick from eating the same types of chicken jerky treats  all of them imported from China She also discovered that the FDA was conducting an   into these treats but the agency has not found any direct evidence that the treats are causing a problem so it has not issued any recalls It has issued three   to consumers about the products most recently in November of last year There havent been recalls because the FDA hasnt officially concluded that theres anything wrong with these imported pet treats Though it has received more than  complaints about them in the past five years the FDAs tests havent turned up any contaminant or adulterant in the treats that would give it a reason to issue a mandatory recall However the agency has posted some   about its investigation of the treats The FDA didnt respond to our inquiries but an FDA official recently told a conference of veterinarians that concerns about the treats might be overblown Two thousand complaints since  is an incredibly small subset of the  million animals estimated to consume these treats Dr Tracy DuVernoy with the FDAs Coordinated Outbreak Response and Evaluation Network said last month DuVernoy didnt rule out a contamination But she told the veterinarians that if there is something wrong with the dog treats its something the FDAs scientists havent been able to pin down Since a lot has been ruled out she said it might be a very intricate sort of biological response DuVernoy   in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medicine Associations web coverage of the conference The Waggin Train company says its treats are safe The FDA has been looking at this since  and theyve been very clear that they havent found any contaminant says Keith Schopp a spokesman for the brand While the FDA waits and conducts more testing Desollar doesnt want retailers to wait A few weeks ago she created an   demanding that Walgreens Walmart Kroger and other retailers yank the treats off their shelves Within less than a month the petition has garnered more than  signatures We contacted several of the retailers on Desollars list They said theyre waiting to take action until the FDA comes to an official conclusion about whether the pet treats are safe or not But Desollar says at the very least the stores should give their customers full information about whats already happened Just tell me its under FDA investigation she says Ill make the decision
