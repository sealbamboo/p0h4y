Warning Driving a truck for a living can be hazardous to your health  if you are diagnosed with prostate cancer researchers said Tuesday Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer diagnosed in men and in most cases its basically harmless As the National Cancer Institute says even patients who never get their tumors treated are likely to die of something other than prostate cancer So instead of looking at prostate cancer risk the researchers who did the new study focused on the risk that the cancer would be aggressive at the time of diagnosis They had a hunch that truck drivers might be vulnerable because previous studies had suggested that longterm exposure to the kind of wholebody vibration endured by men working with with heavy equipment could increase prostate cancer risk Its not clear why this would be but one possibility is that the vibration prompts the body to produce more testosterone which is a known risk factor for prostate cancer according to a   published in the Annals of Occupational Hygiene Another is that vibration can lead to   or inflammation of the prostate gland which may also be linked to prostate cancer according to the American Cancer Society The research team  from the NCI the Louisiana State University School of Public Health the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo NY  looked at medical records and other data from  men who were part of the   Along with other health and demographic information they told interviewers about the two jobs where they had spent the most time in their careers as well as their most recent job at the time of their diagnosis When the researchers crunched the numbers they found that men who said they spent more time driving a truck than doing anything else were nearly four times more likely than educators to be diagnosed with a prostate cancer considered highly aggressive The educators were used as the baseline group because they were deemed to have pretty much no exposure to wholebody vibration These aggressive cancers had a PSA level greater than  nanograms per milliliter of blood a Gleason sum of at least  or a combination of a Gleason sum of at least  and tumors that were stage TT Truck driving had the strongest link to an increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer but it wasnt the only occupation associated with higher risk The researchers also found that men who worked at a garden shop for at least six months were  times more likely than educators to be diagnosed with highly aggressive prostate cancer That might be due to exposure to pesticides although men who worked as landscapers exterminators or in other jobs that involve pesticides were not found to have a heightened risk of aggressive prostate cancer The researchers presented their results Tuesday at the American Assn for Cancer Researchs   on Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research in National Harbor Md    and like   on Facebook
