But researchers soon discovered the chemical compound theyd created could have wider uses It turns out if we found the worlds greatest mosquito repellent no one would care Zweibel said So we needed to find something that would work against all insects The trick Zweibel says was taking the way bug spray as we know it works then doing the exact opposite Most commercial insect repellents target the bugs olfactory system  the way it smells  to make it harder for them to find us and consider us as targets for a meal We decided to take a more aggressive approach and rather than turn off the mosquitos olfactory system we could look for something that would turn it too far on to see if we could design a new generation of insect repellents based on overloading their smell system Zweibel said They hate just like we hate overstimulation They will move away from too much smell The researchers who were funded in part by a grant from the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation say that so far VUAA has worked on every insect theyve tested it on That widens the possibilities for it Potential uses range from shooing away bugs that eat crops to a commercial product that can be used to keep pests out of the home But the original goal helping prevent a deadly disease that  killed more than  people in  remains foremost for Zwiebel and his team Our hope is that were able to help develop a product that can be sold for profit in the developed world and use that profit to leverage distribution in the developing world he said Our hope is that every time we spray on a mosquito repellent here in America were subsidizing malaria reduction in Africa and Asia The team has patented the compound But theres no word yet on when it might hit the shelves For now theyre doing tests to make sure it will be safe for people to use So far we dont see any toxic effects Zwiebel said
