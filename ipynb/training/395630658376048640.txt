Mr Odone   but he left an indelible mark on the world of disease activism setting a gold standard for what patients and their families might achieve with determination good luck and the media But Mr Odone himself preferred to be remembered as a loving parent I had the opportunity to meet Mr Odone  and Lorenzo  when researching a book on famous patients He was an unlikely activist An Italianborn economist working for the World Bank Mr Odone Michaela and yearold Lorenzo had moved from Africa to the suburbs of Washington in the summer of  With his thick Italian accent and Old World charm Augusto stood out among his neighbors Michaela who hailed from Yonkers was an editor Lorenzo a precocious boy who spoke three languages started kindergarten that fall Yet rather than thriving Lorenzo experienced numerous problems having temper tantrums slurring his words and even falling on two occasions Doctors initially suspected a difficult adjustment to a new country and school But Lorenzo grew progressively sicker When a neurologist finally made the diagnosis in April  the news was terrible   or ALD a genetic disorder of young boys in which the myelin that protects the nerves of the brain and spinal cord becomes progressively damaged Lorenzo doctors said would gradually lose his ability to see hear eat and walk Death would soon follow The crestfallen Odones did what they could They took Lorenzo to Baltimore to see the worlds top ALD specialist Dr Hugo Moser Dr Moser entered Lorenzo in a clinical trial of a special diet to try to lower the elevated level of verylongchain fatty acids in the blood of affected boys But it did not work It was here that the Odones went from ordinary to extraordinary parents Refusing to believe that there was nothing else to be done they became fixtures at the nearby library of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda Md Among the things the Odones discovered was that scientists across the globe who were working on ALD and other socalled demyelinating diseases had never actually attended a conference together Not only did the Odones arrange this in October  but they began to study ALD themselves asking probing questions of the scientists generating hypotheses about the cause of the disease and beginning to develop possible therapies When asked why he and Michaela did this Mr Odone in typically modest fashion said We love this kid and we dont want to lose him    There have been other examples of this type of activism Also in the mids people with AIDS were becoming experts regarding their disease advocating  often angrily  for increased research funding faster approval of drugs and entrance into experimental protocols Still many physicians as well as the parents of boys with ALD resented what the Odones were doing  Yet by  the Odones had achieved the unthinkable They had deduced that a mixture of two cooking oils oleic acid and erucic acid competitively inhibited the enzymes that overproduced the verylongchain fatty acids that destroyed the myelin They had begun to feed the oil to Lorenzo through the stomach tube he used for eating  By this time Lorenzo was blind mute largely deaf and wheelchair bound In  the Australian film director George Miller best known for the Mad Max movies contacted the Odones He had heard their story and wanted to make a Hollywood film based on Lorenzos story Released in  and starring Nick Nolte as Augusto and Susan Sarandon as Michaela Lorenzos Oil was an unabashed paean to the love and determination that the Odones had shown their son One reviewer said it was an inspirational drama that is truly inspiring   In my book   I discussed how many of the films scenes were inaccurate or misleading For example doctors had never tried to deny Lorenzos Oil to a segment of boys with ALD in order to conduct a randomized clinical trial Nor had it been proven that the oil successfully treated the disease as the film implied But these details were not the crucial aspects of Lorenzos story What I witnessed when I visited the Odones in  was quite remarkable Michaela had died of cancer in  but Lorenzo was alive at age  defying the gloomy prognosis the Odones had received two decades before True he did not interact with me and lay the entire time in a chair But Augusto interacted with him frequently and believed that his son could understand him and still appreciated classical music and books The most indelible image I have is of Augusto leaning down next to his grown son quietly speaking with him and kissing him Lorenzo died in  at age    And what about the oil Did it really work The current scientific consensus is that while it may prolong the lives of boys like Lorenzo it does not really reverse the effects of ALD However astoundingly it does prevent the onset of the disease in susceptible boys in at least twothirds of cases   Before the doctors could do so Augusto Odone had guessed right Hundreds of boys are alive and well today as a result
