For children with ear tubes topical antibiotic drops treat the leaky discharge caused by an ear infection much more effectively than oral antibiotics or observation according to   published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday Each year roughly  children in the United States have tiny plastic tubes placed in the eardrum in one of the most common surgeries of childhood If the ear gets infected afterward clear or bloody discharge can drip out and a foul smell may be noticeable This condition of drippy ears which may or may not be painful is known as tympanostomy tube otorrhea In    percent of children who had ear tubes put in experienced one or more episodes of otorrhea in the year after the procedure Smaller trials with different designs have found that ear drops are more effective than systemic antibiotics for this common problem But the new study is the first to include a notreatment waitandsee group and provides the best evidence to date for the superiority of ear drops for children with tubes This is a big study very high quality and very rigorous Its more of a definitive study said Dr Richard M Rosenfeld chairman of otolaryngology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn who was not involved in the research Putting drops into the ear canal he said is akin to dropping a Scud missile on the bacteria There are two benefits he said It resolves the otorrhea more effectively and faster than oral medicine he said More importantly you avoid the problem of resistant germs which is a major major problem In the new study  children ages  to  with acute tube discharge were randomly assigned to three groups some got ear drops some got oral antibiotics and some were simply observed At two weeks  percent of the children treated with drops still had discharge from an infection compared with  percent of those treated with oral antibiotics and  percent of those who were only observed The study suggests that drippy ears in children with tubes might take two weeks or longer to resolve without treatment  a long time if the child has trouble sleeping or cannot participate in activities No previous study assessed the actual need to treat these children said Dr Thijs MA van Dongen the lead author of the study and an epidemiologist at University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands In a sixmonth followup the study found that children who were not treated for the first two weeks had a median total of  days of discharge compared with five days for those who got ear drops and  days for those given oral antibiotics Its better to start treatment quickly after onset of symptoms Dr van Dongen said They improve more quickly and they have less recurrence in following months But Dr Rosenfeld said it was not clear that all children with tube otorrhea should promptly start ear drops Watching and waiting is an option he said if the drainage is not profuse and causes no discomfort and the child still sleeps and acts normally Drops can be expensive and if used excessively they can cause hardtotreat yeast overgrowth Last July   issued by the American Academy of OtolaryngologyHead and Neck Surgery strongly recommended that clinicians prescribe only topical antibiotic ear drops for children with uncomplicated cases of tube discharge But some pediatricians and family physicians still routinely prescribe systemic antibiotics for these cases Among otolaryngologists the new guidelines are fairly well accepted said Dr Joseph E Kerschner a professor of otolaryngology and the dean of the medical school at Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee Still theres evidence that not all physicians have gotten the message A   found that  percent of emergencymedicine physicians used oral antibiotics to treat an ear infection in a child with ear tubes compared with just  percent of ear nose and throat doctors almost all of whom used topical antibiotics Most children do not see ear nose and throat specialists first said Dr Seth R Schwartz an otolaryngologist and the director of the Listen for Life Center at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle so its important that all physicians who treat children with this condition are aware The bottom line is that oral antibiotics dont work well in these cases he said and they may cause stomach upset or diarrhea In an uncomplicated case of tube discharge Dr Kerschner advised parents to say to pediatricians Hey my kid has a draining ear how about using topical antibiotics instead of oral antibiotics The child will get better faster and more reliably In children without ear tubes who get an ear infection drops are not effective as they cannot get behind the ear drum For those children oral antibiotics are a common treatment Lately Dr Schwartz said theres a higher recognition that you can treat with observation initially with close followup
