A survivor of a serious motorbike accident has had pioneering surgery to reconstruct his face using a series of D printed parts   Stephen Power from Cardiff is thought to be one of the first trauma patients in the world to have D printing used at every stage of the procedure  Doctors at Morriston Hospital Swansea had to break his cheekbones again before rebuilding his face Mr Power said the operation had been lifechanging The UK has become one of the worlds pioneers in using D technology in surgery with advances also being made by teams in London and Newcastle  While printed implants have previously been used to help correct congenital conditions this operation used customprinted models guides plates and implants to repair impact injuries months after they were sustained  Despite wearing a crash helmet Mr Power  suffered multiple trauma injuries in the accident in  which left him in hospital for four months  I broke both cheekbones top jaw my nose and fractured my skull he said I cant remember the accident  I remember five minutes before and then waking up in the hospital a few months later  In order to try to restore the symmetry of his face the surgical team used CT scans to create and print a symmetrical D model of Mr Powers skull followed by cutting guides and plates printed to match Maxillofacial surgeon Adrian Sugar says the D printing took away the guesswork that can be problematic in reconstructive work I think its incomparable  the results are in a different league from anything weve done before he said What this does is it allows us to be much more precise Everybody now is starting to think in this way  guesswork is not good enough The procedure took eight hours to complete with the team first having to refracture the cheekbones with the cutting guides before remodelling the face A medicalgrade titanium implant printed in Belgium was then used to hold the bones in their new shape  Looking at the results of the surgery Mr Power says he feels transformed  with his face now much closer in shape to how it was before the accident  It is totally lifechanging he said I could see the difference straightaway the day I woke up from the surgery Having used a hat and glasses to mask his injuries before the operation Mr Power has said he already feels more confident Im hoping I wont have to disguise myself  I wont have to hide away he said Ill be able to do daytoday things go and see people walk in the street even go to any public areas The project was the work of the Centre for Applied Reconstructive Technologies in Surgery Cartis which is a collaboration between the team in Swansea and scientists at Cardiff Metropolitan University Design engineer Sean Peel has said the latest advance should encourage greater use of D printing in the NHS  It tends to be used for individual really complicated cases as it stands in quite a convoluted longwinded design process he said The next victory will be to get this process and technique used more widely as the costs fall and as the design tools improve  Mr Powers operation is currently being featured  in an exhibition at the Science Museum in London called D Printing The Future
