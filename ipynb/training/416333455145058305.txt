At the Central Iowa Shelter and Services in Des Moines Iowa health insurance navigator Andrea Pearce stood in a crowded dining hall on a recent day shouting instructions on how residents can sign up for Medicaid If you do not have insurance and you want to enroll and you have an email address where you know the password she said come to the computer lab we will guide you through the application Jerry Gross enthusiastically darted to the front of the line This tall yearold carries just a duffle bag and his winter coat He arrived in Des Moines in early December He says when he cant find a job in one town he hitchhikes until he can find work But hes uninsured and taking care of his health is always tough I take three different water pills for hypertension Ive got like  more days of that left and after that what do you do he says When the federal Affordable Care Act called for states to expand Medicaid programs to cover people like Gross Iowa Republican Gov   refused He said he feared the federal government wouldnt come through on its promise to fund the expansion to include childless adults Iowa was one of many states that initially refused all or part of the federal funds offered Were not just one of those states that said Oh yeah well take the federal money No We said no  Branstad said during a recent news conference Eventually Branstad said yes but only if Iowa could take the money on its own terms The state legislature which is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats came up with an alternative Federal expansion dollars would pay for managed care policies that poor people would select on the HealthCaregov site Iowas plan also provides incentives for people on Medicaid to monitor their health Branstad calls it having skin in the game Iowa is one of a   that negotiated or are negotiating with the federal government to customize their Medicaid expansion and still get federal funding Branstad notes that other states like Tennessee and Pennsylvania are looking at our plan The federal Department of Health and Human Services decision to   a waiver to try this idea is not surprising says   executive director at the Georgetown Universitys Center for Children and Families a policy research center She says that the Obama administration is willing to bend over backwards to get to yes  to show Republican governors how much flexibility they have in experimenting with Medicaid expansion in their states But there are some lines they cant and will not cross Alker says While Iowa beneficiaries have to pay something for premiums and nonemergency care recipients cant be disenrolled if theyre unable to pay those premiums she says Thats important because we already have plenty of evidence to suggest that charging premiums to people below the poverty line will mean that they cant afford them and theyre likely to lose their coverage Alker worries that the Iowa plans   for nonemergency medical transportation which is included in coverage in other states could have repercussions Theyre covered for emergency transportation Theyre going to get that ambulance to get to the hospital But we want to make sure folks are able to get their preventative and primary care appointments Alker says When youre talking about people who literally could have limited or no income that becomes a real barrier People are already signing up so that theyll be enrolled in Medicaid in Iowa beginning Jan   This story is part of a reporting partnership between NPR and
