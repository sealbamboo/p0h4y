He says when he can't find a job in one town, he hitchhikes until he can find work. But he's uninsured, and taking care of his health is always tough.. "I take three different water pills for hypertension. I've got like 10 more days of that left, and after that what do you do?" he says.. When the federal Affordable Care Act called for states to expand Medicaid programs to cover people like Gross, Iowa Republican Gov. .  refused. He said he feared the federal government wouldn't come through on its promise to fund the expansion to include childless adults.

Alker worries that the Iowa plan's .  for non-emergency medical transportation, which is included in coverage in other states, could have repercussions.. "They're covered for emergency transportation. They're going to get that ambulance to get to the hospital. But we want to make sure folks are able to get their preventative and primary care appointments," Alker says.
