Medication used to treat stomach ulcers may cause potentially harmful vitamin B deficiency say experts  A US study of  people in the Journal of the American Medical Association found the link  People who took tablets known as proton pump inhibitors PPIs or histamine antagonists HRAs were more likely to lack enough vitamin B for good health  Left untreated B deficiency can lead to dementia and neurological problems  The study authors say doctors should still prescribe these medicines but that they should weigh possible harms against any benefits in patients who need the drugs for prolonged periods of time  More investigations are needed to fully evaluate the risk which appears to be in people who take these medications for two or more years they say The Kaiser Permanente researchers found that the link with B deficiency increased with dose and was stronger in women and younger age groups But the overall risk was still low  PPIs and HRAs are commonly prescribed for patients with symptoms of stomach ulcers such as heartburn and indigestion The tablets are also widely available to buy without a prescription overthecounter at pharmacies They work by reducing the amount of acid made by your stomach  Stomach acid is needed for us to absorb vitamin B from our food such as meat fish and dairy If identified most cases of B deficiency can be easily treated by giving supplements or an injection of vitamin B  But symptoms such as lethargy can be vague and overlooked  Prof Mark Pritchard of the British Society of Gastroenterology said people should not be concerned by the findings  Only patients who had taken these tablets for more than two years were at risk and only a minority of patients on longterm proton pump inhibitors showed evidence of vitamin B deficiency He said people taking ulcer medications could ask their GP for a simple blood test to measure vitamin B levels if they are worried
