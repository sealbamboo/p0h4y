When University of Connecticut star basketball player Shabazz Napier told reporters right after winning the NCAA Division I mens basketball national championship he sometimes went to bed hungry you could almost hear the collective gasp from mothers around the country The comment kicked up a media firestorm and NCAA President   found himself under pressure to ensure studentathletes could get food outside of their meal plans which arent sufficient for many of them On April  the NCAA council   new rules allowing studentathletes unlimited snacks and meals But while the notion of hungry studentathletes seems to have caught many by surprise its far from a new struggle For one student the effort to unionize college players started  years ago with a bag of groceries Back in  University of California Los Angeles football star Donnie Edwards told a radio reporter he didnt have food in his refrigerator When he got home there were groceries on his doorstep The NCAA suspended Edwards for accepting  worth of food which reportedly came from a sports agent Meanwhile the NCAA was selling a jersey with his number on it That struck a chord with Edwards teammate   That was the moment that made me realize that not only are there inequities that should be addressed but that players didnt even have a voice Huma told NPR sports correspondent   in a profile   A year after the Edwards suspension Huma formed a studentathletes association to give students that voice His group later morphed into the National College Players Association or   a major player in the push to unionize studentathletes today A scholarship just doesnt cover everything Huma tells The Salt Thats why Huma wants students to be able to collectively bargain for benefits just like other employees And Napiers comments have helped bring attention back to his cause To Huma unionizing is not about the money Huma is more focused on medical expenses reducing concussions and improving graduation rates he says Its hard to determine how many studentathletes actually go hungry let alone how many students overall go hungry Since many students on scholarship come from lowincome families who would otherwise not be able to pay for college and the NCAA   a studentathletes ability to get a job its a safe bet that there are some gaps In fact the average full athletic scholarship left college players with  in outofpocket expenses during the  school year according to a recent NCPADrexel University Sport Management Department   Still theres no denying that when Napier said he was hungry it moved the ball forward The new rules allowing studentathletes unlimited snacks and meals were in the works for some time NCAA President Emmert said in an  with ESPN Radio last week that the new rules are a relief He gave an example of what he called the dumb food rules The infamous one is you can provide between meals a snack but you cant provide a meal Well then you got to define whats the difference between a snack and a meal So it was literally the case that a bagel was defined as a snack  unless you put cream cheese on it Now it becomes a meal Thats absurd he told ESPN But Huma cautions that the new rules dont take student unionization off the table It doesnt solve their problem he says The NCAA board has to approve the new food rules and then university presidents get a vote And then there are other pressing issues Ninetyeight percent of college athletes do not get picked up by the pros and can have lingering medical problems from college play that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars The next test comes on April  when Northwestern Universitys football players will vote on   You can bet the other colleges are watching closely
