linked to reproductive problems Instead choose candles made with essential oils and fresh flowers to scent your home Also  try using baking soda and white vinegar as odor absorbers The oneword ingredient perfume can translate to a product containing upwards of  chemical ingredients Perfume companies wont release lists of exact ingredients for fear of divulging secrets to their competitors Avoid perfumes and colognes or switch to products that are scented with natural oils Stain blockers essentially create an invisible plastic barrier over your furniture This plastic will eventually wear off and be released into your home environment Instead simply clean stains as necessary rather than trying to prevent them Check the labels of cleaning products for   such as phthalates and

means almost nothing in the food and cosmetics industry as its not regulated by the FDA Instead look for organic labeling because organic ingredients are federally monitored and really mean something in the food and cosmetics world A good start in finding a safer products for yourself and your home is to avoid items containing parabens or sulfates such as sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureate sulfate or items labeled fragrance or parfum Of course it may not be practical for you to toss all of these items at once Instead try swapping out one product at a time with a safer version Even small
