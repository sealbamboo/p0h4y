Heavy smokers who are at least  should have an annual CT scan to check for lung cancer a  The recommendation which could apply to about nine million Americans would mean Medicare and many health insurance companies must start providing the test for free to patients  The screening test which costs  may prevent as many as  percent of future deaths from lung cancer the US Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF says in its   explained in a separate report published in the Annals of Internal Medicine Other experts note that in realworld practice the actual numbers may be much lower  It ranks it alongside mammography colonoscopy some other established cancer screening tests says Dr Kenneth Lin an associate professor of family medicine at Georgetown University This screening test can sometimes find lung cancers at a treatable stage and  we can cure people that we otherwise might not have been able to cure Dr Christopher Lathan a lung cancer expert at DanaFarber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School in Boston says he is ecstatic This is a tremendous opportunity to really change the tide in lung cancer treatment Lathan told NBC News Lin is a little more cautious I think this is an advance but at the same time I dont think that everybody should necessarily run out and get this test because of all the problems that the test can cause in the long run he says The USPSTF estimates that about nine million Americans who smoked the equivalent of a pack a day for  years fall into the eligible group which includes current smokers aged  to  or former heavy smokers who quit less than  years ago Patients who smoked even more heavily  three packs a day for  years  would be included This is just about whats been recommended by other groups including the American College of Chest Physicians the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Thoracic Society They are right in the heart of what the science shows says Dr Peter Bach of the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center in New York The American Lung Association has some   The idea of  who seem healthy for lung cancer has been highly controversial since it was first proposed more than a decade ago Smoking is the single biggest cause of cancers of all types and it causes most cases of lung cancer the biggest cancer killer Lung cancer is so deadly because it doesnt start causing symptoms until its already spread It kills nearly  people a year according to the American Cancer Society So the idea of screening people and catching the cancer early is appealing Dr Claudia Henschke of the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York who led a study that started the push for screening says she is delighted It is going to make a big difference to how many people die of lung cancer she told NBC News Back in  when we published our results we were very confident that it was going to make a big difference she added Now finally it will be made available to those people who are at highest risk I am thrilled Its a draft recommendation  open for comment  and its graded B by the USPSTF That means Medicare the federal health insurance plan for the elderly would pay for the screening for eligible patients And the  Affordable Care Act known commonly as Obamacare requires health insurers taking part in the new insurance marketplaces to provide free of charge all screening services rated A or B by the USPSTF  Its a great first step Henschke says Using CT computed tomography screens for cancer isnt cheap and it isnt harmless Spiral CT used to look for lung cancer is a lowdose form of Xray delivering about the same radiation as a mammogram And CT scans arent exactly clear says Lin A fuzzy blur on a CT scan might be a tumor might be emphysema an infection or even nothing so people must get a second scan if theres something suspicious looking there Even the additional imaging isnt enough to really assure us that a nodule you might see on your lung is not a cancer Lin says And then the only recourse is to do a lung biopsy which means taking a needle and inserting it into your chest into your lungs and getting a sample for pathology It not only hurts  it can collapse the lung The National Lung Screening Trial  the study that forms the main basis for the new recommendations  showed that for every five to six lives saved by screening one person died because of procedures done after screening including surgery and biopsies that collapsed the lung  And experts are worried that having the test available may give people just the excuse they want to keep smoking About  percent of US adults smoke cigarettes Bach says he also worries that screening will be done at centers and by experts who are not equipped to do the right followup No one thinks that the quality of the benefit will be as large in the real community as in in the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial he told NBC News The surgeons in the trial were superexperienced They had an unbelievably low mortality rate The statistics show that  percent of people who get an initial positive on the first scan will turn out not to have lung cancer And  smokers will have to be screened to save one life That is a benefit of  percent Bach said But the people who do benefit  benefit hugely  The costs could be enormous A study by a team at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle last year found that lung cancer screening could add  to  billion in yearly national health care spending They calculated that the price of preventing one lung cancer death was  Its not clear how insurers would respond Insurance companies already charge smokers extra and Obamacare limits how much more they may do so Henschke says once the screening tests are common they could reduce lung cancer deaths by  percent Bach thinks this is a wild overestimate My estimate is that this could probably prevent between  and  deaths from lung cancer a year he says The Fred Hutchison team calculated it would be  lives a year if  percent of those eligible got screened That is a huge number Bach adds Even just  deaths prevented equals the number of women who die from cervical cancer each year he points out Leslie Kingon  says hes one of those whose life was saved by screening The retired high school English teacher started smoking in the foxholes during World War Two and had been getting regular screening exams in Henschkes office for years  It was this or living on tenterhooks for the rest of my life just waiting around and I didnt want to do that Kingon told NBC News His lung cancer was diagnosed in  and surgeons got the tumor out in time I think it was discovered in the first stage luckily And thats what saved me Kingon said  I tell my friends who are still smoking  look if you really are serious about stopping smoking get lung cancer he said  and   on Facebook and on
