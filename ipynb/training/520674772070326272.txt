Dr Gabriel Logan is a bundle of energy Wearing a yellow dress shirt untucked from his slacks he races around the Liberian government hospital compound in Tubmanburg north of the capital Monrovia He also moves fast on the medical front experimenting with his own idea of treatment for Ebola patients Back in July this hospital which was the main medical facility for the region was closed after  of the staffers got sick with Ebola We sent them to Monrovia he says Of the  only one survived When the hospital reopened in August Logan at first tried to refer any suspected Ebola cases to Monrovia Clinics in the capital had no room for them Everywhere is filled so I said to myself Well then as a doctor I have to do something to save some of the peoples lives  Logan says So Logan set up a barebones Ebola isolation ward in a small building behind the hospital He also started wondering whether any of the drugs in his pharmacy might work against the virus Thats when he decided to try   an antiviral medicine used to treat hepatitis B and HIV on Ebola patients Theres no approved medicine on the market to treat Ebola and lamivudine is not even on the list of the World Health Organizations experimental prospects But Logan says he needs to do what he can   We need to save some of the lives of our people Of the  patients he treated with lamivudine he says  survived Logan acknowledges that this is far too small a sample to prove whether lamivudine is effective But thats not slowing him down Do you expect me to wait until the bigger study is over he asks Then most of my patients would be finished They would be dead Ebola hasnt just brought treatment challenges to Logans hospital Hes also dealing with issues concerning the dead bodies Body collectors are refusing to dig graves saying its not their job And new cemetery space needs to be found because the current plot is full In addition Logan has to organize care for  orphans whose parents died of Ebola And if that wasnt enough he also has to combat fear of the hospital Logan and his staff also treat people with illnesses other than Ebola but patients are staying away Just the word Ebola scares them So we are out there talking to the community telling them there is hope Logan says If you are sick you need to come The county has organized regular community meetings to handle questions about the outbreak At a recent one Logan tries to quash rumors that Ebola survivors are still infectious Hes confrontational with the crowd but in a goodnatured way Logan is affectionately known as GLo around the hospital  a mashup of his first initial and Logan Logan insists that survivors provide inspiration to Ebola patients and should get jobs at the new treatment unit being built by US troops on the hospital grounds He assures a grumbling audience that survivors will just be doing ordinary housekeeping They will not be serving medication he says But they will be members of the team Currently Logan has just six Ebola patients in his ward but he expects hell need the full  beds in the facility being built by the Americans as this epidemic grows
