Way back in the s were you the one playing When Doves Cry over and over Well dont be surprised if your kids wind up doing the same thing Young adults have strong positive memories of the music their parents loved when they were the same age a study finds That flies in the face of the cultural stereotype that children reject their parents taste in music Participants in a study on musical memory didnt just say they remembered and loved the music that was popular in the early s when their parents were young They also loved the music of the s which their grandparents may have been blasting while changing Moms diapers And the yearolds of today liked the older songs as much as the new stuff they listen to with peers For real They would hear this music and say Oh yeah thats my parents music with obvious fondness says   the psychology professor at Cornell University who led the study The   was published online in the journal   The scientists had been testing musical memory in an earlier study and were surprised to find that collegeage participants could identify older pop and rock songs just as quickly as the new stuff Even more surprising they liked the older stuff more So the researchers decided to try to nail down what was happening using clips from hits off   lists from  to  More than  student volunteers average age  listened to short clips of the top two pop and rock songs for each year The researchers quizzed them on which songs they recognized how much they liked them and their emotional responses They were also asked if they had memories associated with the songs and if those memories were from listening with parents alone or with others Earlier research has found that the music heard in late adolescence and early adulthood has the most impact and staying power through a persons life So the researchers figured that todays yearolds would be all about Rihanna and the Black Eyed Peas Not so We didnt have any idea that young adults had strong personal memories of the music of the early s Krumhansl told Shots She and her colleague Justin Adam Zupnick of the University of California Santa Cruz were even more surprised to see the second reminiscence bump in emotion and memory for top hits from  to  The connection to parents music isnt entirely surprising Music plays a central role in child rearing both in the songs children are taught at home and in school and in those heard more informally as part of the home environment The songs parents choose to listen to reflect their taste their values their era Music is a powerful cue for retrieving strong personal memories  when you kissed that girl at summer camp the blue polkadot dress you wore to prom how lonely you were freshman year And the human brain remembers music with extraordinary detail unlike spoken words in which people remember just the gist After hearing less than a second of a song people can come up with the title and the artist Krumhansl says They know the emotional content They know the style The s music may evoke strong memories in somethings because of the quality Krumhansl speculates We are talking about The Beatles here But the top pop songs of that era used in the study also included The Ballad of the Green Berets To Sir with Love and Sugar Sugar so maybe its not just that Krumhansl thought the students might have memories of s music because it lives on as classic rock But it turned out their memories came not from current listening but from hearing it when they were younger Technology may also be a factor The introduction of cassette tapes in the s made music more ubiquitous and the same tapes were played long after that decade ended Props to you parents still hanging on to those mixtapes Next Krumhansl wants to find out if other generations have the same experiences with emotional memory and music and try to trace influences back through multiple generations Shes launching a Webbased survey that covers  years of pop hits and welcomes public participation check it out   And maybe play   No  hit  while you do
