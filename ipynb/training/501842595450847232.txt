The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the most explosive in history One reason the virus spread so fast is that West Africa was blindsided Ebola had never erupted in people anywhere close to West Africa before The type of Ebola causing the outbreak  called Zaire  is the deadliest strain Until this year it had been seen only in Central Africa about  miles away Thats about the distance between Boston and San Francisco So how did it spread across this giant swath of land without anybody noticing To answer that ecologist   says we need to look at the history of Ebola Zaire Back in the summer of  a young Zairian doctor named Ngoy Mushola traveled to a rural village in what is today the Democratic Republic of the Congo He heard people were dying of a strange disease near the shores of the   They had fevers stomachaches and rashes Some had internal bleeding Whats so nasty about it is that it effectively melts your blood vessels says Walsh whos at the University of Cambridge Eventually scientists realized a new virus was causing the disease They named it   after the river and the country Nearly  people died in that first outbreak Then about a year later poof Ebola Zaire vanished In  the virus reappeared and started hopscotching around the rain forest of Central Africa It goes away for a while and comes back Walsh says This year its here next year its  kilometers down the road Over the past  years Ebola Zaire has proved to be the deadliest of the five Ebola strains It has the highest mortality rate and has caused the most outbreaks But the virus always stayed in Central Africa Until last December Thats when people started dying of a mysterious disease again This time it was across the continent on the western tip of Africa At first many people thought the culprit was another type of Ebola  Tai Forest  which hides out in nearby rain forests But DNA tests made it clear Ebola Zaire was causing the outbreak So how did the virus end up  miles away from its normal home range Disease ecologist   says scientists dont know for sure But they have a top theory The virus spread through bats Many signs point to bats as the main source of Ebola Scientists have found Ebola antibodies in bat species that are widespread throughout Africa The virus infects and replicates inside bats but it doesnt kill the animals So bats can easily spread Ebola And bats get around Some can migrate hundreds even thousands of miles Bats dont need a passport to cross borders says Daszak who is the president of the conservation group EcoHealth Alliance Hundreds and thousands of bats migrate across countries And weve shown that in other countries they have really large ranges And they take the viruses with them So does this mean there are giant colonies of bats flying  across a large swath of West Africa carrying Ebola It sounds scary Daszak says But bats have a very wide distribution And people are becoming more and more populous across that distribution These viruses can emerge anywhere where the wildlife reservoir lives There are a couple of big caveats here This is still a theory And although scientists have found traces of the virus in individual bats they still havent been able to figure out which species are actually spreading Ebola or how long the virus has been in West Africa And Ebola outbreaks are still rare Its a bit like a giant earthquake They happen very rarely but theyre very devastating when they happen Daszak says But if Ebola Zaire could crop up in Guinea it could appear anywhere in West Africa where about  million people live This opens up more people at risk Daszak says Hes quick to point out though that we shouldnt blame the bats They are actually a really important part of the ecosystem Daszak says Bats are out there pollinating trees and crops  and eating insects that destroy crops We only catch viruses from bats and other wildlife when we dont respect their habitat Lets not blame the wildlife he says Lets look at what we can do to interact with wildlife so that its safer from a public health point of view
