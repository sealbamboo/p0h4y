Rather than letting people keep their old health plans that dont comply with the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act the head of the group that represents the nations health insurance companies is floating an alternative weakening the requirements If you take  categories of coverage said Karen Ignagni president and CEO of   in an interview taped for   no matter how meritorious each and every one of those benefits may be  you have a giant step up from what many people had before and wanted to pay for Those  categories make up the   that nearly every plan now must cover to be considered compliant with the law Ignagni said forcing people to move from plans with lower premiums and fewer benefits to higher premiums and higher benefits was a bridge too far for some individuals and resulted in the decision by the Obama administration to allow people to   for longer than the insurance industry would like Thats because insurers set their premiums for this year assuming those people would join the new risk pools Allowed to keep their old plans those presumably healthier people remain outside the new program As one possible alternative Ignagni said she would create a lower tier of coverage So that people could gradually get into the program so they could be part of the risk pool she said So we dont hold the healthier people outside so the process could be working the way it was designed Currently all four metal tiers of coverage     must offer all the essential benefits but with different levels of costsharing There is already a   for those under  and certain others who can demonstrate financial hardship but so far it hasnt proved particularly popular According to the   from the federal government only  percent of those selecting a plan in the  states where the federal government is operating the exchange have chosen a catastrophic plan Ignagnis proposal would presumably fall somewhere between the catastrophic plan and the bronze level of coverage And she insists it would not draw most people into the cheapest plans Were not seeing that right now she said I think by that hypothesis you would have expected an extraordinary amount of people to buy bronze and theyve chosen more silver Indeed  percent of those in the federal marketplaces have chosen silverlevel plans so far but some have suggested that may be in part because silverlevel plans have    in addition to the premium subsidies that are available for all the metal tiers But would having a choice that offers fewer benefits help or hurt the existing market Thats hard to say said   who helped develop the Massachusetts law that was the forerunner of the Affordable Care Act Its a very very tough question Gruber tells Shots Theres a tradeoff between premiums and benefits and I dont think theres a right answer Much of the debate he says is simply philosophical and comes down to a question of which benefits dont get offered Do we want to call something health insurance that doesnt cover prescription drugs
