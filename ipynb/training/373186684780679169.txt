If youre finding it harder to remember where you put the car keys the culprit could be a brain protein with a name thats easy to forget RbAp A shortage of this protein appears to impair our ability to remember things as we age researchers   in the current issue of Science  And boosting levels of RbAP in aging brains can reverse memory loss at least in mice they say The protein was studied in an area of the brain that is generally unaffected by Alzheimers disease The research reinforces the emerging idea that Alzheimers disease and aging are separate entities says   a neurologist at Columbia University and one of the studys authors It also suggests that eventually it should be possible to treat memory loss thats not related to Alzheimers Small and a team that included Nobel Laureate   discovered the protein after studying postmortem brains from eight people ranging in age from  to  The scientists focused on one specific region of the hippocampus a structure thats highly involved in memory We simply asked Can we find a molecular change in that brain region across the lifespan Small says The answer was yes In the brains of young people the RbAp protein was abundant the researchers report But in older people it was scarce The team still needed to show that this protein really is responsible for memory loss So they found a way to artificially reduce levels in young mice Small says What was remarkable is that if you just manipulate this one molecule in this particular area of the brain you now have a young mouse that looks very much like an old mouse Small says These young mice had trouble remembering new objects and things like how to get through a maze Then the researchers tried something even more ambitious They boosted levels of RbAp in old mice with failing memories The effect was dramatic Small says Their ability to detect novel objects went back to the way a young mouse is able to perform that task he says All of these experiments involved whats called the    a region of the hippocampus that is generally not affected by Alzheimers disease Also the RbAp protein hasnt been linked to Alzheimers Small says The findings could eventually help doctors determine whether someones memory loss is a symptom of early Alzheimers or just normal aging Small says Thats become the most common question I get from patients he says The new study is both beautiful and important says   a neurobiologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine The findings suggest that a drug could reverse memory loss in some people with agerelated memory loss Sweatt says But the possibility of finding such a drug raises a tricky question for society If its normal do you need a drug for it Sweatt says Sweatt thinks there is a need because even normal memory loss impairs the lives of many people in their s s and beyond But a drug isnt the only option for increasing levels of this memory molecule he says Other likely candidates include diet and exercise which scientists already know can affect the levels of some proteins in the brain
