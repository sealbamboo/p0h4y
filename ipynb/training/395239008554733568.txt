What a difference a day makes Consumers who buy a health policy good for only  days might save hundreds of dollars in premiums but they could also find themselves without important benefits and charged a penalty for not having insurance next year Under the health care law in January most insurers have to start accepting all applicants   and offer plans with comprehensive benefits that limit outofpocket costs But shortterm medical plans defined as policies with terms lasting less than  months can sidestep all the laws new requirements A number of insurance vendors are taking advantage of this loophole and offering plans with skimpier coverage that last up to  days I am concerned that health insurers will try to  sell people coverage that yes may come with a cheaper sticker price but that may expose them to significant financial risks down the line says   project director at Georgetown Universitys Center on Health Insurance Reforms In addition to inadequate coverage consumers who rely on shortterm plans will likely face a penalty next year for not having insurance because the plans dont qualify as   under the law Plans that meet the standard must cover  essential health benefits and cover at least  percent of allowed medical expenses Also consumers who buy plans that are sold through their states health insurance marketplace may be eligible for subsidies if their income is less than  percent of the federal poverty level  for an individual or  for a family of four in  Subsidies arent available for plans nonmarketplace plans Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shields day Essential Blue Freedom plans least expensive option would cost a yearold Little Rock resident  per month half the  premium for the least expensive bronze plan the carrier offers that meets health law requirements That Essential Blue Freedom plans  deductible is lower than the  for the bronze plan But the cheaper plan doesnt cover any preexisting medical conditions and only people who pass medical underwriting are approved The website alerts shoppers that the plan may be subject to a penalty Young people and others without medical problems as well as those who arent eligible for subsidized coverage on the health insurance exchanges may find these plans appealing says Max Greenwood a spokesperson for Arkansas BCBS Shortterm policies have been around for decades With a term that typically lasts as long as three or six months consumers often purchase them after graduating from school or while theyre between jobs Once the major ACA provisions take effect in January plans that fill gaps in coverage of less than three monthsthe length of time someone can go without having insurance before facing a penalty under the lawwill still be useful say experts In the last year and a half however more companies have been offering shortterm plans that bump up against the day limit says Carrie McLean director of customer care for online health insurance vendor   A few companies caught on to what was going to be happening with Affordable Care Act and thought  that could be an alternative option she says Aside from offering inadequate coverage some experts say theyre concerned that the plans which are mostly geared for people who are healthy could   because it removes the less expensive people who are necessary to moderate the costs of those who are sick Like another strategy some insurers are employing this year  allowing current policyholders to   and thus avoid the health laws requirements for nearly a year  day plans help insurers appeal to healthy people who are relatively inexpensive to insure Its a way of cherrypicking says   a professor at Washington and Lee University specializing in health law
