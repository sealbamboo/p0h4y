If youre a healthy baby boomer looking after your own elderly parents that question may not have crossed your mind just yet  But its going to be a big issue going forward The AARPs Public Policy Institute issued a report on Monday suggesting that    just  years from now  when the first boomers begin to turn  According to the report there will be a shortage of both unpaid caregivers  typically family or close friends  as well as paid caregivers like home care aides and personal care attendants   The data highlighted in the AARP study is startling In  there were  individuals of prime caregiving age   to  years old  for every person age  or older  By  the caregiver support ratio the proportion of people in prime caregiving years to those age  or above will drop to  then plunge to  by  according to AARPs projections About  percent of potential caregivers found themselves actually providing care to someone age  or older in  according to the AARP Another  percent helped someone younger than   The larger the pool the more likely it is that someone will be able to step forward and assume what often are challenging responsibilities In  more than half of adults age  and older had a severe disability and  percent needed help with bathing using the toilet dressing cooking eating paying bills or other routine activities Whether similar trends will apply in the decades ahead is an open question If you want raw numbers here they are The population of baby boomers stood at  million in  and it is expected to decline to  million in  and  million in  as members die off   The aging of this generation will swell the ranks of those age  and older from  million in  to  million in  then to  million in    People in the  to  age group numbered  million in  that will essentially stay flat at  million in  and rise to  million by  according to figures supplied by AARP upon request What these numbers tell us is that relying on family and friends to provide longterm care may be unrealistic in the future said Lynn Feinberg a senior strategic policy adviser at AARP We need to be thinking about new approaches to financing and delivering longterm services and supports particularly home and communitybased services which are what most people want All this contradicts some widely held beliefs   percent of Americans age  and older are   according to a survey by Associated PressNORC Center for Public Affairs Research published this year   The explanation for what AARP calls an impending care gap lies with welldocumented trends including longer life spans smaller families more divorces among those age  and older more people who never had children and rising rates of disability associated with the obesity epidemic The number of frail older people those age  and over with any disability is projected to increase from  million in  to  million in  the report notes The percentage of frail older people who are childless is projected to rise from  to  percent during this period and the percentage of frail older people who have only one or two adult children is projected to increase from  to  percent There are limitations to the AARP study   For instance it doesnt say how many people are entering older age living alone without family or friends nearby   The numbers here paint a big picture of a big problem but details that might flesh out who is particularly vulnerable are lacking  Asked what solutions AARP recommends Ms Feinberg discussed a need for better supports for family caregivers but didnt endorse specific suggestions That said the points raised in the report are an important contribution to a discussion now under way as the national Commission on LongTerm Care prepares to issue a report outlining policy recommendations in September  Stay tuned  well have more on that commissions work in the weeks ahead
