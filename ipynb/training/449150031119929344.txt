The World Health Organization has declared its South East Asia region poliofree The certification is being hailed a historic milestone in the global fight to eradicate the deadly virus It comes after India officially recorded three years without a new case of polio The announcement means  of the world is now officially free of polio although the disease is still endemic in Afghanistan Nigeria and Pakistan Other countries in the WHO South East Asia region such as Sri Lanka Maldives and Bhutan have been free of the virus for more than  years  However despite the huge global significance of the announcement the WHO admits there are still major challenges to overcome if the world is the reach the goal of eradicating polio everywhere by    There have also been outbreaks in conflicthit countries such as Syria which had previously managed to stamp out the virus  Polio mainly affects children under five years old The virus is transmitted through contaminated food and water and multiplies in the intestine It can then invade the nervous system causing paralysis in one in every  infections  South East Asia is the fourth of six WHO regions to be declared poliofree after the Americas Western Pacific and Europe regions Eastern Mediterranean and Africa have yet to gain a similar status  Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh WHO South East Asia regional director said This is very significant because before this region was certified poliofree we had half the worlds population polio free With the South East Asia region being added we now have  of the population polio free This was a problem the region was struggling with for a long time but now finally we are polio free  Many experts thought India would be the last country in the world to get rid of polio says Deepak Kapur of Rotary Internationals India National Polio Plus Committee He said India faced several enormous challenges including its large population He said India has close to  million children under five who needed to be immunised  Then theres the existence of insanitary conditions which helped the polio virus to proliferate  and impure drinking water because polio is a water borne disease  But he said the fact that India had managed it and now the whole of South East Asia could be declared polio free sent a powerful and optimistic message to the three remaining polioendemic countries  The world signed up to eradicating polio in  The Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched which is a partnership between governments and organisations such as Unicef the WHO and Rotary International The aim was to banish polio once and for all  In  there were  recorded cases By  cases had fallen to  But last year there was a rise in cases to  new infections  The increase is largely down to vaccination campaigns being interrupted by conflict In October  Syria reported its first case of polio since  By March  there were  cases  An outbreak in the Horn of Africa which started in May  has seen  new cases in Somalia Kenya and Ethiopia  While Thursdays announcement clearly marked an important milestone there was still a long way to go said Mr Kapur  Every child in the world is at risk of contracting polio until such a time as the wild polio virus is completely eradicated from every part of the world he said Until then no child  be it in North America or Europe  will be free of polio potentially hunting them down all over again The only way to ensure the wild polio virus no longer exists in any part of the world is to wipe it out of every community in the world  It is not good enough to wipe it out on one continent and not the rest of the world because today the world is just one global village  The only way to keep polio away is through immunisation He said if every child on the planet were immunised there would be nowhere for the virus to flourish and spread  Todays a big occasion for the entire global polio eradication initiative because if India  which had the most difficult of situations  can do it others around the world can do it too Mr Kapur said So Pakistan Afghanistan and Nigeria need to replicate the example of India and go after this virus  Global eradication could and should be achieved in the very near future   Syria The Silent Enemy is broadcast on  March at  GMT and  March at  GMT on BBC Radio   Syria The Silent Enemy is broadcast on  March at  GMT  GMT  GMT  GMT and  March at  GMT on BBC World Service
