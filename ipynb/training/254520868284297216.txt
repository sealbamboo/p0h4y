Independent   have not been particularly kind to Mitt Romney since Wednesdays first presidential debate in Denver But one of the candidates claims turned out to be so far off the mark that he had to be corrected by his own aides  a fact not unnoticed by the Obama campaign Romneys claim was this part of what turned out to be a   of health care No  preexisting conditions are covered under my plan By preexisting conditions Romney was talking about the ability for people who already have medical problems  diabetes for example or even things like allergies  to buy health insurance Starting in  the federal   says insurance companies can no longer reject people with bad health histories  nor can they charge them more Thats already true   under the law Romney signed as governor But Romneys   for the nation should he be elected president wouldnt necessarily guarantee that same protection Actually governor that isnt what your plan does President Obama told Romney at the debate Wednesday What your plan does is to duplicate whats already the law The president was referring to the   Its a  law that says among other things that once you have health insurance you can continue to purchase it as long as theres no interruption in your coverage of more than  days But Romneys plan wouldnt guarantee that people who dont have coverage now will be able to buy it Top Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom said as much in the socalled spin room to   right after the debate and again on Thursday on   The governor will repeal Obamacare and he will return to the states the power to control their own health care futures Fehrnstrom told Wolf Blitzer Look what works in Massachusetts may not work in Texas It was wrong for the president to take the broad outlines of the Massachusetts plan and impose it as a dictate from Washington on every state in the nation That correction was gladly picked up by the Obama forces At a   in Northern Virginia Obama took credit for one of the few times he actually called Romney out during the debate Gov Romney was fact checked by his own campaign Thats rough the president told a cheering crowd at George Mason University Even they know his plan would take away coverage for tens of millions of Americans This isnt the first time a Romney statement has had to be walked back by his staff when it comes to health care In recent weeks hes misstated or switched positions on   and on   But at   this was by far the largest audience thats heard something different from what the candidates position actually is
