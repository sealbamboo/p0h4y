Sometimes you stumble across statistics that just scream at you I was looking this week through some reports on the Liberian Ministry of Healths website The screaming statistic was an  listed as the number of people currently in treatment at the ELWA  Ebola treatment unit run by Doctors Without Borders in Monrovia That couldnt possibly be right I thought ELWA  is the largest Ebola hospital ever built with  beds I was at the site when it was being built in August and later when it was full Its a massive complex covering what used to be a huge empty field on the grounds of a missionary hospital Its hard to get a sense of how big it is while youre walking amid the long white tents holding Ebola patients and suspected cases In August ELWAs size seemed depressing The fact that such a large hospital was needed was an indication of how out of control the outbreak was As the wards were being erected behind her Lindis Hurum emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in Monrovia told me the outbreak was worsening every day It ELWA is going to be the biggest unit ever by MSF and the reality is that we think that that will not be enough she predicted At first it seemed she was right ELWA opened originally with  beds then quickly expanded to  In September it seemed that even that wasnt enough Staff members had to turn away suspected Ebola patients at the gate So to hear that the hospitals patient roster had dropped to just eight last week is great news A spokeswoman for Doctors Without Borders says the admissions fluctuate a lot and the tally has since gone up from eight to  But still  Ebola patients is a far cry from  Part of why that statistic of eight screams so loudly is that ELWA is now a sign of how dramatically the number of cases has come down in Liberia Theres no denying that it was worth building the bed hospital It got all of those people out of circulation so they couldnt spread the virus to others But now the international response once again seems out of step with epidemic On the same day that ELWA had more than  empty beds last week the Chinese government opened a brand new  bed Ebola treatment unit just down the street
