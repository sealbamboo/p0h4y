All across Connecticut you can see billboards and TV ads hear radio spots and get pamphlets about how to get insurance under the new health care law starting Oct  But the state is also using less traditional and more expensive ways to get the word out At state beaches this summer outreach workers handed out tubes of sunscreen that said Get Covered The state is opening up Applelike   And outreach workers have fanned across the state to talk with people attending   like the Americas Most Wanted rap concert featuring superstars Lil Wayne and TI Papilon Ferreiras  was at the concert He says he works about  hours a week at Taco Bell and would like health insurance Who wouldnt Who wouldnt like health insurance he says This is where Emanuela Cebert an outreach worker sees an opening She walks up to Ferreiras tablet computer in hand If I had a way for you to get more affordable health insurance or health insurance in general would you want to learn more about it she asks Ill look into it Not today But Ill look into it Ferreiras answers So Cebert tells him she can get his information and contact him in October when Connecticuts marketplace starts selling insurance under the Affordable Care Act The state has a lot riding on how Ferreiras and others respond This is the biggest expansion of health insurance in  years says   executive director of   the states health care exchange Hes got  million in federal money to spend on marketing Its pretty hard to communicate effectively without investing some he says We invested in a lot of other programs in order to promote them The outreach is heating up now even though people cant officially sign up until October Coverage begins in January Connecticut is one of   and the District of Columbia setting up their own health insurance marketplaces Under the Affordable Care Act they get access to federal marketing money The outreach work isnt easy People often people walk right by Cebert and her colleagues But if the health care expansion is going to survive successful outreach is important Were gonna be at Miranda Lambert and Dierks Bentley Counihan says Were going to be at the Rockstar Energy Drink Uproar Festival Were going to be at John Mayer and Phillip Phillips Its about more than raw numbers Its about the particulars of who signs up It has to be broad and comprehensive he continues If we narrowed this say to the Hartford Pops Festival or the Hartford Jazz Festival we will get a slim demographic which doesnt adequately reflect our state A few weeks later Counihans workers were at the Milford Oyster Festival and its shucking competition The goal was to reach an older more suburban crowd Robert Harrington was there He says he could get health insurance through his job but he doesnt Its too expensive and he makes a calculation At  a week You know do I pay health insurance or do my kids eat he asks Now he doesnt have much of a choice He doesnt like President Obama and he doesnt like Obamacare But he doesnt want to be penalized for being uninsured You know I got to do what I got to do I dont want to get fined Cause its a tax he says And then theres Gary Mott Hes a bathtub refinisher with insurance but he worries about the  deductible for his and his wifes policy For both of us altogether its about  so were good right now as far as premiums go he says But that deductible if one or both of us gets sick were in trouble Thats how people end up losing their homes and such So Mott could be one of the people who finds an option in Connecticuts marketplace Exchange head Counihan says hes hoping to enroll about  people in the first year alone
