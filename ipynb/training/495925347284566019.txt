When my translator and I arrive in a crowded dusty neighborhood in Karachi Fatima Noor is waiting in a full black burqa But she pretends not to see us She turns down the alley and disappears We follow her into a neighborhood where the buildings are so close together that Noors burqa brushes the walls Finally she slips into the entryway of a building and with a sigh of relief she pulls back her headscarf Noor is a yearold mother of three Shes also one of Pakistans roughly    who help provide basic health services to children in slums and remote rural areas of Pakistan On this day she and two other workers are immunizing kids for   The trio is explaining to a group of young mothers how their children will need to get measles booster shots in a year and a half Being a frontline health worker usually isnt controversial But in Pakistan it can get you killed The Taliban went on an offensive against polio immunization in  after it became clear that the CIA used a fake hepatitis vaccination campaign to gather intelligence on Osama bin Laden Since then more than  polio workers have been   Whenever I go out for a polio campaign my heart is scared and my mind is not working Noor says through our translator During polio drives she goes door to door giving children drops that protect them from permanent paralysis But the attacks have completely changed the drives Noor says She no longer wants to be seen carrying the small blue ice chest that holds the vaccine We ask one of the kids to go in the street and check if the situation is all right or not Noor says And Ill get my son to carry the vaccine cooler He hides it inside a shopping bag And Ill be covered in a burqa Noor has worked as a  for  years and earns roughly  a month During nationwide polio immunization drives many of the other vaccinators are hired by the day They earn just  a day which is so low that even in Pakistan theyre often referred to as volunteers Her team has never been attacked she says But whenever they hear something that sounds like gunfire they all run and hide And when the vaccinators go into an apartment building they post one person to wait outside and watch for trouble When we come out of a building we have to be careful Noor says Sometimes we stop for a while to see if anyone was watching us Sometimes they also travel with a police escort In most neighborhoods she says   accept the vaccine But in some places  usually poor slums  parents can be hostile Some refuse to have their children vaccinated saying the campaign is a   against Muslims or a government scheme to sterilize their children People are saying that its a form of family planning she says We tell them that if the government wanted to they could add birth control into anything into the water into the food Eventually many parents accept that the rumors dont make sense Whats harder to overcome in Pakistan is the fear created by the militant attacks on polio workers Whenever another vaccinator gets shot Noors husband urges her to stop going on campaigns and to stay home But Noor says she cant To her protecting Pakistani kids from polio paralysis is crucial to the country  especially since theres no treatment for the disease These are our children and its obvious we will not let them be disabled she says
