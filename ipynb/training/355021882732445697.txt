We open our hymnals to Hymn  and we begin to sing God is Love let heavn adore him  God is Love let earth rejoice  Lifting voices together in praise can be a transcendent experience unifying a congregation in a way that is somehow both fervent and soothing But is there actually a physical basis for those feelings To find this out researchers of the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden studied the heart rates of high school choir members as they joined their voices Their   published this week in   confirm that choir music has calming effects on the heart  especially when sung in unison Using pulse monitors attached to the singers ears the researchers measured the changes in the choir members heart rates as they navigated the intricate harmonies of a Swedish hymn When the choir began to sing their heart rates slowed down When you sing the phrases it is a form of guided breathing says musicologist   of the Sahlgrenska Academy who led the project You exhale on the phrases and breathe in between the phrases When you exhale the heart slows down But what really struck him was that it took almost no time at all for the singers heart rates to become synchronized The readout from the pulse monitors starts as a jumble of jagged lines but quickly becomes a series of uniform peaks The heart rates fall into a shared rhythm guided by the songs tempo The members of the choir are synchronizing externally with the melody and the rhythm and now we see it has an internal counterpart Vickhoff says This is just one little study and these findings might not apply to other singers But all religions and cultures have some ritual of song and its tempting to ask what this could mean about shared musical experience and communal spirituality Its a beautiful way to feel You are not alone but with others who feel the same way Vickhoff says He plans to continue exploring the physical and neurological responses of our body to music on a longterm project he calls Body Score As an instructor he wonders how this knowledge might be used to create more cohesive group dynamic in a classroom setting or in the workplace When I was young every day started with a teacher sitting down at an old organ to sing a hymn Vickhoff says Wasnt that a good idea  to get the class to think We are one and we are going to work together today  Perhaps hymns arent for everyone but we want to know what songs soothe your heart For a bit of inspiration weve included a clip of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir whose members know a lot about singing together
