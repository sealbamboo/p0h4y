Householders across England have started receiving leaflets about a new NHS scheme called Caredata  The likelihood is most people will simply cast the documents in the bin along with the takeaway menus and doubleglazing offers  But to some the datasharing project represents an attack on privacy and confidentiality Should we be concerned  when it is ready in the early summer will effectively be an anonymised medical database which will include details of every NHS patient  unless you opt out NHS England which has commissioned the Health and Social Care Information Centre to run the project argues the system will make medical advances easier by allowing researchers to investigate drug side effects and enable greater monitoring of performance in the health system To date the NHS has provided access to anonymised records but that has been solely limited to what happens in hospitals As a result there has been virtually no information about the care given by GPs and elsewhere in the community or the sort of drugs patients have been given before they reach hospital For those who rely on this information it is said to be like looking at a jigsaw puzzle with half the pieces missing For example cancer survival in England has tended to lag behind other western countries That could be down to late diagnosis poor GP referral practices or inadequate treatment  but noone really knows  Having information about this joinedup patient journey could provide the answer So far so good Yes but there is a controversial element At the moment the database will only be open to NHS bodies But there is a proposal  to be discussed at a meeting in March  that will allow it to be made available to nonNHS groups such as drug companies The fear is that as the information contains so much data it will in theory be possible to identify some patients  And as some drug companies also have health insurance arms it is easy to understand why this could be a problem with fears being raised about increased premiums and targeted marketing There are laws strictly prohibiting trawling data to join up the dots However there is still uneasiness about the issue To date both the British Medical Association and Royal College of GPs have remained largely supportive But that does not mean there is not some concern within the medical community A recent survey of  doctors by the GP magazine Pulse found nearly half were unhappy about the plans This is because GPs will be handing over the raw data which includes NHS numbers date of births postcodes genders and ethnicities They will then have to leave it up to the Health and Social Care Information Centre to link it up with the hospital side before anonymising it This is the first time such records have been released like this from the safety of a GP surgery MPs have also started showing an interest An early day motion has been tabled by Roger Godsiff the Labour MP for Birmingham Hall Green He has suggested there should be no faith in the official guarantees of anonymity So what should the public do NHS Englands chief data officer Dr Geriant Lewis believes the fears are unfounded If you believed everything you read about this you would think the NHS was either about to give away everyones confidential data free of charge or flog it to the highest bidder  Needless to say we are doing no such thing to do so would be unethical illegal and unconstitutional But he adds people do have a choice pointing out the leaflet arriving on the doormat contains information about the project and the and the options open to patients  including how to opt out Just dont throw it away
