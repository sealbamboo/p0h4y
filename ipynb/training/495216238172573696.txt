After months of debate and uncertainty, the World Health Organization has released a proposal for naming biosimilars, which are designed to emulate brand-name biologics and are forecast to save untold billions of dollars in health care costs in coming years.. At issue is whether biosimilars should be given the same International Non-Proprietary Name, or INN, as brand-name biologics. The global INN system is overseen by the WHO, which has held several meetings to resolve the question. And a key point of contention is whether different INNs would hamper substitution needed for lowering health care costs, and this has divided the pharmaceutical industry.
