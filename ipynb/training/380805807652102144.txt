He hasnt done anything yet to cause me concern but I know its coming I know that one day something will happen Garner said More than  million people worldwide live with dementia today according to a new report By  that number is expected to more than triple to  million The majority require constant care theyre dependent  and that dependence can impact their loved ones in unmeasurable ways  People with dementia have special needs for care the report from Alzheimers Disease International says They need more personal care more hours of care and more supervision all of which is associated with greater caregiver strain and higher costs The  World Alzheimers Report titled Journey of Care examines global trends related to older people who need dementia care including those with Alzheimers disease  In the early stages of dementia patients become forgetful They get confused about the time or their location Decisions are difficult As the disease progresses patients have a harder time communicating and caring for themselves By the final stage patients can no longer recognize their loved ones eat without assistance or even move Its a slow torturous decline Garner says Jim breaks some things and loses others He provides offthewall answers to peoples questions Hes emotionally detached from their two kids aged  and   She worries that her kids wont remember what an awesome father Jim was He was the dad who got up in the middle of the night to help with feedings and change diapers He read to the kids played with them took care of them when they were sick Garner is brutally honest about the impact the disease is having on the family It would be a little bit easier if he would just decline quickly and get it over with Garner said But unfortunately Alzheimers doesnt work that way  People with Alzheimers live on average four to eight years after theyre diagnosed but some may live  years beyond their initial diagnosis  Caregivers whether theyre family or professionals share many traits the World Alzheimer Report notes they often do demanding work with minimal training or preparation Theyre also underpaid and undervalued Professional caregivers usually earn minimum wage and often report poor job satisfaction Family members of course earn nothing and make many personal sacrifices to care for a loved one  Because of the progressive nature of the disease and the length of its duration Alzheimers care needs only escalate often to the point of impacting the caregivers own health Angela Geiger chief strategy officer of the Alzheimers Association said in a statement  And the problem is getting worse Increasing life expectancies and an aging population are creating a group of seniors thats bigger than the workingage population that supports them the report says Approximately  of the population in developed countries now is currently over the age of  in  experts predict that number will rise to   The World Alzheimers Report identifies four areas in which specific actions could lead to improvements in the quality of care for people with dementia and seven strategies to make this care more affordable Overall the report authors say governments need to make dementia a bigger priority  No two families are alike in their needs for care and support and we need to find ways to make care more personcentred and care packages more flexible and individualised the report says Earlier diagnosis enables the person with dementia to make decisions about the care that they will receive Alzheimers disease cannot be prevented cured or delayed But experts say an earlier diagnosis may help patients live better daytoday The Alzheimers Association predicts that by  US costs for caring for the dementia population will total  trillion To compare the total cost worldwide in  was about  billion If dementia were a country it would be the worlds st largest economy the report says ranking between Poland and Saudi Arabia  Garner went back to work fulltime after Jim lost his job but she makes less than half what he did The family used to go on vacations and go out to eat without stretching their budget too much Now even backtoschool shopping is a financial burden  Its impacted us tremendously and I dont even pay yet for care of him Garner said When I have to hire someone for inhome care which insurance doesnt cover I have absolutely no idea how Im going to do it When Jim was diagnosed she was a woman on fire talking about Alzheimers all the time asking Jim about his bucket list encouraging him to write letters and tape videos for their kids But as time and his disease progress her life has become a daytoday struggle to live peacefully in the moment  Unless someone has a family member with Alzheimers she says they cant understand the overwhelming frustration that comes with it Financially Emotionally Dealing with the medical system Planning for the future  And when I say frustration that word is just not strong enough she says I read articles and I talk to people and I know whats coming Theres nothing I can do to stop it  If you or a loved one has Alzheimers visit   or call the Alzheimers Associations hour hot line at
