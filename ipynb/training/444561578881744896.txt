A sad fact None of the eight major clinical trials looking at whether regular mammograms reduce a womans risk of dying from breast cancer has included women over age  Older adults are frequently   a problem for those trying to treat them based on information not hunches This helps explain why the United States Preventive Services Task Force says   to assess mammographys value for those over age  and why the American Geriatrics Society cautions   Not only may mammograms not help like any medical procedure they may also harm Mammograms can result in false positives that require additional tests including biopsies and bring anxiety The scans may identify small tumors that wouldnt have caused problems for years  or at all since older women are far more likely to die from other causes Yet once a mammogram detects even a noninvasive cancer its very hard to decide not to be treated said Dr Mara Schonberg an internist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston Since most women over age  still get mammograms thousands of them undergo unnecessary surgery radiation and medication every year What women need she and several colleagues agreed is a decision aid a tool that clarifies a medical procedure and its likely results Once they understand the pros and cons of mammograms women can make better decisions based on realistic information about their risks she said Dr Schonberg who has investigated breast cancer screening among older women for years noted that women dont hear much about the cons  She and her colleagues decided to put together an page pamphlet written clearly at a sixthgrade reading level It points out that doctors dont know whether mammograms lower mortality in this age group Indeed there is wide   The guide estimates that out of  women over  three of those who get mammograms will die of breast cancer and so will four of those who dont a tiny difference  Its charts show that heart disease other cancers stroke and dementia are far greater threats to elderly women It even helps women calculate their life expectancy to see whether a mammogram is likely to extend their lives Then the researchers tried a small pilot study asking  women aged  to  whod had a mammogram within two years to use the pamphlet Did it help Maybe Sort of Yes the information did significantly   results published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine show The women scored higher on a truefalse test about the benefits and risks of breast cancer screening after they read the pamphlet than they had beforehand Yes it did lead to more conversations about the decision with primary care doctors In the five years before this experiment patient medical records showed only  percent had had such discussions In the six months after reading the guide  percent did And yes the proportion of this small group who intended to continue screening dropped substantially especially among those with a calculated life expectancy of nine years or less In that group  percent had earlier said they intended to get another mammogram after the guide  percent did The guide didnt make a significant difference in the group with a longer life expectancy Women said they liked the pamphlet and found it useful Their doctors said so too And yet  percent of these older women went ahead and got another mammogram within  months including more than half of those with a lower life expectancy It was tough to persuade women to start getting regular mammograms back in the s when the American Cancer Society and the former first lady Betty Ford began campaigning for annual screening Decades later its tough to get older women to stop Ditto for other cancer screenings       among both older men and women These decisions involve more than a riskreward calculation clearly When it comes to mammograms women go for reassurance for affirmation of their health Dr Schonberg said Her own studies show that they felt this was the responsible thing to do what Dr Alexia Torke associate director of the Indiana University Center for Aging Research has termed a moral obligation Some women dont recognize that theres a decision to be made at all Radiologists send you an annual reminder card Dr Schonberg said Youre just told go The Preventive Services Task Force recommendation is every two years not annually up to age  Still this remains an individual decision Women who see the whole picture and decide to continue with mammograms  Medicare pays for one each year  at least have reached an informed decision So I hope Dr Schonbergs pamphlet gets widely circulated Shes about to test it with a much larger sample of about  women in Massachusetts and North Carolina then report her findings And then well publish a link to the guide here for anyone to use
