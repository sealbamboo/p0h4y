If you want to teach kids to adopt healthier eating habits its probably unwise to give them coupons for fast food chains at school And those advertisements for sugary sodas on the gymnasium scoreboard Seems like another mixed message schools are sending kids Thats why the White House and US Department of Agriculture proposed new   Tuesday aimed at cracking down on the widespread marketing of lessthannutritious foods to kids on campus during the school day Even though  percent of school districts are now meeting the overhauled nutrition   students are still being flooded with advertising for junk food in schools according to first lady Michelle Obama The idea here is simple Our classrooms should be healthy places where kids arent bombarded with ads for junk food said Obama who joined USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack to announce the guidelines Because when parents are working hard to teach their kids healthy habits at home their work shouldnt be undone by unhealthy messages at school she added in a statement And that messaging is everywhere Food and beverage companies spent  million to market their products in schools in  according to the Federal Trade Commission Advertising for sodas and other sugary drinks accounted for more than   of this spending followed by fast food Beverage companies used to sell a lot of sodas in schools Nowadays their vending machines are selling juice and water instead Even so critics note the same companies are still selling directly to kids Meanwhile nearly twothirds of elementaryschool kids receive coupons for fast food at school through programs such as Pizza Huts Book It Program which uses pizza as a reading incentive according to   published last month in   The proposed rules would limit such exposure by allowing only ads and marketing in schools for foods that meet the   nutrition guidelines Those standards which are set to go in effect in the  school year stem from the  Healthy HungerFree Kids Act They aim to boost the healthfulness of foods sold through vending machines snack bars and a la carte in cafeterias Under the stricter guidelines vending machines branded with images of Coke or Pepsis sugarsweetened sodas would no longer be allowed in schools Same goes for branding for sugary drinks and snacks on posters and cups The snack rules set limits for how much fat sugar and sodium snacks can contain But they only apply during the school day So foods sold at afterschool games for instance are exempt Tuesdays announcement comes as the first ladys Lets Move Initiative to combat childhood obesity marks its fourth anniversary this month Advocates for limiting food marketing to kids hailed the announcement as an important step forward Given the high rates of childhood obesity and childrens poor diets it doesnt make sense to advertise and market unhealthy food to children at all much less in schools Margo Wootan nutrition policy director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a   Parents know from experience and studies show that food marketing affects kids food preferences food choices and health Others applauded the new guidelines but worried that they didnt go far enough For instance the new rules wouldnt ban charity events linked to fast food chains such as McCare nights  fundraisers in which students and their parents are encouraged to eat at their local McDonalds The franchise then donates a portion of sales to the school Wed love to see the Lets Move campaign take on this predatory marketing to kids that happens across the board says Sriram Madhusoodanan a senior organizer with Corporate Accountability International a watchdog group that has been calling on McDonalds to stop such marketing to kids Indeed its still unclear just how the guidelines which have yet to be finalized will be applied In part thats because schools will be given leeway to decide for themselves what constitutes unacceptable marketing And the Associated Press   that the rules will make some exemptions for big infrastructure costs Also announced Tuesday an expansion of efforts to feed hungry kids through school Starting on July  more than  schools nationwide serving mostly lowincome kids will be allowed to serve all students free breakfasts Right now millions of children in this country are showing up to school hungry every day the first lady said As we recently   more than  million schoolchildren ate free or reducedpriced lunches last year Under the expanded program an additional  million kids will be eligible to receive the free meals Obama says
