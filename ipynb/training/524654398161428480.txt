While Ebola stokes public anxiety more than  in  hospitals  including some top medical centers  are having trouble stamping out less exotic but sometimes deadly infections federal records show Nationally about  in  hospitalized patients   Some  people die each year from them  more than from car crashes and gunshots combined A Kaiser Health News analysis found  hospitals with higher than expected rates for at least one of the six types of infections tracked by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In  states and the District of Columbia a quarter or more of hospitals that the government evaluated were rated worse than national benchmarks the CDC set for at least one infection category the Kaiser analysis found The missteps Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital made this month in handling an Ebola patient echo mistakes hospitals across the nation have made in dealing with homegrown infections Dr Kevin Kavanagh a patient safety specialist from Kentucky said hospitals often fail to strictly follow protocols to deal with infectious diseases and the governments standard responses arent specific enough Right now there are too many recommendations on how to handle infectious diseases too much leeway he said A   in the   underscored the problem While hospitals have reduced the frequency of many infections over the last decade they could do better if staff complied fully with recommendations Those include diligent attention to handwashing and using stringent   when tubes are being inserted such as covering patients from head to toe with a sterile drape and wearing sterile caps masks gowns and gloves The percentage of time that health care providers do all of the things they are supposed to do when caring for a patient with a contagious disease can be pretty low said one of the authors Dr Don Goldmann chief medical and science officer at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement a nonprofit in Cambridge Mass Theres a lot of room for improvement Goldmann said that hospitals tend to become more focused on following procedures when facing novel highly publicized outbreaks such as Ebola When an infection risk has been around for a long time it kind of becomes part of the background he said Since  the federal government has been analyzing and publishing the CDC rates for specific hospitals on   website Starting this fall Medicare is considering infection rates when deciding how much to pay hospitals The CDC reports six categories of infections those from flexible tubes inserted into veins to deliver medicines or nutrients infections from catheters that drain bladders two antibiotic resistant germs   and Methicillinresistant   and two surgical site infections after hysterectomies and colon operations States with more than a quarter of hospitals having at least one high infection rate in the CDC data were Arizona California Colorado Connecticut Florida Massachusetts Montana Nevada New Jersey New York Rhode Island South Carolina and Utah according to   Three highly regarded institutions  New YorkPresbyterian Hospital in Manhattan Geisinger Medical Center in Danville Pa and the University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor  were among seven hospitals the CDC rated as having worse rates for four of the six infections Kaiser found The CDC data based on reports hospitals submit are considered the most reliable assessments that exist Still many hospitals the CDC judged as having worse rates disputed those verdicts They said that they look bad because they are more vigilant in identifying and reporting infections or because they handle very sick patients who are more prone to catching a bug For instance Dr Darrell Campbell Jr chief medical officer at the University of Michigan Health System said hysterectomies are performed on cancer patients at four times the rate than at other Michigan hospitals that compare information with each other Because cancer surgeries take longer than regular hysterectomies often involving removal of pelvic lymph nodes the chances of infection are greater he said When you adjusted for the cancer we dont look different from any of the hospitals he said Campbell said none of Michigans infection rates deserved being rated poorly Eventually well get where we are more comfortable with this data but were not there now he said New YorkPresbyterian said in a statement it has made significant improvements Geisinger said in a statement that its infection rates have dropped since  and that its MRSA rate appeared high because the hospital made a data entry error when it reported cases to the government Geisinger also noted that many patients who test positive for C diff never develop any symptoms but hospitals still must report it as an infection Some major teaching hospitals like Denver Health Medical Center Duke University Hospital in Durham NC and Mayo Clinics hospitals in Rochester Minn have been able to maintain low infection rates the KHN analysis shows Others are succeeding in controlling some infection types but not others according to the CDC data YaleNew Haven Hospital had lower rates of bloodstream infections caused by central lines but higher rates of infections from catheters inserted into the bladder to remove urine Since one of the main ways to avoid such infections is to remove the catheter as soon as it isnt essential the hospital now allows nurses to take them out without a physicians order under certain conditions said Dr John Boyce the hospitals director of epidemiology and infection control Busy physicians sometimes forget their patient has a catheter in but the nurses know he said Nationally   by a fifth and centralline infections decreased by  percent between  and  MRSA decreased by a third during that period Battling   is very different than fighting Ebola and in some ways harder because it requires hospitals to restrain use of the antibiotics necessary for so many patients When those drugs eliminate weaker bacteria from the intestines   is able to prosper Patients can get massive diarrhea and while   can be treated the worse cases may require surgery to remove the infected part of the intestines Other infections for which the CDC tracks but doesnt yet publish hospitalspecific rates known as   are impervious to nearly all antibiotics Reducing the frequency of   and these kinds of infections requires hospitals to become more judicious in deploying antibiotics But only about half of hospitals have established stewardship programs that help doctors use the appropriate antibiotics in the most effective doses without overdoing it researchers say We have increasing amounts of data that  percent of the antibiotics we are prescribing are inappropriate said Dr Kavita Trivedi a consultant and former infection control official for California It sounds crazy to people who are not in medicine Why would a patient be prescribed an antibiotic they dont need But it happens frequently because we dont know what they need
