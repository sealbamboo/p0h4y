The vast majority of women getting fibroids removed should not be treated using devices called morcellators which grind up a womans uterus so it can be easily removed the Food and Drug Administration said Monday The FDA issued a revised warning saying the chopping process can spread undetected cancer in women and should only be used in very specific cases As many as one in every  women having the procedure to remove uterine  have tumors in the uterus that havent been diagnosed the FDA says Using the  can break up and spread the tumors inside the womans body We believe that in the vast majority of women the procedure should not be performed Dr William Maisel of FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health told reporters But the main group representing gynecologists says the FDAs guidance is confusing and doesnt take into account all the variables and uncertainties Morcellators are commonly used to remove fibroids but they can also be used in other procedures such as removing a   and those procedures pose a much lower risk The risks have been known for months and one manufacturer even asked doctors to return its device but they are still being used too commonly the FDA says It says the devices need to be more clearly labeled so doctors wont use them in the women at risk of having undetected cancer Today the US Food and Drug Administration is taking immediate steps to help reduce the risk of spreading unsuspected cancer in women being treated for uterine fibroids the agency said in a statement Uterine tissue may contain unsuspected cancer The use of laparoscopic power morcellators during fibroid surgery may spread cancer and decrease the longterm survival of patients FDA added Theres only a small group of women who might safely be treated using For example some younger women who are interested in maintaining their ability to have children or wish to keep their uterus intact after being informed of the risks may be candidates for this procedure But Dr Hal Lawrence executive vice president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says FDA didnt consult his group and says some of what the FDA is saying is confusing I am not saying that we totally disagree with the FDA Lawrence told NBC News I think the way its stated is a little confusing The problem is that theres no good test to distinguish between a fibroid  which is almost always a benign growth on the uterus  and a tumor or a precancerous growth Lawrence says The overwhelming majority of fibroids are totally benign fibroids he said The FDA guidance suggests that the morcellators should only be used in young women  for example to remove fibroids but allow a surgeon to repair the uterus But there are also older women who may have had a fibroid for years who are having surgery for another reason Lawrence says In those cases its pretty clear the fibroid isnt a tumor and they could safely be operated on with a morcellator There are some important benefits to using morcellators Lawrence says They can help reduce the dangers of more invasive surgery so women can recover faster An estimated  US women get hysterectomies every year Maisel said about  percent of hysterectomies are done because of fibroids and about  of these use laparascopic or keyhole surgery which can include morcellators
