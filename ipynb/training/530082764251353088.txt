If theres one thing college kids do best its thinking creatively Often operating with limited resources and tight deadlines theyre used to coming up with ingenious solutions to lifes everyday problems usually on little sleep So its no surprise that experts are turning to students for help in battling one of this years most pressing global health issues the Ebola outbreak The US Agency for International Development announced a  million   in October signaling the urgency to develop better protective gear for health workers in West Africa Recognizing that grads and undergrads are in the perfect position to come up with clever ideas some of Americas most prominent universities have organized their own design challenges and emergency hackathons to get students brains churning Challenge accepted Working between classes and into the night     students have been hacking Ebola from every angle Take for example how to improve the appearance of an Ebola protective suit You might think aesthetics is the   thing innovators should worry about but consider this For people in West Africa when they look at somebody in full protective gear it is pretty scary says   vice president of innovations at   a global health nonprofit affiliated with Johns Hopkins University Thats one of the reasons that people are afraid to come to the treatment centers Sanghvi helped organize a   two weeks ago at Hopkins in Baltimore where a team of engineering students and textile experts are working on making the gowns look friendlier Something as simple as adding name tags to the suits and developing a face protector that shows more of the face  to increase eye contact  can make a difference he says At Columbia University whose engineering and public health schools launched a twoweek design challenge in early October a team is   with a variety of colorfully patterned aprons that can be worn over antiEbola suits Team member and engineering student Ramya Ahuja   the universitys student newspaper that they studied traditional West African patterns to make their designs culturally appropriate Another Columbia group thought of using colorchanging bleach to help health workers confirm that theyve fully disinfected every part of their suits Still another developed a lightweight cot that workers can use as a stretcher to transport patients and can double as a bed Students think practical and they think outside the box says   an epidemiologist at Columbias Mailman School of Public Health and one of the challenges organizers Students she notes arent encumbered by knowing the limitations While students dont have all the answers they make up for it with unbounded enthusiasm says Aditya Brahmabhatt A recent graduate of New York Universitys engineering school the yearold mechanical engineer organized an Ebola hackathon at his alma mater last weekend that drew about  professional coders data scientists and students They were really excited to be given a chance Brahmabhatt says People are looking for  these things where they can come and make a difference For a group of Kenyan students at Duke University their ties to Africa were enough reason to get involved in their schools innovations challenge which launched last week We recognize that this Ebola outbreak could happen in Kenya says Dorothy Mangale  a global health student So in the spirit of brotherhood or neighborliness we decided that this was going to be an important issue for us Mangales group includes global health medical and computer science students Together theyve come up with a mobile application with a decision tree The tree would help people figure out whether a persons symptoms warrant a visit to an Ebola clinic It would also alert health workers to any suspected cases so they could send an ambulance as soon as possible For global health students learning about epidemics of the past It was hard for them to relate to what they were studying in the classrooms says Kyle Munn the program coordinator for Dukes   who helped organized the universitys Ebola event So this gave them an opportunity to apply their learning to a current realworld challenge NYUs Brahmabhatt says he wants to see even more US schools involved Its really sad to see that every university is not already doing this he says Every university has computer scientists data scientists anthropologists and epidemiologists Coupled with the creative minds of passionate students he says this creates just the right balance of knowledge and skills for generating quick and innovative solutions The most promising ideas resulting from the Ebola hackathons will either be entered into USAIDs Grand Challenge or will be sent for fieldtesting and product development And those ideas dont necessarily have to come from a large event Back in September at Emory University one lecturer asked her introductory biology class to come up with a faster and cheaper way to test patients for Ebola She intended for them to explain the science in an upcoming quiz for bonus points  but got a surprise when two students took her   Freshmen Brian Goldstone and Rostam Zafari both  came to her with an idea for cheap detection strips that can recognize the Ebola virus before the onset of symptoms The duo with the help of a few experts created an   and raised more than  last month to put their strips to the test
