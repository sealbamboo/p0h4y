Leukaemia research may lead to new drugs for difficulttotreat breast cancers say scientists  These types of tumours cannot be treated with the targeted drugs which have hugely improved survival A team in Glasgow says a faulty piece of DNA which causes leukaemia also has a role in some tumours and could help in research for new drugs Meanwhile other researchers say they have taken tentative steps towards a blood test for breast cancer Oestrogen or progesterone positive breast cancers can be treated with hormone therapies such as Tamoxifen Another drug Herceptin works only on those tumours which are HERpositive But around one in five breast cancers is triple negative meaning chemotherapy radiotherapy or surgery are the only options A team at the University of Glasgow investigated the role of the RUNX gene which is one of the most commonly altered genes in leukaemia However they have now shown it is also active in the most deadly of triple negative breast cancers  Tests on  triple negative breast cancers showed patients testing positive for RUNX were four times more likely to die as a result of the cancer than those without it The results were published in the journal PLoS One  One of the researchers Dr Karen Blyth said This opens up the exciting possibility of using it RUNX as a new target for treatments She told the BBC First we need to prove this gene is causative to the cancer if it is then what would happen if we did inhibit it Theres a couple of drugs in development in the US to target this gene from a leukaemia point of view if they work we can test it in breast cancer cells However the gene has a complex role Normally it is vital for cell survival and plays a critical role in producing blood However depending on circumstances it can either encourage or suppress tumours It means any use of a drug to target the gene might cause sideeffects Dr Kat Arney the science communications manager at Cancer Research UK said Theres still so much we need to understand about triple negative breast cancers as they can be harder to treat in some people Almost two out of three women with breast cancer now survive their disease beyond  years  But more must be done and we urgently need more studies like these particularly in lesserunderstood forms of the disease to build on the progress weve already made and save more lives   In a separate development scientists at University College London think they have taken the first steps towards a blood test for breast cancer  They found changes in the DNA of immune cells in the blood of women who were at high risk of breast cancer as they had inherited the BRCA risk gene  Prof Martin Widschwendter from UCL said Surprisingly we found the same signature in large cohorts of women without the BRCA mutation and it was able to predict breast cancer risk several years before diagnosis They think it could become the basis of a blood test Dr Matthew Lam senior research officer at Breakthrough Breast Cancer said These results are definitely promising and were excited to learn how further research could build on these findings
