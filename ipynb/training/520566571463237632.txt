Love respect integration into communities work housing food and clean water Thats what mentally ill people like all human beings need Instead in many parts of the developing world people with mental illness are chained nearly starved and even locked in a cage with a wild animal like a   to scare the demons out of them The World Health Organizations   was launched in  to help improve mental health services around the world On this years   organized by WHO to raise awareness of mental health issues the theme is schizophrenia a severe mental disorder characterized by false beliefs hallucinations and unclear thinking We talked with Dr Taghi Yasamy senior medical officer in the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse at WHO about the plight of people with schizophrenia In general many people in lowincome countries believe that schizophrenia is the result of possession by evil spirits Beliefs like that are very common and people use different techniques to try to get rid of the evil spirits For example theyll chain people  to beds in the house to trees outside They might give them only water bread and pepper They believe the spirits will leave because they dont like pepper They might leave the mentally ill person in chains for as long as  days with just bread and water Or theyll expose them to a wild animal thinking the animal will scare the spirits away In some places theyll brush the skin harshly to get the spirits out In the lowest income countries its common to see such things The stigma is strong in many countries So families try to hide these patients They want to confine the person and they do unethical things like putting the patient in a cage In places where they are not rich enough to afford a cage they might chain the patient to a tree In some places where the literacy rate is higher and they have more resources and a good number of educated people they develop institutions to care for mentally ill people But the demand is so high people rush to these centers There may be nothing for the rural areas but in large urban areas the institutions fill up and there is not enough manpower to care for everyone The few mental institutions become just like jails and within them people can still be chained The institutions might say that its to keep the patients safe so they cant hurt themselves But this is a violation of human rights In Somalia and Afghanistan where we started the ChainFree Initiative there are now chainfree hospitals We established a committee within hospitals that included patients families and staff We train the staff we involve the relatives and friends who will be helping to provide services They have become more humane places for treatment not places to contain people When the patients feel better they go back to the community Patients need followup We get permission from the family first and then educate the community We explain that the patient is not being possessed He is ill If there is a good primary healthcare system mental health care can be integrated into the services within the primary care health centers Providers at these centers have already been trained to immunize children and on mother and child nutrition Weve developed guidelines and tools to help them deal with mental illness Thats true These are the invisible chains of the mind People all over the world need a higher level of psychological literacy In highincome countries between a third and a half of people with mental illness dont get services This is often due to attitude not access
