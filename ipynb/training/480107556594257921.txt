For many the World Cup represents the best in soccer religiously watched for amazing saves and incredible goals For nonsports fans the reason to watch the World Cup is more primal You have to consciously avert your eyes to avoid all the Hot World Cup Player Lists or as website Jezebel asks    Germanys Thomas Mueller and Portugals Cristiano Ronaldo both forwards have serious futbol skills but are almost as famous for their supermodel sex appeal The   protested over published photos of them swimming nude at the team pool victims of a paparazzi ambush What is it about soccer It is quite likely that elite soccer players are more attractive than the general population  they are young men who work out a lot spend a lot of time outside and who are generally healthy writes evolutionary biologist   a research scientist at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies at University of Zurich Furthermore fame wealth and success make you more attractive  Yeah but other professional athletes are rich and famous so it has to be more than that   Evolutionarily women were attracted to males because they thought theyd be good mates research indicates Strong jaws washboard abs muscular arms and legs once meant that a man would be a good provider making him a more desirable partner   At least some of the things that make for a good soccer player strong fast and healthy also make for a good husband and father says Postma  Soccer players like Ronaldo have lean welldefined muscles with almost no body fat Long legs powerful thighs and lean body are combined with high endurance levels  When it comes to male attractiveness there is a lot of emphasis on strength However  it might have been particularly important to have a high endurance performance says Postma who studied the attractiveness of Tour de France athletes People thought cyclists with better endurance were hotter  Soccer certainly requires endurance with players running about  miles during a game says Dr David Geier a sports medicine expert and orthopedic surgeon in Charleston South Carolina They have strong thighs and calf muscles to jump and change direction quickly  You basically have to run whenever needed for  minutes I would venture that many people in society couldnt do that Geier says  Interestingly not all positions are created equally People believe different positions require different skills which makes a player more or less attractive While fans may mourn Spains loss to Chile because it means well see less of defender Sergio Ramos others might think Ramos is meh because his position is not as skilled despite obvious evidence that he is certifiably hot Researchers discovered that people think forwards in both hockey and soccer are more attractive than defenders  Assuming that being a forward requires more athletic skill than being a defender this provides further support for athleticism being a trait that is preferred says Postma The bodies of soccer players are also close to western ideals of beauty  If you look back at sculptures of the Greek gods soccer players bodies look very similar he says Theyre much more in line with our traditional impression of beauty and what an ideal body can look like  Why do soccer players bodies stand out Football basketball baseball and hockey players demand such unusual body types drawing athletes from a smaller population  Those guys are enormous compared to soccer players Geier says  Theres also a psychological connection Soccer players dont wear helmets so its much easier to see them reacting dramatically after a great play The hugging kissing and emotional swagger also makes them sexier    forward and heartthrob Mario Balotelli and midfielder Daniele De Rossi also frequently celebrate by tearing off their shirts showing off their elite physiques  Being able to see their emotions and reactions on the field I think that adds to their attraction Geier says You get a better sense of who they are  Seeing who they are also allows us to see their symmetrical faces Kendra Schmid associate professor in biostatics at the University of Nebraska Medical Center has studied what makes faces attractive using the golden ratio a number believed to lead to the most beautiful shapes or buildings When it comes to faces it means the features are appropriately spaced the eyes for example are the width of one eye apart  In watching the World Cup she noticed that many players have attractive geometric features there upper lips seem proportionate their ear length equals nose length and the face divides in an equal third In other words the formula for hotness   I have noticed many of the soccer players do exhibit some of these proportions she says
