The school for husbands is in session in Niger Its part of an effort to bring down the worlds highest birthrate more than seven children per woman on average Thats a major problem in a country that depends on agriculture but has only a limited amount of land that can be farmed  much of Niger is desert  and ever more hungry mouths The current population of  million is expected to double in  years if the birthrate stays at its current level Jason Beaubien visited Niger this summer to see how the government is trying to bring down family size Hell report on this topic on the radio in the weeks ahead but gave Goats and Soda a preview of the schools for husbands which began in  as a program from the United Nations Population Fund In different communities men meet twice a month under a tree or in an openair classroom to talk about maternal health and contraception Its an effort to get people to accept contraceptives which is fairly controversial in Niger A lot of times they talk about child spacing  instead of using the word contraception which raises red flags with a lot of people In Niger having a big family was traditionally a sign of success a sign that youre rich youre doing well Youre a big man if you have a big family Yet now having a big family is becoming a huge problem Even the president talked about it being shameful this month for people to have  kids if theyre not able to feed them Theres a growing awareness that something has to give on the population growth Its like the soft version of Chinas onechild policy They dont come out and hit people hard and say this is what you have to do Theyre saying were going to make contraception available in all the health clinics Theyre trying to make contraception more acceptable to people to get the word out that not only is it OK for women to use contraception but that they should be using contraception At the health clinics theyve got traditional condoms female condoms IUDs injections Obviously the pill as well They have had some problems keeping these options all  in stock across a country But for the most part they are now available The issue is getting women to actually use contraception In this society you have to convince the men that its OK because thats how the decision is going to get made It tends to lean to guys who are a bit more mature and older people who are already influential in the community clergy I did talk to one guy who was  quite a bit older than his wife but younger than a lot of the men we saw in the school for husbands I asked whether he would want to have  children He was like Thats ridiculous When I asked how many he said Thats up to God But it is clear that younger men are expecting a smaller family than previous generations So that change is happening There is definitely a push to have women get married later not at  or  or  but in their late teens early s That shortens the period when they would be having children Some girls still are forced to marry at a young age But there was a case of a girl who went to court to stop her family from forcing her to marry her uncle in Nigeria Ultimately she was successful Theyre out there with a hoe growing one crop mainly millet as close to the river as possible The kids do the hoeing Kids are valuable because they can work the fields Infant mortality is going down so kids are surviving longer But people dont yet understand that they dont need to have as many kids because most of the kids are now going to survive to adulthood That wasnt always the case in the past
