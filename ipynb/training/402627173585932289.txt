Are military metaphors such as battling always appropriate when it comes to cancer asks Andrew Graystone In the summer of  the US government was under pressure  After  costly years of deployment in Vietnam the public appetite for war was evaporating and President Richard Nixon was beginning to withdraw troops    It was against this background that on  December  Nixon signed into law the National Cancer Act  He committed bn to what became known as the war on cancer  Having failed to subdue the Viet Cong Nixon hoped that taking on an enemy that directly affected millions of Americans would deliver him the most significant victory of his presidency   Nixon didnt defeat cancer of course but he did transform the rhetoric we use to talk about it  Up to that point cancer had been a shameful secret in many families Often cancer patients werent even told what they were suffering from  Film actor John Wayne coined the phrase the Big C to avoid naming the disease But through the s cancer gained a new vocabulary  For  years the language of warfare has dominated cancer discourse  We have given cancer a personality and made an enemy of it so that today its commonplace to speak about battling cancer fighting cancer even kicking cancer Oncologists are painted as heroic warriors the SAS of the medical world  sometimes fighting hand to hand with scalpels sometimes using lasers ray guns and chemical weapons  In reality cancer is a collection of many different diseases but we have turned them into a single adversary Its probably no coincidence that this has happened at a time when the US and the UK have been engaged in the equally abstract and seemingly unwinnable War on Terror  The language of warfare can work well for cancer research organisations  In the competitive marketplace of charities they need to create simple campaign messages to evoke a response Natasha Hill from Cancer Research UK says that donors respond well to messages that personify cancer and treat it as an enemy  So the advertising agency that designed Cancer Research UKs recent Race for Life campaign wanted to turn their traditional sponsored runners into an army who run dance and sing all up in cancers stupid stupid face with the new line of Cancer Were Coming To Get You  There are effectively two cancers  The objectified cancer of the campaigns and research programmes exists only in the abstract and it has been so stubbornly unbeatable that its taken on a mythical status It offends our evolutionary optimism  the sense that whatever is bad in the world will eventually be defeated by human skill and ingenuity  Perhaps its not going too far to say that the war on cancer is actually a battle against death itself   But the individual personal cancer that around a third of us will experience is different  Some people who have cancer find the language of battle useful  but not all of us  Some of us need new metaphors that come closer to our own experience  When I was diagnosed with cancer four years ago the language of warfare jarred with me  It was partly because Im not really the fighting kind and partly because frankly there wasnt much that I could do to fight my cancer  Like most cancers mine was out of reach I couldnt see it or touch it I couldnt operate on myself or prescribe medication My chief aim was to live well with cancer and then hopefully to live well without it  And yet I felt a strange expectation that I should declare civil war in my body These were my cancer cells  part of me that I had unwittingly created  I found it hard to like them but I didnt feel it would help to turn my body into a war zone I dont like all the parts of my body equally but as a rule I try not to hate any of them Prof Michael Overduin of Birmingham University researches cancer at a molecular level  He knows that talk of designing warheads to target cancer cells with minimum collateral damage has an immediate appeal to funding agencies But he sees his work as more of a puzzle to be solved than a battle to be won Cells work together like the players in an orchestra playing a symphony he says  But if a cell is malfunctioning it produces dissonance  The instrument may need to be retuned or the cell retrained    Poet and priest Jim Cotter describes his cancerous bone marrow as like a garden that has become overgrown with weeds The weedkiller that takes out the weeds also damages the healthy plants  But with luck the good plants may regrow   St Francis of Assisi  who had longterm illness himself  is said to have spoken about Sister Illness  He embraced his illness like a family member  For me cancer arrived as an unwelcome lodger parking itself in the back room and demanding attention For three years I tried to be a courteous if unwilling host  Eventually the time came to invite my cancer to leave  She has left the place in a bit of a mess and Im conscious that she has kept the key Still Im hopeful that in due course all I will be left with is the rich memory of time spent with a stranger I never expected to meet
