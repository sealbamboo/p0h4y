After a devastating earthquake hit Haiti in  governments and foundations from around the world   more than  billion to help get the country back on its feet Only a fraction of the money ever made it And Haitis President Michel Martelly says the funds arent showing results Roughly  people still live   Many others simply moved back to the same shoddily built structures that proved so deadly during the disaster Martelly says the relief effort is uncoordinated and projects hatched from good intentions have undermined his government We dont just want the money to come to Haiti Stop sending money he tells Shots Lets fix it he says referring to the international relief system Lets fix it Disaster specialist   from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine agrees with Martelly Clearly we saved lives he says Clearly we put people in tents Clearly we did all kinds of stuff But at the same time the level of chaos and the overall ability to reach needy people we dont know how well we did Kirsch whos been in Haiti several times since the quake added We could have written a check to everyone in Haiti for  I dont know   a piece which would support them forever rather than the way we spent it So where did all that money go We got to put that question to reporter   author of the new    He was Haiti bureau chief for The Associated Press at the time of the quake Here are highlights from the conversation edited lightly for length and clarity Katz Money did what money tends to do in most foreign aid situations That is rather than being a model in which a rich country gives a poor country a big bag of cash and says Here spend this on fixing things up from whatever the latest crisis was what actually happens is that very little of the money actually leaves the donor countries First of all youve got billions of dollars that are promised but just never delivered Youve got billions of dollars more that were sort of creative accounting Donor nations say theyre providing debt relief yet those debts were never realistically going to be paid back So some of the money is sort of fictive Even among the real money if you look at what was labeled as humanitarian relief in the months right after the quake that amounts to about  billion Ninetythree percent of that money either went to United Nations agencies or international nongovernmental organizations or it never left the donor government So you had the Pentagon writing bills to the State Department to get reimbursed for having sent troops down to respond to the disaster If were talking about reconstruction its really a misnomer to think that relief aid was necessarily going to have the effect of rebuilding a country in any shape or form BandAids Literally bandages Shortterm relief Tarps to put over your head Food to fill emergency gaps in supply But food gets eaten Tarps wear out BandAids get pulled off And ultimately all that money is spent but people arent left with anything durable When you hear about all these billions of dollars in aid donations the imagination is that theyre going to go and rebuild the country after the earthquake They were never intended to do so and lo and behold they didnt What is interesting about Haiti is the extremes There are lots of places that have weak governments but Haitis government is weak in a special way Its the product of so many years of aid going around the government and international efforts to undermine the government Presidents being overthrown and flown out on US Air Force planes and then reinstalled and then overthrown again That left the Haitian government in such a weakened state Then the disaster itself was also so much more extreme It was so concentrated It hit the capital city Whether your estimates for a death toll is in the  range or closer to the governments estimate of   in a city of  million people  its just an extraordinary number It was an incredibly horrific disaster It hit the country right at its heart and destroyed a government that was already weakened But beyond that the attitude that so many foreign aid groups have regarding Haiti is that you can basically come in and do whatever you want So there was no accountability no coordination People were just running around doing what they thought was best or what they thought was best for them And it really created a mess
