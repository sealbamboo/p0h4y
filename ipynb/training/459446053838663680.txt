One night early in my internship I received a frantic page for help from a fellow intern  Seasoned nurses had been unable to draw a patients blood which senior doctors had ordered be done if his fever spiked so theyd called the covering doctor the firstyear resident on call For more than an hour he had poked at the patients arms and legs littering the floor with bloodstained gauzes used alcohol swabs and crumpled syringe and needle packaging When the patient finally kicked him out of the room howling Ill hit you if you come near me again he called the only people he thought he could the other interns  We didnt have to draw blood in medical school he confessed his eyes red behind his Harry Potter spectacles My med school didnt think it was important for us to learn One of us did manage to get the required blood but for the rest of the week we were haunted by the feeling that any one of us could easily have been in the same situation  We had all endured four years of medical school and we believed that all our lectures exams and national standardized tests had made us ready to be real doctors or at least capable interns But the reality was that in some cases we were unable to carry out even the most routine duties The intern who did get the patients blood on her first try had had plenty of phlebotomy experience in medical school But she confessed she didnt know how to prepare a patient for surgery and had had to ask another intern to write the preop checklist on an index card that she could keep in her white coat pocket The intern who wrote up the checklist came from a medical school where students prepared a lot of patients for surgery but rarely did anything in the operating room When asked to assist on a minor procedure during her first week she had been so awkward and unsure of herself that the scrub nurse burst out laughing  Memories of those anxious first months of internship rushed back recently when I  read   to improve the transition between medical school and residency training in the journal Academic Medicine Each July at teaching hospitals across the country the most seasoned residents leave to begin independent practice younger residents behind them move up a rank and freshly minted MDs take their place as interns at the bottom of the ladder  The   patient outcomes can suffer and young doctors can be particularly vulnerable to burnout Observers have long attributed the notorious   to the rookies who have stepped up to the plate  but in the wake of major reforms in the way doctors and residency programs are accredited medical educators have begun believing that theres another reason   Beginning in  accrediting organizations  how they might better assess the competency of young physicians Too much weight they thought was placed on counting the time spent in training and not enough on gauging measurable skills  To remedy this weakness they introduced a set of defined competencies to judge the preparedness of young doctors In the process however they discovered another serious flaw in the system Instead of working as parts of a seamless and wellconceived whole medical schools and residencies were operating independently of one another teaching and emphasizing aspects of medicine that werent always relevant to the next step of a young doctors career  One of the most glaring examples of this was the transition between medical school and internship Although for example most medical schools required that senior medical students complete a subinternship a month in the hospital as an acting intern few structured this requirement around   Moreover depending on the hospital the team of senior doctors and the medical schools particular educational philosophy the   with some students toiling away as fullon intern replacements and others languishing on the sidelines as extraneous observers  Educators in some of the smaller specialties like     and   responded first holding conferences and conducting specialtywide surveys to create explicit goals for students preparing for their internships   a panel of experts put together by the Association of American Medical Colleges   that medical students needed to have before starting a residency skills like   recognizing clinical emergencies and obtaining informed consent for procedures  Now educators in the largest specialty internal medicine which   of all medical students have begun a similar effort the article in Academic Medicine explains They distributed a questionnaire to their colleagues at residency training programs asking them what skills were necessary for students starting internships and  nearly  program directors responded And while their answers were not entirely surprising the degree to which they agreed was  The overwhelming majority believed that interns should show up on their first day of work knowing when to ask for help how to communicate well with nurses and how to manage their time Only  percent believed that new interns needed to have more medical knowledge or procedural experience before starting work   With so much agreement you might wonder why it has taken us so long to coordinate our education and training said Dr Steven V Angus the lead author and program director of the internal medicine residency program at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine in Farmington But we educators had this silo mentality and were thinking I know what my job is and someone else can deal with what happens to the students before or after  During the last attempt to create subinternship guidelines for internal medicine   for example   responded to the survey Guidelines emerged but the reaction was tepid like customers at an allyoucaneat buffet the majority of those in charge of the medical school subinternships picked only   But Dr Angus and his coauthors are optimistic about this latest effort For one it appears to be the largest collaboration ever taken between internal medicine educators in medical schools and residencies And with threequarters of the program directors responding to the questionnaire it also represents the most enthusiastic one a sign that old attitudes are changing  Were stepping out of our silos and talking a lot more now Dr Angus said And most of us are embracing the change because we know it will be better for our students and for the patients they care for
