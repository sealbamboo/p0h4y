 A leading consumer advocacy group along with nutrition experts and health agencies from a number of US cities are calling for lowering the amount of   Led by the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest CSPI the group on Wednesday sent a petition to the US Food and Drug Administration asking the agency to determine safe levels of   Currently the average ounce bottle of soda contains about  teaspoons of sugars made from highfructose corn syrup the CSPI said The American Heart Association currently recommends that men   and women no more than  teaspoons worth Some  million Americans of all ages now get more than onethird of their calories from added sugars the petition stated The consumption of such high amounts of sugar and highfructose corn syrup in sodas are causing serious health problems   diabetes heart disease among others said CSPI Executive Director Michael Jacobson Theres been a great deal of scientific evidence gathered over the past decade to support that link to health problems he said and were contending that much of the evidence centers around beverages The CSPI believes most   The group said its petition has the support of public health departments in Baltimore Boston Los Angeles Philadelphia Seattle Portland Ore and other cities as well as leading academics at Harvard and Yale universities and other institutions around the country According to Jacobson the FDA is legally bound to examine the health effects of the amount of sugar being consumed and take corrective action The center is first asking the FDA to determine the safe level of sugar in drinks Also it wants the FDA to issue   of other sugary foods and urge industry to voluntarily reduce sugar levels in those foods Jacobson said The third thing is to educate consumers to choose healthier foods and beverages he said The FDA classifies highfructose corn syrup sucrose and other sugars as generally recognized as safe Jacobson said What were asking the FDA to do is to modify those regulations and set some limits in beverages he said In the s the FDA twice committed to looking at limiting sugar levels in foods if new scientific evidence found sugar levels were harmful to the public or if sugar consumption rose Jacobson said We are reminding the FDA of that and saying you have an obligation to revisit this and protect the publics health he said It will take years before any action is taken but that gives industry time to adjust to using less sugar in drinks Jacobson said Jacobson said economic issues shouldnt be part of the FDAs consideration There are winners and losers for any kind of a regulation The sugar industry and the corn industry   would be losers but the soft drink industry might be winners he said The makers of nocalorie sweeteners would probably make out like bandits Jacobson said The CSPI hopes new sweeteners  such as rebiana made from the stevia plant  will replace highcalorie sugar making drinks healthier Although some people are concerned that these sweeteners may be harmful Jacobson said they are still a better option than sugar The FDA considers all these sweeteners perfectly safe Jacobson said We think the certain harm thats coming from the  teaspoons of sugar in a ounce bottle of soda greatly outweighs the speculative risk from artificial sweeteners he added We have an obesity epidemic on our hands with twothirds of Americans obese or overweight and that should take precedence over smaller concerns Jacobson said The sugar industry took issue with the new petition As we continue to debate the root causes of our nations obesity issue we need to rely on science and facts not look for quick fixes that draw focus away from developing real solutions to a complex problem said J Patrick Mohan the interim president of the Corn Refiners Association which represents highfructose corn syrup manufacturers And the American Beverage Association which represents soft drink makers said its industry is already making changes Today about  percent of all nonalcoholic beverages purchased have zero calories and the overall average number of calories per beverage serving is down  percent since  the ABA said in a statement issued Wednesday And according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Americans are consuming  percent fewer calories from sugar in soft drinks and other sweetened beverages than in  the group added Everyone has a role to play in reducing obesity levels  a fact completely ignored in this petition the ABA said This is why the beverage industry has worked to increase options and information for consumers Dr David Katz director of Yale Universitys Prevention Research Center said he joined the CSPI effort and is proud to have signed the petition The evidence that an excess of added dietary sugar in any of its many guises is a major contributor to the prevailing public health ills of our time is now essentially incontrovertible he said It stands to reason that lowering those levels will help in efforts to reduce the levels of obesity diabetes and other chronic disease Soda and other sugary drinks are the single biggest source of calories in the US diet with Americans on average consuming between  and  teaspoons  about  to  calories  of added sugars each day according to the petition Many teens and young adults consume even more sugar than the average Some get at least  percent of their calories from added sugar according to the  US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey The CSPI petition notes that cities around the country have taken note of the problem and have acted In New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is capping restaurant soda serving sizes at  ounces  a move that has met with considerable resistance from some who believe it tramples individuals rights
