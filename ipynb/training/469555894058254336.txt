Why are Americans so fat A new study suggests weve been getting it all wrong Its not that we dont exercise enough or spend too much time at the office or that good healthy food is too expensive researchers reported Thursday And its not about socioeconomic status race or geography Rather the main reason were getting fatter  all of us  is because we are surrounded by tasty temptations that cost very little from fast food menus to processed snack foods said the studys lead author Roland Sturm a senior economist at the RAND Corporation and a professor of policy analysis at the Pardee RAND Graduate School Up till now researchers have focused on group differences between rich and poor between those who live states like Colorado and Mississippi or between blacks and whites Sturm said But what weve really got to look at is changes over time for everyone he explained People arent becoming obese because they dont have enough money or because Southern hospitality makes you fat And they arent staying thinner because they live in a mountain state like Colorado This is something that cuts across the whole population Sturm reviewed the all the available research for a study published in CA Cancer Journal for Clinicians and concluded that everyone regardless of race ethnicity or socioeconomic status is gaining weight at about the same rate His graphs clearly show parallel tracks of increasing flab among all groups If we want to solve the obesity problem we have to figure out what has changed for everybody Sturm said And the thing that pops out is our food environment Thats where the action is And its not just that food is now cheap relative to income its also that its so much more convenient In the s Americans spent a quarter of their disposable income on food The most recent data show that share is now under onetenth And while cheap convenient food is a good thing our biology and our social norms havent caught up with the abundance Foods that can be massproduced and arent perishable like potato chips candy and sugarsweetened drinks are prime culprits We have a survival instinct that drives us to eat constantly because in human history starvation was the problem Sturm said Also our social norms are guided by that Weve been brought up to believe that its nice to offer food to guests Its like smoking There was a time when it was perfectly good manners when someone visited to offer them a cigarette Some researchers have suggested that part of the problem is the inaccessibility of healthy foods But the data show that fruits and vegetables for example have become increasingly available and affordable over the past decade he said While Sturm allows that Americans could eat more fruits and vegetables he argues that wouldnt make them any thinner Thats because fruits and veggies wouldnt replace other less healthy choices they would simply be consumed in addition to everything else But cost doesnt paint a full picture says Marion Nestle a professor in the Department of Nutrition Food Studies and Public Health at New York University who was not involved in the research This study attributes obesity to only one cause low food pricesIt does not discuss relentless marketing of cheap junk foods nor does it discuss Consumer Price Index data on the relative cost of foods she said noting that the cost of fruits and vegetables has gone up more than the average food cost The higher prevalence of obesity among people of lower income and education can be explained by greater consumption of lowcost highcalorie foods Other factors that seem to play into the obesity epidemic are the rise of electronic entertainment increased reliance on cars and a shift away from physical jobs to more deskbound ones Although Americans arent spending more time at work and have more leisure time today they do spend more of that time sedentary the researchers found Sturm may have offered up a new target but he doesnt have a silver bullet to aim at it He suggests small tweaks to prod people to make changes For example taxes on unhealthy food choices An economic incentive allows us to nudge people in the right direction he said It might be enough to start changing social norms In half a decade smoking changed dramatically Though we cant say thats all because of taxes and indoor smoking limits those tweaks probably helped
