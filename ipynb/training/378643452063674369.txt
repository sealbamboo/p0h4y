Human DNA is the ultimate fingerprint A single hair can contain enough information to determine someones identity  a feature thats been invaluable for identifying the unnamed casualties of natural disasters and war But forensic scientists who use DNA say the technology isnt always available where its most needed like in poor countries or in war zones like Syria The technology is often too expensive or too complicated and where there are large numbers of unknown dead you need far more than just DNA profiling equipment You also need sophisticated computer programs to organize and match DNA samples from numerous family members as well as experts to read the samples properly  a medical ethicist at Carnegie Mellon University says that while there are numerous groups that do DNA identification worldwide and the process is often ad hoc and erratic It was largely the Indian Ocean tsunami that got forensic experts thinking There were tens of thousands of unidentified bodies and DNA experts flocked to Thailand to set up labs Tom Parsons a DNA expert with the   says Thailand got the attention because western tourists died there Their governments sent teams to find their bodies but it didnt go well All of the worlds firstrate forensic teams took off to Thailand where white people were killed Parsons says with no centralized plan pushing and pulling Governments funded the effort because they wanted their citizens remains back But it was really a mess says Parsons Different groups wouldnt share their technology and even disagreed on how to do the DNA analysis There was little coordination Eventually Interpol the international police organization intervened The commission ended up identifying some  people mostly Thais who might not have been identified otherwise Parsons says in the end the DNA work in Thailand was a success but it revealed to forensic experts that there might be a better way to do this  that in fact a permanent organization with DNA chops money and an international mandate to respond to disasters might work better Our concern was that there should be a mechanism in place that would allow access to DNA identification beyond just ability to pay London says Too often if there isnt a funder out there then people who are missing relatives wont get access to the technology So forensic scientists are calling for the creation of a DNA identification organization  one that functions much in the same way the International Atomic Energy Agency does which sends inspectors to nuclear facilities But   in an article in the journal   that a global DNA identification organization would face political obstacles especially from governments at war with their own citizens
