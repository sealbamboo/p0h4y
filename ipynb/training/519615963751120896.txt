 Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. and activist investor William Ackman plan to boost their offer for Allergan Inc. by $15 a share, people familiar with the matter said, trying to keep the Botox maker from striking a rival deal.. The new bid could value Allergan at more than $56 billion, increasing the offer by $4.5 billion. That would make it the largest deal of the year if completed, surpassing AbbVie Inc.’s pending $54 billion acquisition of Shire PLC.
