 IQ is rising in many parts of the world Whats behind the change and does it really mean people are cleverer than their grandparents It is not unusual for parents to comment that their children are brainier than they are In doing so they hide a boastful remark about their offspring behind a selfdeprecating one about themselves But a new study published in the journal Intelligence provides fresh evidence that in many cases this may actually be true  The researchers  Peera Wongupparaj Veena Kumari and Robin Morris at Kings College London  did not themselves ask anyone to sit an IQ test but they analysed data from  previous studies Altogether they harvested IQ test data from more than  participants captured over  years and from  countries  Focusing on one part of the IQ test the Ravens Progressive Matrices they found that on average intelligence has risen the equivalent of  IQ points since  IQ tests are designed to ensure that the average result is always  so this is a significant jump The gains have not been evenly spread IQ has generally increased more rapidly in developing countries with the biggest leaps seen in China and India Progress in the developed world has been chequered  the data seem to indicate steady increases in the US for example but a decline in the UK  The new research is further confirmation of a trend that scientists have been aware of for some time In  James Flynn a philosopher and psychologist based at the University of Otago in New Zealand was looking through old American test manuals for IQ tests He noticed that when tests were revised every  years or so the testsetters would get a panel to sit both the old test and the new one  And I noticed in all the test manuals in every instance those who took the old test got a higher score than they did on the new test says Flynn In other words the tests were becoming harder  This became known as the Flynn Effect though Flynn stresses he was not the first to notice the pattern and did not come up with the name But if the tests were getting harder and the average score was steady at  people must have been getting better at them It would seem they were getting more intelligent If Americans today took the tests from a century ago Flynn says they would have an extraordinarily high average IQ of   And if the Americans of  years ago took todays tests they would have an average IQ of   the recognised cutoff for people with intellectual disabilities To put it another way IQ has been rising at roughly three points per decade This is a puzzle not just for the US but for all countries demonstrating the Flynn Effect Does it make sense Flynn wrote in one paper to assume that at one time almost  of Dutch men lacked the capacity to understand soccer their most favoured national sport So what is going on There are lots of theories none of which is particularly proven says Robin Morris One possible explanation has to do with changes in education In most of the developed world more people are now in school for longer and teaching methods have evolved moving away from the simple memorising of names dates and facts It seems like a reasonable assumption that education is training people to think better  But in fact the evidence is mixed There has been no clear correlation between the rising IQ scores and US school performance  in SAT tests for example  But school prepares children for sitting IQ tests in other ways  what the psychologist Arthur Jensen has called test wiseness  Over time students become used to the pressure of tests and they pick up examinationroom tactics that improve their performance A vivid demonstration of this emerges from a study of raw IQ data from Estonia When psychologists Olev and Aasa Must laid examination papers from the Estonian National Intelligence Test from the s alongside papers from  they found an increase in correct answers  and also incorrect ones The more recent students knew that they would not be penalised for guessing and getting something wrong James Flynn believes test wiseness may have been a factor in IQ gains in the US in the first half of the th Century However since then the amount of IQ testing taking place has  waned  and IQ increases have remained steady Flynn puts this continued progress down to profound shifts in society as well as education over the last century which have led people to think in a more abstract scientific way  the kind of intelligence measured by IQ tests  He cites the work of Russian neuroscientist Alexander Luria who studied indigenous people in the Soviet Union He found that they were very pragmatic and concrete in their thinking says Flynn and they werent capable of using logical abstractions or taking hypotheticals seriously  Luria put the following problem to the head man of one tribe in Siberia Where theres always snow the bears are white theres always snow at the North Pole  what colour are the bears there The head man replied that he had never seen bears that were any colour other than brown but if a wise or truthful man came from the North Pole and told him that bears there were white he might believe him The scientific methods of hypothesising classifying and making logical deductions were alien to him  Now virtually all formal schooling when you get past the sixth grade into high school and college means that you take hypotheses seriously says Flynn This is what science is all about And youre using logic on abstract categories And this kind of thinking doesnt only occur in school  in  only  of Americans performed cognitively demanding jobs  now the figure is  and the work itself is far more intellectually demanding than it was a century ago Families are also smaller so children are exposed to more adult conversation at the dinner table than in the past Hothouse parenting  pushing your kids to achieve goals from an early age  may also be a factor And when it comes to older people a lower disease burden may have an effect on their performance in tests  Such effects have diminishing returns after countries become fully industrialised Flynn says which may explain why in some North European countries including France and Scandinavia IQs have flatlined or diminished slightly He admits that the pattern in Europe is a little baffling but he has an idea why IQ scores continue to rise in the US I think America is a society where economic and environmental differences are much greater than they are in Scandinavia And for example black Americans have terrible schools and they have had terrible conditions to live under  A few other possible causes for the Flynn Effect have been put forward some of them very intriguing  One proposed by Arthur Jensen but yet to be investigated points to the spread of electric lighting The thought is that light from bulbs TV screens and the like may have contributed to cognitive development in a similar way that artificial light stimulates growth in chickens Then there is the theory that todays world is more visual than the world of  years ago The Ravens Progressive Matrices  the subject of the recent international study into the Flynn Effect by Wongupparaj Kumari and Morris  requires people to pick out patterns from an array of stripes and squiggles This particular test has seen the biggest IQ increases of all Perhaps television video games advertisements and the proliferation of symbols in the workplace have made it easier for us to decode pictorial cues and identify patterns There is also a debate surrounding nutrition In a  article in Intelligence Richard Lynn notes that measures of infants mental development increased in the UK and US at rates correlated to the increasing IQs of slightly older children Its difficult to see how Flynns theories are enough to explain this Are infants thinking more scientifically today he asks rhetorically  Lynn argues that prenatal nutrition is a determinant of birth weight which is in turn correlated to higher IQs A shortage of one particular nutrient  iodine  is known to stunt intellectual development in growing children A  paper examining iodine deficiency in China found that childrens IQ scores were higher in areas where there was no iodine deficiency and it increased after a programme of supplements started  So explanations of the Flynn Effect abound  but what precisely does it signify Do these steadily improving results indicate that the IQ test is not after all measuring intelligence Or are people really cleverer than their forefathers  I dont think smarter has anything to do with it says Flynn  Today we have a wider range of cognitive problems we can solve than people in  Thats only because society asks us to solve a wider range of cognitive problems People in  had minds that were perfectly adequate for remembering first cousins once removed they were perfectly adequate for ploughing a farm they were perfectly adequate for making change in a store Noone asked them to do tertiary education Its like a weightlifter and swimmer They may have the same muscles when they were fertilised in the womb but they would have different muscles at autopsy wouldnt they So today at autopsy certain portions of our brain for example those which use logic and abstraction would have been exercised more and look differently Other portions of the brain would have shrivelled a bit It may be then that certain abilities  problemsolving or reasoning ability say  have improved but a general underlying cognitive ability has not changed This general ability is fundamental to the way many scientists view intelligence  Although little is actually known about it there is supposed to be a general hereditary quality that makes an individual who is good at giving fine speeches more likely to be good at Sudoku too The problem is that this general cognitive ability is exactly what IQ tests are supposed to measure  in fact of all the components of the IQ test the Ravens test was supposed to be the truest measure of it If people arent becoming fundamentally more intelligent IQ tests arent doing what theyre supposed to do But Robin Morris is prepared to entertain the possibility that there may over time have been a real increase in general cognitive ability It seems to me that its reasonable to think that intellectual functioning could increase over time in more developed societies says Robin Morris  But do we actually notice in our midst a higher proportion of geniuses than there were in earlier generations Thats the baffling aspect Morris admits How could it go up so much but there arent all these very very smart people floating around And that is a bit of a puzzle But then people have started to say Maybe there are more bright people floating around and theyre kind of hidden away because of the way science has become very specialist Theyre working in their own particular field and theyre doing amazing things  theyre acting as geniuses  but theyre not necessarily identified as such Its an odd thought There are more and more geniuses out there if this theory is correct  but many of them are unrecognised
