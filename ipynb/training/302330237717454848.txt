 As patents on popular opioid painkillers OxyContin oxycodone and Opana oxymorphone start expiring makers of the brand products warn that the potential nontamperresistant generics are unsafe and some legislators are concerned as well Drugmakers Purdue and Endo Pharmaceuticals have taken steps to keep generic competition at bay and late last month Sen Tom Coburn MD ROkla a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and Rep Fred Upton RMich chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent a letter to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius asking for more information on the imminent release of nontamperresistant versions of extendedrelease opioids and the impact  on our nations struggle against prescription drug abuse When OxyContin was first released in  Purdue Pharma claimed the drug would be harder to abuse because of its extendedrelease formulation But users quickly learned to crush the tablet in order to release its full opioid punch right away So the company upgraded releasing an   that made the drug harder to crush chew or dissolve Endo Pharmaceuticals followed a similar path with Opana which was initially approved in  and got an abuseresistant upgrade in May  Both companies have voluntarily pulled the original versions of their drugs from the market But experts point out that Purdue and Endo likely had patent expiration on their minds when they made their pills harder to abuse Original OxyContin comes off patent in April  and generic versions of original Opana could be marketed as of Jan  Purdue has already filed patentinfringement lawsuits against several generic drugmakers including Watson and Teva and launched a   the purpose of which some say is to extend OxyContins patent by  months Endo has also been lobbying state legislators to prevent pharmacists from substituting generics that arent tamperresistant albeit with little success The company also   to block generic versions of Opana but the lawsuit was dismissed at the end of last year Its not difficult to be cynical about their motives for fighting the upcoming generics said David Juurlink MD PhD a drug safety researcher and internist at the University of Toronto The notion that generics that arent tamperresistant are going to make a huge contribution to the prescription drug abuse problem is probably not quite true On the other hand he said one could probably make the case that all drugs should be tamperresistant It wont completely eliminate abuse for sure it will not but it will make it difficult to misuse he said Steve Gelfand MD a semiretired rheumatologist in Myrtle Beach SC and a critic of opioid overuse said he felt having nontamperresistant generics on the market would indeed have an impact on addiction and overdose rates This is the one time we would tend to agree with Purdue about what could happen if they release those generics Gelfand told   Some researchers say the jury is still out as to whether making drugs abuseresistant can truly deter abuse   found that the OxyContin reformulation sent drug users looking for other pills that were easier to abuse The FDA is currently in the process of defining what qualifies a drug as tamperresistant per a provision slipped into last summers Prescription Drug User Fee Act PDUFA reauthorization known as the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act The deadline on that guidance is Jan  although its unclear what impact it would have on the development of generic OxyContin and Opana A   are developing abuseresistant drugs A statement from the Generic Pharmaceutical Association GPhA noted that generic drugmakers will comply fully with all FDA requirements and are committed to working with the agency to ensure the safety and quality of the medicines they make Impax Laboratories set to make generic Opana told   it has not yet shipped any product even though they were able to do so on Jan  The letter from Sen Coburn and Rep Upton asked HHS whether the FDA would have the authority to prevent the marketing of these drugs should they jeopardize the public health and whether Sebelius herself could suspend the approval of such generics if she finds a similar hazard It also asks for an update on the tamperresistant guidance due from FDA next week A spokesperson for HHS told   that the request was forwarded to the FDA which said in an email that issuing the draft guidance expeditiously is a high priority for the agency and FDA staff are working diligently to issue the guidance as soon as possible The HHS spokesperson said FDA and HHS are working together to draft a response to the CoburnUpton letter but could not give further details Juurlink practices in Canada where generics of original OxyContin came to market more than a month ago after the patent expired last November Several groups had protested approval of this agent with no success He said the solution for the problem in the US is easy If Purdue and Endo are primarily concerned about safety  let them put their money where their mouths are and sell their drugs at the same price as the generics Then he said the only people seeking out the generics would be the people intent on crushing them Source
