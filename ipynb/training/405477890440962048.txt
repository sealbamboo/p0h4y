The  HN swine flu epidemic killed up to  people across the globe  a death toll  times greater than initially estimated by the World Health Organization researchers say In a   published Tuesday in the journal Plos Medicine epidemiologists used data on respiratory deaths in  nations to calculate a global mortality rate for the pandemic Prior to this research the WHO counted just  labconfirmed cases of HN a viral infection of the airways This study confirms that the HN virus killed many more people globally than originally believed read a statement from Lone Simonsen a research professor in the Department of Global Health at George Washington University We also found that the mortality burden of this pandemic fell most heavily on younger people and those living in certain parts of the Americas Simonsen said The  pandemic was far from the worst such outbreak In  the Spanish influenza pandemic killed  million people roughly  of the world population at that time Nevertheless researchers said it was important for healthcare providers to understand the full impact of recent flu pandemics The relatively modest number of deaths estimated by the WHO prompted some to question whether the overall response to the  outbreak was excessive However Simonsen and her colleagues argued that labconfirmed influenza deaths would underestimate the broad reach of the illness Many influenzarelated deaths result from secondary bacterial infections or from exacerbation of preexisting chronic conditions and are not recorded as related to influenza infection authors wrote Among the findings that surprised researchers was the age and geographic distribution of deaths Most of the people who died   to   were younger than age  Traditionally seasonal influenza hits seniors the hardest The range in percentages for deaths under the age of  is due to a range of rates in the  sampled countries as well as different statistical methods used to calculate global deaths Researchers also calculated that flurelated deaths were  times greater in Central and South America than in European countries That finding stood in sharp contrast to an earlier US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the heaviest mortality rates occurred in Africa and Southeast Asia and that death rates in the Americas were lower The research was funded by the WHO and relied on viral illness and mortality data from  nations from  to  The sampled nations represented  of the worlds population and researchers then used statistical methods to calculate mortality rates for all nations The authors noted that their conclusions were limited by a lack of data from poor nations and other factors The true total mortality burden is likely to be even higher because deaths that occurred late in the winter of  and in later pandemic waves were missed in this analysis and only pandemic influenza deaths that were recorded as respiratory deaths were included authors wrote Researchers said that if deaths due to cardiovascular disease and other causes were included the death toll might be as high as
