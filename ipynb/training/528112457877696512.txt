Julia Levine asked a seemingly impertinent question while learning to shoot rifles in Vermont last fall Were the bullets made of lead Levine  of Stowe was starting a family and her companion at the allfemale retreat Doe Camp was pregnant High exposure to lead can put a woman at risk for miscarriage or birth defects At first he was very dismissive when I asked him his opinion on lead she said of the instructor He was one of those downhome Vermonters who have been shooting with lead from the beginning of time But thats not what the science says  which can cause serious neurological problems and even death is most often associated with peeling paint chips in old houses not recreational shooting But with more women and youth joining the  million Americans who enjoy gun sports experts say the use of lead ammunition can pose deadly risks In   children and teens at a Vancouver Washington indoor shooting club tested positive for lead poisoning according to a recent yearlong investigation by   A   revealed that the single largest source of lead exposure in children aged  to  was firing ranges Lead dust can enter the body in two ways inhalation and ingestion Unsafe exposure can cause nausea and fatigue organ damage and mental impairment Children are the most vulnerable to the effects of lead because their brains are still developing according to the   Negative health effects can be lifelong Yet many firing ranges host birthday parties and   where youngsters can ingest lead after touching contaminated surfaces I am familiar with at least one case where children were allowed to play in the earth backstop with their Tonka trucks while the range was closed said Jack J Giordano a shooting range safety and health specialist based in Scottsdale Arizona Unfortunately a lot of operators are unaware that overexposure to lead is a real issue he told NBC News When a gun is fired the base of a lead bullet can become airborne as microscopic particulate The bullet fragments further when it hits a target or backstop That entire area can be contaminated Police officers bring their kids to the shooting range to practice pitch for the baseball team and set up a ball catching net on the pistol range said Giordano When handling ammunition he said parents need to be aware kids shouldnt be eating or putting things in their mouth or drinking or eating on the range itself Federal regulations require operators to keep the range properly maintained workers must be trained and provided with protective equipment The dangers of lead poisoning are most acute at poorly ventilated indoor ranges According to the CDC thousands of Americans are   at the nations  to  indoor firing ranges despite health outreach efforts A recent CDC report found that between  and  a total of  Americans in police protection and  likely involved in target shooting had elevated blood lead levels The CDC blamed indoor ranges for failing to monitor for personal exposure and dry sweeping leadcontaining dust Workers are at greatest risk for chronic lead exposure when the ranges are not properly ventilated or cleaned One Kentucky firearms instructor told the Seattle Times she had such dangerous levels of lead in her blood that she was not allowed to breastfeed her newborn No levels of lead are safe for children according to the CDC In adults  micrograms per deciliter of lead in the blood is considered elevated and potentially harmful At  micrograms serious health problems can occur at  there can be severe brain and kidney damage Thats what worried Julia Levine at the shooting range in Vermont but both she and her pregnant friend went on to have healthy babies Levine said that despite her initial concerns the shooting experience was positive There is definitely a feeling of power and accomplishment in it she said Her instructor NRAcertified Larry Hamel said that he switched to copperjacketed bullets which encapsulate the lead Hamel president of the Lamoille Valley Fish  Game Club said he also monitored carefully where the two women stood on the range Why take a chance We err on the side of caution he told NBC News We have learned a lot about lead in the past couple of years We pay attention and take it to heart Lead sickens people
