Getting to see a GP in England is getting more difficult the official patient survey shows The poll of more than  patients found that in the last two years the proportion saying it was not easy to get through on the phone rose from  to  When they did get through  were unable to get an appointment the Ipsos MORI poll for NHS England showed But overall  rated the experience of making an appointment as good When they did get to see a doctor or for some a practice nurse  said their overall experience was good It comes after the British Medical Association BMA warned last week that patients would face longer waits to see a GP because of a shortage of doctors and squeeze on funding Speaking at the BMAs annual conference BMA GP leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul said waits of one or two weeks would become the norm This survey does not measure that but it does show that access is becoming a problem for a growing minority As well as  not being able to make an appointment  of those getting an appointment felt it was at an inconvenient time When asked about outofhours care which most GPs opt out of providing themselves twothirds rated it as good with  saying it was poor  up from  two years ago There are almost daily reminders of the pressures on general practice   A Health Select Committee report covering England says more than half of a GPs consulting time is taken up with patients with longterm conditions such as diabetes and arthritis   Some doctors complain of a struggle to keep up with the workload generated by a growing population and rising demand for services Now more than  patients have had their say through the NHS England GP Patient survey   The overall degree of satisfaction remains high at around   But all the main indicators show a decline in approval ratings sometimes  over two years  Access by phone to surgeries and experiences of outofhours services are areas where there is a significant minority of unhappy patients Ministers point out they have made more money available for general practice through the Prime Ministers Challenge Fund But there are increasing question marks over the ability of the primary care system to cope with the demands placed on it GPs argue the problem is caused by rising demands not being matched with by a corresponding rise in resources The number of annual consultations carried out by general practice has risen by  million since  hitting  million at the last count Meanwhile figures from the Royal College of GPs RCGP show the amount spent on practices   In  bn was invested in general practice when everything from spending on pay IT tests and drugs was taken into account the RCGP research found That compared with bn in  which is the equivalent of bn in  prices The Department of Health has already recognised access to GPs is an issue  It has launched a m Challenge Fund to extend opening hours and make greater use of technologies such as Skype and email  More than  practices  one in eight of those in England  have signed up Dr David Geddes from NHS England said Overall these results show that the majority of patients are positive about their GP services which is testament to the hard work of GPs and their staff  But we need to recognise the continuing trend in what patients are telling us about access to services However Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham warned It is getting harder and harder to get a GP appointment under David Cameron  The next Labour Government will invest m to help patients to get appointments within  hours or on the same day for those who need it Dr Richard Vautrey of the British Medical Association said the overall satisfaction results were remarkable considering the workload pressures GPs were under He added It is a concern that the results show signs of slipping backwards  The government must heed these early warning signs together with the recent falling GP recruitment figures and urgently invest in general practice
