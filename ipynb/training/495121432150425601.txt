Weight loss surgery should be rolled out to thousands more patients with type  Diabetes draft guidelines published by health watchdog the National Institute for Clinical Excellence NICE suggest But why cant overweight people just eat less and exercise more One victim of fat shaming shares her story Zaneta Jones from Newquay lost  stone kg after surgery and her diabetes is now in remission But this was not before she had dog excrement thrown at her after being accused in a national newspaper of wasting precious NHS resources She recalls the moment three years ago when she was abused My son had an accident while playing American football and was taken to hospital As we went in the door we had people having a go at us saying Youre that family from the paper you shouldnt be allowed in here youve wasted NHS money  my father hasnt had the cancer treatment he needs I went and sat in the car and I was too scared to go in  At the same time we had dog poo in carrier bags thrown at us We were called the scum of the earth It took a lot for me to go back outside again Like many people with obesity she had deep psychological and emotional problems  As a child in the s she was given slimming pills to counteract a family history of heart disease and her access to food was restricted When she started to work at the age of  Zaneta rebelled against her harsh dietary regime and her weight spiralled out of control At my absolute heaviest I was  stone and my BMI body mass index was  she says A healthy BMI is classified as  And what started as a teenage rebellion soon became complicated by fertility problems I tried doing silly diets like the cabbage soup diet things like that every time I would lose five or lb and I would think Thats nothing to  stone and I did actually give up Zaneta even had her jaw wired which she recalls was  months of just having a pint of skimmed milk and a pint of orange juice a day  Yes you lost weight  I lost  stone in that  months  but I was going to have a fertility operation and I didnt get it because I was lb overweight so I then put on  stone she says By this time Zaneta had taken to wearing mens clothes because there was nothing available for her size in womens shops And she did not only suffer diabetes  she had eye and kidney problems high cholesterol and sleep apnoea  all caused by her obesity  She could only travel by wheelchair because her weight made walking difficult Far from eliciting sympathy her size was highlighted in a national newspaper where she and her family were accused of wasting the NHS m in weight loss treatments The story still rankles on several levels Zaneta says she was never interviewed directly by the paper and that several important details including the costs quoted in the article were inaccurate   But even then it was not the abuse generated by the newspaper coverage that made her change  more the fear that she would lose her life The biggest shock was when I went to see my endocrinologist about my diabetes and she said if you dont do something you wont be here at the end of the year And he referred me to have the gastric bypass she says Before having the operation six years ago Zaneta had to reduce her BMI from  to  and to assist her with dieting she had a gastric balloon fitted for nine months  effectively reducing the amount she could eat The balloon was removed just before Christmas but there was a six week delay to allow her stomach to settle You can imagine that for someone who is addicted to food having to watch what you eat at that time of the year is torture she says But she managed to keep her weight under control and as for the gastric bypass itself she says Its supposed to be major surgery but it didnt feel like major surgery  I didnt feel much at all Zaneta is now in remission from type  diabetes and her other health problems have largely disappeared  She no longer needs a wheelchair
