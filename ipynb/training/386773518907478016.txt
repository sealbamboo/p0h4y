Imagine that suddenly you cannot recognise your mother your partner your child You can see them but your brain cannot process the information  you dont know whether they are smiling or understand their emotions  That is what happened to David Bromley after he suffered a brain injury that left him with face blindness David has prosopagnosia People with this condition can see the eyes the nose and the mouth what is known as the context  but they cannot see them as a whole They do not recognise gestures or emotions I can even recognise my wife if I walk into the house and know that she is there says David  But if Im in the street and she passes by and I dont know that she is going to be there I wouldnt recognise her David who lives in Essex had unknowingly been living with eye damage since birth  the arteries and veins were mixed up This eventually caused a partial loss of sight and damage in the brain which caused the prosopagnosia Perhaps the most difficult aspect of this condition is that people do not notice right away that something is wrong with them He remembers when he realised there was a problem I went to a reunion where I saw friends that I hadnt seen for  years We were pretty close but we went our separate ways On the way home he told his brotherinlaw Fran and Mickey havent changed a bit they are exactly the same And then I said hold on were they wearing tank tops What David was seeing was his memory of their friends back then My brain was telling me that there they were and what they looked like but that wasnt the reality  After that he discovered he was face blind There are two main forms of prosopagnosia developmental  where people fail to develop face processing abilities which is thought to affect around  of the population and acquired which develops after some form of brain injury and is much rarer Dr Ashok Jansari a cognitive neuropsychology expert from the University of East London said Acquired prosopagnosia is extremely rare because the type of brain damage is very specific It can be caused by damage to the back of the brain on the righthand side in an area known generally as the right occipitotemporal region David said I dont know whats worse  not being able to ever recognise people or at  years old  as it happened to me  suddenly not being able to recognise anybody He added that the worst part is the social embarrassment We were on holiday in Cuba and Id been snorkelling in the sea I was talking with this guy from Denmark when this woman swam up and said buenos dias and I went hello pleased to meet you thinking it was his wife but it was actually my wife and I hadnt recognised her David can see people perfectly well  but  or  minutes later he cannot recognise them He now tells clients If I ignore you Im not being rude it is just that I cant recognise you Sandra from London who only wants to give her first name is also afraid of social embarrassment   She had encephalitis  inflammation of the brain   years ago which left her with face blindness Even though her prosopagnosia is mild  she can recognise people she knew before her illness  she would rather not let people know because she does not want anyone to think she has some sort of incapacity Life with prosopagnosia is very shameful she says  She is teacher and at work almost nobody knows that she is face blind If I see someone every day I can recognise them But if one of the children says hi to me on the street I would know it is a student from the school but I wouldnt know who I dont say anything to the children I just work every day to learn their faces But she says Perhaps the reason why I dont mention it is because I dont want them to think that I cannot do my job because thats not true I dont want to feel ashamed or that people think that there is something wrong with me  Dr Jansari understands the feelings and fears of David and Sandra He knows of cases in which people have lost their jobs because of the condition  including a teacher who had difficulty recognising pupils causing problems when parents came to pick up their children at the end of the day Even though prosopagnosia is not recognised as a disability Dr Jansari thinks it should be treated as such in some cases This condition has no cure In the case of acquired prosopagnosia once a part of the brain is damaged it is not going to grow back so it is impossible to fix the problem he said With developmental prosopagnosia we dont know what causes it but hypothetically in the future if they find that there is a genetic cause that could be corrected  but that would be a very long way off Even though people develop strategies to cope  because people change their appearance they are not foolproof Dr Jansari says Once David thought that a photograph he saw was of George Michael but it was of me from a time when I used to have a goatee beard and a gold earring
