A woman who suffered  miscarriages over  years has had a baby boy after being given a drug normally used to treat malaria and rheumatoid arthritis Kelly Moseley from Birmingham endured  miscarriages each at about eight weeks before she contacted a miscarriage expert she had seen on television Hassan Shehata discovered that Kellys pregnancies were being attacked by natural killer cells present in her body and decided to treat her with hydroxychloroquine Initially Kelly continued to miscarry  including losing two babies at five months  before one year of taking the drug she found out she was pregnant and Tyler was born in April  He is now nine months old Kelly had been trying for a baby since  when she married her husband Alan Even though all her family and friends begged her to stop trying after so many heartbreaking miscarriages she refused to give up When she saw Mr Shehata interviewed about his work helping women who had experienced recurrent miscarriages she was encouraged and made contact with him Eventually she was referred to the consultant obstetrician and gynaecologists clinic at Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust in Surrey Mr Shehata and his colleagues had spent many years researching why some womens bodies reject pregnancies and their work was focused on natural killer cells which are present in everyones white blood cells He said We found that some womens natural killer cells are so aggressive they attack the pregnancy thinking the foetus is a foreign body  and thats what was happening to Kelly  Natural killer cells can be lowered by giving some women steroids  but for Kelly this didnt work so we tried an antimalaria treatment which also lowers the immune system  Mr Shehata said Kelly was the first patient to receive this treatment in tablet form of the immune modulator drug hydroxychloroquine Finally she became pregnant with Tyler and although the pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia he was safely delivered at  weeks weighing just under lbs I still cant believe Tyler is here Kelly says I just refused to give up hope and I hope our story encourages other women out there too I will never forget the babies Ive lost but having Tyler makes it all worthwhile Mr Shehata told BBC Radio  Live that he has since treated  to  women with the drug and found it had a  success rate Its important to say that its not the holy grail its not for treating everyone But hydroxychloroquine has been shown to be very safe in pregnancy Tyler spent a lot of time in a special baby care unit in Birmingham before he was allowed to come home but he is now preparing to celebrate his first birthday in April surrounded by the whole family A spokesperson from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said it was interested to hear that this drug could help women who suffer recurrent miscarriages who tend to have problems with their immune system but that it wasnt standard practice
