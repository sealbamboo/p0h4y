As latenight host Jimmy Kimmel so cleverly captured in a   some people on the glutenfree bandwagon dont know much about gluten or why precisely they should avoid it For the record gluten is a protein found in some cereal grains including wheat and rye Uncertainty about the effects of gluten on people who dont have   a serious autoimmune disease but who identify as gluten sensitive or gluten intolerant is rampant among doctors too As more and more patients experiment on their own with a glutenfree diet researchers are struggling to keep up with just how and why cutting out the gluten may be helping or hurting them But the gastroenterologists around the world whove been trying understand the gluten puzzle say theyre increasingly convinced of two key things One is that the number of people who are truly nonceliac gluten sensitive is probably very small Second they say that the people who say they feel better on a glutenfree diet are more likely sensitive to a specific kind of carbohydrate in the wheat  not the gluten protein That carbohydrate called   is a member of a group of carbs that gastroenterologists say is irritating the guts of a lot of people causing gas diarrhea distention and other uncomfortable symptoms Altogether these carbs are called fermentable oligodimonosaccharides and polyols or the cumbersome acronym FODMAPs If youre someone with a sensitive stomach and youve never heard of FODMAPs listen up In addition to fructan in wheat and garlic and artichokes FODMAPs include fructose found in some fruit lactose found in some dairy products and galactans found in some legumes While most people can digest FODMAPs with no problem for many with chronic gut disorders like irritable bowel syndrome theyre poorly absorbed by the small intestine and then fermented by bacteria to produce gas which leads to those unpleasant symptoms IBS affects up to  percent of Americans After a team of scientists at Monash University in Australia led by Peter Gibson and Susan Shepherd linked FODMAPs to IBS in  they designed the   According to   a gastroenterologist and professor of medicine at the University of Michigan the diet was swiftly embraced by doctors and dieticians as a treatment for IBS because its as effective as the drugs on the market In most trials  percent of patients see improvement in their IBS symptoms when they go on the lowFODMAP diet Yet the glutenfree diet is still way more popular and wellknown than the lowFODMAP diet And thats led researchers to want to try to separate the effects of the gluten protein from the FODMAPs in foods like wheat where both are found Back around    whos now a postdoctoral research fellow at the Translational Research Center for Gastrointestinal Disorders in Belgium heard that a lot of people with IBS in Melbourne Australia were saying they experienced benefits from the glutenfree diet That gave her the idea while she was a grad student at Monash to do a trial to test gluten sensitivity in these people who didnt have celiac disease In a   published in  Biesiekierski and a team of researchers at Monash who were also involved with the FODMAP research showed evidence of the existence of nonceliac gluten sensitivity in a randomized controlled trial of  people some of whom got gluten and some of whom got placebo Everybody was jumping up and down since that was the first study to show gluten could induce symptoms in patients that did not have celiac disease Biesiekierski tells The Salt It also helped fuel the explosion of glutenfree food The number of people with celiac disease is small  less than  percent of the population  but suddenly it seemed possible that a lot more people were sensitive to gluten and should avoid it Given the response to the study the team decided to try to reproduce its results This time  subjects with nonceliac gluten sensitivity and IBS were randomly assigned to groups given a twoweek diet of reduced FODMAPs and then placed on highgluten lowgluten or control diets for one week The   published in  in the journal  were intriguing Only  percent of the participants had glutenspecific effects from the gluten diets while all participants has significantly improved symptoms on the lowFODMAP diet The researchers concluded that gluten had no specific or dosedependent effects on patients who claimed to be gluten sensitive but were not diagnosed with celiac disase We believe nonceliac gluten sensitivity probably does exist but its not very common and we have a lot more to do until we fully understand gluten Biesiekierski says And Biesiekierski says for the majority of the people with IBS FODMAPs like fructan are more likely to be the trigger than gluten That means we really have to understand the differences between gluten sources and FODMAP sources she says to help people figure out whats upsetting their stomachs and how to avoid the triggers Whats more in a   published in April Biesiekierski found that some people who put themselves on a glutenfree diet still had some symptoms which suggests they could be sensitive to FODMAPs other than the ones in wheat Chey the gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan agrees that fructans in wheat are more likely to be triggering IBS in most patients than the gluten But we still need to understand which symptoms are related to gluten and which ones are related to fructans he says And its exceedingly difficult for scientists to answer these questions Its really hard to design and execute studies that really separate out constituent effects of food says Chey Weve still got a long ways to go Regardless Chey says a number of people including me now feel that nonceliac gluten sensitivity is a misnomer We should be saying wheat intolerance Another critical determinant of gut health that scientists are scrambling to understand is the community of microbes in the digestive tract as weve   Chey notes that what you eat influences your microbiome and your microbiome influences how you ferment carbs like FODMAPs that reach your colon While many people say they feel better when they cut out the gluten theres also a question as to how many of them are experiencing the    when believing that something makes you sick causes it to do so Despite the confusion  or perhaps because of it glutenfree food is spreading through the market like wildfire According to Mintel a market research company sales of glutenfree products reached about  billion in  And the company expects them to rise to  billion annually by  The glutenfree diet isnt just trendy in the US Its also taking off in Europe and Australia
