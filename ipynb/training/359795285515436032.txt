More than  million women and girls in Africa and the Middle East have suffered from genital cutting and other types of mutilation UNICEF said this week in the most comprehensive and quantitative survey to date Nearly half of those women live in Egypt and Ethiopia where the practice is still entrenched in the culture Its seen as tradition  something that has just always been there UNICEFs Francesca Moneti said Its just like how we get up in the morning and get dressed Your daughter reaches the age of cutting and she just gets cut UNICEF and other health organizations around the world have condemned   which usually involves removing a piece of flesh The groups have been working for decades to curtail the practice The new   offers evidence that some progress has been made A girls risk of being cut has declined over the past  years in more than half of the countries where genital mutilation is concentrated And in some places that decline is substantial A girl in Kenya or Tanzania today is three times less likely to have suffered the abuse than her mother In Iraq and Nigeria the risk has dropped by nearly half But in many places where genital cutting is more common the decline is smaller For instance about  percent of women in Egypt ages  to  say they have undergone the procedure compared to  percent of women in their late s Still even in these countries Moneti says attitudes toward the practice are noticeably shifting We see from the data that the level of support from girls  to  is lower than with older women In Egypt for instance twothirds of older women support the practice but just onethird of teenage girls do The presumption has been that men often condone female mutilation she says But when we look at the data it doesnt support that Many men and boys want the practice to stop too The problem Moneti says is that communities  even couples  dont talk about the issue The desire to end the practice is hidden she says Men often dont know what women think and vice versa In most places the cutting is performed at home with a razor blade But in Egypt trained doctors perform more than  percent of the procedures About  percent of women across all  countries surveyed have undergone an extreme procedure in which the genitals are cut and then the vagina sewn closed Some people mistakenly frame mutilation as an Islamic practice says UNICEF Deputy Executive Director   But its not she says There are many Islamic communities that dont practice it Its not written anywhere in the Bible or the Quran Instead the practice is linked to poverty and lack of education the report finds And a girl is much more likely to be cut if her mother was Eliminating female genital mutilation and cutting is essential Gupta says Its a form of controlling girls and womens sexuality Its a form of violence against girls These are the kinds of practices that must end
