If you dont think auto racing is a physically demanding sport just ask a member of a teams pit crew This highstakes job requires strength speed and precision as workers change pound tires in a matter of seconds We asked Christmas Abbott  and one of the first women to become a fulltime member of a Nascar crew to take us through the pit crew workout  Ms Abbott who stands just  foot  and  pounds can change two pound tires in  seconds but her goal is to shave that down to  seconds flat A native of Lynchburg Va she stays in shape for the job by doing the highintensity strength and conditioning program known as CrossFit which employs a grueling combination of exercises and weight lifting She regularly takes part in CrossFit competitions owns a gym in Raleigh NC  called CrossFit Invoke  and signed an endorsement deal with Reebok this year Recently we caught up with Ms Abbott to talk about her career in Nascar why she talks to herself during workouts and her views on cupcakes Heres an edited version of our conversation How did you end up working in a pit crew A friend of mine that I met through CrossFit called me one day and asked if I wanted to try Nascar for a day I showed up and they were doing a sponsorship recruitment and I was the token CrossFit girl that was there to compete against the guys We did three tire changes and I beat all the guys Afterward I got a call from Turner Motorsports Were you a racing fan growing up My family is very big into Nascar and we grew up watching races But when I got into this I was very surprised by the level of athleticism and the technical difficulty it involved Physically whats the most difficult part of your job You have to have the consistency to hit the lug nuts at a certain level of intensity every time Its a fine combination of strength and precision Not to mention the other variables with people running around you and cars flying by Everyone in the pit crew is either a former pro athlete or a collegiate athlete Theyre all incredibly skilled It used to be that they recruited fans to change the tires But its now so competitive that every second counts They have the speed and consistency of each stop dialed in to a tenth of a second Talk about pressure How does CrossFit help you with your job Competing in CrossFit is very similar to the pit crew experience where you have tens of thousands of people watching you and you have to perform precisely without messing up It prepares me physically for the actual task but it also prepares me for the performance pressure How did you get into CrossFit I was on a military base in Iraq and I saw a video of three girls my size lifting crazy weight and doing things like power cleans muscle ups and squats Id never seen girls do that kind of dynamic lifting I said whatever it was they were doing I have to try it So I tried CrossFit and Ive been hooked ever since How often do you work out Generally I do three days on one day off What are some of your favorite exercises Thats like asking a kid what their favorite candy is As far as my favorite movements people are going to think Im crazy but I love the thruster Thats where you take a barbell and you go from a front squat into an overhead press in one movement I love Olympic lifting specifically the snatch and the clean and jerk What do you do for cardio I dont do a lot of isolated cardio but youd be surprised how lifting weights can give you a cardiovascular response We train anaerobically most of the time so you get a cardio benefit but without decreasing your muscle mass So even though we dont train for it were able to run long distances and short distances quickly Can you give us an example Theres one workout that we call Grace as in Grace Kelly Its just  reps of clean and jerk  lifting the bar from the ground to your shoulder and from your shoulder above your head The weight for guys is  pounds and for girls its  For a highlevel athlete it takes two to three minutes to complete You have to be pretty strong to do it But when youre done youre gasping for air There are several workouts like this that just gas you But theres no running at all its just lifting Do you adhere to a special diet Talking diet is like talking politics It can be dangerous So I put this disclaimer out there Experiment and find what works well for you What has worked well for me is the Zone Diet which is a balance between carbohydrates protein and fat at every meal I do  percent carbs  percent protein and  percent fat As far as carbs I eat them at every meal I stick mostly to vegetables and fruit But I will deviate to quinoa or another good grain I try to stay away from processed foods altogether So I try to avoid things like bread and pasta Ive gotten the best response in my training and emotionally with Zone It gives me a lot more play in what I can eat Do you have cheat meals I allow myself one a week for sure But if I need more then I take more I just listen to my body If Im at a point where its between me freaking out or having a cupcake Im going to have a cupcake How has your approach to exercise changed over time I used to think negatively about myself when I worked out But then I got tired of listening to that little voice inside my head So I started talking positively to myself and its transformed my workouts Can you give us an example If Im fatigued and I have to lift the bar again I used to say to myself Come on why cant you just do it Or Whats wrong with you you should have been able to do that But now I quiet that voice and I stoke my own ego even if its a lie at the moment Ill tell myself Youre the baddest person in here All you have to do is take a step back breathe and now lets lift it I just tell myself that Im the best in there and Im rocking it and nobody can touch me What are some healthy habits you keep outside of working out Im a big advocate of sleep If I get less than eight hours Im grumpy It doesnt happen all the time but when I do get eight and a half or nine hours of sleep then the next day is awesome What is your next competition Right now Im competing in an Olympic lifting competition and Im hoping to become nationally ranked The competition is in December Its the American Open for Olympic lifting So hopefully Ill be a top  weight lifter in my category which is  kilograms What are some of your fitness goals I always want to be stronger and faster Its a goal on the horizon that you just never reach Youre never strong enough and youre never fast enough But its a beautiful thing to always have that goal
