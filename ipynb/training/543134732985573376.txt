Virtually all US high school students are sleepdeprived a new study finds It might come as no surprise to parents but what is surprising is just how many kids fall short of the recommended nine to  hours of sleep a night  and just how little sleep they really are getting More than  percent of th through th graders fell short of this goal and  percent of high school seniors missed out The consequences can be bigger than just nodding off in class Youngsters who miss out on sleep are more likely to be obese to get diabetes and to do poorly in school And older highschoolers are often driving Sleepy drivers are far more likely to be involved in crashes One study found that teens who slept the least were  to have been involved in a crash than those who got more sleep Those who got six hours or less sleep on the weekend were  percent more likely to be in a crash than those who slept more Drowsy driving plays a role in as many as  a year   percent of all crashes  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found Sleep is essential for the health of the human brain Charles Basch and colleagues at Columbia University in New York wrote in their report published in the journal The data show a need for universal interventions  those directed toward all students they added For example the American Academy of Pediatrics has encouraged school districts to establish start times that optimize students sleep Unfortunately intervention research directed toward high school populations has received little attention For the study Baschs team looked at indepth interviews done with teenagers from  to  They were asked detailed questions about sleep Only  to  percent of girls and  to  percent of boys said they got nine or more hours of sleep a night Its such an important health issue that the American Academy of Pediatrics   saying middle and high school students shouldnt have to start school   or later A different study done at Columbia earlier this year found that onefifth of yearolds reported getting less than six hours of sleep a night They were  percent more likely to be obese by age  compared to their peers who got more than eight hours of sleep The National Sleep Foundation says adolescents are biologically wired to stay up later at night so they need a chance to sleep longer in the morning or need help getting to bed earlier at night The group recommends that teenagers especially limit the use of video screens late at night establish a nightly routine much like parents are advised to do for young children and if all else fails take naps
