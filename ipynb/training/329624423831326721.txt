Rats are notorious for spreading nasty diseases Think the plague lassa fever and even salmonella But could some jumbosize African rodents help health workers diagnose diseases more quickly They just might A group in Tanzania is training rats to detect tuberculosis in people The critters in question are African giant pouched rats They are about twice the size of your average house gerbil  and half as pretty The critters have very poor vision which they make up for with a keen sense of smell For the past decade workers at the nonprofit   have been taking advantage of the rats olfactory prowess to detect buried land mines around the world Now APOPO is tackling TB which kills more than  million people a year Diagnosing TB can be tough in rural communities of Africa because standard methods typically require a skilled medical professional A quick and easytouse tool called   is now available for detecting TB But its expensive at about  for the machine and nearly  for each test So chemist   and his team in Tanzania have been teaching African giant pouched rats to identify the disease by sniffing a patients sputum The team trains the critters with a Pavlovian clickandreward approach When the rats are just a few weeks old technicians teach the animals to associate a click sound with a small bite of mashed bananas and a special pellet of food The next step is to link the scent of TB with the reward A trained rat can correctly pick out a TB sample about twothirds of the time Beyene says The rate increases to about  percent when two or three animals are put on the task The rats arent as good as a trained pathologist in the US with a microscope but they get better results than many clinicians working in rural Africa can achieve Beyene says In an African setting the sensitivity of the microscopy ranges between  to  percent he explains So far APOPO only has around  rats in their TB program But the rodent troop is already helping out with diagnosis at a small laboratory in Morogoro Tanzania The rats serve as a secondline screening system there to verify results from current microscopy tests Beyene says The laboratory collected over  sputum samples from  clinics and hospitals across the country in  With the help of rats theyve accurately diagnosed about twice as many positive results as the clinics alone says APOPOs chief   The lab collects about a thousand samples each week About  percent are positives but only  percent are marked as positive by microscopy meaning nearly half are missed Cox says And the rats are faster than people too The rodents can evaluate more samples in  minutes than a lab technician can do in a day Cox says One noteworthy and nimble rodent named Harod the Rat is able to clear  samples in  seconds Each rat costs about  to train and house for his eightyear lifetime So the little rodents may be a good fit for hospitals and clinics in the developing world where resources and twolegged medical workers are harder to come by But these critters do have their limits Unlike Xpert the rat cant tell if a sample contains a drugresistant strain of TB They are just rats after all
