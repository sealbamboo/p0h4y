The humming breath is a great way for children to calm and soothe themselves Its sort of like a virtual hug giving you that everything is going to be OK feeling says Leah Kalish founder of Move With Me Action Adventures which trains teachers in movement education The deep breathing and pressure point massage relaxes while the backandforth eye movement helps improve eyeteaming skills and crossmotor coordination so kids can think as well as feel better Prompt your children or students to use it when they are tired cranky frustrated or overstimulated From a seated position find the points of the collarbones with your right hand then move down slightly and find the two soft spots on either side of the sternum above your top rib With your thumb and forefinger or middle finger gently press or massage those two points It should make you want to take a breath says Kalish because you are massaging near the carotid artery Put your left hand on your belly just below the belly button Inhale deeply Then exhale slowly with a humming sound as you gently move your eyes from the left to the right and back repeating the slow scan from side to side as you release all of the air in your lungs Remember to move just your eyes and not your head Kalish teaches it to children with this chant One hand on my belly I let it rest I bring the other hand up to my chest I find a pair of buttons beneath that shelf And I hum to calm myself I move my eyes slowly to the left then to the right Heart calm mind clear body strong eyes bright Do it two to three times until relaxation is achieved
