Chances are that if youve ever lost weight following a strict diet and exercise regimen youve also reached the diet plateau On that lonely plateau pounds never seem to melt away no matter how hard you try to shed them Youre not alone Consider the plight of Susan Carierre When the footinch Carriere hit  pounds she decided to enroll in a weightloss program at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center near her home in Baton Rouge La My weight went up and down for years says Carriere  I just couldnt keep it off Over six months in the Pennington program she finally dropped more than  pounds I was ecstatic she says But then the scale got stuck at  pounds It wouldnt move Carriere says I was doing the same lowcalorie diet the same food every day and sticking to my daily walking The scale stayed stagnant for weeks Why am I doing this If Im not making any progress whats the point Carriere says she was thinking I might as well just go out for dinner and if my husband is having fried food then I might as well have fried food Carrieres frustration is echoed by most people says   an obesity researcher who directs the Pennington center Theres no question there is a diet plateau Ravussin says Four to six months into a diet program this typically happens Even a weight loss of  pounds will set the body up to fight back Ravussin says Any significant weight loss means the body is smaller and needs less fuel to walk go up stairs jog or get out of a chair And less fuel burned means fewer calories needed So if youve been on a diet of  calorie a day perhaps your slimmer body now needs  calories less per day That means you have to decrease your daily caloric intake  perhaps by as much as  calories down to  calories a day  if you want to continue losing weight On top of that metabolism slows as the body begins to combat what it interprets as potential starvation So it begins to burn the calories its getting more slowly In Ravussins   he has found that metabolism slows even if dieters have maintained muscle mass Thats because the body is now using calories more efficiently Its like going from an old Ford to a Prius with a more efficient engine he says And a more efficient engine isnt a bad thing It means the body has adjusted to its new lower weight The diet plateau is the new set point says   director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Weight Center in Boston So when you go to a healthier diet your body says Oh this is good Lets live at a lower body fat and lets live at a lower set point The good news is that as long as people stick to the diet and exercise program that got them to the new lower set point theyll maintain the new weight But return to eating more and exercising less and the weight will come back But what if you want to continue losing What if the new set point isnt your goal In the case of Susan Carriere the pound plateau was  pounds higher than her goal of  pounds If you want to get below the new set point you need a different approach added to the diet and exercise program youre already on says Kaplan We call it speed dating obesity therapies he says If one approach doesnt work we try another one We try a different diet We add exercise or change the type of exercise We encourage better sleep health We encourage decreased stress Inadequate sleep and lots of stress often increase appetite and getting these things under control can help Kaplan says We try to find the best therapies for each individual he adds stressing that everyone is different and may respond differently to various approaches But pretty much everyone agrees that exercise works for most people Thats because bigger stronger muscles burn more calories says Kaplan If youre on the treadmill every day you may burn a couple of hundred calories a day from being on the treadmill but you may burn  or  extra calories throughout the rest of the day when youre not on a treadmill because bodies with healthy muscles work better For some people simply persevering through a diet plateau works eventually Thats what happened to Carriere who after four weeks of not losing any weight got on the scale one morning and had dropped three pounds It was like icing on cake she says I mean all of a sudden I feel like I rang the bell But now that Carrieres body has adjusted to her smaller self shell lose weight more slowly than at the beginning of her diet Unless of course she does something different And thats exactly what she plans on doing In addition to her daily walking shell add a Zumba exercise class Its the only thing that Ive ever done that when you walk in people are all smiling and when you leave an hour later and youre sweating like an old dog youre still smiling she says Carrieres betting on the Zumba  and smiling  to help shed that final  pounds
