People are keeping their distance from Stephen Rowden He just returned to the UK this week from Liberia It was his first posting with Doctors Without Borders and Rowden was charged with a grim task managing teams of body collectors in Monrovia the capital of Liberia He was surprised by the scale of the job They collected  to  bodies a day Someone had to do it In a month of work there Rowden says his team collected and disposed of over  bodies Most of them came from the Ebola treatment wards but some were collected from homes Unfortunately they werent that aware of the conditions that the government had imposed on the removal and disposal of bodies so it was quite a shock when we advised them that the body would be taken for cremation and burial was not permissible says Rowden Liberias government has effectively banned traditional burial practices in which families wash and embrace their dead Instead the teams quickly collect the corpses and transport them to a Hindu crematorium where an open air pyre is stacked up with wood each day and lit with kerosene each night The facility is one of the only ones equipped to do cremations in a country where burial is the primary way of sending off the dead The families of Ebola victims dont get to recover their loved ones ashes Despite the disruption of traditional practices Rowden says that the people he worked with felt a satisfaction at their grim and countercultural job They did see it very much as a role of helping the Liberian people as a whole he says I feel very privileged to have undertaken the work I did A lot of it Im still working through  my feelings my thoughts Rowden says But would I consider going back Yes I would During his last week Rowden says Doctors Without Borders imported two medical waste incinerators from Europe to help with disposal Back at home in Danbury England Rowden faces the stigma many others have experienced in this Ebola epidemic We asked him to speak to us from a radio studio near his home The staff there said no They were concerned about his exposure to Ebola We called him at home instead Rowden says none of the  people he managed in Liberia have shown any symptoms of Ebola
