When wondering whether genes are contributing to your struggle with weight a new study suggests it might be useful to look within  at the garden of bacteria growing in your gut In particular you might well wonder whether in addition to their failure to bequeath you the genes for athletic prowess and a strong jaw line your parents also failed to pass on a genetic predisposition to play host to the bacterium   in abundance In a new study that explored the fecal samples of  twin pairs in the United Kingdom researchers found evidence to suggest that this strongly heritable strain of gut bacterium protects against obesity Nobody would deny that parents girth exerts a powerful influence on their childrens propensity to becoming overweight or obese But how much of that is nature  genetics  and how much is nurture  family consumption patterns and preferences  has become a subject of highly active research Researchers exploring the hot field of gut microbiota are turning up new evidence that both genes and consumption patterns  nature and nurture  contribute to the mix of microorganisms that flourish in the intestinal tract At the same time theyre finding growing evidence that that mix of microorganisms influences an individuals risk of obesity The current study sought to characterize and explore the power of that genesmicrobiotaobesity relationship Why collect and analyze twins poop to see whether the mix of gut microbiota is an inherited trait Because twins come in two flavors identical  those who share virtually all of their DNA because they came from the same eggs and sperm and fraternal  those who share no more DNA than any pair of siblings because they come from two separate unions of eggs and sperm If some feature of gut bacteria say its diversity or the copious presence of some strain is more dramatically shared by identical twins than by fraternal twins scientists can infer that genes likely play a key role in determining that feature If fraternal and identical twins when raised in the same household differ little in the composition of their microbiota theres a good bet that their environment is strongly shaping what grows in their intestinal tract The British twin study suggested that genes play a key role in whether an individual will host several strains of bacteria  including   in abundance And it found that levels of bacteria in the   family seem to be influenced more by environment than by genes But then researchers went further In a series of experiments with mice they sought to confirm that highly heritable strains of gut microbiota could influence obesity First they harvested the mix of gut microflora found in twins who appeared to have inherited high concentrations of   Then they created several fecal transplant packages including some that were wholly from obese twins and some that were an enriched mix of obesityrelated microbiota and   Finally they transplanted these packages of microbiota into weekold mice that were germfree The result In the span of just  days mice with higher concentrations of   in their gut were leaner than those who had gotten the gut flora from an obese person This paper is part of a rapidly growing effort to define the interrelationships between our human genetic variationsÂ  variations in the compositions of our gut microbial communities our diets and our health status said Dr Jefffrey I Gordon director of a newly established Center for Gut Microbiome and Nutrition Research at Washington University School of Medicine in Missouri One outcome he said would to determine how our gut microbial communities are causally related to health and disease risk Researchers also need a keener better appreciation of how the nutritional value and effects of our diets is shaped in part by differences in consumers gut communities he added and how and gut microbes may transform components of their diets into products that impact our wellness This the authors wrote is just the beginning of a lengthy effort that may help identify ways to combat obesity It will be like finding a needle in a haystack to locate the specific genes that predispose an individual to hosting   in abundance not to mention any of the countless other strains of gut bacteria that may be heritable and influence obesity But that would be the next step to eventually exploit these health associated bacteria to promote health the authors wrote
