A lot of us know what can happen when we get hungry We get grumpy irritable and sometimes nasty Theres even a name for this phenomenon Hangry which is a combination of the words hungry and angry says psychologist   from Ohio State University Many studies have suggested that low blood sugar may be the underlying cause of hungerinduced crankiness But most of those studies were performed with strangers in the laboratory Bushman wondered What about people who get along well or who even love each other Does low blood sugar turn even spouses into frenemies To figure that out Bushman recruited  couples for a study He assessed the quality of their relationships and taught them how to measure their blood sugar Then he sent each volunteer home with something unusual a voodoo doll and  pins We told the participants this doll represented their spouse Bushman says and that every night before they went to bed they should stab the doll with pins depending on how angry they were with their spouse So the more pins they put in the doll the angrier they were with their spouse After three weeks Bushman and his team assessed the damage done to each doll Volunteers who had low levels of blood glucose stuck more pins in the voodoo dolls than those who had high levels of blood glucose Bushman and his team   Monday in  In fact people with the lowest blood sugar levels stuck more than twice as many pins in the voodoo dolls compared with people with the highest levels the researchers found The team also wanted to know whether those angry feelings translated into nastier behavior So they had the couples play a computer game in which the winner got to blast his or her spouse with an awful noise The noise is a mixture of noises that most people hate like fingernails scratching on chalkboards dentist drills sirens Bushman says As expected the lower a persons blood sugar the more likely he or she was to blast a spouse  Regardless of how good somebodys relationship is when theyre hungry theyre more angry and they stuck more pins in the doll Bushman says And they were more aggressive by giving their partner louder and longer blasts of noise Bushman thinks his finding could help people cut back on angry outbursts because theyre hungry What we conclude is that glucose is the food for the brain that we need to exercise selfcontrol Bushman says And when peoples glucose levels are low they are poorer at exercising selfcontrol Blood sugar is clearly not the only factor involved in whether someone gets angry But low blood sugar probably makes it harder for the brain to control emotions says   a psychiatrist at the University of Chicago The brain uses only sugar for its energy needs he says So when theres less sugar available the neurons arent going to function as well Now Bushman isnt recommending that people keep candy bars around to prevent angry outbursts Such sweets can cause quick spikes in blood sugar that arent helpful But snacks with both carbohydrates and protein might be a good idea The takehome message from this study would be to make sure youre not hungry when you talk about important issues with your spouse Bushman says So something like a protein bar would be a really good thing to have before discussing an important issue with your spouse that you might become angry about
