Drugs that help women become pregnant have replaced in vitro fertilization as the main culprit behind highrisk multiple births according to a study looking at births of triplets and higherorder multiples IVF which is usually the one we tend to point fingers at was not the leading culprit says Eli Adashi a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Brown University who was senior author of the   published Wednesday in the   The number of multiple births of triplets or more due to fertility drugs like   and injectable hormones rose from  percent to  percent from  to  At the same time the births of multiples because of IVF dropped from  percent to  percent Having more than one baby at a time   for both mother and children including premature birth cerebral palsy and developmental delays Between  and  the proportion of multiple births doubled in the United States the study finds from  percent to  percent Almost all of that was due to fertility treatments Back in the s it became increasingly clear that transferring multiple embryos for IVF was boosting the number of highrisk multiple pregnancies Since  doctors have discouraged women from transferring more than two embryos at a time for IVF More recently improved IVF techniques have made it more likely to achieve a successful single birth by choosing to transfer just   That is credited with lowering the numbers of highorder multiples by  percent from  to  Thats good news for babies and moms But based on this new information it looks like the education campaign needs to expand to include nonIVF fertility treatments too Fertility drugs are cheaper and easier to use than IVF and are often covered by insurance Clomiphene citrate is a pill and hormones called   can be injected at home The drugs stimulate the ovaries to produce more than one egg in a cycle You certainly have less control over the potential number of eggs with fertility drugs compared to IVF Adashi tells Shots But fertility specialists already have guidelines that help reduce that risk Clearly not all doctors who prescribe the drugs are following the advice Adashi says Using lower doses of drugs will go a long way toward reducing the number of multiples IVF births are tracked in a national registry but theres no registry for births from fertility drugs alone So the researchers did some math taking the number of multiple births subtracting IVF births and then adjusting for the fact that women are having babies when theyre older
