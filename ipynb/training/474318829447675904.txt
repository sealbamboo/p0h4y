In the two years since Middle East respiratory syndrome was first diagnosed in people scientists have struggled to figure out how we catch the deadly virus Some blamed bats Others pointed at camels Now scientists in Saudi Arabia offer the strongest evidence yet that the onehumped dromedaries can indeed spread the MERS virus  which has infected more than  people on four continents including two men in the US Last October a yearold retired military man caught MERS while treating one of his drippynosed camels at a farm near Jeddah scientists say The camel was congested The man applied something like a vapor rub directly to the camels nose A week later he fell ill He was admitted to an intensive care unit on November  and died on the th The MERS viruses isolated from both the man and camel had almost exactly the same the DNA sequence scientists  Wednesday in the   It unequivocally demonstrates that transmission from camels to people is possible says virologist   from Columbia University who wasnt involved in the study MERS causes pneumonialike symptoms and sometimes organ failure Theres no cure or vaccine So figuring out where the virus originates is key to stopping it Camels have been at the top of list The MERS virus has been circulating in Arabian camels for more than two decades scientists   in February And the virus has been   in a camels at a farm owned by two people who caught MERS in Qatar But these studies were missing one critical component says immunologist   of the University of Maryland The direction of the infection was never known he says Did the camels infect people or did people infect the camels The new study helps to answer that question The day the retired military man came to the hospital in Jeddah infectious disease specialist   and his team at King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah looked for signs that the mans camel had caught MERS before him The team found the smoking gun Antibodies appeared in the camels blood before they were seen in the mans blood The timing of the infections works with the idea that the camel directly infected the owner Frieman says And not vice versa The findings are important Frieman says because they may help convince people to take precautions when handling camels Theres a lot of reluctance by many people in the Middle East to believe that camels carry the virus and can make them sick he says But camels arent likely the   of MERS People transmit the virus too  and that may be a much bigger problem Theres increasing evidence of humantohuman transmission Lipkin tells Shots Yes weve demonstrated that camels can infect people But the major challenge facing us now is to stop humantohuman transmission of MERS
