In an eyeopening demonstration of natures ingenuity researchers at Princeton University recently discovered that exercise creates vibrant new brain cells  and then shuts them down when they shouldnt be in action   For some time scientists studying exercise have been puzzled by physical activitys two seemingly incompatible effects on the brain On the one hand exercise is known to prompt the creation of new and very excitable brain cells At the same time exercise can induce an overall pattern of calm in certain parts of the brain  Most of us probably dont realize that neurons are born with certain predispositions Some often the younger ones are by nature easily excited They fire with almost any provocation which is laudable if you wish to speed thinking and memory formation But that feature is less desirable during times of everyday stress If a stressor does not involve a lifeordeath decision and require immediate physical action then having lots of excitable neurons firing all at once can be counterproductive inducing anxiety Studies in animals have shown that physical exercise creates excitable neurons in abundance especially in the hippocampus a portion of the brain known to be involved in thinking and emotional responses  But exercise also has been found to reduce anxiety in both people and animals  How can an activity simultaneously create ideal neurological conditions for anxiety and leave practitioners with a deeprooted calm the Princeton researchers wondered  So they gathered adult mice injected them with a substance that marks newborn cells in the brain and for six weeks allowed half of them to run at will on little wheels while the others sat quietly in their cages    Afterward the scientists determined each groups baseline nervousness Given access to cages with open welllighted areas as well as shadowy corners the running mice were more willing to cautiously explore and spend time in open areas an indication that they were more confident and less anxious than the sedentary animals  The researchers also checked the brains of some of the runners and the sedentary mice to determine how many and what varieties of new neurons they contained  As expected the runners brains teemed with many new excitable neurons The sedentary mices brains also contained similar volatile newborn cells but not in such profusion  The runners brains however also had a notable number of new neurons specifically designed to release the neurotransmitter GABA which inhibits brain activity keeping other neurons from firing easily In effect these are nanny neurons designed to shush and quiet activity in the brain  In the runners brains there were large new populations of these cells in a portion of the hippocampus the ventral region associated with the processing of emotions The rest of the hippocampus the dorsal region is more involved with thinking and memory  What role these nanny neurons were playing in the animals brains and subsequent behavior was not altogether clear So the scientists next gently placed the remaining mice in icecold water for five minutes Mice do not enjoy cold water They find immersion stressful and anxietyinducing although it is not lifethreatening Then the scientists checked these animals brains They were looking for markers known as immediate early genes that indicate a neuron has recently fired     They found them in profusion In both the physically fit and the sedentary mice large numbers of the excitable cells had fired in response to the cold bath Emotionally the animals had become fired up by the stress  But with the runners it didnt last long Their brains unlike those of the sedentary animals showed evidence that the shushing neurons also had been activated in large numbers releasing GABA calming the excitable neurons activity and presumably keeping unnecessary anxiety at bay In effect the runners brains had responded to the relatively minor stress of a cold bath with a quick rush of worry and a concomitant overarching calm What all of this suggests says Elizabeth Gould director of the Gould Lab at Princeton who wrote the paper with her graduate student Timothy Schoenfeld now at the National Institute of Mental Health and others is that the hippocampus of runners is vastly different from that of sedentary animals Not only are there more excitatory neurons and more excitatory synapses but the inhibitory neurons are more likely to become activated presumably to dampen the excitatory neurons in response to stress The   Its important to note she adds that this study examined longterm training responses The runners wheels had been locked for  hours before their cold bath so they would gain no acute calming effect from exercise Instead the difference in stress response between the runners and the sedentary animals reflected fundamental remodeling of their brains  Of course as we all know mice are not men or women But Dr Gould says other studies show that physical exercise reduces anxiety in humans suggesting that similar remodeling takes place in the brains of people who work out  I think its not a huge stretch she concludes to suggest that the hippocampi of active people might be less susceptible to certain undesirable aspects of stress than those of sedentary people
