Scientists say they have developed the worlds first vaccine against dengue fever seen to work in largescale trials  Research in the   suggests more than  of children who are given the vaccine are protected against the disease Half the worlds population are at risk of catching the mosquitoborne virus  Experts say though the longawaited study is promising vaccines with greater effectiveness are crucial There are currently no treatments to prevent dengue fever  an illness which affects more than one million people a year In the largest latestage trial of a vaccine to date researchers from five centres across Asia treated  children aged between two and  years old  Some  were seen to have protection against the virus at the end of two years  It worked best for children with certain subtypes of the virus and those who had been exposed to it before And the vaccine had an even greater impact on severe forms of the disease reducing the number of people needing treatment in hospital and preventing  of cases of haemorrhagic fever  a potentially lifethreatening complication Lead author Dr Maria Rosario Capeding from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in the Philippines told the BBC Given that dengue is a major public health problem in most Asian countries the findings have the potential to have a huge impact on public health  A  reduction though moderate can translate into a huge benefit for countries plagued by the disease Prof Martin Hibberd of the London School of Hygiene and Topical Medicine who was not involved in the study said The biology of dengue is complex and has troubled researchers for many years  I am very glad they have tackled this but I am disappointed the vaccine is only  effective  much lower than our normal targets  Nevertheless this is the most significant reduction we have seen to date  the best we have so far  And many nations spend huge amounts of money trying to prevent the spread of this disease He suggests people who have been given the vaccine should be monitored for at least five years to ensure it remains effective and safe  And further questions need to be addressed including how much of an impact it will have in other parts of the world  SanofiPasteur the company funding the research plans to apply for approval once the results of its second trial across Latin America and the Caribbean have been analysed
