Early on Mr Smith worried that his novel being published Tuesday by Simon  Schuster would be unreadable too  or wouldnt be written at all Author of the  blockbuster   and   since Mr Smith writes about people who uncover and keep secrets But for  years he has had a secret of his own In  he received a diagnosis of Parkinsons disease But he kept it hidden not only from the public but from his publisher and editors He concealed it although for years tremors and stiffness have kept him from taking detailed notes and sketching people places and objects for his research  and even as he became unable to type the words he needed to finish his  best seller   I didnt want to be judged by that Mr Smith  explained recently in his lightfilled Victorian home north of San Francisco Either Im a good writer or Im not Hes our preeminent Parkinsons writer Who needs that In talking about his Parkinsons odyssey including a relatively new but promising treatment Mr Smith is opening a window on the still incurable disorder affecting four million people worldwide a disease that is becoming increasingly prevalent as baby boomers age His experience reflects a common desire to conceal oftenstigmatizing symptoms like shaking slowness and rigidity He mostly didnt mind his Parkinsonian hallucinations a black cat in his lap whirlwinds spiraling from computer keys a butler a British military officer in full regalia Having hallucinations for a fiction writer is redundant he said Ingenuity gumption and others generosity have allowed him to keep working Tatiana whose title character is a journalist who writes despite lifethreatening dangers was produced in an especially unusual way which he also hid from his publisher and editor In a room with a blue floor and a window glazed with prehistoric creatures Mr Smith perched on a wooden stool and spun out words while his wife Emily known as Em typed them into the computer gave feedback and made his onthespot changes Neither was sure theyd succeed Writers often think through their fingertips not knowing exactly what theyll create until their hands are at the keyboard Could Mr Smith whose novels braid history suspense deadpan humor and subtly surprising characters write a book one step removed I had a great many doubts he confessed Its like playing football except youve got two quarterbacks It promises confusion complication and loss of immediate contact You want to keep that ball moving keep that idea within your grasp After finishing the book Mr Smith tried another gambit His medication faltering he got deep brain stimulation with electrodes implanted in his brain and electrical pulses from a pacemaker trying to tame disruptive movements Doctors at the University of California San Francisco customized the procedure for their literary patient to curb effects on verbal fluency said the neurosurgeon Dr Philip Starr Thats something obviously in a writer that you want to minimize Before his diagnosis Mr Smith would lose his balance or bungle opening a can but hed dismissed it as little things that pop up like gremlins go away and may not come back again for a year Then at Thanksgiving in  he recalled a doctor friend asked Why are you holding your arm that way Youre just letting it hang Asking Mr Smith to raise his arm he noticed jerky movements and said Im afraid youve got Parkinsons Mr Smith said he happened to be seated that Thanksgiving next to a man with Parkinsons so bad he had to be fed this poor man locked within himself a good man with a good brain It was he said a day when your world collapses After all Mr Smith who is known as Bill is no armchair writer For his books notably those featuring the sardonic Russian detective Arkady Renko he does detailed research about nuclear weapons Russian mafia and political scandals traveling to Chernobyl Cuba and elsewhere But like the bullet lodged in Renkos brain which could shift anytime turning deadly Parkinsons seemed destined to outmatch Mr Smith Its not like Hillary conquering Everest he said Its like Mallory never coming down To avoid being defined by disease Mr Smith began what he called hiding out within yourself finding other ways to do things Shaving is suddenly an adventure Changing a light bulb in this house Victorians never had Parkinsons For a while he said I was getting away with it Being a writer you can hide out more easily You only have to present an amended version of yourself once or twice a day He told his agent Andrew Nurnberg who accompanied him on research trips and whose reaction Mr Smith recalled was Oh thank god I thought it was me I thought you were upset with me for some reason because you had a fixed gaze a flatness of expression 
 About a dozen years and five books ago things started to fall apart Mr Smith said when he couldnt write intricate notes or sketch images like hed always done coralroot orchid for Stallion Gate herring fishermen for Polar Star My research started really being affected He started taking his wife along I would ask questions and she would write down the answers He took photographs but felt when you cant draw things to some degree it makes you blind He became less agile once tripping in Red Square To steady tremors hed affix his hand to his face like a Rodin statue You can only stuff your hands in your pockets so much People would say youre flapping inside your pants  While typing Three Stations he repeatedly made typos and correcting them and wrangling ideas into sentences exhausted his body and imagination It was like trying to catch a fish with your hands he said an image he includes in Tatiana Then Ms Smith  offered to be her husbands fingers I actually didnt know if Bill could do it she said How could you say things aloud to someone else  Mr Smith imagined reactions When I go to the dentist I want just the dentist I dont want the dentist and his wife But in the room lined with books about seemingly everything except Parkinsons the Smiths found a rhythm While he thought she entertained herself reading back copies of The New Yorker She declared Ill do this if there are no children and no dogs that are killed things that occurred in the last book He spilled out remarkably fluent sentences then yanked back words and swapped them Ms Smith loved entering his fictional world Shed note if dialogue rang false or scenes seemed thin She suggested that he write the first draft of a love scene without her in the room Theres probably an amendment or change or suggestion of hers on every page he said The process had a calamitous nature to it an areyouswimmingorareyoudrowning kind of aspect Then its like no Im just treading water Now Mr Smith calls his wife my interpreter In Tatiana loosely based on the    the cryptically important notebook belonged to an interpreter Mr Smith did not tell his editor Jofie FerrariAdler until he learned he loved the manuscript You could have knocked me over with a feather Mr FerrariAdler said You would never ever ever think it was written that way Mr Smith told him he hadnt disclosed his Parkinsons because he didnt want me to pull my punches Mr Smith also reported hed just had brain surgery after years of different types and doses of medication He was kind of between a rock and hard place said his neurologist Dr Jill Ostrem Lower the medications too much then you have tremor But if he took more medication he developed nausea low blood pressure and hallucinations He was a good candidate for deep brain stimulation or DBS which was approved for Parkinsons in  But DBS can have cognitive effects and Dr Starr said Parkinsons had already slightly affected Mr Smiths shortterm and verbal memory On tests of naming objects rapidly he scored in the moderate level Dr Starr said In language testing his score was good but one would have been expected him to be kind of excellent So Dr Starr highly experienced with DBS implanted electrodes in a brain area the globus pallidus believed to cause fewer cognitive issues than a more commonlyimplanted area And doctors implanted only the left brain to treat his mostaffected side the right because if you implant both sides your risk of cognitive decline is probably a bit higher Dr Ostrem said Now the daily torture of the tremor on the right has largely disappeared Mr Smith said He is well enough for a crosscountry book tour and traveled to Italy for his next book which Ms Smith is typing since that ability hasnt returned He has fewer hallucinations although yesterday I saw a woman by the stairs who wasnt there and a black dog often appears in places where there isnt one he said Im not who I was since Parkinsons he said And sometimes I dont find the first word Im after But Ill take the second word the third word Ill take it because I like new ways of expressing things It makes the work alive
