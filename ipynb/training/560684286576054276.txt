Scientists tracking the Ebola outbreak in Guinea say the virus has mutated Researchers at the Institut Pasteur in France which first identified the outbreak last March are investigating whether it could have become more contagious  More than  people have been infected with Ebola and  have died in Guinea Sierra Leone and Liberia  Scientists are starting to analyse hundreds of blood samples from Ebola patients in Guinea  They are tracking how the virus is changing and trying to establish whether its able to jump more easily from person to person We know the virus is changing quite a lot said human geneticist Dr Anavaj Sakuntabhai  Thats important for diagnosing new cases and for treatment We need to know how the virus is changing to keep up with our enemy Its not unusual for viruses to change over a period time Ebola is an RNA virus  like HIV and influenza  which have a high rate of mutation That makes the virus more able to adapt and raises the potential for it to become more contagious Weve now seen several cases that dont have any symptoms at all asymptomatic cases said Anavaj Sakuntabhai  These people may be the people who can spread the virus better but we still dont know that yet A virus can change itself to less deadly but more contagious and thats something we are afraid of There were fewer than  new cases in a week for the first time since June  In the week to  January there were  cases in Guinea four in Liberia and  in Sierra Leone The World Health Organization says the epidemic has entered a second phase with the focus shifting to ending the epidemic But Prof Jonathan Ball a virologist at the University of Nottingham says its still unclear whether more people are actually not showing symptoms in this outbreak compared with previous ones  We know asymptomatic infections occur but whether we are seeing more of it in the current outbreak is difficult to ascertain he said It could simply be a numbers game that the more infection there is out in the wider population then obviously the more asymptomatic infections we are going to see  Another common concern is that while the virus has more time and more hosts to develop in Ebola could mutate and eventually become airborne  There is no evidence to suggest that is happening The virus is still only passed through direct contact with infected peoples body fluids  No blood borne virus for example HIV or Hepatitis B has ever shown any indication of becoming airborne The mutation would need to be major said infectious disease expert Professor David Heyman Virologist Noel Tordo from the Institut Pasteur is in the Guinea capital Conakry He said At the moment not enough has been done in terms of the evolution of the virus both geographically and in the human body so we have to learn more But something has shown that there are mutations For the moment the way of transmission is still the same You just have to avoid contact with a sick person But as a scientist you cant predict it wont change Maybe it will Researchers are using a method called genetic sequencing to track changes in the genetic makeup of the virus So far they have analysed around  blood samples from Guinea Another  samples are being sent to the labs in the coming months A previous similar study in Sierra Leone showed the Ebola virus mutated considerably in the first  days of the outbreak according to the World Health Organization  It said This certainly does raise a lot of scientific questions about transmissibility response to vaccines and drugs use of convalescent plasma However many gene mutations may not have any impact on how the virus responds to drugs or behaves in human populations The research in Paris will also help give scientists a clearer insight into why some people survive Ebola and others dont The survival rate of the current outbreak is around   Its hoped this will help scientists developing vaccines to protect people against the virus Researchers at the Institut Pasteur are currently developing two vaccines which they hope will be in human trials by the end of the year  One is a modification of the widely used measles vaccine where people are given a weakened and harmless form of the virus which in turn triggers an immune response That response fights and defeats the disease if someone comes into contact with it  The idea if it proves successful would be that the vaccine would protect against both measles and Ebola  Weve seen now this is a threat that can be quite large and can extend on a global scale said  Professor James Di Santo and immunologist at the Institut  Weve learned this virus is not a problem of Africa its a problem for everyone He added This particular outbreak may wane and go away but were going to have another infectious outbreak at some point because the places where the virus hides in nature for example in small animals is still a threat for humans in the future The best type of response we can think of is to have vaccination of global populations
