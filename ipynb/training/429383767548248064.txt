A rift is growing between Tea Party activists and other Republicans over health care Some influential conservatives are now saying the   is too entrenched to repeal Take the US Chamber of Commerce an influential business lobbying group When the ACA passed in  the chamber got behind the   to fight it at the US Supreme Court Its time in my opinion to go back to the drawing board  and thus we support legislation in the House to repeal it chamber President Tom Donohue   in his annual address back in  But now hes striking a different tone Were not going to get rid of that bill and so were going to have to devise ways to make it work Donohue said at a recent news conference Some business reporters called that change in tone   and a   But   opinion editor   doesnt agree He Donohue didnt say that he opposes repeal Roy says about Donohues recent statement He just didnt think repeal was realistic in the next several years Business groups such as the chamber have to be pragmatic and deal with the world as it is not as theyd like it to be Roy says Thats why the chamber is now focusing on changing specific parts of the health care law that its members dont like rather than repealing it Roy advised Mitt Romney on health policy in  He thinks Republicans missed their chance to repeal the law in the  elections And they wont get another chance he says until after the  elections By then the chance will be only small Its very difficult once a law that transformative has been in effect for seven years to repeal it Roy says I think there are more attractive ways to achieve the goals of conservatives than repeal and replace That strategy doesnt sound attractive or pragmatic to conservative talk show host   who runs the Red State blog Rather it sounds more like capitulation The lobbying groups that have open access to Republican leaders are abandoning repeal Erickson   in a recent podcast The wonks the GOP leaders listen to are abandoning repeal Theyre laying the groundwork to bail on fighting Obamacare But both Roy and the chamber say they remain committed to fighting the health law The chamber wants specific items thrown out such as the requirement beginning in  that employers with more than  workers provide health insurance or pay a fine And Roy says conservatives could accomplish more by using Obamacare to push for   of all governmentfunded health care The ACA is really an important but smaller portion of the overall reform picture he says And I think whats happened with a lot of the more populist conservatives is that theres not necessarily that appreciation for how much the government is already involved in the health care system through programs like Medicare and Medicaid Conservative activist Erickson says the traditional Republican Party doesnt like its populist wing and that it needs to be taught a lesson in the  primary elections The single biggest thing you can do to get the Republicans back on the right and straight path is to support   against Mitch McConnell in Kentucky he said Erickson also urges financial contributions to conservative primary challengers in Georgia Mississippi Nebraska and other states That means some Republican candidates will face heat from the right for not doing more to repeal Obamacare while theyre fighting Democrats who say they arent doing enough to make the law work better
