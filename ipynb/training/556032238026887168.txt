More than  children have lost one or both parents to Ebola in West Africas current outbreak of the disease according to UNICEF   Almost  of those children are from Sierra Leone Many are also Ebola survivors themselves but because of the stigma and fear around the virus they are often shunned by their communities Britain has pledged m to help set up special care centres for Ebola orphans and reunite children with their extended families  The BBCs global health correspondent Tulip Mazumdar has been to St George Foundation orphanage in Freetown which is run by a British charity and spoken to two orphans about their experiences Haja survived Ebola and now helps look after orphans at St Georges If any children are suspected of being sick she looks after them because she has a level of immunity against the virus  My aunt developed a fever and three days later she died  We didnt know at the time that it was Ebola that had killed her So my whole family went to her funeral A few days after that I became ill too and so did many members of my family including my mother and brothers and sisters  I was admitted to a government hospital and then moved to an Ebola treatment centre  I liked being there because some people who got sick didnt report their illness and they died in their village I got the correct treatment  They gave me medicines I was helpless and I didnt expect to survive But they helped me get well  But many of my family have died My father had died before in  my mother died during this outbreak and my brothers and sisters  of us were infected with Ebola and only I survived  I miss my family every day its so hard I think about them all the time  Although I miss my family I am very happy I survived Now I wish to help others  I am happy I survived now I want to hep protect others  Mohamed lost both his parents to Ebola  He was kept quarantined in his home where his parents died for  days in case he developed the sickness but was then forced to leave his village with his surviving sister because his extended family and neighbours were scared they would catch Ebola from him  He has recently arrived at the orphanage with his elder sister  My mother and my father died of Ebola After they died my community treated me very badly  They told me to go away from my house and never come back So I went to my grandmothers house and she told me to get out from her place  Me and my sister were alone for two days we had to sleep outside in an unfinished building Nobody wanted to see us I did not feel good  Then we went to my grandmothers friends house and she let us stay I felt fine there she talked to me nicely she gave me food and then I went to sleep  But after two days my grandmothers friend said I had to leave A car came and we were brought here I feel good here They take care of me well I eat good  three times a day I sleep I play and I study I am a strong boy and I will be OK
