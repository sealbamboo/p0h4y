Hospitals can make much more money when surgery goes wrong than in cases that go without a hitch And that presents a problem for patients The financial incentives dont favor better care The magnitude of the numbers was eyepopping says   a professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School and an author of the study which was just published in   It was much larger than we expected If a patient with private insurance had complications after surgery hospitals made  more profit than if all had gone well Thats compared to an additional profit of  for a Medicare patient with complications after surgery Thats an indication of the level of perversity here Gawande says Having a complication was profitable and fighting complications was highly unprofitable Its not surprising that health care costs are higher when there are complications since patients need more care to get better And its not surprising that hospitals bill private insurers at a much higher rate than Medicare There was no profit with Medicare patients The paper used contribution margin which is revenues minus variable costs In other words the expense of items used directly for a patients care not overhead or other fixed costs The much higher margin on cases involving mistakes is enough to make a patient think that hospitals arent highly motivated to reduce medical errors In fact one reason that Gawande and his colleagues embarked on the study is that many hospitals have been slow to adopt practices proven to improve the quality of care and save money We have never seen hospitals that are actively trying to cause complications to make a profit Gawande told Shots But weve seen a lot of hospitals where you say Why arent you investing in reducing risk the way other industries do  The researchers looked at  surgeries at  hospitals in the   system in  About  percent of people experienced complications That included surgical site infection sepsis pulmonary embolism stroke heart attack pneumonia and other infections The study was part of a larger effort to improve quality in the system Its just more evidence that payment reform is key to health care reform says Mark Lester Hes executive vice president of Texas Health Resources and a coauthor of the paper Weve unmasked some hidden perverse incentives that are just part of our system Shots asked if Texas Health is talking with insurers about removing those perverse incentives I cant comment specifically on discussions we have had or are having with the payors Lester said Were all moving toward payment reform Its happening incrementally because its very complex Many efforts are underway to reduce financial incentives for providing more care including   for Medicare that pay the same amount for a procedure with or without complications Wonder how your hospital is doing Ninety percent of the country is still functioning in the world we describe in the paper Gawande says
