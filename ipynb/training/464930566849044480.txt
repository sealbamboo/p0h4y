In a hospital in Lahore Pakistan patients use simple pictures of the sun rising over the mountains and the moon and stars at night to help them understand when to take their medication and how long to take it for With about half of patients at the hospital unable to read or write written instructions on prescriptions and medicine labels are virtually useless In the UK where about one in six people is thought to be functionally illiterate  defined as being unable to pass an English GCSE  could pictures and symbols improve patient understanding too Taking the wrong dose of medicine can be dangerous It can put patients lives at risk According to the Patients Association their helpline receives many calls from patients concerned about whether they have taken the right quantity of medicine at the right time Dr Mike Smith chairman of the association says labelling is a patient safety issue There are many elderly patients who may find the writing in small font on the coloured labels on bottles and packets of medicines difficult to read The instructions are usually typed first by the GP on the prescription form then retyped and added to by a pharmacist who attaches them to the medicine bottle and box itself  So could using pictures make things easier  Using pictures and clarity of labels will certainly help the adherence to medications which in turn will reduce the need to seek help from emergency services due to medication errors Dr Smith says  He adds that the use of pictures on labels could also help patients with mild learning difficulties or dementia At Services Hospital in Lahore Dr Matthew Clayton and colleagues designed the new prescription form for patients based on pictures rather than words see image above It also requires the pharmacists to write the number for each medication as it appears on the form on to the corresponding box of tablets  on the experiment published by the BMJ this week describes an approximate  increase in illiterate patients understanding when using the new form  Literacy levels are much higher in the UK but there are still many groups who could potentially benefit Dr Mobasher Butt clinical lead at BMJ Learning and Quality Improvement and a GP in London says patients with visual impairments learning disabilities mental health problems and those taking lots of different medications could all be helped by a picturebased approach He said Given the diversity of population we look after symbols could certainly help reinforce verbal messages When we give patients a prescription we normally explain when to take the medicine and how often then that message is reiterated by the pharmacist But if the patient has the added advantage of picture and symbols to go on that would really help However not everyone agrees Theo Raynor professor of pharmacy practice at the University of Leeds and an expert on the information provided with medicines in primary care says pictures can be confusing and give patients completely the wrong idea Because most people in the UK can read and write to some degree the priority should be to make information on prescriptions and labels as clear and simple as possible He cites the example of a symbol featuring a baby with a cross through it meaning keep out of the reach of children Some people thought it meant dont take if pregnant others thought it meant this medicine is a contraceptive and others dont give to children Pictures sound like a really easy answer  but they can cause more problems than they solve Prof Raynor says pictures have to be tested on patients and then patients should be taught how to interpret them otherwise they are anything but simple  Where he thinks attention should really be focused is on the patient information leaflets PILs that come inside the medicine box At present they are textheavy and complicated  Theres too much about the harms and sideeffects of medicines The information needs to be more balanced Prof Raynor says People like to have that leaflet so there should be more about how they can benefit from the medication   Dr Butt agrees that the information in the PIL can be overwhelming for patients and sometimes it contradicts what the GP has recommended Between the patients name date of birth and details of the medication there is evidently little room for instructions on a label which is why the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency guidelines stress the need for healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical companies to use simple words of few syllables The use of pictures on prescriptions in Lahore did not completely solve the problem for illiterate patients so there is obviously still work to do on a perfect solution
