This week the Department of Health and Human Services released a ton of information about how insurance sold in  states under the Affordable Care Act will work Most of it came   showing the number of carriers and their premium prices in hundreds of regions Until now weve seen information on subsidized policies to be sold through online marketplaces released in trickles by states that are creating their own online portals The federal data covers states that dumped all or part of the work of building the marketplaces on the feds Its the biggest chunk of information so far available even though many critical pieces  the identity of the insurers the structure of the benefits the networks of the hospitals and doctors  wont be known until next week Thats when the online portals in every state are scheduled to start selling subsidized insurance made available by the federal health law to those who arent otherwise covered The Obama administration boasted that the premiums came out lower than expected Opponents of the law countered that many people buying through the exchanges especially younger healthier consumers may pay substantially more than what they pay now But those were only the headlines A closer look at the data reveals other nuggets Competition equals lower prices In regions with only one insurance company selling through the subsidized exchange the average monthly premium for a yearold buying the lowest cost bronze policy is  before any subsidies are applied In regions with  or more rival carriers the average cost is  or less In the exchanges metal rating system bronze plans are the least expensive category covering  percent of medical costs on average after you pay the premium The number of insurance companies selling through the subsidized marketplace varies hugely from one area to another In many parts of West Virginia Arkansas and Alabama only one company is selling policies to individuals and families through the subsidized exchange Insurers may also offer policies outside the exchange In New Hampshire only one insurer will sell through the exchange in the entire state In the Detroit region on the other hand  carriers will sell subsidized policies In Phoenix  will The number of available plans another indicator of choice also varies Residents of Oviedo in eastern Florida will have  polices offered by six insurers to pick from In Oshkosh Wis consumers can choose from  plans sold by eight companies But only seven policies from one insurer will be available in most parts of Alabama St Louis residents can pick from  policies offered by two insurers There is a paucity of platinum plans Under the metal ratings platinum policies are the most expensive They cover  percent of average medical expenses after you pay the premium Policymakers predicted lowerlevel bronze and silver plans would prove more popular than gold and platinum and it looks like insurance companies think so too While in parts of Florida and Wisconsin you can choose from more than a dozen platinum plans in  percent of the regions included in the federal database there are no platinum policies Insurers are putting their energy into plans with lower premiums and higher deductibles and other outofpocket costs There are wide variations in prices even for similar policies sold in the same state In Tucson Ariz the lowestcost bronze plan for a yearold is  a month But in several rural Arizona counties a bronze plan costs  In Missouri bronze plans for a yearold range from  a month to  Other things being equal youd rather be an uninsured oil hand in Oklahoma than an uninsured cheese maker in Wisconsin In western Wisconsin just over the border from St Paul Minn the cheapest bronze policy for a yearold is  a month Thats the highest in the federal database In Comanche County Okla Fort Sill a similar plan costs  Thats the lowest
