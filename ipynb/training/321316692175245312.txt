Older adults hit   last year For the first time since the Pew Research Centers Internet and American Life Project began conducting surveys a majority  percent of people over age  used the Internet The proportion has since inched upward to  percent Which certainly represents progress When Pew first began tracking Internet use in  only  percent of seniors were online But it remains a fairly anemic number compared to the rest of the adult population more than  percent of whom use the Internet And among the older old those over age    Yet thats the cohort most likely to become isolated by physical limitations poor transportation and the loss of social connections  the group in other words who might particularly benefit from being able to interact with the world digitally for everything from banking and ordering groceries to emailing faraway friends I wonder too how much satisfaction we can really take in the growth of wired seniors as Pew used to call them Back in  more than  percent of the group just behind them those aged  to  were online So maybe we havent made as much progress as it appears Maybe  years later the people online just got older Laurie Orlov a tech industry analyst who writes the   has been fuming about this particular digital divide for years It matters more than ever she told me Organizations keep thinking theyll save a buck by no longer using paper When it comes to government programs financial and insurance statements health information or discount coupons the assumption is that youre online Even simple tasks like finding phone numbers for local businesses may soon require Web access How long will there be print yellow pages How long will there be movie listings in print newspapers For that matter how long will there be print newspapers Without Internet access older people could feel even more cut off than many already do A number of programs have tried to address this disparity but they tend to be smallscale and local A few years ago I wrote about   a nonprofit organization acquired computers for about a dozen lowincome New York City seniors provided instruction then linked their users to discussions at an actual senior center in Queens A worthy demonstration project but three years later it still has fewer than  participants Or take the company called   which has placed its simplified touchscreen computer systems in  nursing homes and assistedliving communities plus some adult day programs Another good idea with a but most seniors dont live in congregate settings AARP last year started a ayear subscription service that gives its members unlimited phone online or instore   agents who can help them choose install use and repair electronics I hear enough muttering from boomers whose parents call whenever they encounter a computer glitch to think turning over this job to the Geek Squad might be a smart move but it doesnt seem like one that can bring large numbers of lowincome seniors onto the Internet We want faster adoption Ms Orlov said Little efforts start up here and there but its not a national effort to get  percent of seniors online Shes convinced by the way that older people can make the leap as many readers here are about to point out I know and that most will want to With some of the devices available today if a person is open and interested and theres something on there thats worth the trouble  like video of family members or the ability to Skype with family  they can learn to use a computer or a tablet she said Money will be the big obstacle of course As Ms Orlov points out its going to take big national organizations with deep pockets  foundations technology corporations Internet providers and cell carriers AARP  to undertake a bigger faster and more effective effort than our current piecemeal approach But it may take less than we would have thought a decade back because tablets are cheaper than most desktops and laptops And tablet ownership is growing among seniors Pew reports Just within  the proportion of the over population with a tablet climbed to  percent from  percent Among those over age  tablet ownership jumped to  percent from  percent This might be the way Other ideas are welcomed
