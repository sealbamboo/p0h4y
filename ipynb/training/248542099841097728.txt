Two years ago the United Nations   launched an experiment that aimed to reduce the cost of malaria drugs in parts of Africa where theyre needed most The idea was to subsidize the cost of drugs sometimes making them available even cheaper than wholesale Did it work The results for the first phase of the pilot were unveiled yesterday in Washington and they looked pretty good  at least for the short time the project has been up and running The   program or AMFm had brought more than  million doses of malaria drugs to clinics and pharmacies in  It also increased access to the top malaria medicines by  to  percent in six countries How many lives did the AMFm save Researchers cant say yet because AMFm ran for only a year and half in most countries Many health officials at the meeting worried this unanswered question will give the Global Fund a reason to scale back or terminate the successful pilot Malaria kills about  people each year Nearly  percent of those who die are are children  or ACTs are highly effective at curing malaria but in many parts of subSaharan Africa these drugs arent available in private clinics where the majority of patients are treated Counterfeits are another big problem The goal of AMFm was to help private clinics and pharmacies stock ACTs and then sell genuine medicines at affordable prices The AFM negotiated with drugmakers to reduce ACTs prices and then the Global Fund subsidized the initial purchasing of the drugs by clinics and pharmacies The approach worked surprisingly well says   a health economist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who coled the independent evaluation of AMFm Six of the eight countries met goals set by the Global Fund for boosting accessibility and affordability of the drugs It is quite astonishing that we have seen the changes we saw despite the short period Hanson told Shots at the meeting Hanson says that the Global Fund should continue to explore ways to improve the program and possibly expand into countries where it is likely to work But the tone from the Global Fund was more cautious AMFm was an experiment a proof of concept   an executive with the Global Fund said at the meeting Could we use the private sector to bring access to medications that can alleviate an epidemic The pilot program demonstrated that private sector health care is essential to in fighting malaria Zewdie said but they cant tell if it is sustainable or a costeffective way of reducing malaria deaths The Global Fund will meet in November to decide the fate of AMFm The Global Fund doesnt have the intention of terminating anything without due process Zewdie said but she doesnt think they will continue it as it is or expand it Going forward the Global Fund will be using ever penny strategically Zewdie said The era of throwing money at things is over
