People are being urged to find out their true heart age in order to cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes  Leading UK doctors say we need to look beyond biological age to consider what toll a lifetime of risk factors such as smoking will have on the heart  If not we will continue to miss early opportunities to intervene to prevent ill health they told the journal   They have come up with a new   called JBS This they say should reveal a persons true heart age and risk Currently doctors look at shortterm risk to judge who they should help and people who have a high chance of a heart attack or stroke in the next  years are their priority But experts now say this is too narrow  New guidelines issued by the Joint British Societies say doctors should look at the risk throughout a persons lifetime  and assess their true heart age The JBS sum used to calculate true heart age takes family and lifestyle risk factors into account to predict how many more years an individual can expect to live before she or he has a heart attack or stroke depending on the future actions they might decide to take For example a yearold woman who smokes has high blood pressure and raised cholesterol plus a strong family history of heart disease will have a true heart age of      Using current heart assessment methods which look at shortterm risk of heart attack and stroke within the next  years her risk would be deemed low  less than  The JBS test would suggest she could live to  without having a heart attack or stroke But if the same woman stopped smoking and lowered her cholesterol and blood pressure not only would her heart age fall to  she could also expect to live to the age of  without having a heart attack or stroke And she would cut her risk of heart attack or stroke within the next  years even further  to less than  The UK experts behind JBS  the Joint British Societies which includes the British Cardiovascular Society  the British Hypertension Society and nine more  say their approach is based on the growing body of evidence showing that there is a long buildup to cardiovascular disease and that most heart attacks and strokes occur in people who are in the intermediate risk category It will be used by the NHS Health Check programme in England aimed at  to yearolds but is not intended to prompt blanket prescribing of statins and other heart health drugs say the authors For the majority the recommendation will be to lead a healthier lifestyle rather than pop a pill they insist  Dr Iain Simpson president of the British Cardiovascular Society said By only using shortterm risk estimates which are heavily dependent on age and gender younger people and women tend to be overlooked even if they have substantially elevated modifiable risk factors and are consequently at high lifetime risk
