Scientists have gotten close to pinning down the origin of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome a dangerous respiratory disease that emerged in Saudi Arabia  months ago It turns out the MERS virus has been circulating in Arabian camels for more than two decades scientists report in a study published Tuesday So far MERS has sickened more than  people killing at least  of them  an alarming  percent But scientists havent been sure where the virus came from or how people catch it A report in the journal   suggests the virus is ubiquitous among Saudi Arabian   the onehumped variety The animals get the virus when theyre young and it often doesnt make them sick We now know the answers to several questions says the reports senior author   of Columbia University First this virus infection is very common in camels It probably occurs early in these camels So this is a reservoir that is constantly replenishing itself It can go directly from camels to humans with no need for adaptation in another animal And theres a lot of virus This really confirms that this is a camel virus says virologist   of Erasmus University who wasnt involved in the study Koopmans and her team had previously   the MERS virus in camels as far afield as Africa and the Canary Islands But the current study she says ends the discussion about whether camels get the virus from people It shows this virus is circulating in camels period Koopmans tells Shots At the same time the new data leave other questions unanswered and even deepen some of the mystery around MERS The symptoms of MERS  often a lifethreatening lung infection  can look similar to regular pnuemonias So one question is whether people have been getting the virus for decades without anyone noticing or diagnosing it What argues against that Koopmans says is genetic sequence data from viruses picked up in people indicating that the virus emerged around mid not before that That does not add up to infections having gone on for a long time but thats still an open question The biggest puzzle though is how people whove had no contact with camels get the MERS virus In our cases in Saudi twothirds have had no contact with camels says Saudi Arabias deputy health minister Dr   Its known that people can get MERS from other humans But this fails to account for most cases which occur sporadically with no obvious source of transmission One possibility Lipkin says is that people pick up the virus from contaminated surfaces which scientists call   A   published last fall shows that the MERS virus can persist for at least four days in the environment at wide ranges of temperature and humidity This makes it similar to its far more easily transmitted cousin the   virus and very different from say flu viruses The virus ability to persist in the environment may help explain a MERS outbreak last year among hospitals in the Saudi town of AlHofuf But Memish thinks transmission is a bit more complex than can be explained by fomites We have strong evidence from a cluster of MERS infections in a household with  people only one or two of whom got infected Memish says After  years and close to  cases we know this virus is not very infectious The discovery of widespread MERS virus infection in camels does not rule out bats or other animals as intermediaries in the chain of transmission to humans  although the current study didnt find evidence of infection in goats or sheep Its known that bats harbor a similar virus and last fall Lipkins group caused a stir by publishing evidence that a virus extracted from an   contained a short stretch of genes identical to MERS virus from humans But that bat was one among thousands of samples with no evidence of the virus And not everybody in the community is persuaded that single bat was infected with the same one that causes human disease We need to find out if there is another intermediate host that can carry the virus more closely into the human population says Lipkin who has   for his ability to track down elusive new viruses We need to understand how people get exposed to this virus The answer Lipkin thinks lies in gumshoe epidemiology  the painstaking work of investigating what distinguishes people who have gotten MERS from counterparts who havent In fact after a lengthy delay that has generated much   Arabian health officials are about to launch just such a project called a   The World Health Organization has scheduled a meeting next week to finalize the study design Memish says But Memish doesnt expect the study to answer crucial questions I dont think were going to find anything new because what weve been doing for the last  years is an indepth investigation of every case and their contacts he tells Shots Koopmans disagrees A recent WHO report she notes makes really clear that few people with MERS have had the kind of followup you would want One sidelight of the new report is the strong suggestion that collaborations between Saudi researchers and outsiders continue to be contentious A previous collaboration between Lipkin and Memish the lead person for MERS in the Saudi government has ended Although Memishs name has appeared on previous papers with Lipkin its missing this time Were surprised to see this report coming from their lab using probably our samples but were not aware of it until now Memish says Lipkin says the group collected its own specimens in Saudi Arabia in collaboration with a group from   Lipkin acknowledges his collaboration with Memish has broken down Weve gone our separate ways and I wish him well Lipkin says
