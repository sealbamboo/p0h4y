Spending on locum doctors to plug the gaps in AE units in England has risen by  in three years figures show  The data obtained by Labour under the Freedom of Information Act showed m was spent last year up from m in  Employing locum doctors can cost  a shift four times as much as filling a shift with permanent staff A government spokeswoman said retaining AE doctors was a longstanding problem in the NHS Labour received data from  trusts  threequarters of the ones that run AE units It covered all grades of doctors and suggested these temporary staff were now being employed for nearly one in  consultant shifts and up to one in six for more junior posts Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the rise in spending was linked to the disastrous reorganisation of the NHS carried out by the Coalition government This government is guilty of gross mismanagement of the NHS  They are paying more for an AE service which is getting worse by the week he said Dr Cliff Mann of the College of Emergency Medicine said This sort of spending is very unwise  It is not an efficient way of spending NHS money and can be damaging for morale when doctors work alongside other sometimes less qualified doctors who are earning much more But this has really been building for the past decade There has been a lack of job planning and it is now very hard to attract doctors to this speciality Research by the college has suggested half of trainee posts are going unfilled It believes the unsocial hours and pressures on AE departments have made it less attractive than other areas of medicine The college has recently worked with Health Education England to draw up plans to tackle the problem including more flexible working patterns extra holidays and more training opportunities Conservative MP Dr Dan Poulter a health minister who works parttime as a doctor said There has been for many years a problem  It was first flagged up in  under the previous government about recruiting doctors into AE and it takes six years to train AE doctors so this well predates the current government He said is it was important that improving the worklife balance of AE doctors was part of the the governments plans when renegotiating its contract with doctors
