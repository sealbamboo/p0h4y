The father of a schoolboy who died after suffering concussion during a rugby match has met Wales Education Minister Huw Lewis to discuss safety  Peter Robinson wants compulsory lessons in schools teaching children about the dangers of getting a bang to the head  Mr Robinsons son Ben  died after suffering multiple concussions during a cup match for his school team in Northern Ireland  He previously met Scotland and Northern Irelands education ministers  Two years ago Ben was knocked unconscious and suffered from concussion after several highimpact collisions during the game  However instead of being substituted he was allowed to carry on playing He collapsed just before the end of the game and later died in hospital Speaking to BBC Wales Mr Robinson said had Ben and his teammates been aware of the dangers and the signs and symptoms he would still be alive At the start of the second half he was involved in a heavy tackle and he lay on the ground for a minuteandahalf being treated he said  And when he was assisted to his feet he looked like an old man when he was walking around but he kept being involved in heavy tackles and there was no chance of recuperating  he didnt get a chance to rest at all He spoke to four people that day and none of them were overly concerned  because of a lack of awareness  I suppose the main thing is education at schools level If you build it into the curriculum then no matter what sport you play theyre aware of the dangers of concussion Its ironic to think if hed have had a blood injury hed have been taken off and he would be here today Mr Robinson met Mr Lewis at the Senedd on Thursday to discuss concussion awareness The safety of young people when playing sport both within and outside school is paramount especially when playing contact sports like rugby said Mr Lewis  It is important that everyone involved at all levels of sport are aware of the symptoms and dangers of concussion The Welsh Rugby Union says it is committed to player welfare and is looking at devising a nationwide education programme for all levels of the game Mr Robinsons campaign for greater awareness and education in schools is being backed by one of the worlds leading experts on brain and sport injuries Dr Robert Cantu of Boston University School of Medicine  Everyone ought to understand what are the concussion symptoms everyone ought to understand what is proper concussion management Dr Cantu said It can be very devastating in the sense that if you mismanage concussion you place especially youngsters at risk of second impact syndrome which can be fatal You also place them at risk of receiving further brain trauma which if it happens to an already injured brain its very likely that now youre going to have a very prolonged period of concussion symptoms Dr Cantu said there was some form of concussion legislation in  out of  states in the USA In October a former medical advisor to the International Rugby Board warned that rugbys governing bodies were playing with fire when dealing with the issue of concussion  Dr Barry ODriscoll told BBC Wales that he wanted mandatory concussion training for those involved with the game from grassroots level upwards Mr Robinson met ministers in Scotland and Northern Ireland in October to discuss making concussion awareness compulsory in schools there  Northern Irelands Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride has already sent letters to schools to raise awareness Scottish ministers as a first step have agreed to prepare and distribute leaflets
