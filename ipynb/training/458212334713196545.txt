No one at the clinic knew the plan Nelson and I kept it a secret because the staff had contributed to a pool  each person predicted my finish time and the one who came closest won all the money  at K Perfect Nelson relayed  The realtime updates got everyone into the action  though the money on the line probably helped Nelson acted like a proud coach whose student was finally following his advice  Three hours and  minutes at K he shouted Hes going to do it Its mostly downhill from here Nelson was grinning from ear to ear running from one end of the clinic to the other keeping everyone updated Every staff member believed they could win this thing even some of the patients were in on it They were captivated charged up cheering me on  Four hours and four minutes at K Nelson shouted He has K to go it is just over a mile  And then nothing  Nelson said nothing Everyone had their eyes on him waiting for the final update  Still nothing  Nelson knew something was not right  Something happened he said He should have finished by now Everybody was quiet Seconds tickedoff My assistant Debbie got on her iPhone and checked CNN  They are saying that a bomb went off near the finish she said her voice cracking  They all stared at each other No one said a word She must be wrong they thought This just doesnt happen at marathons Then the phones started ringing Nonstop Patients friends relatives more patients  all calling the clinic inquiring Was I OK No one could give them an answer Time passed By now it was clear that two bombs had exploded and many people were injured some severely Unbeknownst to anyone I was the first person the cops stopped less than two blocks from the finish line My wife Jackie and her daughter Erin were waiting for me directly across the street from the first explosion They were luckier than many It took more than  minutes before Jackie and I connected We flew back to Detroit that evening shaken but physically unhurt I could not sleep I kept hearing the sirens blaring all night Images of ambulances carrying the injured raced uninterruptedly in front of me It was surreal  On Tuesday April  I went to work I always did after Boston It was difficult very difficult But I had patients and staff who were waiting for me The phones continued to ring but now staff had answers I treated patients but emotionally I really wasnt there  When they asked me about Boston I choked up It was hard to talk about it It had affected me like nothing else before I still dont understand how malicious and evil some people can be My consolation is that the majority of people are decent and caring individuals Im an optimistic person and I have faith in the goodness of humanity  I have to I have no other choice So many people reached out to us after Boston The outpouring of concern and support from patients friends and acquaintances was overwhelming They all care they all love they all feel They all remind me how good people can be  That is what makes me want to go back to Boston Yes like thousands of others Im running Boston again this year Every marathon is a marathon but Boston is Boston Im running it to make a simple statement Acts of cowardice will not stop me from exercising my rights as an athlete and a human I am running it for those who were injured and cant run it I am running it for the love of running I am running it to show my support for all Bostonians Lastly I am running it because in  I never really finished  This year I will
