As snow begins falling in Colorados Rocky Mountain National Park the town at its doorstep finds itself newly isolated The only yearround road into or out of Estes Park Colo now is the   It traverses a jumble of mountains all the way Its not the kind of road an ambulance can scream over at  miles an hour Not while Im in the back hopefully jokes paramedic Erle Collum The recent flooding in Colorado washed out the other two roads into town for miles at a stretch Thats bad news for Estes Park Medical Center the towns only hospital Help from big city medical facilities that used to be an hour away is now more like three or four via this single remaining road connecting the town to the rest of the world Collom says hes grateful the towns ambulances have fourwheel drive In the winter time we can get some pretty good snow around here so its a nice thing to have just because of the area we work in he says Its typical that theres snow on the ground from late September through April Estes Park is a town of about  and it sees  million   visitors a year But the towns   isnt set up to take care of critical cases for very long Collom says at least one patient a day gets sent down the mountain to an urban hospital for more advanced care And not everyone stable enough for the old hourlong ambulance ride will be able to take one stretching four hours or more Theyre not the best roads anyway so I suspect itll complicate things when winter finally comes around he says The hospital already makes pretty frequent use of helicopters for the trip to larger hospitals Theres no place for airplanes to land and mountain weather keeps helicopters grounded about half the time in winter says Bill Collins a paramedic who flies helicopter missions into Estes Park Youre basically kind of like being in the center courtyard of a castle and the castle walls are the mountains he says Before the hospital could usually count on either an ambulance or a helicopter as the failsafe Now a blizzard that makes air travel dangerous and closes the remaining road could cut off the town So   the hospitals medical director worries about possible life and death situations like a premature birth Premature babies need an intensive care unit and there is none in Estes Park That means doctors have to pump air by hand into the preemies lungs until it can get to an ICU with a special ventilator I dont know how long our pediatricians could manage that baby here Ive seen them do it for multiple hours Id never want to see them do that for multiple days he says And he says theres nothing worse than not being able to get a patient to needed care With an uncertain winter coming Estes Park hospital CEO Bobbi Swenson has to figure out a budget She expects increased costs and is unsure whether theyll all get covered Will insurers pay for a lot more helicopter and ambulance rides And then theres staffing Half the hospitals workforce lives down the mountain Swensons offering temporary housing But she says There are some people that are not going to be willing to come up here for three to four days and be away from their families Its unclear when daily commuting will be feasible again And the hospital may even be busier serving townspeople who used to drive down the mountain for everything from orthopedic surgery and chemotherapy to basic primary care Many small rural hospitals like Estes Parks get special   payments from the federal government But President Obama says he wants to trim those payments by one percent Swenson says full funding is essential to keep facilities like hers open All the uncertainty at the top for now doesnt change things at ambulancelevel in Estes Park Erle Collom closes his up and gets ready for the next call Were hanging in there and well get through this flood stuff and were still taking care of people he says Thats what we do A little more challenging to get through but we can do it Engineers say they may restore more access to Estes Park by December but that may be only a one lane gravel road in many places State and federal governments have pledged  million to fix Colorados roads State officials say repairs may actually cost more than half a billion
