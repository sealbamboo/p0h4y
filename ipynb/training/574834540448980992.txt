s well as the desk chairs and examination couch found in any GPs consulting room Dr Veena Jhas also has paintings by patients on the walls thankyou cards displayed above the handtowel dispenser and a mug on the window ledge with the words VOP Very Overworked Person on the side The mug was a jokey gift from one of her colleagues to mark the completion in  of a muchneeded extension to the Manor Park surgery where they work But it accurately conveys the constant busyness that is Jhas norm We are all crumbling under the pressures of workload she says with a sigh Jha starts work just after am at the surgery in Glossop an old Derbyshire mill town in the Peak District that is increasingly home to commuters working  miles west in Manchester Few days last less than  hours Switching on her computer immediately tells her how many tasks  pressing matters involving patients health that the receptionists or some of the nine other   have flagged up  she has to deal with on top of what is an already crowded schedule There are anything up to  tasks that she has to deal with somehow while coping with the rest of her daily workload which involves seeing up to  patients in her morning sessions which start at am speaking to others on the phone doing home visits at lunchtime and treating another  people at her afternoon surgery This must be done while all the time listening carefully making detailed notes dispensing her best advice and making important sometimes difficult decisions like whether to send someone for a scan or have them admitted to hospital Time Jhas most precious resource means she has to prioritise her tasks Not all always get done Happily Jha loves her job I was a hospital doctor a gynaecologist for  years But switching to general practice was the best decision I have ever made in my life because I get tremendous job satisfaction even though its nearly always busy As a hospital doctor I treated a condition but as a GP I treat a patient  As a GP I have a more personal and more intimate relationship with patients professionally speaking You get to know about their family and the dynamics in that For example if I know that a male patient is an alcoholic and his wife comes in with stress but wont say why shes stressed Ill already know whats happening in the background  so am more empathetic to them A yearold man came to see me who when I asked him What can I do for you today said that his kitchen sink was blocked I thought he was joking but he did want my help with his kitchen sink He came to me because he saw me as a helpful person in his life My girls the surgerys receptionists called the council and got it sorted she recalls There is a downside though to constantly hearing so much detail about peoples lives As a GP its so much of an emotional rollercoaster because you have dealt with so much sadness during the day At the end of the day you just go home and sit down and do nothing Jha says quietly  Another negative is the pressure caused by the apparently inexorable rise in the number of patients seeking appointments Manor House which cares for  patients in Glossop and another  at its smaller sister surgery in nearby Hadfield is experiencing the same problems as many of the UKs  GP practices The ageing growing and in some ways increasingly unhealthy population means more patients want or need to be seen than the surgery can easily accommodate It vividly illustrates how overstretched the NHS has become MPs have recounted in parliament how constituents have desperately sought their help to get a GP appointment while the revelation in December that patients were having to   from am outside their surgery in Surrey showed the extent of the problem One of the patients in one of Manor Houses two waiting rooms Sheila Redford says They are obviously under pressure You can feel that when you walk in Theres a lot of people queuing up at reception Theres almost always a queue there  thats not a criticism its just a fact Redford a patient at Manor House for  years says things have changed for the worse Many years ago there was a homeliness about being in the doctors surgery  Social niceties have got lost like receptionists asking How are you getting on Even they dont have time to do that anymore Theyre too busy answering phones making appointments Each family doctor does a certain number of morning or afternoon sessions every week seeing patients They are expected to see  patients and speak to three more on the phone in a threehour morning session or see  and assess two others over the phone in a twoandahalfhour afternoon one Each session is divided into minute slots None of the doctors think that is nearly long enough especially with the growing number of older people who have several things seriously wrong at the same time such as diabetes heart disease and breathing problems The longer you have been in the surgery the more comfortable with you patients become and so they start raising more than one problem But  minutes is barely enough for one problem says Jha You have to greet them establish a rapport find out what the problem is do an examination and draw up a management plan for example ordering a blood test peak flow test or bloodpressure check If the patient is acutely unwell with abdominal pain you have to decide if its serious enough for them to be admitted or if they should just go home Those are very important decisions Jha sees three or four such patients most days Their health means she cannot afford to make a wrong call It also takes half an hour at the end of each session to mop up to ensure that the details of every patients symptoms have been entered into their electronic medical record On many if not most days Jha goes without a break Lunch No lunch Maybe an apple Or Ill maybe grab a sandwich on a quiet day though work while Im eating the sandwich In  Manor Houses GPs put on  sessions a week during which they typically saw  patients facetoface and did telephone consultations with  others That has risen to andahalf sessions a week at which they usually provide  appointments and talk to  patients on the phone Across England the number of consultations has risen from m in  to m in   Despite the chronic shortage of GPs across the UK Manor House has its desired complement of doctors But it is telling that its staff include doctors from Romania India Pakistan and Malaysia For Jha and her colleagues there is also an unending number of meetings to attend both internally and externally for example with the local   clinical commissioning group which supervises all the health services in Tameside and Glossop They can be about targets the financial incentives GPs receive safeguarding children and vulnerable adults palliative care patients longterm care plans and analysis of patient safety incidents as well as many other issues Often these meetings and educational activities have to be moved to the weekends as there arent actually enough hours during the weekdays to go through them Jha says The surgery has up to five people simultaneously answering phone calls a large team of receptionists  family doctors five nurses and three healthcare assistants Opening hours in Glossop are ampm with surgery beginning at am on Mondays and finishing at pm on Thursdays It does not open at weekends though a deliberate attempt by the GPs to maintain a worklife balance  It usually gets busiest about am Thats because by then the appointments have basically all gone explains Jo Jenkins the reception supervisor who heads a team of  at the two surgeries Those who cannot get a consultation that day are offered one at another time or the opportunity to speak to a doctor at lunchtime  telephone triage  or are added to the shortlist of those whose condition sounds like they need to be assessed promptly and are given one of the few oncall slots Patients who ring at am or am and are told there are no routine appointments left can get a bit frantic because they want an appointment You have to be professional and try and calm the situation but the person may be shouting at you because they want an appointment at pm But sometimes when I say Sorry we dont have one at pm can you come at pm they say No Ill be shopping then or at the hairdressers says Jenkins Another member of staff even describes some patients as aggressive And another says If you go into Tesco in your uniform people will say Can you get me an appointment Ive tried to get an appointment or Ive tried to get through to your surgery but I couldnt get through or my prescription wasnt ready They complain even in the pub at night However the practice does act on such informal feedback They are setting up ways of treating common illnesses such as conjunctivitis and urine infections more quickly and encourage people to see a nurse practitioner who can diagnose and prescribe medication instead of a GP However staff also appreciate that illness brings anxiety and fear and thus patients can be very impatient about being seen whether thats for a lump they have found or palliative care they need to organise for a relative or blood test or annual review of their diabetes or severe shortness of breath or care for the stroke they had Ultimately those who demand to receive prompt attention generally get it though that may be telephone advice You cant turn people away You just have to deal with it says Jenkins The fact that  of the  patients at the surgeries in Glossop and Hadfield are on repeat prescriptions underlines that like GPs and hospitals everywhere Manor House is facing a growing burden of illness which is expected to keep on rising Dr Nicola Thorley a GP at Manor House for the last  years echoes what some experienced AE doctors say when explaining why demand for their services is rising too  that something in society has changed Patient expectation has changed an awful lot too she says Patients arent prepared to wait the way they used to  these days people especially those under  want same day access seven days a week  Manor House runs various services and specialist clinics including surgery for patients with skin problems It also employs its own pharmacist and has hired an extra nurse specifically to look after the overs In doing all this Manor House is already operating in broadly the way that Simon Stevens the boss of NHS England says GP surgeries need to if the health service is to cope His blueprint to safeguard the NHSs future envisages GP surgeries coming together to form federations and become large enough so that they can provide an alternative to hospital for more and more patients However Jha notes that paradoxically while offering all these different clinics at Manor House may relieve the pressure on its local hospital Tameside general it seems to increase demand on her and her colleagues Despite family doctors handling  of all patient contacts in the NHS their share of its budget has shrunk to just  As pressures have risen the number of GPs has not kept pace and burnout is leading to more and more taking early retirement  Worryingly that has coincided with the failure of determined efforts to attract enough medical graduates into choosing general practice as a career No wonder the Royal College of GPs is warning that urgent action is needed such as the recruitment of  more GPs by  and much more money by  if patients access is not to get even worse Like Jha Dr Guy Wilkinson another of the GPs eats lunch at his desk  Over his  years as a GP he has watched the family doctors role grow ever wider as bureaucracy and medical complexity have also increased There used to be hospitals where frail elderly patients would live longterm But now more older people often with multiple illnesses are being cared for in nursing homes or at home with massive social support Historically those people had maybe two things wrong with them Now ageing means its five So more people are on more complex medication and more people need monitoring he says This morning he saw  patients spoke to three others on the phone and supervised three trainee GPs as they too assessed patients He then spent an hour writing a fivepage care plan for a very ill man who is close to death and coordinating the details of that with district nurses palliative care services and the patients nursing home  an important but very complex and timeconsuming job His frustrations include patients who take up an appointment in his view unnecessarily like parents bringing a small child in at the slightest sign of a problem Theres more fear these days that they wont be able to care for their child through an illness Historically where people may have gone to their mum or grandma for advice these days its get them to the GP He is very pessimistic about what the future holds for GPs and worries that the stresses and strains involved is discouraging young medics from the profession Two local GPs recently returned home to India because they had too much paperwork and their working hours were getting longer and longer he says Being a GP is a tough job and it can leave you feeling shot through at the end of the day because its an isolated job even in a practice with a lot of GPs You are the last port of call for patients and we never discharge people adds Wilkinson I have four children but I wouldnt want any of them becoming a GP like I did because the great bit about being a GP  providing continuity of care watching kids grow up into adults and living and working as part of a community  is being unbalanced by the high pressure nature of it and the decreasing job satisfaction
