The AE units at two Northern Ireland hospitals are to close at the weekend until further notice The changes at Downe Hospital Downpatrick and Lagan Valley Hospital in Lisburn are to come into effect on Saturday  January A shortage of suitably qualified emergency doctors is being blamed  Both AE units will also operate from  until  on week days from the same date This represents no change to the Lagan Valley weekday hours but means  the Downe unit will close two hours earlier In a statement the South Eastern Health Trust said it regretted the move This is because the trust has been experiencing critical medical staffing issues for some weeks it said   The weekend service at both hospitals relies heavily on locum doctors and despite exhaustive efforts by the trust agencies have been unable to provide sufficient skilled experienced doctors to sustain the service    In addition existing permanent medical staff have worked numerous additional shifts in an effort to keep the service going but this is not sustainable The trust said existing GP out of hours service at both hospitals would continue and it would work with GPs to minimise the impact of the changes It said patients needing emergency care especially those with sudden and acute illness or severe trauma should go to the AE unit at the Ulster Hospital Dundonald or their nearest hospital
