When San Francisco prosecutors dismissed charges against Kristian Aspelin in early December it became just the latest case to raise questions about how shaken baby syndrome is diagnosed Aspelin who was accused of causing the death of his infant son had one thing in his favor He had enough money to pay for medical experts who cast doubt on the prosecutions theory   Aspelins nightmare began on a November afternoon two years ago He had just brought his two sons home from day care His yearold son opened the refrigerator and dropped strawberries and pizza on the floor Aspelin says he went to clean it up while holding his monthold son Johan    So I ran into the kitchen to address what was going on and I brought Johan along with me in my right hand and eventually after cleaning up slipped and fell says Aspelin who spoke publicly for the first time in an interview with NPR And I will never forgive myself for bringing Johan into the kitchen but it was an accident Johan had fallen onto the tile floor    Aspelin called  and an ambulance took the infant to the hospital Five days after the fall Johan died   The San Francisco medical examiner did an autopsy and found injuries consistent with shaken baby syndrome Aspelin was charged with felony assault of his son   Earlier this month prosecutors quietly dropped the charges after Aspelins attorney presented reports from six medical experts and a biomechanical engineer Those defense experts explained how the childs death was consistent with the fall Aspelin described and argued there was a lack of evidence to suggest the child was deliberately injured   Aspelins defense even hired a video company that made a model of the familys kitchen  the family had since moved  and filmed Aspelin holding a doll slipping on the floor   Before we did the reenactment Aspelin says I didnt know if I would be able to how I would react to go into that environment and try to relive those moments that have you know basically haunted me for for a long time   One issue was whether a child could die from a fall of just about three feet The video showed how the childs head could have hit the hard tile   Among the experts Aspelin hired were those who have testified on both sides of child abuse cases Some explained how   about child deaths is changing and how they have come to understand there are many alternative possibilities to whats often thought to be deliberate and violent shaking   Patrick Barnes a pediatric neuroradiologist and one of the experts hired by Aspelins defense explained how doctors now recognize a variety of accidental and natural causes that are sometimes overlooked in cases that are first diagnosed as shaken baby syndrome Barnes had testified for the prosecution in one of the most famous shaken baby syndrome cases  at the  trial of English au pair Louise Woodward in Massachusetts Since then he has come to believe that the syndrome is overdiagnosed and misdiagnosed   Aspelins attorney Stuart Hanlon agrees Innocent people get convicted especially in these kind of cases he says And we have to have a better way to protect people from false allegations of shaken baby   To pay for his defense Aspelin went through his savings sold his house and borrowed from family and friends to raise more than  million It cost about  just for the expert medical witnesses  a price that makes them unavailable to many defendants    NPR News Investigations  with PBS   and ProPublica  found  cases of child deaths where charges were later reversed or dropped Since then a Texas man who was the focus of one story   And in California a woman who was the focus of another     A spokeswoman for San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon confirmed that the charges against Aspelin were dropped Prosecutors  in an unusual arrangement  worked collaboratively with Aspelins medical experts In the end the district attorney concluded there was not enough evidence as the spokeswoman put it to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt   Still Aspelins troubles are far from over Since the indictment hes been required to live apart from his wife and their surviving son who is now    He really kept us strong because we had something to really fight for Aspelin says of his older son And I couldnt bear even thinking of losing our other son after Johan went away    Aspelin can see his son every day  on supervised visits  but cant stay overnight in the house It will take another legal proceeding to be reunited
