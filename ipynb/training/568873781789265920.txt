hen I was  years old I experienced the first symptoms of what almost  years later would be diagnosed as Parkinsons disease Getting Parkinsons in your teens is pretty unusual if not rare Nevertheless I am happy that I wasnt diagnosed with an old persons disease in my teens I am convinced that if I had known when I was  that the problems I experienced with movement gait and balance were due to Parkinsons I would not have gone to university got my drivers licence or dared to start a family with the man I met at university In Sweden as in the UK Parkinsons is mainly managed with medication prescribed by a neurologist preferably combined with physical activity But most of the care in chronic diseases is not delivered in healthcare I visit my neurologist two times a year for about  minutes The rest of the years  hours I spend in selfcare taking care of myself the best way I can During the one hour per year with my neurologist he assesses my symptoms answers my questions and prescribes the medication I take six times a day in five different combinations But frankly he doesnt know if I take my medications or not This is why selfcare is so important I am the only person with the whole picture To me selfcare is everything I do to stay as healthy as possible with a disease that is a difficult life companion It entails everything from making sure I take my medication in the optimal way to eating healthily getting enough sleep to making sure I stay physically active I also make an effort to learn as much as I can about my condition my neurologist says that I know more about Parkinsons research than he does I dont find that odd since he needs to try to stay on top of research in probably hundreds of neurological diseases whereas I focus on just one  I have never been one for much exercise and I didnt enjoy sports growing up probably because it was really hard work for me getting my body to move Now however I know how important physical activity is for me to stay well and I use an activity tracker to measure how many steps I take every day how much sleep I get and what quality it is This makes me feel more in control of my Parkinsons because I know more about my condition and better understand why I am feeling really Parky after a night of bad sleep It also enables me to see that the exercise I do really does have a positive effect My strongest weapon against Parkinsons is self observation Sometimes I use technology and sometimes just a pen and paper I use a finger tapping app to evaluate how the effects of my medication varies over the day and as a result have been able to optimise my medication regime My neurologist welcomes discussions based on data I bring to appointments We both agree that it would be ideal if the data I collected could be pulled into my healthcare record but Sweden is not quite ready for that yet  Besides being a patient I am also a doctoral student in health informatics at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm where I use my selfmonitoring experience as the basis of my research I am working closely with fellow Parkinsons patients to develop and research tools that can improve our condition I often present my work to different audiences other researchers fellow patients healthcare professionals or policy makers And almost every time someone says But Sara you are not a typical patient You have to think about the old the less engaged and the nontechies To some degree this is a generational issue since older people tend to see physicians as more of an authority But it is a myth that older people are reluctant to use new technology I am also active in patient advocacy circles internationally This movement is growing stronger and consists of active engaged patients often with serious health challenges who believe strongly in autonomy We are convinced that the person with the biggest interest in their health as well as the opportunity to do something about it is oneself And we want to work together with the healthcare system to achieve the best health we possibly can After all my health is my responsibility In the illustration below the red circle signifies the hour in which I am in direct contact with neurological speciality care The blue dots are the  hours in selfcare applying my knowledge and experience together with what I get from my neurologist to manage a difficult condition as best I can
