A federal judge handed a legal victory to drug maker Hospira Inc. by suspending the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's decision this week to allow the marketing of certain generic copies of Hospira's top product, the sedative Precedex.. The judge, however, subsequently suspended the portion of his order stating that the FDA had to recall any generic Precedex already sold or distributed. Mylan Inc. said this week that it began shipping generic Precedex to the market on Monday.
