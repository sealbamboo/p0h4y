Noncompliance generally means that doctors doubt that a patient will take his medicine or go to followup appointments  In a statement Tuesday Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta said While there has been misinformation circulating Childrens cannot discuss the specifics of this case or any other case due to privacy rules The hospital earlier had said it was working closely with the family to find solutions Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston is in good standing according to the United Network for Organ Sharing the nonprofit organization in charge of transplant coordination in the United States Assessing compliance for potential transplant recipients is important because if a patient doesnt strictly take all required medicines as directed he or she could die within weeks of leaving the hospital said Dr Ryan Davies a cardiothoracic surgeon at the Alfred I duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington Delaware who is not involved with this case But Bell said a doctor told the family that Anthonys low grades and time spent in juvenile detention factored into that assessment The doctor made the decision that he wasnt a good candidate because of that Bell said I guess he didnt think Anthony was going to be a productive citizen  Anthonys mother Melencia Hamilton told   that doctors said Anthony would live only three to six months if he didnt get the heart transplant In the meantime the story became public in local media The Southern Christian Leadership Conferences Georgia chapter got involved because Anthonys family called and the organization has a longtime relationship with the child said the Rev Samuel Mosteller the chapters president  Mosteller said Anthony was judged based on tattoos and an ankle bracelet from a juvenile agency Bell said the detention was because Anthony got into an altercation to protect his younger brother On Tuesday Bell said a doctor delivered the groundbreaking news to the family He said that Anthony has been approved to receive a heart He put him on the transplant list Bell said doctors told Anthony hell likely receive a new heart in about three to four months but that this timetable could change  Anthony had no health problems before this summer Bell said the heart problem is not congenital But he started to have trouble sleeping and then complained about his chest hurting His mother took him to the hospital because of the chest pains  Bell said Anthony is excited and his mother overjoyed after the hospitals reversal The teen is now considered top priority for a heart transplant he just has to wait for one to become available  Federal records show that  people were on waiting lists for heart transplants in  but only  of these procedures were performed While waiting for a heart transplant  people died Dr David Weill medical director of Stanford Universitys Lung and HeartLung Transplant Program said its not unusual for patients to be rejected from organ transplant lists because of noncompliance  in other words if they are seen as people who wont follow instructions about taking medications and seeing doctors  At Stanford Weills group evaluates about  patients per year for lung transplants and turns down about  to  because of noncompliance Its about the same for heart transplants as well he said  As part of the evaluation process organ transplant patients undergo a complete psychosocial evaluation so doctors can get a sense of whether they and their families will follow through with a complicated medical regimen Weill said  A few times a year we run into people who cant he said  A patient would not be turned down solely for having served prison time or having bad grades Weill said but we would want to look at the entire picture Some patients have been denied because they dont have anyone in their lives who can take care of them and accompany them to appointments After a heart transplant patients are too sick to do these things alone Weill said When we fear that someones not going to do well its because the patient couldnt comply with the regimen or they dont have any support in their life he said  Psychosocial factors dont change a persons priority on the waiting list but they could lead a person to be denied a spot on that list he said Arthur Caplan head of the division of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center noted that patients have to adhere to a lifelong regimen after receiving an organ transplant  showing up at medical appointments taking medications monitoring changes in health  and teenagers in general dont have a good track record of following orders  Teenagers arent automatically ruled out for heart transplants but the consequence that you are going to die if you dont take these medicines is far from the mind of a yearold said Davies the cardiothoracic surgeon Instead of denying Anthony a spot on the transplant list Caplan suggested that the boy should be counseled and worked with intensively so he understands whats expected posttransplant  that is if the teenager can get a heart  Bell said the family didnt press the doctor on what led to overturning the decision regarding the transplant list  Personally Bell attributes it to the handiwork of God and the media pressure In a video released by a family friend to CNN affiliate WSB before the reversal Anthony plays chess and looks longingly outside his hospital window  The hospital did not comment on what led to doctors change of heart
