But if the president had been brave enough back then to call a tax a tax his healthcare law might not be in such a mess today It turns out that was a big mistake As we now know theres one thing Americans hate even more than taxes and thats being ordered around by their government Early in the debate on the healthcare law polls found that most Americans were willing to pay higher taxes in exchange for universal health insurance But Obama had promised during his presidential campaign that he wouldnt raise taxes on the middle class and a healthcare tax would have broken that vow To answer such questions government lawyers have emphasized that healthcare is a special case  and it is Already the government requires hospitals to care for the sick even if they cant pay something it doesnt do for other goods or services You cant get free broccoli at a grocery store no matter how hungry you are Given that healthcare is different the government has argued an individual mandate is a practical necessity An insurance pool cant work if only the sick sign up because it would be unaffordable So there has to be some kind of incentive for healthy people to participate Insurance companies have proposed the idea of a limited open enrollment period each year coupled with harrowing warnings about how much your healthcare will cost if you suffer an accident without coverage That would make it impossible for sick people to game the system by buying insurance on their way to the emergency room Thats why the administration pulled out all the stops this week in arguing that the current laws mandate however imperfect is constitutional The presidents lawyer even argued that while the mandates penalty isnt a tax the court should consider it a tax  or at least an exercise of the governments taxing power if that would help If the administration wins it will be a case of legal doubletalk being richly rewarded If the administration loses its biggest domestic achievement could be in ruins It would have been simpler to fess up and call the mandate a tax from the start
