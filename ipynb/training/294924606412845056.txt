A key federal panel Friday recommended placing new restrictions on Vicodin and similar prescription painkillers At the conclusion of an emotional twoday hearing the Food and Drug Administration advisory committee voted  to recommend the agency change how drugs that contain the opioid   are classified as controlled substances If the agency goes along with the panels recommendation which is typical but not required the drugs would be more stringently regulated moving to socalled   from   The change would impose a variety of new restrictions on the drugs For example doctors could only write prescriptions for day supplies and could no longer call in new prescriptions without patients coming back to the office In addition nurse practitioners and physician assistants in some states would no longer be able to prescribe them The vote was praised by those seeking new restrictions I believe that this change will mark a turning point in the epidemic said   of the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn NY It will lead to less people becoming addicted which is the most important thing that needs to happen to bring this crisis under control But pain specialists expressed concern about the effect of new restrictions on patients struggling with debilitating pain If the FDA agrees with the advisory committee the decision will have farreaching impact on access and cost to pain care said   presidentelect of the American Academy of Pain Medicine I hope people in pain wont suffer as a result Top officials at the FDA will now consider the vote in making a recommendation to the Department of Health and Human Services and the agency isnt saying when that might happen In  the FDA rejected a similar request We will pay close attention to everything weve heard as we proceed the FDAs   told the panel at the conclusion of the hearing Drugs containing hydrocodone are at the center of an   that pits the needs of pain patients against efforts to fight widespread abuse of these and other opioid painkillers More than  million prescriptions for these products are dispensed every year making them the most widely used prescription drugs Vicodin is probably the bestknown hydrocodone medicine but there are many others sold under brand names such as Lortab and Norco The request for the change came from the Drug Enforcement Agency which along with others argues these drugs are just as addicting and abused as frequently as other powerful opioids such as Oxycontin and Percocet which are Schedule II drugs While powerful painkillers opioids are highly addictive and are abused by millions The number of Americans overdosing from these drugs has been increasing rapidly in recent years and more than  now die every year according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention But about  million Americans suffer from chronic pain and many of them and their doctors fear the change would make it difficult if not impossible for these patients to get drugs they need The concern is that many people such as the elderly and those living in rural areas wont be able to make the extra trips to the doctor to get new prescriptions or afford additional visits Doctors worried about getting into trouble with the DEA may also stop prescribing the drugs and insurance companies may stop paying for them In addition to testimony from DEA and FDA officials and from pain and addiction specialists the committee heard from several parents whose children died from overdoses after becoming addicted to hydrocodone products Many of them broke down in tears or expressed anger at the widespread availability of the drugs They are highly addicting My son is proof said Cheryl Placek of Niagra Falls NY who sobbed as she described how her yearold son Daniel committed suicide after becoming addicted to hydrocodone he received for back pain All he did is follow his doctors instructions she said In the end the drug took his life We look for medicine to get us better not kill The addiction to hydrocodone stole my sons life and destroyed his family The committee also heard from several patients suffering from chronic debilitating pain They pleaded with the committee not to impose new restrictions Shani Weber of Mount Airy Md said she depends on the drugs for managing pain from   which among other things causes her joints to suddenly dislocate triggering intense pain She described one incident that occurred last week I awoke with a pain level so high I was struggling to breathe Weber said It was all I could do to not fall into a fetal position screaming I was extremely thankful for access to hydrocodone In addition to the DEA request some doctors and addiction specialists want the FDA to change the labels on all opioids including drugs such as Oxycontin and Percocet They want the labels to say they should only be prescribed for severe pain at much lower doses and for no more than  days The goal is to get drug companies to stop marketing these drugs as aggressively and get doctors to be much more cautious about prescribing them The FDAs has scheduled another hearing on that request
