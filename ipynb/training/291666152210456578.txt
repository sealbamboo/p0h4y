What if there were a vaccine that could halt the progression of    Researchers at Universit Laval CHU de Qubec say they may be close to developing a prophylactic treatment that could potentially stimulate the brains natural defense against Alzheimers disease Their study partially funded by the pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline was published in the early online edition of the   It is one of several the group of researchers have conducted to explore this innovative approach to combating   The vaccine works by stimulating the activity of microglial cells the bodys natural nervous system defenders which are able to attack and prevent the proliferation of amyloid beta the toxic plaque molecules that form in the brain and largely are responsible for the progression of Alzheimers The researchers used mice with Alzheimers disease to test the potential vaccine Over a period of  weeks the rodents were given weekly injectionsThroughout the treatments the scientists assessed their   by observing whether the rodents were able to navigate through a water maze one of the most widely used tests in the field of neuroscience The mice that received the vaccine and not the placebo improved over time and were able to reach the other end of the maze Its very similar to what you see in patients says Serge Rivest MD PhD professor at Universit Lavals Faculty of Medicine a researcher at the CHU de Qubec research center and the lead author of the study In patients you do have some problems when you put them in an environment theyre not familiar with If further studies bears out the mice study results the researchers believe the vaccine could potentially be effective to both stop the progression of Alzheimers disease and prevent it Rivest speculates that such a vaccine may be most useful for individuals who are at risk for developing Alzheimers He says the type of biomarkers his vaccine targets can also be   and accurately predict Alzheimers risk One in eight Americans over the age of  has Alzheimers disease which is the sixthleading cause of death in the United States according to the Alzheimers Association Symptoms include memory loss inability to recognize people or objects and difficulty with motor skills and speech For years scientists have worked to develop ways to slow the progression of the Alzheimers Cholinesterase inhibitors the current   on the market stop the breakdown of acetylcholine a neurotransmitter that is believed to be important for cognition and memory Drugs in this class include Aricept Exelon and Razadyne Rivest says other vaccines in research stage have been ineffective and one was found to cause inflammation of the brain The vaccine he and his team are developing activates immune cells rather than targeting the proteins that cause dementia which is how some Alzheimers medications or vaccines work he says
