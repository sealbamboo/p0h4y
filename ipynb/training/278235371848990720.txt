Just as the name implies   is a difficult pathogen to beat It causes a nasty infection in your gut and its often resistant to many antibiotics But   got even more troublesome about  years ago when a particularly virulent form of the bug   in hospitals across the US and was no longer vulnerable to one of the most common classes of antibiotics These days antibioticresistant   is a superbug that   nearly  Americans a year British geneticists just sequenced a bunch of these   strains from around the world And the genomic data chart how the drugresistant bacteria arose in North America and then hopped to Europe Australia and Asia The findings were just   in the journal    infections usually occur in hospitals when patients have been treated with large doses of antibiotics So   and his team at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute sequenced the genomes of    strains isolated from hospital patients between  and  From the DNA sequences they calculated that the highly virulent form of   first appeared in Pittsburgh around  From there it spread to Oregon New Jersey Arizona and Maryland where it caused major hospital outbreaks in each state Since  the drugresistant bacteria have also made appearances in South Korea and Switzerland The genomic data also showed that another superbug of   cropped up independently in the US around the same time The scientists cant pinpoint exactly where it originated but they know it spread to Montreal in  and the Netherlands in  This strain found its way to the UK on four separate occasions likely triggering a large hospital outbreak that reached both London and Cambridge Lawley and his team also figured out how the superbugs picked up resistance to a common class of antibiotics called   that includes such drugs as Levaquin and Cipro Both strains independently acquired a single mutation in an enzyme that binds fluroquinolones and the strains also captured genes that pump antibiotics out of their cells American doctors heavily prescribed fluoroquinolones in the late s and early s And Lawley thinks this study is a cautionary tale about the risk of overusing antibiotics The data indicated that antibiotic resistance can happen more frequently than we appreciated Lawley tells Shots And it will probably happen again
