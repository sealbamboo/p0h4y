Its because I never admitted ever that I was getting old I retired at  but I didnt really retire When I reached  I backpacked across Europe I would take off going to Belgium to look at places that Id visited during the second world war I went back home I got restless again So I took a plane to San Francisco and travelled all the way through southern California My youngest sons wife said Youre crazy I said Id rather be crazy than sitting waiting for death I really enjoyed my life The saddest part was when my wife died in   thats when my wanderlust started My house didnt have any thoughts for me I dont know how you can sum it up because   I was born five years after the end of the first world war That alone was a disaster that crippled soldiers Thats the trouble with wars too after a war the government doesnt give a damn about the soldiers There were guys with no arms or legs who were living under the same desperate circumstances as everyone else My elder sister died in the poorhouse at the age of six from tuberculosis For a young kid I think the worst part about it was  I just couldnt keep up with my studies For one thing we couldnt stay in the same place  I must have gone to at least six or seven schools by the time wed finished hopping around because we couldnt pay the rent here or something else And then this job I had which took from after school until just about dark and on Saturdays So I was just buggered by the time it came to weekends Oh yes absolutely If you didnt have a job you didnt have money if you didnt have money you didnt have food  thats the whole point Thats why I did this barrowboy job as a child I got four shillings a week and managed to put a little bit more food into the house I had a maths teacher  Froggie Dawson  he was a rather fattish man with a corpulent body I remember one time I hadnt gone to school for a couple of days it was in the winter and the snow was on the ground and so when I came back at the end of the class he made me stay behind and demanded to know How come you were off school yesterday and the day before And I remember lifting up my shoe  and I had cardboard there for a base and it was all soggy So he said  go home now get there as quick as you can and see me after school tomorrow So after school the next day when all the others had gone he reaches into his drawer for a pair of shoes And they were a bit big but I knew I could stick some newspaper in the front and I thanked him profusely sobs We didnt have any hope at all that I could remember until after  We just didnt believe they were going to do anything about it because we existed under such a cruel system for so long My mother and this man shed taken up with got to drinking extensively and my sister and I were left pretty much in charge of the mans youngest son He was only a baby So we had to take care of him when they were down the pub We stayed awake when they came back  and then the fight would begin Thumping and banging dishes flying We would get up in the morning cups saucers plates left over the floor like a ship had collapsed Another time we had to throw ourselves on the mans back because he was beating our mother It was a sad time I got pissed aged seven in Sheffield My Uncle Harold said to me one day How would you like to come to Sheffield Itd be a day out for you something different And I said Sure why not So he took me into Sheffield  he had to go around the betting places to place bets and afterwards he said Well just go into this bar and well have a drink then well go home So he went in ordered a drink and then the barman looked at me and said Whats the young chap going to have Uncle Harry said Give him a gin and orange By the time I finished it he had to carry me to the bus stop My grandmother gave him hell when we got back because I was still dozy Yes and became a wireless operator It was a sixmonth course I learned about morse code learned to send and receive about  words a minute and I also learned about receivers and transmitters It changed my life For the first time I knew Id have three meals a day and get a paypacket at the end of the week  The smell of death was just unbelievable and there were  people still under the ruins It was like a giant mountain Can you imagine I saw lots of bombed buildings in Belgium and Holland but not to the extent that it was in Germany It was senseless I entered Germany with a feeling of enmity disgust at what theyd done during the war but I soon realised they were no different to any other nation They still had their worries about their children They were starving Once we got drunk in Hamburg and commandeered horses through the city My wife saw me riding drunk on a horse and thought What a bunch of idiots When I first saw her I thought Shes really beautiful I offered to carry her bag the usual and she said Youre not Canadian are you When I said no she said Thats all right Canadians dont have a very good reputation At that time you couldnt go out in public with a German woman and it was against the law to cohabitate so I had to walk  paces behind The conditions for the German people and Dutch people was so far advanced from what we had in England They all had inside toilets they had baths with hot running water electric stoves I couldnt get over it because we were still washing with a tin bath in the kitchen So when my wife came back to England she was pretty appalled When I told her Youll have to use a potty here dear she said Theres no way Im going to use a potty doesnt matter what time of day or night So in the middle of the night shed say Ive got to go and we got up found some warm clothes and went to the front door The toilet was about  houses past I had to stand there while she used the toilet and go back to bed again I said I hope you dont have to go again tonight  Then   when the rich could buy care and the rest of them had nothing They either lived or died according to their genes or their strength or will or something Its not fair I think everyone has the right to his life and to live it to the best of his ability To even think we could live without an NHS is just unbelievable to me and I think its about time governments really worked to fund it properly even at the expense of getting some of these rich people paying more taxes Even now I shudder to think what people are going through to feed their children Its so bloody unnecessary as far as I can see Its appalling    how could the government allow something like that to even come into existence You cant take money from the average worker and not from the big businesses The government hand everything out now to private companies  in the old days the government used to be the ones who looked after everything How the hell can you privatise water Its the basis of life  and actually I told him  I said you have a chance now to be a prime minister who will go down in history But you have to assert yourself and you have to make it clear who you are and what youre planning to do But it didnt seem to work He said Yes yes and patted my arm And its true  anyone who came up now with a good plan to rule Britain could rule it for the next  years because its at the stage where it can be saved and it could be saved First of all I would suggest that voting should be made compulsory and until it is what they have to do is get up off their arses and go to cast their vote If they dont like any of the people who are on the ballot spoil the ballot Spoiled ballots are counted too they might not realise it  and if the government comes to power and finds only  of the people are voting for them and the rest are saying Shit on you maybe therell be some changes  Harrys Last Stand by Harry Leslie
