Patients who took a certain type of blood pressure medication got measurable relief from worsening Alzheimers symptoms too researchers reported on Thursday Its the latest in a series of studies on the effects of various blood pressure drugs on the fatal and incurable brain disease which is affecting more and more Americans as people live longer In this case it was a type of drug called an ACE inhibitor Patients at a hospital in Ireland who were taking the drugs anyway to treat their high blood pressure did not worsen at the same rate as patients not taking the drugs said William Molloy of the Centre for Gerontology and Rehabilitation at University College Cork in Ireland They were not progressing at the same pace as other people Molloy told NBC News Molloy who treats Alzheimers patients said he decided to look after he saw other studies suggesting ACE inhibitors might help He went back through the medical records of  patients with Alzheimers or vascular dementia Of them  had test scores the team could use to assess the progress of their disease over six months Those taking the ACE inhibitors lost their memory and other thinking abilities at a rate that was about  to  percent slower than the others Molloys team reported in a study published Thursday in BMJ Open That may not sound like very much he said But over years the effect would be compounded And these drugs are available generically and very cheap The results would have to be tested in a larger study  preferably a socalled doubleblind prospective study that looked at patients over time with the drug randomly assigned Thats important because doctors may have prescribed the drugs to patients for reasons that could also affect the course of their disease says Dr Gary Small of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles and director of the UCLA Longevity Center The doctors decide who goes on the drug and who doesnt It might be some other factor that is driving the improvement says Small who was not involved in the study Alzheimers is a huge and growing problem Researchers project that the number of Americans living with Alzheimers will  which means that  million will have it by   Census data project that as the baby boom generation ages the number of Americans aged  to  will approximately double by  Currently an estimated  million Americans have Alzheimers the most common cause of dementia Symptoms start with mild memory and thinking problems but as the brain becomes more and more damaged people lose the ability to find their way around to care for themselves and eventually to eat and drink We have nothing that works in dementia at all We have nothing that prevents it Molloy said Researchers are desperate to find something that works Other studies have suggested that blood pressure medication may help  but others show it may actually cause memory loss in some patients The science is so confusing says Small who has  s on Alzheimers  The drugs we have for Alzheimers dementia are basically symptomatic drugs They work temporarily So far as we know there is no specific drug to prevent disease We know probably that lifestyle choices have an effect People who eat more fruits and vegetables who exercise and who stimulate their brains with reading puzzles and social interaction all can lower their risk of Alzheimers But people who do everything right still often get the disease anyway Small says this study and the others show that at the very least its important to take prescribed drugs to control blood pressure One of the weaknesses of this study is that it is an observational study Small noted But he and Molloy both pointed out that this also means it reflects the real world  which is messier than an carefully controlled study in which only certain patients are enrolled Dr Wesson Ashford director of the  at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System agreed  Some of the benefit could have been in reducing small stroke risk in the nonAlzheimer patients Ashford said via email However it is intriguing that medications may be able to alter the course of dementia and this is the exciting possibility he added This kind of study is very important not just to provide hope but to lead new research directions that will end up stopping Alzheimers disease and other dementing illnesses Its not clear how blood pressure medications might help prevent Alzheimers from damaging the brain Molloy believes they may work by suppressing inflammation  a process thats also involved in the damage caused by heart disease  A   in the journal Neurology showed that at least in JapaneseAmerican men taking betablockers lowered the risk of Alzheimers and general cognitive decline That study showed no effect from ACE inhibitors or other blood pressure drugs But Molloy said ACE inhibitors  which include drugs such as Lotensin captopril Vasotec and lisonopril  cross the socalled blood brain barrier and can affect brain tissue But studies on various drugs to treat other diseases being tested against Alzheimers have disappointed before Just last May researchers said they had  experimental findings that a cancer drug could treat Alzheimers Bceause the drug Targretin was already approved as a cancer treatment doctors know how safe it is and could prescribe it off label to treat any condition including Alzheimers The same could be true of blood pressure drugs but Small said its too soon to start prescribing any blood pressure drugs strictly to help prevent or treat Alzheimers
