Restraint and unflappability are just about as British as Big Ben and English Breakfast But could that national stiff upper lip be keeping the British from getting proper cancer care A survey looking at why people in different countries avoid doctors finds that stoicism may be one reason why Britains cancer survival rates lag behind its neighbors In the study   in the   researchers interviewed  people over age  in the UK Canada Australia and the Scandinavian countries By far the Brits were the most likely to cite embarrassment and not wanting to waste the doctors time as reasons for not calling the doctor when cancer symptoms cropped up There was such a big difference between the UK and other countries that its very likely to be important says   a psychiatrist at Kings College London who led the study Its speculative but it may be because the stiff upper lip is distinctly ingrained in the culture Despite having a health care system thats just as good the British are less likely to survive lung breast or ovarian cancers than their Scandinavian neighbors  especially during the first year after a diagnosis Previous studies had hinted at this British reluctance to see a doctor when they suspect a problem And Lindsey thought that the tendency to keep calm and carry on was at play So she and her team decided to probe the underlying attitudes in different cultures About onethird of the British interviewed admitted that concerns about wasting the doctors time could cause them to delay visiting the doctor In contrast only about  percent of the Scandinavians Australians and Canadians voiced such worries This is an older population who really support the   National Health Service and they dont want to waste its time Forbes says They think The NHS should be helping young children or people other than me  The British also were most likely to cite both potential embarrassment and fear about what the doctor might discover as reasons for delaying medical attention for serious symptoms Lindsey says a stiff upper lip is not the whole story behind why Britains cancer survival rates are relatively low compared to those in other wealthy nations But we dont want to wait before we get the whole story before we start tackle this big problem she tells Shots The government has already launched a campaign with posters and TV ads that encourage people to brush aside their stoicism and see a doctor Interestingly the   ran a special   last October looking at the history of the British stiff upper lip With footballers and tennis stars perennially crying on TV the comedian Ian Hislop concluded that the phenomenon may be disappearing I think that the younger generation may not have such a stiff lip Forbes agrees But for the population most likely to get cancer it doesnt seem to be going away
