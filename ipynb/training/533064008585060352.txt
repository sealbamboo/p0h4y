This is the time of year that NHS bosses  and their political masters for that matter  start to look at the weather forecasts A bad winter can make a huge difference to the health service A cold snap increases the number of falls and amount of respiratory illness while the vomiting bug norovirus can take hold on hospital wards And this year the stakes could not be higher With little more than six months to a general election all eyes are on how the health service copes particularly in England The focus is traditionally on AE units but these have already started feeling the pinch long before the cold weather has kicked in In recent weeks the number of patients seen within four hours in England has dropped to below   missing the target and worse than much of last winter despite it only being autumn  There is clearly concern as ministers have just announced the winter pressures pot has been increased from m to m Elsewhere in the UK performance is even worse As always the most acute problems are in the biggest units But that is just the start of it Wherever you look the NHS is under strain Latest data from the   shows people are finding it increasingly difficult to get through to GP surgeries on the phone and when they do they have to wait longer for an appointment In hospitals the number of patients waiting more than  weeks for routine treatment  the target time  has been hovering at its highest level since  Part of that is down to the governments   it announced during the summer to deal with the people who had faced the longest waits Nonetheless the demands being placed on the system are  like AE  increasing According to latest figures  more patients are on the waiting list compared with last year While emergency care and routine operations are quite different areas of hospital care they are not entirely unrelated A busy winter period in AE can suck staff and resources from other parts of the hospital In cancer care it is a similar story The day target for treatment starting has been missed for the past two quarters The reasons are complex but again greater demand is playing a role  the numbers being referred into the hospital system are on the rise Not all of these people have cancer but GPs are under pressure to detect the disease at an early stage so they tend to refer as soon as they are concerned Each case needs investigating and tests carried out This is all happening at a time when staff are involved in an industrial dispute with ministers Last month nurses midwives and a range of support staff from porters to admin workers took part in the   Another strike is planned for later this month With the political parties gearing up for what promises to be a tightlyfought election could the fortunes of the NHS this winter play a key role Richard Murray director of policy at the Kings Fund thinks so  The problem is we are starting from a low base Its not even winter yet and the pressure is really high At the same time hospitals are being asked to think about routine operations and cancer There is just no wriggle room  The big question is whether we will see a winter crisis like we used to patients waiting in corridors and on trolleys unable to get a bed We are not there yet but if pictures like that start emerging the debate goes to a whole other level
