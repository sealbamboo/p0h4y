NPRs global health correspondent Jason Beaubien tries to keep his cool when traveling abroad But he may have set a new record for chillness En route to Liberia to cover the Ebola outbreak he flew out of Sierra Leones Freetown airport Like all passengers he had his body temperature measured by an ear gun thermometer The reading  degrees centigrade roughly  degrees Fahrenheit A degree temperature can mark the onset of hypothermia at  degrees amnesia can kick in But Jason remembers and has photo proof of that clearly erroneous temperature reading The authorities were not troubled and let him board his flight If that was a comedy of errors in Monrovia Beaubien found a tragedy of errors when it comes to burying the dead The government is having a really hard time finding places to bury the bodies because nobody wants them in their community The government bought this land for burials in a quite remote spot There isnt even a village that close to it just some little shacks But its near the settlement of Johnsonville The dead body management teams  thats what they call them  went out there last week to bury these bodies Basically the site is a swamp They had a big backhoe to start digging the graves But people from the nearest community came  they didnt want the bodies buried there There was a clash Then the backhoe got stuck in the mud They didnt finish burying the bodies that night but they threw the bodies into the graves theyd dug Overnight water from the swamp came up and lifted the body bags up and so the body bags were floating in these graves And the community was furious I went out to the site  it took two hours driving from the capital Monrovia over some of the worst roads I have ever been over just upanddown rutted roads The backhoe is still stuck the treads just buried in the mud And there are all of these grave markers with peoples names written on them maybe with a Sharpie  their name the day they died their age  The markers are made out of plywood and nailed onto wooden sticks Theyre just scattered all over the place I counted  of them Right after death is when theyre incredibly contagious People are terrified of dead bodies But the authorities spray the entire body with a  percent chlorine solution which is very strong zip it up in a body bag spray the body bag with that solution then they double bag it zip the whole thing up again and spray it down again So its pretty safe People are just freaked out People were particularly freaked out because the burial turned into this fiasco where the body bags were thrown into open graves that then filled with water so the body bags floated to the surface That was definitely a fiasco They did finish filling in the graves the next day but it was not good in terms of trying to get this community to allow burials out there and now this burial site has been completely abandoned Neighbors around this site stated to me that theyre afraid that those bodies are bringing Ebola to their land Thats their perspective Whether its true or not thats how they feel about it The burning of bodies is so new that Ive heard no complaints about it I havent heard anybody being concerned People have a sense of humor about it My driver today was recounting this story he heard  a guy in a shop took tomatoes and smeared them so the juice was coming out of his ears and nose and he ran up to the cash register and was like Im bleeding Then the cashier ran away and the man stole all the money out of the till My driver thought that was really funny
