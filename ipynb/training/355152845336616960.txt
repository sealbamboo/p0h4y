Can belief in God predict how someone responds to mental health treatment A recent study suggests it might Researchers at McLean Hospital in Belmont Mass enrolled  men and women in a cognitive behavioral therapy program that involved on average  daylong sessions of group therapy individual counseling and in some cases medications About  percent of the participants were being treated for depression while others had bipolar disorder anxiety or other diagnoses All were asked to rate their spirituality by answering a single question To what extent do you believe in God  The results   revealed that about  percent of participants reported some belief in God Strength of belief was unrelated to the severity of initial symptoms Over all those who rated their spiritual belief as most important to them appeared to be less depressed after treatment than those with little or no belief They also appeared less likely to engage in selfharming behaviors  Patients who had higher levels of belief in God demonstrated more effects of treatment said the studys lead author   a psychologist at McLean Hospital and director of the Center for Anxiety in New York They seemed to get more bang for their buck so to speak One possible reason for this he said is that patients who had more faith in God also had more faith in treatment They were more likely to believe that the treatment would help them and they were more likely to see it as credible and real   Of the  people who expressed the strongest belief in God  also had very high expectations for the treatment while nine had very low expectations In contrast of the  patients who said they had no belief in God or a higher power only two had high expectations for the treatment  Its one of the first studies Ive read that actually looks at perhaps a mechanism for why we see some correlation between the strength of religious commitment or the strength of spiritual commitment and better outcomes said Dr Marilyn Baetz a psychiatrist at the University of Saskatchewan who studies the effects of religion and spirituality on mental health An   by Dr Baetz and her colleagues found that people with panic disorder who rated religion as very important to them responded better to cognitive behavioral therapy showing less stress and anxiety than those who rated religion as less important  Assessing how religious practices affect health is difficult in part because researchers cant randomly assign people to embrace religion or not the way they might assign participants in a drug test to take a new medication or a placebo Most studies of this relationship are observational and people who are more or less religious may differ in other important ways making it difficult to know whether religious faith is actually causing the effect or if it is a result of some other factor  But teasing out the effects of faith on treatment outcomes may be an important goal Most Americans believe in God   percent   though the percentage among mental health professionals may be considerably lower   found that  percent of psychiatrists said they believed in God compared with  percent of other physicians  Previous research has associated church attendance with   and in some studies a   But this study looked not at how often the participants went to church or at their religious affiliation but at their belief in a higher power  I think its a scientifically sound way of measuring things that have to do with peoples experience of spirituality said Torrey Creed an  assistant professor of psychology in psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania I think about this as a study of cognitive styles that theres a pattern of thinking that helps people get better in treatment And two examples of this pattern of thinking are I believe in treatment and I believe in God  Randi McCabe director of the Anxiety Treatment and Research Center at St Josephs Healthcare in Ontario said Peoples belief that something is going to work will make it work for a significant proportion of people similar to the placebo effect Your belief that youre going to get better your attitude does influence how you feel Dr McCabe continued And really in cognitive behavior therapy that is really what were trying to change peoples beliefs how theyre seeing their world their perspective  Dr Rosmarin offered further explanation for why religious faith might aid psychiatric treatment Theres a vulnerability associated with physicality he said I think people psychiatric patients in particular might recognize that vulnerability and recognize that things cant be counted on  Sometimes medications dont work and sometimes psychotherapy doesnt work he continued But if someone believes in something that is metaphysical if someone believes in something spiritual which would ostensibly be eternal permanent unwavering omnipotent then that could be an important resource to them particularly in times of emotional distress
