The current flu epidemic has been the worst on record since  when the   was at its peak But while the latest   the  swine flu pandemic continues to have an impact on peoples health According to an upcoming British study the widelyused swine flu vaccine Pandemrix might be responsible for approximately  Swedish and other European children developing the incurable sleep disorder   with many more potentially at risk Narcolepsy affects  in  people worldwide but many cases go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed The disorder is characterized by   Approximately  Americans live with narcolepsy Nearly  million people received Pandemrix made by GlaxoSmithKlineÂ  and since then cases of narcolepsy have spiked in the following countries Sweden Finland Norway Ireland and France The vaccine was used primarily in Europe it was not approved for use in the United States The link between narcolepsy and Pandemrix has been under investigation since  when the possible association was noticeable enough that GlaxoSmithKline began investigating the vaccines side effects The company said the information available at the time was insufficient to assess the likelihood of a causal relationship between Pandemrix and narcolepsy A study published in March  in the   stated that a sudden increase in the incidence of abrupt childhood narcolepsy was observed in Finland in  Scientists reached this conclusion after comparing rates of childhood narcolepsy from  to  before the swine flu and use of Pandemrix and the rates in  after the use of Pandemrix The rate for the first period was  children per  being diagnosed with narcolepsy During the second period the rate had increased to  children per  The study named Pandemrix as a contributing factor to heightened risk factors for children developing the sleep disorder In September  the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control announced that Pandemrix was linked to a higher risk of narcolepsy in children and teens in Sweden and Finland The agency also concluded that the drug should no longer be used in people under the age of  The soontobepublished new study uncovered a similar pattern of children developing narcolepsy in other countries that had already been evident in countries like Sweden and Finland Children faced a higher risk for developing the sleep disorder after they received GlaxoSmithKlines swine flu vaccine The current investigation and study aim to answer questions about the link between the sleeping disorder and the vaccine what the triggers were for narcolepsy and how genetic susceptibility played a role
