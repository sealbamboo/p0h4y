CVS Caremark pharmacies will phase out tobacco in US retail stores by Oct  a move swiftly embraced by President Barack Obama and the first lady on Wednesday as a step that would save lives and promote good health The chain will lose about  billion in revenues annually from sales of tobacco in its  stores but CVS Pharmacy president Helena Foulkes said it just makes sense for a firm now positioning itself as a health care company not to sell cigarettes sidebyside with medicine  a former smoker who tried for years to stop immediately praised CVS saying in a statement that their powerful example will help advance my Administrations efforts to reduce tobaccorelated deaths cancer and heart disease as well as bring down health care costs  ultimately saving lives and protecting untold numbers of families from pain and heartbreak for years to come The first lady  who encouraged her husband to kick the habit  quickly chimed in The move is also an effort to help curb tobaccorelated illness and the  deaths caused by smoking each year in the US Despite huge reductions over the   about  percent of Americans   million people  still smoke health officials say Smoking costs the nation about  billion annually in direct medical costs and lost productivity according to federal figures Health experts and groups like the American Pharmacists Association and the American Medical Association have urged stores that house pharmacies to stop selling tobacco for years Many small independent pharmacies and small private chains already ban tobacco said John Norton spokesman for the National Community Pharmacists AssociationTarget stores stopped selling tobacco products in  But CVS is the first large retail pharmacy chain to do so This action may not lead many people to stop smoking smokers will probably simply go elsewhere to buy cigarettes CVS medical officer Dr Troyen Brennan wrote in an   in the Journal of the American Medical Association But if other retailers follow this lead tobacco products will become much more difficult to obtain Pharmacy retailer Walgreens released a statment on Wednesday in which it said it has been evaluating the place tobacco products hold on its shelves Representatives for RiteAid Corp and RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co wouldnt comment on the pending announcement late Tuesday calling it speculation We will continue to evaluate the choice of products our customers want while also helping to educate them and providing smoking cessation products and alternatives that help to reduce the demand for tobacco products Walgreens said in the statement US Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius called the move an unprecedented step in the retail industry and urged others to follow CVS lead The Department of Health and Human Services applauds CVS Caremark Corp for their leadership in helping to make the next generation tobaccofree she said in a statement Dr Michael Fiore of the University of Wisconsins Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention also embraced the decision I think this is fantastic news and I commend CVS for this Fiore said Theres a disconnect if the mission of a store is to promote health to sell a product thats going to kill half of the people who use it If other large retailers phase out tobacco it will contribute to other efforts to denormalize tobacco use such as New Yorks ban on smoking in outdoor public spaces he said Smoking is often just another marker for social and economic disparities with smoking rates highest among people with the lowest levels of income and education Creating zones free of cigarettes in their face in drug stores will make it easier for people trying to quit particularly in the early weeks and months Fiore added CVS pharmacy was among the top five US best retail brands in  according to an annual survey by Interbrand Design Forum The Woonsocket RI company posted record revenues in    billion fueled by pharmacy services and retail pharmacy sales Earlier this week the Food and Drug Administration announced a   dubbed Real Cost that will use humorous ads and a few scare tactics to discourage teens from ever starting to smoke According to the FDA nearly  percent of adult smokers start using cigarettes by age  Tobacco companies have increasingly been wooing them with candyflavored minicigars and ecigarettes And   adds a new litany of diseases caused by smoking including Type  diabetes rheumatoid arthritis erectile dysfunction and the macular degeneration that can blind older adults as well as two new kinds of cancer  liver and colorectal and cleft palate birth defects Taken together with other efforts the CVS decision could be a first step in budging smoking rates that have hovered near  percent for a decade said Harold Wimmer president of the American Lung Association CVS says it plans a broad smoking cessation effort this spring to reach the  in  people who say they want to quit We really believe that access to tobacco products is one of the factors in reducing smoking Wimmer said noting that is to get it down to  percent in the next  years We feel the steps that CVS and others are taking will help us make that kind of a difference
