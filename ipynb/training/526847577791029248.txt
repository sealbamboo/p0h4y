The usually staid   is blasting the decision of some states to quarantine returning Ebola healthcare workers In an   the NEJM describes the quarantines as unfair unwise and more destructive than beneficial In their words We think the governors have it wrong The editors say the policy could undermine efforts to contain the international outbreak by discouraging American medical professionals from volunteering in West Africa The way we are going to control this epidemic is with source control and thats going to happen in West Africa we hope In order to do that we need people on the ground in West Africa says Dr Jeffrey Drazen editorinchief of the journal Speaking to Goats and Soda he says it doesnt make any sense to imprison healthcare workers for three weeks after theyve been treating Ebola patients The editorial explains his rationale arguing that healthcare workers who monitor their own temperatures daily would be able to detect the onset of Ebola before they become contagious and thus before they pose any public health threat to their home communities The sensitive blood polymerasechainreaction PCR test for Ebola is often negative on the day when fever or other symptoms begin and only becomes reliably positive  to  days after symptom onset This point is supported by the fact that of the nurses caring for Thomas Eric Duncan the man who died from Ebola virus disease in Texas in October only those who cared for him at the end of his life when the number of virions he was shedding was likely to be very high became infected Notably Duncans family members who were living in the same household for days as he was at the start of his illness did not become infected Federal guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention call for healthcare workers to be quarantined only if they have a known direct exposure to the virus as a result of a needle stick or a breach in their protective suits Several states however are going further and imposing quarantines on any healthcare worker who treated Ebola patients in Guinea Liberia or Sierra Leone New Jersey health officials held Kaci Hickox a nurse with Doctors Without Borders all weekend in an isolation tent adjacent to the Newark University Hospital Shed just returned from Sierra Leone where shed been treating people with Ebola Despite testing negative for Ebola and having no known direct exposure as described by the CDC she was detained by New Jersey officials Shes now being sent back to her home state of Maine Officials there say shell be under a mandatory home quarantine for  days after her last possible exposure to the virus Twentyone days is the outer limit of the incubation period of Ebola Meanwhile New Jersey governor Chris Christie stands by his states quarantine policy and the treatment of Hickox
