The University of New Hampshire Wildcats are heading into a doordie quarterfinal football game this week against the University of Tennessee Chattanooga And whether they win or not theres one thing you can say about the Wildcats They are likely the only football team in America trying to reduce concussions by practicing without helmets Football has a concussion problem from the National Football League down to PeeWee teams And there are lots of efforts out there to fix it But   a University of New Hampshire professor of kinesiology studies movement and says there has been very little discussion about getting to the root of the problem technique Instead of clashing helmetfirst as football players often do the better approach is to keep the head up and tackle chest to chest never leading with your helmet  or your face neck or shoulders Swartz says his idea to experiment with having players drill without helmets came from his own time playing rugby You keep your head out of the way in a tackle in rugby he says Because its not protected it will hurt Swartzs ongoing study divides the team into two player groups The control group always practices with a helmet on while the treatment group takes helmets off during a tackling drill Before practice every player has a sensor placed behind the ear to gauge and relay the force and number of impacts to the head Swartz and his team watch to see if and how that changes over the course of the season for each player During fullspeed tackling the idea is to look up when you tackle to see what youre hitting says Wildcats running back Donald Goodrich who is part of the group that does the drill without helmets It becomes second nature if you do it enough in practice Goodrich says After that short intense drill the helmets go back on The hope is that players who think more about their skulls during a game will suffer less head trauma over time Wildcats head coach   says this study or something else   to work Im responsible and our coaches are responsible for these kids safety McDonnell says If we dont take care of this it could be the end of football The NFL is paying attention The pro football league GE and the sports clothing firm Under Armour have together funded Swartzs work with a  grant Nineteen of the  researchers given similar grants to tackle the concussion problem are making things like stronger helmets softer turf and better concussion diagnostics Only Swartz is trying to change basic human behavior He thinks his approach could work If you look on the sidelines lets say after theres a touchdown in football oftentimes the players will headbutt themselves to celebrate Swartz points out They probably wouldnt do that if they didnt have a helmet on The Wildcats research will continue into next year when Swartz says he also plans to expand the study into three high schools
