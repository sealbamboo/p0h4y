Scientists say they have found a way to get a glimpse of peoples dreams Our results show that we can predict what a persons seeing during dreams says   a researcher at the ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto Japan Philosophers poets and psychologists have long shared a fascination with dreams But Jack Gallant a neuroscientist at the University of California Berkeley says solving the mystery of our dreams is one tough problem In psychology and neuroscience theres been  years of argument about whether dreams are important or unimportant says  t a neuroscientist at the University of California Berkeley We dont really know because we havent had very good access to peoples dreams Scientists dont have very good access because they have to rely on how people talk about their dreams often as those images are already slipping away Because of the nature of dreams we find it very difficult to remember our dreams and to sort of describe them well Gallant says So the idea is you could perhaps build a dream decoder that would allow you to inspect your dreams after you had them and sort of interrogate them and figure out what you were dreaming about Now Kamitani and his colleagues have come up with a decoding program that analyzes brain activity while people sleep To do it Kamitanis team repeatedly scanned the brains of three volunteers just as they were starting to drift into dreams We focused on dream experience which can be detected just a few minutes after the sleep onset Kamitani says The researchers awakened the study subjects more than  times to ask them to describe their dreams in detail so they could gather data on which patterns of brain activity meant what Many of them were just about daily life in the office Kamitani says Others were bizarre or humorous he says One man dreamed he was having dinner with a famous Japanese movie star The scientists then did more brain scans while the volunteers were awake so they could tweak their program to characterize various patterns of brain activity We used that to train the decoder Kamitani says In a   being published in this weeks issue of the journal   the researchers then showed they could often predict at least parts of what the subjects were dreaming The results suggest that it may be possible to read out dream contents even when you dont remember just by looking at brain activity Kamitani says Other scientists called the research a technological tour de force and potentially a milestone toward starting to understand our dreams In this field of dream decoding no one has managed to successfully do this before Gallant says So this is not the final step down this road its the first step The ultimate goal would be a tool that could provide vivid detailed representations of our dreams If you could build the perfect dream decoder it would create a movie on your television screen and it would just replay your dreams Gallant says It would replay all the actions that happened the actors the people involved and it would replay the sound Were nowhere near that yet But the research reported in   represents at least a small step toward revealing what we dream and perhaps someday why
