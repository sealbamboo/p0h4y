Women with early stage   often choose a radical mastectomy over lessinvasive lumpectomy surgery for fear that the cancer will return But new research finds more aggressive surgery  removing the entire breast as opposed to only the lump or cancerous growth  wont necessarily lead to a better health outcome A new study from Duke Cancer Institute analyzed health outcomes of breast cancer patients ages  to  whod received a   versus breastconserving therapy  or lumpectomy  in tandem with radiation for their treatment Shelly Hwang MD of Duke Healths division of surgical oncology led the study which was just published in the journal   Dr Hwang and her team analyzed  years of patient data from the California Cancer Registry Among women who had breast cancer  percent received lumpectomy with radiation and  percent had a mastectomy without radiation The data showed that after five years minimally invasive breast cancer surgery with radiation actually led to better outcomes for breast cancer and the women were also less likely to have died from other causes including heart or respiratory disease In particular women over the age of  with hormonesensitive tumors saw the greatest benefit in opting for lumpectomy with radiation This group was  percent less likely to die from breast cancer and  percent less likely to die from any other major health conditions after five years than women who had undergone a mastectomy Some women feel like doing more   is going to get them a better outcome says Hwang Based on the results of her research she adds I think better outcomes may come from doing less surgery Though   have been conducted to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of both surgeries Hwang says much of the research is up to three decades old  when breast cancer surgery was done differently  and largely outdated Len Lichtenfeld MD deputy chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society has worked in the oncology field since the s He says surgical treatments for breast cancer have evolved to become as least disruptive as possible to a patients health and selfimage Decades ago he says women who were believed to have breast cancer faced a traumatic and disfiguring recovery Whenever we had a woman who might have cancer wed take her to the operating room and if she woke up with a breast shed say Oh I dont have cancer he says The philosophy back then was to take out as much tissue as you could Before lumpectomy became the goldstandard earlystage breast cancer treatment women who underwent surgery usually opted to have a part of the breast removed  a little more than a lump and much less than the entire breast But  to  years ago Lichtenfeld began to notice a shift in attitudes about mastectomies More women with earlystage breast cancer wanted to have mastectomies and more surgeons were insisting it was the right course of treatment Many experts speculate that while having a breast removed is traumatic for some patients its also psychologically reassuring for women who fear the cancer will recur Typically the size of the tumor influences a doctors recommendation and the patients decision In Hwangs study the older the woman the more likely she was to opt for mastectomy if her tumor was greater than  centimeters in size  centimeters is the cutoff between stage  and stage  breast cancer Several factors including improved reconstructive surgery techniques may contribute to a womans decision to have a mastectomy versus a less invasive surgery Some women who dont have access to radiation therapy because they live in rural areas far from suitable medical facilities may also opt to have a mastectomy says Lichtenfeld There has also been a shift in social acceptance of mastectomy These days celebrities undergoing treatment for breast cancer frequently announce their plans to have drastic surgeries almost in defiance of breastobsessed Hollywood Last fall   the yearold Miss America contestant representing Washington DC publicly announced her plans to undergo a double mastectomy also defying the beauty industry she works in In some instances Lichtenfeld says a womans own anatomy may help guide the decision A smallbreasted woman with a typically sized cancer may have a better cosmetic outcome if she opts to have a mastectomy with breast reconstructive surgery Women should not be led to believe that mastectomy is a better option says Lichtenfeld Its been a little discouraging or difficult to understand why thats happening or accept that its happening Further clinical research that demonstrates overall positive health outcomes may encourage patients to seek less invasive treatments says Lichtenfeld
