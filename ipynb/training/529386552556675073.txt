Many parents have felt panic after seeing their toddler furtively sneak an unknown object in their mouth The small batteries found in remote controls laser pointers and toys are an example of just how dangerous that roulette can be In  the National Capital Poison Center   over  cases of ingested batteries with over  of those occurring in children less than  years old While the majority of batteries dont cause serious damage the buttonsized nubs can get stuck in the esophagus leaving tissue burns tearing the lining and even causing death The larger buttons at  millimeters in diameter are particularly dangerous One out of  children under  years old who swallow this larger battery are going to have a serious debilitating complication says   executive director of the National Capital Poison Center which runs the National Battery Ingestion Hotline The batteries can cause injuries that require surgical repair or the use of a tube for feeding or breathing Now researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Harvard Medical School and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute have created a shield that pastes directly onto the the negative terminal of the battery The results of their   published Monday in the   show that a prototype shield is effective at keeping small  millimeter batteries from damaging the esophagus after being swallowed Microscopic metal particles are embedded in the shield which is a millimeter thick When a battery is inserted into a device the pressure from the devices cover or a spring that holds the battery in place pushes the metal particles together The shield then acts like a switch conducting electricity When the battery is free floating down a childs esophagus for instance theres not enough   to make the microparticles smush together The shield then acts as an insulator To test the prototype battery the researchers put it and a regular button battery in two pig esophagi for two hours They also inserted a camera to look for damage While the normal battery damaged the lining of the esophagus the shielded battery left no trace They also put three shielded batteries into a laser pointer and found that the pointer worked normally The shields material is commercially available and currently used in touchscreen devices where a gentle press of a fingertip can complete a circuit The researchers say the materials availability makes it a cheap solution We think that probably its going to be in the range of pennies per battery   associate professor at Harvard Medical School and an author of the study tells Shots The next step he says is to test the prototype battery in a wider range of devices to make sure it functions and fits like a traditional button battery Karp says considering battery safety hasnt significantly improved since batteries were created this approach is surprisingly inventive Its a very simple offtheshelf potential solution However its too early to say if battery companies will be interested in buying the shield and there are still many unanswered questions says Litobitz How long will the protective coating last in the body Will it work with the bigger button batteries too Will the coating deter companies that want the slimmest possible batteries to fit inside their toys There are a lot more issues here that have to be investigated she says adding it would be a gamechanger if it worked
