On a recent afternoon at his office in Hartford Conn Dr Doug Gerard examines a patient complaining of joint pain He checks her out asks her a few questions about her symptoms and then orders a few tests before sending her on her way For a typical quick visit like this Gerard could get reimbursed  or more from a private insurer For the same visit Medicare pays less  about  And now with the new private plans under the Affordable Care Act Gerard says he would get something in between but closer to the lower Medicare rates Thats not something hes willing to put up with I cannot accept a plan in which potentially commercialtype reimbursement rates were now going to be reimbursed at Medicare rates You have to maintain a certain mix in private practice between the low reimbursers and the high reimbursers to be able to keep the lights on he says Three insurers offered plans on Connecticuts ACA marketplace in  and Gerard is only accepting one He wont say which but he will say it pays the highest rate I dont think most physicians know what theyre being reimbursed he says Only when they start seeing some of those rates come through will they realize how low the rates are they agreed to Gerards decision to reject two plans is something officials in Connecticut are concerned about If reimbursement rates to doctors stays low in Obamacare plans more doctors could reject those plans And that could mean that people will get access to insurance but they may not get access to a lot of doctors That worries Kevin Counihan who runs Connecticuts health insurance marketplace I think it could lead potentially to this kind of distinction that there is these different tiers of quality of care he explains His agency recently approved rules geared at getting more providers into plans on the exchange The goal is to make sure that everyone gets good care regardless of their income  and that consumers recognize it The perception that there are different tiers of quality of care means somehow that the people think that just because my income is below  percent of the federal poverty level Im going to get inadequate care or lesser care than someone making above  percent says Counihan Thats been something at least in our state that were trying to work against And the carriers are as well NPR asked all three of the insurers on Connecticuts exchange to comment Two declined but one agreed Ken Lalime is the CEO of Healthy CT  an insurance coop He says insurers face a real challenge figuring out how to pay doctors enough but also keep   Every time you increase payments to providers you have to offset that with increased reimbursement from the consumer So theres this balance between how much do you want to cost to provide that service  and how much you can pass along in your premium rates So its a balancing act he says Healthy CT may have missed the balance  just  percent of the exchanges consumers bought their insurance  Lalime says he also thinks low reimbursement rates are forcing some doctors to decide against accepting insurance under the Affordable Care Act Dr Bob Russo is sure of it Hes a radiologist and hes also the presidentelect of the Connecticut State Medical Society He says that the low rates and administrative burdens that come along with the ACA could make it a financial loser You get what you pay for he says If you cant convince doctors that theyre not losing money doing their job its a problem And they havent been able to convince people of that He like Counihan worries about creating a tiered health care system Think about Medicaid he says Before a recent rise in rates it paid doctors even less than Medicare so many stopped accepting Medicaid patients Theres no question that Medicaid under its old rates wasnt working he says So have we just invented a new Medicaid that kind of slid the scale up a little more to make access a little more The experience of these doctors is a good reminder that the Affordable Care Act is more than a thought exercise in health care  its happening now Open enrollment for  begins in
