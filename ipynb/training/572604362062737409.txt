Its not easy being Batmans sidekick It can cause a lumbar disk blowout like the movie franchise did for Chris ODonnell Nevertheless some yoga thrown into the fitness mix keeps him mobile and relatively pain free Its not easy being a kid playing sports these days either As a father of five who coaches and referees ODonnell sees a lot of poor sportsmanship So the costar of NCIS Los Angeles which has its season premiere Monday became part of a program to bring fun and positive play back to fields courts and rinks I played everything as a kid baseball basketball football golf hockey and swimming I was the little guy on the end of the bench barely getting any playing time to be honest I loved hockey and wished Id been better at it but when I went to high school I was able to use my smaller size to my advantage I was the coxswain on the rowing crew for four years I look back on my experiences with sports and some of the best were fourthgrade intramural football We had such a great coach that year There were certain coaches that made an impact on you Even if you werent a big contributor he made you feel like you were an integral part of the team I believe in having my kids exposed to as many sports as possible So many parents want their kids to focus on a specific sport by age  Theyre already focused on getting their kid a scholarship They think their kid is on this track to huge success and its too much pressure I try to put more focus on enjoyment over competitiveness There is more to it than the numbers on the scoreboard Its about being a good teammate and showing each other respect Too many times Ive seen parents escorted off the field because they lost control and kids being disrespectful to other players and refs and coaches so I became involved with PlayPositivecom where they created a pledge to promote sportsmanship Whats its forced me to do is be mindful of maintaining a strong core Thats something I try to incorporate into workouts as much as possible but something thats been really useful to me in the last few years and has kept me relatively pain free is doing yoga a couple of times a week I go to the gym but Im not hardcore on the weightlifting like my NCIS costar LL Cool J That man is a beast Ive always been a lowerweight highrep guy as opposed to seeing how much I can deadlift or bench Its more of a general fitness approach rather than bulking up You also burn a lot of calories being a father The minute I walk in the door I have one kid who wants to shoot hoops another one wants to throw the football and another wants to go for a bike ride Its nonstop and its fun We do a lot of stunt work and thats a lot of fun  LL Cool J is unbelievable and we feed off each other Its a bit contagious LL is a positive influence
