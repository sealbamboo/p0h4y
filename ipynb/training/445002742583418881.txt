Earwax is one of those bodily substances which few of us like to discuss in polite company  Like other secretions it is something that most of us deal with in private Yet it also holds a fascination for many   In the past it has been used as a lip balm and salve for puncture wounds  But it can do a little more than that Recent research suggests it can indicate a build up of pollutants in the body  and it could even be used to diagnose certain conditions Here are five things you  probably  didnt know about ear wax The cells inside the ear canal are unique in the human body  they migrate You could put an ink dot on the eardrum and watch it move over a few weeks and it would be carried out by the movement of the cells according to Prof Shakeel Saeed at Londons Royal National Throat Nose and Ear hospital   If this didnt happen the mini culdesac of the ear canal would soon fill up with dead cells created by the natural process of skin shedding   This movement also propels the wax  produced by the modified sweat glands which line the ear canal  towards the outside  Its thought that normal movements of the jaw  through eating and talking  assist with this movement  Prof Saeed has noticed that ear wax does sometimes get darker as we age  and that men whose ears get noticeably hairier as they age sometimes find that the wax cant escape through this jungle of hair  Ear wax contains waxy oils but much of it is made up of keratinocytes  dead skin cells The rest of cerumen  to give it its technical name  is a mixture of substances  Between  to  glands produce antimicrobial peptides  whilst sebaceous glands close to hair cells add into the mix alcohols an oily substance called squalene cholesterol and triglyceride  The production of earwax doesnt vary much between men and women young or old  but in   its triglyceride content decreased from November to July   Cerumen also contains lysozyme an antibacterial enzyme capable of destroying bacterial cell walls Other researchers are less convinced and claim that it is the perfect medium in which bacteria can grow  Asian and nonAsian ears produce different   of earwax according to scientists at the Monell Institute in Philadelphia Chromosome  is home to the wet or dry gene for earwax  with the wet variant dominating  A small change in the gene ABCC is related to both the drytype earwax and also for reduced underarm body odour found in Chinese Japanese and Korean individuals The American study measured the concentration of  volatile organic compounds found in earwax  in groups of East Asian and white men   In  out of the  compounds the Caucasian earwax had greater amounts of odorous compounds   Kate Prigge from Monell says their analysis of the smell of ear wax is a first step towards finding out whether they might eventually use it to detect disease  The institute studies a rare genetic disorder called maple syrup urine disease which can be easily diagnosed through the scent of earwax compounds Swabbing someones ears is a much simpler and cheaper process than doing a genetic test  Dr Prigge does realise how odd her choice of career might sound  She says You tell someone that you work in human body odour you get a good laugh says Prigge  But when you explain the importance behind it or how much information can be gained in these types of studies people often understand why  Carrie Roberts is in her s and has an ear wax problem She had her ears syringed at the GPs several times tried hot oil with no success  and ended up with both ears blocked Ms Roberts decided to pay for microsuction treatment where the ear canal is cleaned with an instrument like a tiny vacuum cleaner   Prof Saeed prefers this method to   With syringing you are going in blind  not under direct vision If you use water it has to get past the wax and come back bringing the wax with it  If there is no gap it cant get through and it shouldnt be forced It is uncommon to damage the ear drums during syringing but it does happen  With the microsuction the whole procedure is carried out whilst looking into the ear canal with a microscope   Carrie said the procedure was painless a little noisy and very quick  She adds It felt like one of those things they put in your mouth at the dentist to suck water out while you are having a filling but in your ear  It has been miraculous  Carrie is a convert I will go every time now Much better than syringing as I didnt feel dizzy and faint afterwards it was much quicker and I didnt have to mess about with olive oil for a week first Earwax like many other bodily secretions can show traces of certain toxins in the body such as heavy metals  But its an odd place to look and no more reliable than a simple blood test  There are also some rare metabolic disorders that affect earwax  The most notable earwax scientific discovery of recent times is that of a     Unlike humans which shed their earwax and dead skin cells filterfeeding whales retain their earwax recording life events similar to the way tree rings reveal arid and wet seasons during its lifetime  The earwax was analysed by Sascha Usenko a environmental scientist at Baylor University in Waco Texas He and his team found that during the yearold male whales life it came into contact with  different pollutants such as pesticides  There was a peak of exposure during the first year of life  suggesting that these were transferred from its mother either in the womb or through her milk  High levels of the stress hormone cortisol appeared in the waxy plug as the animal reaches sexual maturity  when competing for a mate would have been a priority
