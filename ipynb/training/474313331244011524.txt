Modern genetic sequencing helped doctors diagnose and cure a teen boys mysterious infection offering a glimpse into hospital techniques of the future A report in the New England Journal of Medicine describes how the youngsters case was baffling doctors who tried treatment after treatment as his brain swelled Current tests gave no clue as to what was causing it Finally a new sequencing technique that looks at all the genetic material circulating in the boys spinal fluid gave up the culprit  leptospirosis a bacterial disease probably contracted when he went swimming on a trip to Puerto Rico While such tests are still beyond the reach of the average doctors they wont be for long experts predict We are hoping we can apply this to any patient who comes into the hospital with any infection said Dr Charles Chiu of the University of California San Francisco who led the research team This is the wave of the future although it will take a little bit of time to iron out the wrinkles agreed Dr William Schaffner an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University who was not involved in the research The yearold boy who isnt identified in the report had severe combined immunodeficiency or SCID sometimes known as bubbleboy disease In this case his immune system was strong enough for him to live normally and even travel He had gone on a missionary trip to Puerto Rico during the first two weeks of August  where he swam in a river and the ocean Chius team wrote The boy visited the hospital three times over four months with fever and headache Eventually his brain swelled up and he had to be put into a medically induced coma Frantic doctors ran a battery of tests but didnt suspect bacterial meningitis They thought it might be something a cat gave him  the boys family had pets and the boys group had interacted with feral cats in Puerto Rico They gave him immune globulin treatment Rituxan to counter a possible autoimmune reaction and even took a brain biopsy He got even more immuneboosting treatments  but did not get better The boys family agreed to enroll him in a clinical trial using nextgeneration sequencing This approach uses modern fast genetic sequencing to look at all the DNA in a sample It found evidence of leptospirosis infection in his spinal fluid and doctors decided to treat him with penicillin  the cheap basic antibiotic that best attacks the infection That did the trick The boy got well enough to go home a month later Later on specific testing using polymerase chain reaction PCR confirmed it was leptospirosis We suspect that the patient most likely contracted leptospirosis during his trip to Puerto Rico the researchers wrote Another teen on the trip was hospitalized with fever and blood in the urine and may have had the same infection Infections such a meningitis and pneumonia often stump doctors The standard way to test is to take some blood or perhaps coughedup sputum and try to culture or grow bacteria But more than  different agents including bacteria viruses mold and fungi can cause meningitis More than half the cases of meningoencephalitis remain undiagnosed despite extensive clinical laboratory testing Chius team wrote Leptospires the bacteria that cause leptospirosis are hard to detect and they dont grow well in standard tests that culture bacteria We spend a huge amount of money to work up these cases and despite the latest generation of tests were still unable to diagnose up to  percent of cases of pneumonia in hospitalized patients Chiu told NBC News Were unable to make a diagnosis using older methods like growing out cultures More recently other types of tests have become available such as PCR which looks for specific sequences  but for only one organism at a time and you have to have a prior target he added Current diagnostic techniques especially to find viruses often dont work well The downside is the genesequencing machine  this ones made by a company called Illumina  costs  or more Thats a lot for a hospital to invest in Chiu estimates a test would cost  a pop But Chiu argues that nextgeneration sequencing will save money We estimate that the cost of hospitalization for this boy was well over  he said There was probably  spent on diagnostic tests that turned out negative And that doesnt include the distress to his family If we could have done it on the very first day he came to the hospital we would have potentially spared him three hospitalizations  an invasive brain biopsy and a stay in the ICU Chiu said Other experts agreed the case could illustrate whats coming in a few years This article is about a single case but I believe it represents a turning point in the use of sequencing to diagnose infections said genetics expert Dr Robert Green of Brigham and Womens Hospital and Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study While I would not expect this to become integrated into care immediately I would not be surprised if this is sort of genomic characterization of infectious agents is deeply integrated into clinical care within the next five years
