Ever since Marci Lieber a parttime social worker in Brooklyn learned she was pregnant she and her husband have been scrambling to find   But insurers consider   a preexisting condition and wont sell anyone a new policy that covers it That changes on Jan   when insurers will no longer be permitted to deny coverage of preexisting conditions  and all Americans will be required to have health insurance under the Affordable Care Act Ms Lieber  hopes to purchase a policy through New York States new health exchange as early as this October Just in time the baby is due Jan  I hadnt paid super close attention to the ACA I didnt realize it would apply to my life Ms Lieber said She learned she could purchase a policy through the new exchange from a counselor at Community Health Advocates a consumer assistance program that helps New Yorkers find health coverage Ms Lieber isnt alone Many Americans still   including  out of  lowincome workers who especially stand to benefit according to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation Many mistakenly believe the law has been overturned and few have any idea how they are to go about purchasing health insurance from the online exchanges being set up in each state  or that the federal government intends to help many of them pay for it But many efforts are being made to simplify the process of buying insurance and to make the exchanges as userfriendly as possible For starters the state exchanges are Web sites designed to make it possible to purchase health insurance if you dont get it from your employer If they work as promised the exchanges will let consumers compare different options as easily as they would booking a trip on Travelocity or researching a car on   You can find a link to your states exchange at   All health plans offered on a state exchange must provide comprehensive coverage that includes doctors visits lab work hospital stays emergency room services maternity care prescriptions mental health services and childrens dental and vision care Presumably this means fewer consumers will be stung by minimal coverage and unexpected denials  the fine print of health policies that everyone dreads But not all the plans will offer the same level of coverage Shoppers will find four broad categories Policies with the most generous benefits will be platinum plans they will have the highest monthly premiums but fewer outofpocket costs and lower deductibles The gold and silver plans will be somewhat less generous while those in the bronze category will have the cheapest premiums but may require high outofpocket costs and deductibles The idea is that you will be able to make an applestoapples comparison of the prices provider networks and other details to see which policy best fits your needs Be aware that the plans may have narrow provider networks  your favorite doctor or the hospital down the street may not be a participant Youll need to check to see if a certain provider is in the network advised Sabrina Corlette a research professor at Georgetown Universitys Center on Health Insurance Reform The exchange should be able to tell you exactly what each plan will cost given individual circumstances Be prepared for sticker shock A yearold nonsmoker may be able to buy a plan for about  annually or less someone in his or her s may pay double Health insurance is an incredibly expensive product Ms Corlette warned What many consumers dont realize is that even if you earn well above the minimum wage you may get help purchasing the policy you want People who earn up to four times the federal poverty level  roughly  a year for a single person and  for a family of four  can receive subsidies to help pay for the new coverage Those earning  percent of the poverty level are eligible for additional costsharing subsidies The vast majority of currently uninsured are going to be eligible for some form of subsidy said Elisabeth Benjamin vice president of health initiatives with the   To see if youre eligible for subsidies and what portion of the cost you will be expected to carry try this calculator   Americans who work at minimum wage jobs earning less than  percent of the federal poverty level which is  for a household of one and  for a household of four will qualify for free government coverage under    but only if they live in a state that is expanding its Medicaid program The Kaiser Family Foundation   Medicaid is going to be the safety net for more people in the years to come Its free you dont pay anything its comprehensive and it turns out to be the easiest thing to apply for said Karen Pollitz senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation In many states all of these transactions are to be handled by the online exchange Medicaid may require a separate process in some states You fill out an application providing your   number and information about your income and family The exchange will tell you if you are eligible for Medicaid or for a subsidy If so it will tell you the amount as well as what your share will be the calculation is based on the price of a midrange silver plan You select a plan and you can decide whether you want the subsidy paid directly to the insurer or not The new system will be a radical departure from the byzantine and often bewildering insurance market we have now Critics say the exchanges will cost the government a fortune and warn that the plans may provide access only to a limited number of doctors and hospitals Supporters acknowledge that there will be glitches initially and that it may take a while to iron out all the details And health insurance has never been cheap Outofpocket costs are still high even with the financial assistance said Jennifer Sullivan of Enroll America a nonprofit group that aims to get as many Americans coverage as possible People need to see it in context and realize the annual savings they are getting that moves them to say Ah this is a pretty good dealÂ  Open enrollment on the new exchanges will run from October  through March  You will not be able to sign up for insurance after March  unless your circumstances have changed and you are suddenly without coverage because of a divorce or job loss Help will be available online or via telephone Given how difficult insurance purchases have always been many Americans are likely to need it
