The idea that milk may diminish the potential hearthealth benefits of tea has been a topic of some debate Lots of us cant imagine black tea without a little dairy to cut the bitterness But according to   research going back to  we might want to at least consider trying say a nice cup of green tea sans sugar or cream Why Well to get to the bottom of this issue last week I spent an afternoon at the Fifth International Scientific Symposium on Tea and Human Health where I picked the brains of lots of researchers Turns out there seems to be a consensus about one thing Milk proteins can bind with the beneficial plant compounds known as flavonols in tea You may have heard these compounds referred to by specific names such as catechins And according to some scientists the binding may make it tough for the body to absorb the flavonols and get the health benefits There are lots of potential health benefits of tea Take for instance weight maintenance Rick Hursel of Maastricht University Medical Centre in Holland has published a review   that finds green tea may slightly increase metabolism Weve shown that green tea is able to increase your energy expenditure so the amount of calories you burn and also to increase the amount of fat you are burning says Hursel Now before you get too excited its important to point out that the weight loss effects are small  and perhaps only fleeting But Hursel says the interesting thing is that in a separate   he published he found that when milk is added to tea the metabolic effects are inhibited Something happens which we dont want to happen explains Hursel This effect has also been observed among scientists who study teas influence on blood vessel health Preliminary   suggest that flavonols in tea play a role in helping to regulate blood pressure But again the effect seems diminished when milk proteins are present Now not all scientists are convinced that the effects of milk are strong enough to cancel out potential health benefits Theres no convincing evidence that milk is a problem says Alan Crozier of the University of Glasgow in Scotland He explains that teas are loaded with beneficial flavonols and typically people only add a little milk to a cup of tea The amount of milk is not going to greatly interfere with the way theyre catechins absorbed says Crozier Milk proteins may slow down the process but theres no evidence that they cause irreversible binding And his hunch is that the milk does not stop the bioactive compounds catechins from being absorbed Theres another reason some people may avoid milk in their tea For certified tea sommelier Robert RexWaller of the Park Hyatt Hotel in Washington DC its about enjoying the distinct flavors of teas on their own RexWaller oversees the tea program at the hotel which serves  rare teas from all over the world and showcases the very finest in a glass tea humidor Hes learned to enjoy the taste of pure green tea There are some teas where Id cringe a little if someone poured milk in he says He suggests that people take a sip first before adding any milk But he says tea is for enjoyment  people should just prepare their tea the way they like it Everyone has their own preferences Green tea sans milk and sugar may be a struggle in our society which seems to have a communal sweet tooth and a penchant for cream Even Starbucks serves up a sweetened   with steamed milk So heres one idea If you prefer black tea with milk and sugar drink it with breakfast Then later in the day try to add in a cup of green tea  nothing added
