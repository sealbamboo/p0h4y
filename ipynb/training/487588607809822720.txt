Hello, everyone, and nice to see you again. We have returned our civic duty just in time for our weekly ritual – daydreaming about weekend plans.  Our agenda is, as usual, rather modest. We hope to spend ‘quality time’ with one or more short people, tidy up around the castle and take a nap or two. And you? Anything interesting planned? This is, of course, a lovely time of year to enjoy the great outdoors, so perhaps a sojourn to a beach or lake is in order. Or taking a long walk can be good for the soul. And then there is that upcoming soccer match to watch. Well, whatever you do, have a grand time, but be safe. See you soon…. Meanwhile, Shire is hearing from its shareholders by way of letters, telephone calls and meetings with its chairwoman about holding talks with AbbVie. Sarepta Therapeutics released study results of its drug for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy and these suggested less of a decline in walking ability from previous studies, sending its stock plunging. And the U.K.’s National Health Service and other European public health programs are set to be carved out of a proposed transatlantic trade deal to protect them from legal challenges by U.S. corporations.
