From the shock of the cancer diagnosis onward depression can take its welldocumented toll on patients Even patients who appear to pack away their fears during the grinding treatment journey to becoming cancerfree concede that when the regimen ends they unspool emotionally  There has been less attention paid to the diseases emotional impact on spouses They too can become depressed But with the roles of caregiver and cheerleader thrust upon them they may feel constrained about expressing their darker feelings Now a new analysis finds that within two years of a cancer diagnosis the pervasiveness of depression in patients and their spouses tends to drop back to roughly the same levels as in the general population only to be replaced by another minddemon anxiety which can even intensify as time passes The analysis which looked at  studies involving  patients with a range of cancers found that over all nearly  percent of patients experienced serious anxiety two to  years after their diagnosis compared with about  percent of the general population But in a cluster of studies that looked at couples anxiety levels in that time frame grew to as high as  percent in patients and  percent in their spouses Anxiety is a persistent problem long after the cancer has been diagnosed said Dr Alex J Mitchell the lead author of the study which   and a senior lecturer in psychooncology at the University of Leicester in England Psychooncologists often based at cancer centers look at the psychological and social effects of cancer on patients during and after treatment Unlike depression anxiety has not been looked at extensively in the longterm cancer population and even less so in partners It appears to be at least equal and perhaps more of a problem for spouses than patients Dr Mitchell said But at least in the UK were poor at helping family members when the patient is affected  People who have not confronted a lifechallenging illness may be perplexed by the residual anxiety in patients long after they have successfully completed treatment They think that when its over it should be over said Jane Hyman  a retired elementary school principal from Sharon Mass who was treated for breast cancer  years ago But the downside to being further out is that Ive known many people who have had cancer more than once  Her body works like an unconscious calendar In early June she becomes edgy and nervous and begins staying awake till  am reading Then she and her husband check their real calendars and sure enough her annual checkup is just a few weeks away Dr Laura B Dunn a professor of psychiatry and director of psychooncology at the University of California San Francisco said that although cancer is increasingly labeled a chronic illness its different from arthritis in that its more of a chronic threat Some of us are wired to be attuned to threat The anxiety is understandable she said because no one can guarantee you a cancerfree survival Some people can say Yeah it might recur but I cant control that and they live their life anyway she continued  But others because of genes past experience or temperament have more difficulty doing that she said and the anxiety may not decrease over time Dr Mitchell said that in his clinical practice key predictors of anxiety in family members included whether a caregiver felt out of control and unable to participate in the patients care witnessed an unexpected or unpredictable deterioration of a loved one and transitioned from being in an equal relationship to being a caregiver a role you didnt ask for In at least two of the studies more women than men turned out to have greater rates of anxiety In a prostate cancer study more spouses than patients experienced it while in a study of gynecological cancers the patients tended to be more anxious than their spouses But those results may reflect in part that so many men are raised not to be forthcoming about feelings like depression or anxiety My husband keeps his game face on said Casey Malanga of Milton Mass who is  and was treated for breast cancer in  He was never one to gush about his emotions I think he does worry but it calms his worry to say I know what theyve done is still working and they are always monitoring you  A couples ability to manage anxiety may be more challenging when men are the patients said Dr Dunn because the husband doesnt want to worry his wife with every ache and pain so he doesnt mention them And he doesnt want to be micromanaged over every little symptom But if the wife finds out shell worry even more because he didnt tell her The analysis did not identify certain cancers as having more psychological impact than others Rather the burden of the disease on an individual patient including symptoms and treatment complications was more telling than the type of cancer Dr Mitchell said Although the Lancet Oncology study did not look at the effects of cancer on children other studies have noted the considerable emotional turmoil they can experience Risk factors were variable including the severity of the parents disease the depression exhibited by the parents themselves and the age of the child  teenagers tended to have more psychosocial problems than younger children There were drawbacks to the current analysis Most of the studies had little information about the precancer mental histories of the patients for example and they used variable methods to screen for depression and anxiety But the findings underscore the need to address the longterm consequences of anxiety and other mood disorders among patients and those closest to them Even in an era of scarce resources hospitalbased psychooncology programs should probably not be exclusively reserved for patients said Dr Ilana M Braun chief of the adult psychosocial oncology division at the DanaFarber Cancer Institute in Boston  Such programs she says should be made available in some capacity to those in remission and to loved ones impacted by cancer in their family
