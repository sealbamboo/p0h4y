In December Ben Villarreal graduated with a bachelors degree from Samuel Merritt Universitys nursing program in Oakland In short order he received two job offers at UC hospitals with programs for new graduates But with less than a month to go before his start dates the yearold said he is concerned that he could lose both promising opportunities As of midFebruary Californias Board of Registered Nursing still hadnt given him the goahead to take the nursing exam needed to get his license and start a new job Ive been told my application is on my evaluators desk with hundreds of others he said My name could be at the bottom of the pile or it could be at the top Theres no way to know when theyll get to it Problems with a new computer system are leaving thousands of recent nursing graduates like Villarreal in the lurch Californias new BreEZe online licensing and enforcement system managed by the Department of Consumer Affairs in Sacramento was intended to improve efficiency for  licensing boards and bureaus But since the states Board of Registered Nursing and nine other agencies started using the software Oct  applications for graduating nurses have spent weeks in limbo Approximately  were pending as of Tuesday according to Russ Heimerich a spokesman for the Department of Consumer Affairs Our BreEZe computer system is not doing everything it was designed to do yet he said BreEZe a million system cannot yet accept online applications for nursing licenses so board workers have to type in applicant data from paper forms before they can determine eligibility to take the licensing exam BreEZe is causing additional steps and additional workload Heimerich said adding that the pileup grew worse when large numbers of nurses graduated in December The nursing board is now advising graduates it may be as long as  days before they receive the goahead to take the licensing exam Before the transition to BreEZe its website warned applicants they might have to wait  to  weeks  but the process rarely took that long Audrey Berman dean of nursing at Samuel Merritt University which operates campuses in Oakland Sacramento and San Mateo said she had heard from at least a dozen distressed students including Villarreal out of about  who graduated from her program in November and December They have done what theyre supposed to do and they found a job but they cant start without their license in hand Berman said adding that she wasnt sure how many other Samuel Merritt graduates were facing delays A nursing program administrator in Southern California told The Times that more than a third of the  people who graduated from her school in October had contacted her with worries about delayed licenses Heimerich said the Department of Consumer Affairs was trying to get the online application process working as soon as the contracts with its BreEZe vendor would allow There is no target date for a fix yet In the meantime Heimerich said the department will move at least  additional staff members over to the nursing board to help the staff of  who process applications with manual tasks like data entry which should help eliminate the backlog Heimerich said the nursing board was also working on a letter applicants will be able to share with employers explaining that license delays arent the job candidates fault Hospitals have been giving new nurses extra time to get their licenses when they can said state Assemblywoman Kristin Olsen RModesto Last week she asked for an audit of the BreEZe implementation to figure out what went wrong There are many other examples of persistent problems with tech system failures in state agencies she said mentioning the Covered California exchange and the Employment Development Department where unemployment checks to as many as  people were delayed in September  after a botched system upgrade One would think we could save time and money by putting systems online Olsen added These technology systems should be fully tested and problems fixed before rollout The Joint Legislative Audit Committee will consider Olsens request at a March  hearing Villarreal said he didnt blame the nursing board for the delays Im not sure whose fault this really is he said I just hope that theyll learn to do this more quickly for future classes
