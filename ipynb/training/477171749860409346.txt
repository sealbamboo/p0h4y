Medical researchers doctors and censustakers may lump Latinos or Hispanics into one group but a giant study of Mexican genetics shows theres really no such thing Mexicans themselves show such extreme diversity that someone from the dry north is genetically as different from someone from the Yucatan as a European is from an East Asian The findings published in the journal Science are important for medical research and healthcare the researchers said In this study we realized that for disease classification it also matters what type of Native American ancestry you have said Carlos Bustamante a professor of genetics at Stanford University In terms of genetics its the difference between a neighborhood and a precise street address Before the Spanish conquerers arrived in the th century   was inhabited by Native Americans who had carved out their own often isolated kingdoms These genetic differences show up even today the team at Stanford the University of California San Francisco and the Mexican National Institute of Genomic Medicine found Mexico harbors one of the largest amounts of preColumbian genetic diversity in the Americas said Stanfords Dr Andres MorenoEstrada For the first time weve mapped this diversity to a very fine geographic scale and shown that it has a notable physiological impact on an important clinical trait lung function They compared their genetic map to tests of lung function as measured by the volume of air a person can expel in one second or FEV They found a  percent difference in baseline FEV as they moved from populations in the western state of Sonora to Yucatan in the east We were really fascinated by these results because we had expected that  years of population movements   and mixing would have swamped the signal of preColumbian population structure said Bustamante The differences hold even though most Mexicans are mestizos Today the majority of Mexicans are admixed and can trace their ancestry back not only to indigenous groups but also to Europe and Africa the researchers wrote It will be important as medicine becomes increasingly tailored based on an individuals genes Their specific origin  not just a broad racial group  may provide crucial pointers We cant just clump everyone together and call them European Americans or Mexican Americans added Dr Esteban Burchard of UCSF
