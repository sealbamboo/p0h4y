There are estimated to be around m deaths per year according to the World Health Organisation  and its thought half are not registered  so there is a lot of missing information about what people die of The Million Deaths Study aims to change that by investigating one million deaths in India  and there have been some surprising discoveries In a small house near Bangalore the loud hum of silk spinning machines in the background Maniamma relates the details of her husbands death a few months ago The day he died he went to see our daughter who lives in a nearby village While returning he had some problems  perhaps a minor heart attack He got out of the car but couldnt walk He died at am the following morning All the details are recorded by Ashok Kumar a trained fieldworker who is carrying out a verbal post mortem a   Its part of a huge study surveying and analysing one million deaths in India Knowing what is killing people is vital  it helps save lives by ensuring public health money is spent on the right things In the developed world almost all deaths are registered and the cause of death recorded on an official medical death certificate By contrast most deaths in the developing world go unrecorded and estimates of the causes of death are generally based on people who die in hospitals and under medical supervision But hospital deaths are the exception in India India has about nine million deaths a year most of which occur at home and in rural areas  says Prof Prabhat Jha who leads the study from the Centre for Global Health Research in Toronto The Million Deaths Study MDS uses verbal autopsies or postmortems  interviewing those close to the deceased about what happened before their death  as a way of addressing this gap The million deaths are chosen from a representative sample of areas across India and the aim is to ascertain the cause of death in each one Its a mammoth task   homes per year have been visited over the course of  years and they are set to reach the millionth death later this year Trained interviewers like Ashok Kumar talk to relatives of the deceased to build up a picture of why they died  He asks about symptoms like unconsciousness breathlessness or fever leading up to the death as well as lifestyle questions about smoking drinking and diet The information collected on the field visits will then be passed to two physicians who independently try to decipher the cause of death If their conclusions dont tally the case is passed to a third senior physician to analyse By looking into home deaths as well as those under medical supervision the MDS has built up a more complete picture of what people are dying of It also means researchers can tailor disease control by identifying diseases common in one place and rare in another as well as helping spot emerging epidemics After surveying their millionth death it will take another year or two for all the deaths to be coded and analysed But early findings have already made an impact Controversially in  the team found malaria deaths in India were   The WHOs India Office continues to dispute the high malarial deaths figures However a spokesman said The malaria figures estimated by MDS were unexpectedly high and justify further investigation They suggest malaria is often more difficult to diagnose as a cause of death through verbal autopsy  because fever symptoms are common to other illnesses Now the studys results are helping fight another major cause of death in India  smoking By looking at how the dead person lived Prof Jha explains you can understand the living as well as the dead We can study for example did the dead person smoke did they drink and from that using simple statistical methods figure out how many people are dying from smoking in India By number crunching the data they found the average male cigarette smoker is losing a decade of life in India Prof Jha says their findings helped prompt Indias health minister Harsh Vardhan   for the new governments budget In the budget   taxes on cigarettes were raised between  and  but the researchers estimate that even this more modest hike could save nearly one million lives They also found  of people dying from smoking are illiterate  highlighting the importance of Indias policy of graphic warnings on cigarette packets Dr Sanjay Kinra a public health expert from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who is not involved in the study believes the MDS will help improve Indias health You need lots of information to plan public health policy and knowing the key cause of death and basic lifestyle factors is a good start The ultimate aim he says should be for the Indian government to develop a stronger civil registration system to record the details of all deaths  not just a sample as in the Million Deaths Study But he adds that knowing the cause of death does have limitations when allocating public health money Not everything that is a disease kills you  and diseases that dont kill you straight away but cause suffering over many years like diabetes or dementia also need a lot of resources Prof Jha was inspired to start the project by his grandfathers premature death at the age of  in Bihar India Death isnt avoidable but early death is and his death at age  was a major trauma on my mother and the extended family Noone knew why hed died young and years later as a medical student Prof Jha went back to his grandfathers village and asked his grandmother what happened She recalled very vividly  years ago the events hed gone to the washroom in the morning yelled out collapsed and his right side wasnt moving And so on the spot I said he probably had a stroke If his grandmother could recall faroff events so vividly he reasoned why couldnt this be applied more widely Teaming up with Indias Registrar General who had been keeping death records since  the researchers introduced verbal autopsy into the system so that cause of death and lifestyle information would be recorded at the same time Prof Jha is confident that it is a robust way of assessing causes of death In the village in India people will tell you the truth  theyll talk about Aids theyll talk about sensitive things like suicide theyll talk about neglect from the government care in a very candid way And because death is so memorable people will tell you the details years later He doesnt find it depressing looking at deaths all the time  his motto is study the dead to help the living Im the first in the world to look at these numbers and see patterns  and I get really excited about them
