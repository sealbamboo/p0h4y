The Oct  launch of the new   is now less than two months away and people are starting to pay attention to the changes these new marketplaces may bring to the nations health care system We know its confusing so were spending part of the summer and fall answering at least some of your questions about the law You can see earlier pieces in our series   and   Today were answering questions regarding two of the more frequent topics raised student health plans and possible penalties for failing to obtain health insurance The first thing students need to know is that if they DO have student insurance through their college or university thats been   that individuals have health insurance starting in  There was a question about that for a while and its been answered Then theres the question of what happens if you cant afford the insurance your school offers or what to do if your school doesnt offer coverage First if youre a fulltime student and youre not working or if youre working just parttime you probably dont earn enough to trigger the requirement to have health insurance It applies only to people who   thats just under  this year for a single person under age  What if you DO want health insurance One popular part of the law lets   plans until they turn  And in states that opt to expand Medicaid thats an option for college and graduate students that hasnt been available before Its for people who earn up to  percent of poverty or about   But so far   are planning to expand Medicaid Another issue that sparked a lot of interest was the possibility of penalties for NOT having health insurance The penalty for not having health insurance is at least for  is  or  percent of your taxable income  whichever is greater It   eventually to a maximum of  percent of taxable income Its assessed if you owe it on your  income tax form thats due April   And thats how the government finds you  it asks on your income tax form if you had health insurance People who have it will get some sort of certificate of coverage from their health insurers And a reminder  you cant go to jail for not paying the penalty the government cant even garnish your wages The most the IRS can do is withhold your tax refund See the answer to the last question in this   And one final penaltyrelated question It depends on how you define the word penalty Seriously From the government  no To reiterate pretty much all employer insurance counts as coverage for purposes   Take your own take your spouses It doesnt matter Some companies however and this is something that predates the Affordable Care Act   if an employees spouse who doesnt work for the same firm has coverage available from his or her own job The theory is that the company doesnt want to be providing benefits to another companys employee But however you make the calculation thats best for your family it doesnt matter for purposes of the health law
