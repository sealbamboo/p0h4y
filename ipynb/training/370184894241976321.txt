Teenage girls remain big fans of tans So a   in   that found about a third of white high school girls indulge in indoor tans wasnt exactly startling What was a bit startling was how the tanning industry responded saying in effect that we should be worrying more about skin cancer in middleaged men not girls Rather than targeting sun abstinence campaigns at young women the American Suntanning Association said in a statement the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which reported on high school girls and indoor tanning should support teaching sunburn prevention to people of all ages It could not be any more clear that skin cancer rates are skyrocketing in men and particularly men over age  but CDC has inexplicably ignored this group We dont recall any skin cancer campaigns telling older men that they can kick back and stop worrying about funky spots on their skin And of course its wellknown that skin cancers are much more common among older people It can take decades for the   from the sun to result in cancer And older people are more susceptible to cancer overall But are the tanning salons really saying that we shouldnt worry about skin cancer in young people They should be teaching sunburn prevention to people of all ages says Joe Levy executive director of the International Smart Tan Network and a spokesman for the   which represents tanning salons Thats not what theyre teaching here His organization questions studies that find that people who bask under indoor UV lamps or on tanning beds are more likely to get melanoma as well as less serious squamous and basal cell skin cancers Melanoma rates rose  percent a year in white teenagers and young adults from  to  an increase researchers  to exposure to both natural and artificial UV light Those studies find a correlation between indoor tanning and skin cancer Levy told Shots but not a direct cause But doctors and public health advocates say its abundantly clear that exposure to UV light from any source boosts skin cancer risk Period They look at the numbers and figure its a lot easier to get rid of the tanning bed than it is to get rid of the sun It is a preventable cause of cancer says   chief of dermatology at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit Teenagers fondness for indoor tanning is troubling Lim says because theres   that early and frequent use of indoor tanning increases cancer risk and because teens are less wellequipped to weigh the consequences This is a very specific group of individuals Lim told Shots Very impressionable with a lot of peer pressure As a result of pressure from public health advocates and medical societies five states now  to tanning salons by minors and  states limit access Earlier this year the Food and Drug Administration proposed to stiffen   of tanning beds and sunlamps The changes wouldnt prohibit teens from using these sunlamp products as the FDA plans to call them but would make labels and other warnings on the risks clearer and consistent including a recommendation that frequent users be regularly screened for skin cancer The units already have warning labels Levy told Shots They already acknowledge that overexposure is a risk factor And frankly there is nobody today that doesnt understand that already Or as a   on the ASAs Web page about managing the risks of indoor tanning says italics theirs Overexposure is harmful Levy says We have always said that But its very very difficult to make that stick when the dermatologist is saying conveniently that any exposure is bad But based on the CDC numbers it looks like teenage girls are more likely to listen to their peers than the dermatologist at least so far
