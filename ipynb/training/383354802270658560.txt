Fast-food giant McDonald's has made a .  to stop marketing sodas as a beverage option in kids' Happy Meals.. Instead, the chain has committed to market and promote only milk, water and juice with the children's meals.. Now, if parents order a Coke or Sprite with their child's Happy Meal, they won't be turned down. But sodas will no longer be marketed or promoted visually in any of McDonald's advertisements or in-store visuals.. The change comes as part of a larger plan to promote more healthful choices at the fast-food chain.. The announcement was made in partnership with The Alliance for a Healthy Generation, founded by the Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association — which has been working to combat childhood obesity..

And, hey, how about the competition? Wootan says other restaurant chains should follow suit and stop marketing sodas with children's meals.
