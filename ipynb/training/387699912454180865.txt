A bomb exploded Monday near a group of polio vaccinators in Peshawar killing at least two policemen     Since December at least  polio workers have been killed in similar assaults Such violence has threatened the global effort to stamp out the disease in the three countries where the virus is still endemic  Afghanistan Nigeria and Pakistan The attacks will probably continue researchers warned Tuesday unless world leaders rethink the strategy for eradicating polio In a pair of   researchers from Afghanistan Nigeria and Pakistan call for a shift in where money and resources for polio eradication are focused Instead of promoting the polio vaccine through highprofile leaders and politicians they write these countries need to build up and empower the community health workers Usually women these workers go door to door to administer vaccine and other basic health services Otherwise terrorist groups like alQaida in Pakistan and Boko Haram in Nigeria will continue to see attacks on polio workers as an effective war tactic against the West   and his colleagues write in the journal   Targeting the polio campaign is one way that terrorist groups can attract attention not the least because of the largescale advertisement campaigns run by government authorities they write Many people in Nigeria and Pakistan associate the antipolio campaign with he West the group says That connection has fueled distrust for the vaccine and leaders supporting it To reverse this trend Abimbola and his colleague suggest integrating the polio vaccine with other basic health services sanitation and clean water There are many health issues in northern Nigeria that the people rightly consider as priority issues but the government  seems to concentrate on polio eradication Abimbola writes This situation breeds suspicions and leads people to refuse the polio vaccine This sentiment is echoed by   of Middelbury College in the US and   of Aga Khan University in Pakistan who coauthored another commentary in the same issue of   They call for putting polio vaccine drives side by side with other immunization drives For example during the recent measles outbreaks in Pakistan the polio vaccine could have been administered to millions of children  but as a routine practice immunization campaigns were limited to vaccinations against measles Pakistan has trained more than a hundred thousand community health workers to implement these immunizations drives These   are the backbone of the health care system in Pakistan  and a critical to polio eradication Closser and Jooma write But the government offers these women little support financially or politically Lady Health Workers are often in desperate financial straits they write Many earn under  per day while the Global Polio Eradication Initiative operates with a budget of more than a billion dollars each year By empowering these women and expanding their skills communities will be more likely to embrace polio eradication as a broader health problem Closser and Jooma argue Then groups such as Boko Haram and the Taliban will have an incentive to help secure access to vaccinations as a means of winning peoples support
