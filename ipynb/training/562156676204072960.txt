New guidance on whether to resuscitate patients who are approaching the end of their lives is being issued to medics.. For the first time, all hospitals in Wales will follow the same procedure to decide if patients should receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).. The Welsh government said it would ensure the best interest of patients.. Baroness Ilora Finlay, a professor in palliative medicine, said the policy will "avoid futile attempts to start a person's heart when it stops".
