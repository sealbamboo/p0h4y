The death of Charlotte Bevan and her newborn daughter in Bristol has prompted a review into the care she was given There are often questions about how such tragic situations might be avoided when family and friends become aware that a loved one is slipping into a decline To talk about this most sensitive of subjects I met a polo player and former social editor at Tatler magazine Clare Milford Haven for a coffee in a quiet cafe at Brighton railway station  Her eldest son James WentworthStanley was sporty bright and goodlooking  He took his own life at the age of just  in  He was in his second year of studying Spanish and business  Described by his mother as a doer he also played in a rugby team and held down a hotel bar job James had returned to student life in Newcastle a few days after a minor operation had led to a change in mood Clare Milford Haven told me I wish Id kept him under my watchful eye  I couldnt force his hand about returning to Newcastle  but I regret it because then he took his own life It was the most horrendous and alarming experience There was absolutely no warning sign at all  we didnt see it coming Our world was turned upside down   You have so many questions and you just look for answers A suicide bereavement is complicated by intense feelings of guilt and shame James WentworthStanley sought help in vain He had been in contact with a GP and a walkin centre  which sent him to AE two days before his suicide  His mother has harnessed her pain to help others  Clare Milford Haven helps to run the Alliance of Suicide Prevention Charities TASC  One of her goals is to set up a network of centres near hospitals  Called James Place these would offer urgent facetoface support for patients who are experiencing a crisis but are not in touch with mental health services Clare hopes the idea will be piloted in West London as well as in Brighton and Hove  She said Wed like to have a hierarchy of staff  from volunteers to highly trained clinicians But the atmosphere would be a nonclinical one  Its my dream that this would fill those very vital gaps in services We drive to a nearby library where  people have gathered for a course called Safe Talk or Suicide Alertness For Everyone The audience  mostly community workers  watch and discuss video clips which demonstrate how to ask someone who is suffering a very simple but direct question Could you be thinking of suicide The message behind the course is the importance of keeping someone who is  vulnerable safe and connecting them with services This might involve for example taking someone to a pharmacist or GP with any medicine they have stockpiled During a break the instructor Chris Brown tells me how the charity she cofounded Grassroots Suicide Prevention is working to reduce what had been a very high suicide rate in Brighton  She said Were trying to make Brighton a suicidesafe town  its all about education awareness and training residents with brief courses like this one Research tells us that people considering suicide have doubts about it It shouldnt be regarded as an inevitable outcome Part of a person considering ending their life wants to live as well as the part of them that wants to die But sometimes rules of confidentiality can mean that people dont get the help they might need from friends or family  this can result in a tragic outcome Advice to doctors from the Medical Defence Union says they should encourage patients to allow friends and family to get involved  and they can listen to the concerns of loved ones  Technology could hold some promise here  Grassroots has launched an app called Stay Alive which aims to point desperate people to help quickly  But the Samaritans had to suspend their app called Radar after criticism that its monitoring of tweets was intrusive and could encourage bullies This is an area in which any support has to be offered carefully and sensitively
