The Michael J Fox Foundation is attempting to use wearable sensors to monitor the symptoms of Parkinsons disease The charity has teamed up with Intel to equip patients with smartwatches which record continous data about them The organisations carried out tests earlier in the year and now plan to release an app to help doctors study the effects of different medications The effort has been given a cautious welcome by other researchers The actor Michael J Fox created his New Yorkbased foundation in  after being diagnosed with the degenerative neurological disorder It is believed that Parkinsons is brought on by a mixture of genetic and environmental factors but the exact cause is still unknown  Its symptoms can include tremors and other uncontrollable movements impaired balance and coordination stiffness slowness of movement loss of smell a decline in intellectual functioning and speech and swallowing problems It is estimated to affect about five million people worldwide and usually but not always occurs in old age The linkup with Intel came about through the tech firms former chief executive Andy Grove who serves as a senior advisor to the foundation and has been diagnosed with Parkinsons himself This opportunity really will allow us the chance to uncover novel breakthroughs in Parkinsons disease by truly understanding how people are living with the disease today how are they responding to treatments what are their unmet needs said Todd Sherer chief executive of the foundation The wearables study is intended to provide researchers with more accurate data than can be obtained via traditional subjective methods A preliminary test was funded by the two organisations earlier this year that equipped  Parkinsons patients and nine control volunteers with the devices for four days The watches allowed more than  data points to be recorded every second translating to one gigabyte of data per patient a day The information was then uploaded to Intels system by a smartphone carried by those involved Over the period the participants kept paperandpen diaries and attended two clinical visits where they engaged in tests designed for the disease Intel data scientists are still processing the findings In addition to checking that the wearable techs records correlate with those taken by the parties involved they aim to develop algorithms that will allow body movement symptoms and sleep patterns to be automatically measured and made available for review in real time The next phase of the study involves releasing an app that allows patients to record how they are feeling and to report their medication intake to help scientists measure the efficacy of the drugs and inform medics when they are deciding prescriptions This stage of the trial will be carried out in Boston New York and Israel Were looking for the accelerometer data Ronald Kasabian general manager of big data solutions at Intel told the BBC We want to be able to understand gait fluidity of movement tremors The researchers are dying for the insight The ability to see what is happening to the patient on a minutebyminute  hours a day  days a year basis  the tremors the sleep habits  to see that in real time will be one of the most eyeopening opportunities Intel said it would encrypt and anonymise the data to safeguard patients privacy It added that the intention was to eventually open up the platform to other research centres and  wearable devices Parkinsons UK welcomed the development but cautioned that it was too soon to know how useful the results would be The potential of using new technology to aid clinical decision making and help people with Parkinsons to get the right treatment is exciting Suma Surendranath professional engagement manger at the charity told the BBC However it would be crucial that any device should demonstrate its effectiveness in robust clinical trials before becoming more widely available  New technology that has been proven to accurately represent the complexity of symptoms of people with Parkinsons could be a very useful addition to the tools currently available to professionals The Michael J Fox Foundation acknowledged that the study was still at an early stage but it said it still believed a sensordriven platform could be delivered within years and not decades to allow doctors to better tailor treatments to each patient What happens is that you have onoff periods as a patient explained Sohini Chowdhury senior vice president of research partnerships at MJFF When youre on your medication is working youre able to move youre able to do the tasks you want When you are off you are basically frozen you cant do anything The question treating physicians tackle with is Are we giving you the optimal dose to be able to get you the right amount of onoff time during the day Several other major tech firms have also announced plans to become more involved with health tracking tech In May Samsung unveiled Simband a prototype wristband that can be fitted with thirdparty sensors to gather a range of data about the wearers body that would then be shared with a platform called Sami Samsung Architecture Multimedia Interactions Then in June Apple unveiled HealthKit  an app for its forthcoming iOS  operating system that is designed to gather data from a wide range of thirdparty sensors which can contact health professionals if it notices irregularities Later the same month Google announced Google Fit the Androidmakers own software to amass healthrelated data from other services and devices
