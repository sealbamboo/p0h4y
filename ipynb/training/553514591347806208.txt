era Baird finds herself in a curious position Her political party wants to scrap her job but would use the savings to invest in a cause dear to her heart Who knows she might even get another post out of it Baird police and crime commissioner PCC for Northumbria has made countering domestic and sexual violence and abuse not just her priority in her current role but her lifes work She is determined to see services for victims recognised as an integral part of stcentury welfare provision In a modern welfare state you cant have women  one in four women at some time in their life  groping around in the hope that there are services to help them says Baird  a QC and former MP who was solicitor general for England and Wales in the last Labour government Besides its all about investing to save She is struck by the way austerity in the public services is exposing how the tentacles of domestic abuse have spread into sectors such as housing health and education Cuts in funds like the   show how tackling abuse and dealing with its consequences has extended way beyond provision of refuges  and how that kind of wider intervention is at risk To redress the balance and stop much higher costs being incurred elsewhere in the public services Labour is to promise in its general election manifesto a programme of measures entitled   Drawn up by Baird and based on the work of a commission she led the programme would include the appointment of a commissioner to integrate crossgovernment policies for protection of women and girls Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper   introduced by the coalition government a little over two years ago While Baird would lose her Northumbria post in such a scenario her credentials for the proposed new national role look impeccable Thats mere speculation however For now Baird is focused on putting some of her key ideas into practice in her northeast laboratory which she oversees from her office on an anonymous business park on the outskirts of Newcastle upon Tyne She is fortunate she says that Northumbria police has a relatively good  though not marvellous  record on dealing with domestic abuse being one of only a handful of forces spared scathing criticism in the   on the subject last March Local councils particularly Newcastle recognise the importance of the problem both in its own right and as a contributor to other issues such as homelessness and child abuse and employers in the region are signing up in growing numbers to a domestic and sexual violence champions network The police have all had some training in dealing with domestic abuse have a specialist worker attached to the force and are seeking to improve profiling of perpetrators so as to identify the most appropriate response This chimes with national research due to be released shortly on whether perpetrator programmes reduce domestic violence by men The research known as   and carried out over five years among  perpetrators is expected to conclude that programmes are not effective for all men but can be for those who have been violent at home often repeatedly but are otherwise not criminal by nature The general view has been that perpetrator programmes dont work says Baird But I think Project Mirabal will say its about sorting out the perpetrators This should change the tide Baird admits to having changed her mind on the value of   which police can issue to exclude a violent man from the family home for up to  hours and prevention orders which a magistrate can issue to extend an exclusion for up to  days The measures were extended across England and Wales last year I didnt think there was much point in them at first because you could always arrest the perpetrator and put them on bail she says But it does change the cops perception that she should leave We take her out we take the kids out we even take the dog and cat out but actually a lot of times it makes most sense just to put him out It gives her some space to discuss what she wants to do and make proper arrangements and tells her that the powersthatbe are on her side not his She accepts though that a lot of domestic abuse is not about black eyes but about socalled coercive control  not letting her have any money following her when she goes out texting her every five minutes discouraging her family from coming round calling her names telling her she is ugly and her cooking is terrible all of it incredibly undermining This sort of abuse can by definition be hard to spot To help the police do so Baird is running pilot schemes in Sunderland and Newcastle whereby officers are accompanied by specialist workers when they visit homes where abuse is suspected In an earlier pilot in the town of Washington  of women who were visited subsequently made contact with the refuge where the workers were based As few as  would typically do so says Baird adding that the cops think their risk assessments are much better because they are being done jointly with experienced refuge workers The home secretary Theresa May   amending a Home Office bill already in passage to make coercive and controlling behaviour an offence punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine Baird sympathises but is unsure the idea is practical Im not myself convinced that making it a criminal offence is the right thing to do she says What I am sure about is that the courts have got to start counting domestic violence Thats what matters In the northeast as a whole including the Cleveland and Durham police force areas as well as Northumbria  women make formal complaints about domestic violence in the course of a year Baird thinks thats about one in five of all victims She and her two fellow PCCs for the region have been campaigning for local courts to take a stronger line on cases that are prosecuted and   they accuse of flouting sentencing guidelines but she says it is impossible to know if sentences are in line with those for other offences of violence because cases are not logged separately Beyond better counting though the big change Baird wants to see is for domestic abuse to become an issue owned by society more broadly by community groups alert to it in their neighbourhoods by employers appointing champions trained to respond to signs that colleagues are suffering it at home and by other state agencies and housing organisations sharing responsibility currently shouldered too much by the police She thinks the   or Maracs which focus on a small minority of highrisk cases have become too enormous a drain on limited resources  though she recognises they have saved lives The truth is that you need some similar arrangement that starts with lowrisk people so they can get out before it all becomes highrisk There has got to be a structure that will allow everybody to get similar support The blueprint for the future she believes is the multiagency strategic hub or Mash which permanently colocates staff from different agencies There is an existing Mash in Sunderland for child safeguarding When somebody comes through any door they are straight away in the middle of all of the agencies My guess is that thats the way forward for domestic abuse Some people think another option would be to have a national inquiry into domestic abuse Baird disagrees We know what to do she says Weve known for years what to do Its just getting it through to the frontline
