It seems almost sacrilegious to question the wisdom of Julia Child First with her opus   and later with her PBS cooking show the unflappably cheerful Child helped rescue home cookery from the clutches of convenience food She taught us how to love  and take pride in  making something from scratch And yet in at least one important kitchen skill Child got it dead wrong rinsing raw poultry I just think its a safer thing to do Child tells viewers in one clip from   in which she shows us the ins and outs of roasting chicken Oh no says Drexel University food safety researcher   when I inform her that Child was in the probirdwashing camp I dont want to take on that Yet take on the doyenne of TV chefs she must For Quinlan is on a mission to get Americas home cooks to drop this widespread habit of washing poultry before cooking Theres no reason from a scientific point of view to think youre making it any safer she says and in fact youre making it less safe Thats because washing increases the chances that youll spread the foodborne pathogens that are almost certainly on your bird all over the rest of your kitchen too food safety experts say Were talking nasty stuff like salmonella and Campylobacter which together are estimated to cause   of foodborne illness in the US each year Some studies suggest bacteria can fly up to   from where your meat is rinsed  though you cant necessarily see it If that thought alone doesnt give you pause perhaps this slimy germ vision animation will do the trick But fear not All you have to do to kill these unwanted bacteria is to cook your meat properly   can help  chicken needs to reach an internal temperature of at least  degrees Fahrenheit and keep your utensils and cooking surfaces clean Quinlan and her collaborators at New Mexico State Universitys Department of Media Productions have created a new   to get the word out about why washing poultry is a bad idea Her focusgroup surveys conducted as part of a research project funded by the US Department of Agriculture suggest as many as  percent of people rinse their raw birds  even though the USDA has advised against it for years The practice is slightly more common among minorities she says but pretty much everyone does it And Quinlan expects some people will continue to cling to their birdrinsing ways Some people she notes just do it because they think their chicken is slimy If your chicken is so slimy that it needs washing something is wrong she says Other people say Thats just how I was taught to do it  It doesnt help she says that many celebrity TV chefs not just Child and cookbooks call for this as a first step But science says Quinlan is really giving the lazy a free pass  nay an    to cut out this step And some people for whom rawchickenmeat baths have been a source of marital strife may welcome Quinlans message wholeheartedly As my colleague Dan Charles told me sorry Dan Im outing you here I never did wash my chickens but then my wife forced me to So as soon as this thing is posted Im sending it straight to her
