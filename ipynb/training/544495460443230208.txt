Hello, everyone, and welcome to another working week. Yes, the weekend respite is now a thing of the past, although we do hope you had a chance to relax and recharge. Now, of course, that familiar routine of meetings and deadlines and what-not has returned. As always, we are coping with a needed cup or three of stimulation. Our flavor today is Blueberry Cobbler, a nice treat. Please feel free to join us. We don’t mind drinking alone, but a little camaraderie now and then can be a good thing. Meanwhile, here are some tidbits. Have a smashing day and do stay in touch…. Teva Pharmaceuticals ceo Erez Vigodman is preparing the ground for its fall from the patent cliff and promises that acquisitions will be a bigger factor in 2015; In a setback to Cipla, the Indian government has so far found little merit in its plea to override patent rights for five Novartis drugs; and a federal judge ordered Texas officials to release the name of the compounding pharmacy that provides the state its execution drug.
