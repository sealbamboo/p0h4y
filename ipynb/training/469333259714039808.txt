Losing weight is simple Ingest fewer calories than your body burns But how best to do that is unclear Most experts advise small reductions in calories or increases in exercise to remove weight slowly and sensibly but many people quit that type of program in the face of glacial progress A new study   suggests that minimal calories and maximal exercise can significantly reduce body fat in just four days  and the loss lasts for months The catch of course is that those four days are pretty grueling Researchers in Spain and Sweden had  healthy but overweight Swedish men restrict their calories to about  a day a reduction of approximately  calories What calories they did ingest came in liquid form Some men drank mostly sugary carbohydrates others a highprotein drink The men also exercised  a lot Their days began with  minutes of cranking an armpedaling machine for an upperbody workout Then as a group the men strolled for   hours across the Swedish countryside with only a minute break every hour They were allowed as much of a lowcalorie sportstype beverage as they wanted during their walks Most of the men were surprised that it was easier than they thought it would be says Jos Calbet a professor at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in Spain he and his colleague HansChrister Holmberg a professor at Mid Sweden University in Ostersund led the study Some of the subjects experienced minor problems with pain in the joints and blisters on their feet according to Calbet but none dropped out or complained of hunger After four days the men had each lost almost  pounds with nearly half of that coming from body fat the rest of the loss came primarily from muscle mass The researchers had anticipated that the highprotein drink would protect people against musclemass loss In fact the losses were the same whether the men had been given sugar or protein More surprising the men did not immediately put the weight back on after the study ended We thought they would overeat and regain the weight lost Dr Calbet says Instead when the volunteers returned a month later most had lost another two pounds of fat And a year after the experiment they were still down five pounds mostly in lost body fat  Dr Calbet and his colleagues hope to study whether women respond similarly to men and whether repeated bouts of such a program might affect muscular health and appetite hormones But given the doleful statistics on weight loss  most people regain everything they lose dieting and more  these results are startling They also at the moment are inexplicable The only explanation we can offer for the sustained loss Dr Calbet says is that the men were inspired by their hypercompressed success to change their lifestyles The men moved more and ate less than before
