Theres a growing body of evidence linking elevated blood sugar to memory problems For instance earlier this year a   published in the   concluded that higher glucose may be a risk factor for dementia even among people without type  diabetes So the question is at what point does the risk of cognitive decline set in Or in other words should we be aware of creeping blood sugar even before it gets to levels that doctors call   Well researchers writing this week in the journal   have some new data that suggest that even modest increases in blood sugar among people in their s s and s can have a negative influence on memory The   included  healthy older people all of whom had blood sugar in the normal range All of the participants were given recall tests where they were read a list of  words and then asked to repeat back as many as they could remember The researchers found that if a persons hemoglobin AC the   is a common blood test that reflects a persons average blood sugar level over a twotothree month period went from  percent which is in the normal range up to  percent which is edging closer to what doctors classify as   this was associated with recalling fewer words This association suggests the effect isnt huge But researchers says its significant So whats actually happening in the brain when blood sugar levels are chronically elevated Study author Agnes Floel of Charite University Medicine in Berlin says there may be a couple of things at play Its possible that blood vessel effects can damage memory Elevated blood sugar levels damage small and large vessels in the brain leading to decreased blood and nutrient flow to brain cells explains Floel Another explanation Elevated blood sugar may impair the functioning of brain areas like the hippocampus a structure particularly relevant for memory Floel says When youre making a decision or trying to retrieve information from your memory the hippocampus requires a lot of glucose explains Gail Musen of the Joslin Diabetes Center But when glucose levels rise in the body it may lead to a disruption in the transport of glucose through the bloodbrain barrier to the hippocampus And this may impact the integrity of the hippocampus according to the findings of the new study So it seems that when blood sugar in the body rises it may be more difficult to get that glucose to the hippocampus Musen explains We should point out that its possible for blood sugar to go dangerously low a condition known as   This is most commonly an issue for people being treated for diabetes with insulin So what can we do to help control blood sugar and keep it in the healthy range What we eat is important Consuming a diet rich in fiber vegetables fruit fish and wholegrain products is recommended Floel wrote to us in an email And theres exercise too Exercising regularly is absolutely associated with lower blood sugars on average and its also associated with brain health says   of the University of Washington
