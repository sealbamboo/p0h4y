Childhood fractures are common especially among boys Even so the injuries are rarely treated correctly in emergency rooms new research shows The most frequent problem is the splint  the combination of fabric wrap and rigid material used to stabilize a broken bone A pediatric orthopedic team at the University of Maryland School of Medicine examined the splinting technique used in  young patients who averaged  years old In  percent of the cases the injury had been wrapped improperly   at the American Academy of Pediatrics conference in San Diego The orthopedic team found that often the splints were too tight or that an elastic bandage mistakenly was applied directly to the skin the study said As a result researchers saw swollen fingers blisters and skin ulcers Sometimes children experienced pain far from the site of the fracture because incorrect splinting had put pressure on nerves In half the cases the splints were the wrong size  either too long or too short That meant bones were either too immobilized or insufficiently supported The splinting mistakes did not result in major complications that required surgery but the issue nonetheless should be addressed said Joshua M Abzug the studys lead author and a pediatric orthopedist and assistant professor at University of Maryland I still feel strongly that this is not acceptable Dr Abzug said Theres a proper way to do a splint and even if there are minor complications doctors and health care workers should do everything in our power to avoid them Mininder Kocher a pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Boston Childrens Hospital and a professor of orthopedic surgery at Harvard Medical School said the results of the Maryland study were unfortunately not surprising It mirrors what we see he said A lot of splints are applied incorrectly An   get a fracture at least once by the age of  although some researchers estimate the percentage of fractures among children is even higher Despite the pervasiveness of childhood fractures Dr Kocher said pediatricians receive minimal training in how to apply splints Theres a disconnect between what theyre getting in training and what they need to do in their practice he said Pediatricians usually decline to put splints on their patients instead sending children for Xrays and referring them to an orthopedist In the latest study children arrived at the pediatric orthopedic clinic after being referred from dozens of different emergency rooms or urgent care centers around the state Dr Abzug said The most common cause for the injuries he said was children falling and then landing on outstretched hands The team members photographed the incorrectly wrapped splints noted the injuries and provided appropriate care Both Dr Abzug and Dr Kocher emphasized the importance of better training for emergency room personnel who see these injuries including residents emergency room physicians nurse practitioners and cast technicians Dr Abzug is developing posters about the correct placement of splints which he hopes will be widely distributed in emergency rooms and urgent care centers
