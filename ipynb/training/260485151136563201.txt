With all the attention on     and   outbreaks lately its worth remembering that regular old cardiovascular disease is still the number one   in the US Cancer is close behind at number two lower respiratory diseases are a very distant third So its encouraging that the most recent results of an biennial survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show a substantial increase in the number of Americans who have their hypertension which is a big risk factor for cardiovascular disease under control More than  percent of adults who had high blood pressure are effectively managing it compared with just  percent ten years ago The CDC defines under control blood pressure as being below  on average Its heading in the right direction Vicki Burt one of the CDC statisticians who analyzed the survey results tells Shots We still have a lot of room for increasing the control rates But this is optimistic improvement in the last decade The survey called the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey or   stopped short of identifying a specific cause for this uptick But it did note that the number of hypertensive Americans who are on blood pressure medication increased by almost  percent over the past decade This isnt surprising as pharmaceutical companies have rolled out a bevy of new treatments  like       and others Burt says this variety gives doctors the option of prescribing low doses of several drugs rather than a high dose of one drug which she says reduces the likelihood of negative side effects And judging from the survey results it looks like doctors are doing just that The number of hypertension patients taking more than one blood pressure medication increased by almost  percent over the past decade Of course taking more drugs isnt always a great option for people with hypertension Aside from their potential side effects taking medication for a long period of time can be costly Burt says overall the survey results are encouraging but shouldnt necessarily be cause for celebration First of all if  percent of hypertension patients have their blood pressure under control that means   Second Burt says it was puzzling that only a third of the hypertension patients the CDC surveyed were taking diuretic drugs when those drugs are the recommended firstline medication to combat high blood pressure And finally Burt says though its good news that more people are getting their hypertension under control wed like to see more people prevent their hypertension But thats more difficult The CDCs findings were published today in the journal
