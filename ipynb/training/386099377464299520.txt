A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of virtual babies is set to launch in the US by December New York startup   will initially focus on donor sperm simulating before pregnancy how the genetic sequence of a female client might combine with those of different males Donors that more often produce digital children with a higher risk of inherited disorders will be filtered out leaving those who are better genetic matches Everything happens in a computer but experts have raised ethical questions We are just in the business right now of giving prospective mothers who are using donor sperm to conceive a filtered catalogue of donors based on their own underlying genetic profile Genepeeks cofounder Anne Morriss told BBC News We are filtering out the donor matches with an elevated risk of rare recessive paediatric conditions Ms Morriss an entrepreneur gave a presentation on the company at the Consumer Genetics Conference in Boston last week  She was motivated in part by her own experience of starting a family Her son was conceived with a sperm donor who happened to share with Morriss the gene for an inherited disorder called MCADD MCADD mediumchain acylCoA dehydrogenase deficiency prevents those affected from converting fats to sugar It can be fatal if it is not diagnosed early Luckily in Ms Morrisss case the condition was picked up in newborn screening tests  My son has a pretty normal life Ms Morriss said but about  of children with rare genetic diseases dont make it past the age of five Genepeeks has formalised a partnership with a sperm bank  the Manhattan Cryobank  and has a patent pending on the DNA screening technology  The startup benefits from the rapid pace of change in genetic technology  Indeed six months ago Genepeeks founders decided it was able to use a superior system for DNA analysis called targeted exon sequencing than the one originally envisaged  a result says Anne Morriss of falling costs and increased flexibility For couples planning babies other companies already screen one or both partners for genes that could cause disease if combined with a similar variant  socalled carrier screening One academic who studies the use of genetic technology commented This is like that but ramped up  times Ms Morrisss business partner Prof Lee Silver a geneticist and expert on bioethics at Princeton University New Jersey told BBC News We get the DNA sequence from two prospective parents We simulate the process of reproduction forming virtual sperm and virtual eggs We put them together to form a hypothetical child genome Then we can look at that hypothetical genome and  with all the tools of modern genetics  determine the risk that the genome will result in a child with disease Were looking directly for disease and not carrier status For each pair of people that were going to analyse we make  hypothetical children   The process will be run for the client and each potential donor one by one scanning for some  known singlegene recessive conditions In this way the highestrisk pairings can be filtered out Anne Morriss added At this stage our clients wont be receiving any genetic information back Were very much focused on the practical utility of helping prospective parents who want to protect their future kids giving them the option of additional analysis to what is currently being offered in the industry But the companys founders have plans to expand the screening beyond singlegene recessive disorders to more complex conditions in which multiple genes play a part  Indeed going to the trouble of simulating thousands of digital children deliberately lays the ground for this Its impossible to get towards an accurate risk calculation in any other way said Anne Morriss And in   Prof Silver says My hope for the future is that any people who want to have a baby can use this technology to greatly reduce the risk of disease being expressed in their child  To some such a prospect might appear like a step towards designer babies  until now the preserve of science fiction literature and films such as Gattaca which envisaged a future of genetic haves and havenots  Bioethicists approached by the BBC said Genepeeks was a logical outcome of the increasing demand for more information when making reproductive decisions  However some raised potential concerns about risk communication and the expansion of screening beyond rare singlegene disorders But they suggested there were few if any regulatory barriers One ethicist told BBC News The biggest question for me just from the outset is the understanding of uncertainty Even people who have been doing genomics for years still have a hard time figuring out exactly what a risk for a particular genetic predisposition really means for a family Geneenvironment interactions can lead to people either having disease or not having disease Dr Ewan Birney associate director of the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton UK echoed the point Its good that theyre focusing on the carrier status of these rare Mendelian disorders where its potentially more clearcut That said these things are more complex than they first seem he said Im sure the scientists appreciate that complexity But when transmitting that complexity to everyday people these things can sound more absolute than they really are He added The thing I would want to stress here is just how complex this is Its great that people are thinking of using this technology in lots of different ways but our knowledge gap is very large Risk communication to clients was said Anne Morriss absolutely critical to anyone in this industry  We have to be crystal clear about what were testing for what risks were helping to reduce that theres no guarantee you wont give birth to a sick child she said Prof Mildred Cho associate director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics in California raised questions over whether the sperm donor should also receive information about their genome gleaned from the screening process Unlike hair colour occupation or family history  those are things presumably the donor already knows  the thing thats different about this that I see is it could create information that the donor doesnt already have It also has implications for the donors other biological family members Prof Cho told BBC News  that Californiabased consumer genetics company andMe had submitted the patent on a DNA analysis tool for planning a child
