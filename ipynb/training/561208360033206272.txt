Being a vegan would be relatively easy if I just had a talented personal chef Short of that a budget for eating out all the time would work too Since I decided to eat a vegan diet for the month of January Ive eaten in some places I had not tried before  eating out is part of the research right Theres no need to be stuck in a burger cafe ordering the bun and condiments There are plenty of naturally vegan dishes on menus these days many chefs are having a field day using vegetables in creative ways Matthew Kenney for example has classical training but the owner of the raw food restaurant MAKE said After many years as a traditional chef my desire and passion for health took precedence So I took my passion for cooking and my passion for health and put them together He is opening a restaurant this spring Plant Food and Wine in Venice that will serve a vegan menu of cooked and raw foods using he said by phone a lot of modernist techniques being used in fine dining establishments around the world Many diners he said even if they are not eating vegetarian are eating more consciously by which he means more conscious about the effects of their food choices on their health the environment and on animals The diets of those people might be called plantbased  which people are using when they dont exclude all animal products from their diets but tend to eat few of them  maybe eggs for Sunday brunch or ice cream occasionally Last year Kenney said he had a course tasting menu at Noma a restaurant in Copenhagen considered by many as one of the worlds best and most of the courses were vegetarian Like other chefs Kenney is not trying to recreate meat dishes without meat Instead he said he is taking the ingredients available to him and creating from there At MAKE that means with dehydrators slicers extractors and other equipment But raw is a step further than my path The   that lists vegan and vegetarian restaurants turned up  vegan ones in LA  from cafes in food stores to full on special occasion restaurants such as Crossroads where chef Tal Ronnen makes diners happy no matter their usual grocery list A few chefs suggested that vegans can ask any chef to accommodate them Many will like the creative challenge Or for a simpler solution Order a salad with an olive oil dressing ask for food cooked in oil rather than butter Suggest other simple changes such as leaving off the cheese Here are a few spots Ive tried and liked both vegan and veganfriendly I still have a pretty long list of others to sample Gadarene Swine in Studio City Sage and Crossroads at the top of the list and Id love to here your ideas by email or   on Twitter  on Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood has a beautiful dining garden and a fun cocktail menu that includes alcoholic icy drinks From the people who own Caf Gratitude its an organic Mexican menu with entrees under  and no attitude The nopales salad and taco trio were serious hits at my table  Melrose Ave West Hollywood      on Sunset Boulevard in Echo Park served some of the best Brussels sprouts ever Its mostly vegan menu also has cauliflower wings vegan blue cheese celery and hot sauce The food and drink are locally sourced and the soaring space is appealing Pizzas and salads too  W Sunselt Blvd      a few locations including La Cienega Boulevard north of the Beverly Center The service was slightly ditzy the night ate with two friends but the food made up for it RFD is a regular favorite of all the vegans I asked Burgers salads bowls and other options  N La Cienega Blvd   and other locations   a fastfood chain that blends convenience and vegetables Salads sandwiches etc Locations in Califoria Oregon and Washington   One of the many Ethiopian restaurants clustered on Fairfax Boulevard between Pico and Olympic Rahel serves traditional dishes but the food is all vegan and all delicious Its a cozy spot and not expensive  S Fairfax Ave      With three locations M Cafe is a macrobiotic restaurant so theres fish The opening chef Lee Gross got classical training as well as macrobiotic training before cooking for celebrities That experience led to the M Cafe dishes California cuisine with a Japanese underpinning is how Gross still a consulting chef to the restaurants described it on a recent visit to LA M Caf has breakfast and a kids menu  Melrose Ave Hollywood   plus locations in Beverly Hills and Brentwood  Melrose Ave Hollywood
