A genetic susceptibility that gives a tenfold increased risk of developing type  diabetes has been discovered The gene mutation found in the population of Greenland will give clues to the different causes of the condition say Danish scientists The research published in   adds to evidence genetics plays a role in the chances of developing diabetes  Other factors included lifestyle with obesity and a bad diet increasing risks said a diabetes charity  Several susceptibility genes have been linked with diabetes meaning that if an individual is carrying one of these genes they face a greater risk of developing diabetes Danish researchers say the new mutation is present in almost one in five of Greenlanders But Prof Torben Hansen of the University of Copenhagen said it was not found in other European Chinese or AfricanAmerican populations suggesting type  diabetes has multiple causes The gene variation raised the risk of type  diabetes by up to ten times he told BBC News We have identified a new and novel type  diabetes gene with a huge increased risk due to insulin resistance in muscle he added Type  diabetes is not just one disease its many diseases In the long term this kind of research could help provide new ways to prevent and treat the condition said Richard Elliott research communications manager at    Until we know more maintaining a healthy weight by eating a healthy balanced diet and enjoying regular physical activity is the best way to prevent type  diabetes he said Greenlanders are a historically small and isolated population  established by a very small number of individuals The island has undergone a rapid transformation from a traditional hunting and fishing society to a modern lifestyle with an increasing rate of Western diseases Type  diabetes was once very rare on the island but it has increased dramatically in the past  years Prof Torben Hansen and colleagues screened for genetic links to type  diabetes in  people living in Greenland  They discovered that a mutation in a gene called TBCD  present in  of the population studied increased risk  The effects are several times larger than any previous findings Unlike other mutations that have been found it causes problems with the regulation of blood sugar levels after eating
