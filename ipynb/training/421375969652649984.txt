But a constant companion on Seniors ride was alcohol Back in the day I kinda started early drinking and getting high he says If drinking was in the Olympics I would have been a gold medalist   But he also says he thought he would grow out of what he now recognizes as addiction That didnt happen   What it does is it gets progressively worse and I think that I finally got to the point where it kinda just took over my life completely he says  Teutul says theres a long history of alcoholism in his family My uncle was an alcoholic my mother was an alcoholic And you know  most of them died from that Eventually he realized everything he had built was at risk if things didnt change I was fortunate  in  I was running a business I had a small wielding shop and I just got lucky he says I went to a step program and then I just kept going Just because he stopped drinking however didnt mean his buddies did Its tough when youre not drinking and youve got two people on either side of you in a truck knocking down shots of Black Velvet whiskey and drinking beers and youre in the middle It wasnt easy he says For nine years straight he was afraid to miss a meeting It did take me two years before I wasnt thirsty anymore He says he doesnt go to meetings these days and that he never feels like drinking But Teutul says given his past experience he will not drink again Senior just celebrated  years of sobriety which he describes as quite the trip When you get sober you put things in play and they happen he says You think a lot clearer Your whole attitude changes you kinda learn how to live all over again which is a tough thing by itself And its a message he continues to share  My lifes an open book says Teutul I know people that had problems and I think that Ive been a power of example to them Ive heard from people that theyve turned their lives around from me sharing my experience so its all good I dont have a problem with sharing anything
