People who jogged or ran for as little as five minutes a day reduced their risk of premature death by nearly onethird and extended their lives by about three years according to a new study Researchers examined the exercise habits of more than  adults in the Dallas area who were monitored for six to  years About  of the adults described themselves as runners Compared to those who didnt run those who did were  less likely to die of any cause during the course of the study They were also  less likely to die as a result of cardiovascular disease   Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology These figures were adjusted to take into account peoples smoking and drinking habits how old they were when they enrolled in the study their familys health history and their other exercise habits Put another way nonrunners were  more likely than runners to die during the study period In fact the mortality risk associated with not running was greater than the mortality risk associated with being overweight or obese  having a family history of cardiovascular disease  or having high cholesterol  The researchers divided up the roughly  runners into five groups based on how many minutes they ran per week Those in the lowest group ran up to  minutes over a sevenday period and those in the highest group ran for more than  minutes over the course of a week But the benefits of running were pretty much the same for all runners according to the study Running even at lower doses or slower speeds was associated with significant mortality benefits the researchers found They also measured running in other ways  by total weekly distance frequency speed and the total amount of running which was calculated by multiplying duration and speed In all categories even the runners in the lowest groups were less likely to die during the study than the nonrunners In order to reduce the risk of premature death all it took was  to  minutes of running per week the researchers calculated This finding has clinical and public health importance according to the team from Iowa State University the University of South Carolina Louisiana State University and the University of Queensland School of Medicine Because time is one of the strongest barriers to participate in physical activity this study may motivate more people to start running and continue to run as an attainable health goal for mortality benefits they wrote People who cant devote  or  minutes to moderate physical activity each day may appreciate the efficiency of a fiveminute run they added If all of the nonrunners had taken up running  of the  deaths that occurred during the study could have been averted the researchers wrote That would have saved  lives Its not clear that the findings of this study would apply to the nation as a whole Most of the adults who were tracked were collegeeducated middleclass or uppermiddleclass whites However the researchers noted that the physiological characteristics of the study participants were similar to those of samples that are more diverse In   that was published alongside the study researchers from Taiwan urged doctors to use this information to motivate their patients to exercise even if its only for a few minutes a day It is important to promote exercise by stressing the potential harm of inactivity they wrote Warn patients that inactivity can lead to a  increase in heart disease and a  increase in cardiovascular disease mortality not to mention a  increase in the incidence of cancer diabetes and untold depression Three of the editorials four authors worked on a  Lancet study that found that even   could extend a persons life expectancy Both that study and the new study are good news to the sedentary Exercise is a miracle drug in many ways they wrote in the editorial The list of diseases that exercise can prevent delay modify progression of or improve outcomes for is longer than we currently realize The study was funded in part by CocaCola Co which has   the role of physical inactivity in the nations obesity crisis The National Institutes of Health helped pay for the study as well
