A campaign urging people with a persistent cough to see their doctor has led to a dramatic rise in lung cancer diagnoses figures show The campaign which ran in England last year said people should go to their GP if they had had a cough for more than three weeks An estimated  extra patients were diagnosed with lung cancer around the time of the campaign Lung cancer accounts for more than a fifth of all deaths from cancer Public Health Englands Be Clear On Cancer campaign supported by Cancer Research UK NHS England and the Department of Health ran in May and June   The number of people diagnosed with lung cancer in MayJuly  was   just over  higher than the  in the same period in  And around  more patients had their lung cancer picked up at an early stage improving their chances of survival Surgery which improves the chances of surviving the disease was offered to  more patients than in  Dr Harpal Kumar chief executive of Cancer Research UK said It is great news that this campaign has raised awareness of lung cancer symptoms among those most at risk of the disease  By acting quickly if you notice a possible symptom you can give yourself the best chance of survival  In many cases it wont be cancer but it is better to be sure and if it is cancer to detect it earlier rather than later Sean Duffy national clinical director for cancer at NHS England said  Until recently a lung cancer patient in Sweden was nearly  more likely to survive their disease for at least five years than if they lived in England  So I am therefore delighted that this new set of figures shows that the Be Clear On Cancer campaign has helped speed up our progress in lung cancer survival with hundreds of patients receiving potentially lifesaving surgery as a result of this campaign It is hoped the campaign will run again next year Dr Penny Woods chief executive of the British Lung Foundation said the initial results from the campaign were encouraging But she added Naturally we wont know for sure until subsequent years whether this impact will be a lasting one But these very positive early indications seem to confirm that such awareness campaigns can make real tangible differences to peoples lives She added The findings tentatively suggest that we might finally be turning a corner in tackling a disease that has been killing too many for too long
