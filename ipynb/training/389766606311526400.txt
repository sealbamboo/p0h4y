The health minister has said that if he broke the ministerial code over a ban on gay men giving blood in Northern Ireland he did it unwittingly On Friday Belfast High Court ruled Edwin Poots did not have the power to retain a lifetime ban The judge also ruled he had breached Stormonts ministerial code by failing to take the issue before the Executive  Mr Poots said the retention of the lifetime ban in NI was based on sexual behaviour and not sexual orientation  My priority as health minister is the safety of blood continuity in the supply of safe blood and public confidence in the safety of blood he added The DUP minister said the judge had found it was unlikely there was bias on his part and the lifetime ban was now a matter for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt Mr Poots was responding to an urgent question raised in the assembly by Kieran McCarthy of the Alliance Party who called on the minster to apologise and lift the ban The UK ban on gay men donating blood was put in place during the s However in November  it was lifted in England Scotland and Wales and replaced by new rules that allow blood from men whose last sexual contact with another man was more than a year ago  Mr Poots maintained the ban in Northern Ireland on the basis of ensuring public safety but after a gay man brought a judicial review challenge a High Court judge held on Friday that the decision to continue the lifetime ban was irrational On Monday Mr Poots told the Northern Ireland Assembly Assembly It is a matter for the department of health in England to decide what it wants to do next The judge believes it is a decision for Jeremy Hunt Jeremy Hunt didnt believe it was but obviously the judge is contradicting the department of health in England and its a matter for the department of health to take whatever action it believes it should His party colleague First Minister Peter Robinson said the ruling had ramifications for the Stormont Executive and for the department of health in London  The DUP leader said there was a question over the constitutionality of his party colleagues decision that would have to be examined  However he cautioned against the suggestion that all decisions should go before the Executive  In answer to a question from Sinn Fins Ian Milne about the judges ruling that Mr Poots had breached the ministerial code by failing to take the issue before the Stormont Executive Mr Robinson said there would be major difficulties in having every decision brought to them He said it was important that major decisions came before the Executive but said no minister had asked for the blood ban to be discussed When pressed again by Mr Milne if he accepted and agreed with the ruling Mr Robinson jokingly said Are you trying to get me into trouble The first minister added I think those are obviously matters that can be considered by those from a legal background  If a department does not agree with it then it can appeal that judgement  In terms of the ministerial code I had been more content and felt that the Lord Chief Justices ruling on that matter was a sensible judgement in that he indicated if there was a controversial or significant matter then it would be raised at the Executive committee  That meant that only if you like the nuclear issues would start coming  to the Executive rather than every single issue  Because if every single issue is brought to the Executive then there is no minister in this house who would be able to take a decision on their own  theyre all going to have to come through the Executive committee  So before people start cheering to the rafters about this issue they should think about the ramifications of the judgement
