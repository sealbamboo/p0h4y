Here are five ways you can ensure that you hang on to your teeth as you age Dentistry today has taken a much more conservative approach But it can be hard to know what your options are Here are some key points that you should know about dental treatment  Small cavities can be recalcified Strong doses of fluoride or something called MI Paste applied directly to small cavities can actually recalcify or rebuild the enamel removing the need for a filling  That said the key to recalcification is early detection Regular dental visits are crucial to early detection  Fillings crowns or any dental restoration should be replaced or heavily scrutinized every eight years Some patients are of the if it aint broke dont fix it era But the reasoning behind this advice is to eliminate the spread of recurrent cavities that lurk under dental restorations   The longer you wait to replace dental restorations the more problems you can run into If the decay spreads undetected it may eat up too much healthy tooth structure and need the support of a crown or reach the nerve and need a root canal    Make sure your children are getting fluoride treatments until at least the age of   Kids especially consume a lot of sugar which breaks down into a biproduct of acid that erodes teeth quickly causing cavities  Fluoride is a great treatment in rebuilding enamel and neutralizing those acids In dentistry the electric toothbrush has been one of the biggest advances in home dental care Ninetynine percent of patients dont really know how to brush with a manual brush and more important dont brush for the full two minutes needed  Electric toothbrushes remove the confusion and have a timer to ensure that the full brushing is done at each session Improper brushing can lead to plaque buildup swollen gums cavities and overall poor oral health The sonic brushes remove plaque and get into hardtoreach places like in between teeth and under the gums to ensure a healthy mouth Grinders can wear away a millimeter of tooth structure per year if undiagnosed  Clenchers may not see any immediate signs of wear on their teeth but the pressure that clenching puts on your teeth is destructive It slowly breaks down the supporting bone around the teeth leading to gum recession bone loss and inevitably tooth loss  If you feel that you may fall into either of these categories you should be wearing a night guard It may not be sexy but its much sexier than missing teeth Today there has been a lot of money and research into better oral care products But understand that there is an actual regimen of toothpaste mouth rinse and extracare products thats right for you   The first step is defining what type of patient you are  I like to break it down into four basic types cavityprone sensitive stainers and those with bad gums You can ask your dentist which category you fall into Each product in the sea of dental products in the drugstore has key ingredients tailored for each category of patient Using the right oral care products can make a big difference in the longevity of your teeth Fortunately  or unfortunately  your dentist has a lot to do with the preservation of your teeth  Make sure your dentist is up on all current research and his office is updated and stateoftheart but most important make sure your dentist is taking time and looking after you It sounds simple but its probably the most important item on your checklist
