 magazine editor Scott Stossel has countless phobias and anxieties  some youve heard of others you probably havent Theres a vast encyclopedia of fears and phobias he tells  s Terry Gross and pretty much any object experience situation you can think of there is someone who has a phobia of it Stossels own fears include turophobia a fear of cheese asthenophobia a fear of fainting and claustrophobia His new book   is both a memoir and a history of how medicine philosophy and the pharmaceutical industry have dealt with anxiety Stossel says he wrote the book to help him understand and find relief from  or redemption in  anxious suffering Hes a very highfunctioning anxious person and in fact before this book most of his colleagues were unaware of his problems The fear of vomiting which for me is one of the most original and most acute of my fears is actually fairly common Emetophobia its called and by some estimates its the fifth most common specific phobia  There are these online communities where these people seek each other out Both in terms of the duration of the time that Ive suffered from it and its intermittent acuteness its the emetophobia that causes the most suffering It infects  many of my other fears For instance the fear of vomiting it makes me afraid of travel because Im afraid Ill vomit far from home It makes me afraid of flying not for the conventional reason that Im afraid that the plane will crash although I also have that but Im afraid Ill get motion sick and get nauseous  The fear of germs is obviously directly tied to that The horrible kind of selffulfilling vicious cycle of emetophobia is that if youre prone to acute anxiety and nervousness as I am it often manifests itself with stomach symptoms  I havent vomited since   March   With the rational part of my brain I realize how completely irrational this is I mean the amount of time since I was  years old that Ive spent worrying about something  that Ive spent  percent of the last  some odd years   it makes no sense I know it makes no sense and yet here I am A lot of times I can talk myself into whats known as limited symptom panic attack where Ill have some of the symptoms whether Im sweating or having a little bit of stomach distress or what have you but I can kind of keep myself from going into the fullblown allconsuming mindhijackedbypanic I can do that with selftalk and armed with the knowledge that I have about how panic attacks work Some people say that in stressful situations I can seem unflappable and I think thats partly because Im always kind of internally flapped And so  when theres actually something real to be concerned about its actually less anxietyprovoking than these irrational things Its also fairly typical  of certain kinds of anxietydisorder sufferers particularly people with panic disorder they are exceptionally good at hiding it Theyre able to convey an impression of competence calmness and confidence which is maybe substantially real  but theres an internal fear  The gap between that and this faade where people see you as competent and effective  youre always afraid of being exposed which is in itself anxietyproducing One of my more recent therapists calls this phenomenon impression management Impression management is not only a symptom of anxiety because youre worried about being exposed but its also a cause because youre constantly worried that the house of cards that is your outward image  is going to come crashing down The family tree is sort of stippled with people who have anxiety which is quite common in the literature In my research not just in my own family  Ive come to the conclusion that there is a rather large genetic component to ones underlying temperament That doesnt mean that youre doomed to grow up to have an anxiety disorder or be nervous all the time but you will be disproportionately prone to developing an anxiety disorder Nothing is ever purely genetic There are identical twins one of whom will develop panic disorder and the other one is much more likely to develop panic disorder than a random person in the population but theyre not guaranteed to do it which is sort of proof that it cant be wholly genetic because they have the same genome
