Halloween is the time to indulge those seemingly pathological cravings to get scared out of your skull Who in their right mind would subject themselves to bloodsplattery horror movies or haunted houses blaring highpitched screams while serving bowls of grapes dressed as slimy edible eyeballs Lots of us and experts say good can actually come from these predilections People think being afraid is a bad thing but the reason we evolved to be afraid is that the world is pretty dangerous and weve evolved very powerful systems that automatically force us to do our natural defensive and protective behaviors says Michael Fanselow a UCLA behavioral neuroscientist Some fears are learned others are encoded in our DNA Rotting flesh were looking at you zombies snakes blood heights  even our tinybrained ancestors understood these were unsafe And the fear prompted immediate responses Fanselow says A headless horseman likely wont decapitate you on Sunset Boulevard and its doubtful a goblin will eat your liver for dinner but Fanselow suggests that like the original Grimms Fairy Tales scary films are a tutorial to beware of actual threats Watching horror movies you have more control your automatic fear responses are still strong but not completely taking over so what we learn is more how to face and deal with our fears Fanselow says If you know youre going into a dangerous environment like a combat situation its good to have a lot of training and experiences that are similar but arent quite so dangerous so we learn to behave adaptively Female moviegoers may enjoy horror or slasher films featuring a final girl character  the last female character to survive She confronts and often kills the murderer or villain says Martha Lauzen executive director of the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film Sixty percent of the Paranormal Activity  audience was younger than  and half was female Lionsgate exit polling showed the audience for the gory Saw D was just  male And for Saw IV  were female Stanford professor of communication James T Hamilton author of Channeling Violence The Economic Market for Violent Television Programming isnt surprised I found in my research men  to  were the largest consumers of violence but next were women  to  he says A major brain area driving the fear response is the amygdala and its usually the prefrontal cortex that allows reaction control Risktaking spikes in teenage years and early adulthood when people have to face dealing with dangers on their own The brain changes physically when we learn and young adulthood is when the parts of our brain that provoke and control our fears need experiences in order to learn and come into balance Fanselow says Arousing situations whether joyful or frightful juice up the brain says Joseph LeDoux a neuroscientist and director of New York Universitys Emotional Brain Institute and author of The Emotional Brain Horror movies energize the system Hearts pump faster blood pressure rises and dopamine releases as does norepinephrine which readies the body for flightorfight response and endorphins which kill pain Fanselow says But experts agree that childrens brains are too vulnerable for scary movies And some adults are vulnerable too There have been case reports of people having stress symptoms after watching The Exorcist  says Richard J McNally a Harvard psychology professor But these folks already had histories of mental disorders and thus were vulnerable And many people want nothing to do with Halloween frights Genetics epigenetics upbringing and all the other individual experiences theyve had probably all contribute LeDoux says Its a matter of degree
