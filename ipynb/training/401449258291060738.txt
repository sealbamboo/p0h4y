Im by no means a glutenfree girl and not much of an expert when it comes to glutenfree cooking But Thanksgiving is coming up and what is Thanksgiving without pie Since many of you may be stuck when it comes to pies and glutenfree family members and guests I decided to tackle a glutenfree pie crust this week  I know there are probably readymade crusts out there and there is plenty of glutenfree flour mix on the market but I have yet to find a glutenfree all purpose flour that doesnt taste like bean flour and that just doesnt work for me  After a few false starts I finally came up with a whole grain crust that held together well and did not have a chalky texture Rather than use the combination of  percent potato starch or cornstarch and  percent whole grain flour that I use in other baked goods I used a combination of fine cornmeal or corn flour oat flour and a small amount of almond flour The oat flour was the key  it has a wonderful flavor and a fine starchy texture but its not chalky You do have to check that it is processed in a facility that does not process wheat however Bobs Red Mill is a good source Once I had the crust down I made pies  pumpkin apple pear and sweet potato Now I cant wait until Thanksgiving so I can make them all over again 
  After much trial and error a pie dough thats delicious and glutenfree 
  A pie that is sweet with spices but not too sugary 
  Caramelized apples are baked into a delicious desert  Poaching the pears until they are just tender results in a delicious fruit tart 
  An untraditional flan that is irresistibly creamy
