Hooper and his husband of five years adopted their daughter Savannah last fall Although they are not biologically related Hooper says it was love at first sight Hooper is one of a growing number of fathers who are acting as primary caregivers for their children with or without maternal involvement The number of stayathome dads has doubled since  to  million in  according to Pew Research Center Singlefather homes are also on the rise  of homes are now headed by a single father up from  in  Our brains are ready for this cultural shift researchers say Scientists from Bar Ilan University in Israel   showing that the brains of dads who are highly engaged in their infants lives are activated in the same way mothers brains are during pregnancy This maternal neural network allows mothers to react quickly and instinctively to their childs needs  Theres something really strong that makes mothers bond with the infant right when theyre born said lead researcher Ruth Feldman a professor of psychology at Bar Ilan University and an adjunct professor at Yale University Fathers need a little more work for that to happen Feldmans study is the largest on the parental brain to date with more than  mothers and fathers participating in the research Feldman and her team wanted to find out how our brains operate differently as parents and more specifically how mens brains are altered in response to fatherhood  Researchers know from previous studies that the amygdala becomes highly active in mothers after giving birth What they didnt know was if  and if so how  fathers brains change Feldman studied three groups of parents heterosexual primary caregiving mothers heterosexual secondary caregiving fathers and homosexual primary caregiving fathers The researchers videotaped the parents playing with their children at home and later played the videos back to the parents while they were in an MRI tube along with videos of other infants to compare the brain responses  The researchers found that the brains of primary caregivers and secondary caregivers showed different responses while the parents watched videos of their infants  The brains of the primary caregiving mothers demonstrated a strong response in the amygdala which regulates emotional reactions and allows mothers to bond quickly with their newborn Secondary caregiving fathers brains on the other hand showed a strong response in the neural network that regulates social cognitive processing However in the primary caregiving fathers  the  homosexual fathers who were parenting without maternal involvement  the researchers discovered that both paternal and maternal networks were activated In other words these primary caregiving fathers demonstrated a brain response similar to mothers who had carried their babies to term through pregnancy yet also showed brain responses similar to those of secondary caregivers Amongst all fathers both primary and secondary caregivers time spent taking care of their child correlated with greater amygdala activation  It shows that the amygdala can be sensitized through months of pregnancy but also through active parenting Feldman said Fathers brains seem to be particularly plastic As societal norms continue to evolve Feldman and others say the definition of what it means to be a father is rapidly changing A mothers role in child rearing has been fairly consistent across cultures and throughout history Feldman says while fathers involvement has varied widely More than anything fathers are now playing a greater role in rearing their offspring a relatively recent development in Western society  Its a fascinating shift said James Morris an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Virginia  who studies the neurobiological basis of social functions  We can now study parenting without a female being involved which is a relatively new phenomenon in nature he said Its well known that neurobiological changes will happen when you become a mother but we dont know this for males Morris emphasized that scientists didnt need brain imaging to confirm that fathers can be fantastic primary caretakers  That said the study is important because the neurobiological processes underlying parenting behavior are not well understood he said  Morris however cautioned against drawing conclusions based on the differences between the gay men in the study and their heterosexual secondary caregiving counterparts   Gay male fathers were used as test subjects  because researchers wanted to see what happens to fathers brains when there are no mothers around not because these men were homosexual The differences found between men in this study cannot necessarily be attributed to the fact that one group is gay Morris said in an email These findings might be useful when considering other social dynamics like situations where fathers may take more of a primary role in parenting than has been considered traditional in the past Although Morris praised the study as wellgrounded he also questioned its strong distinction between the socalled maternal pathway and paternal pathway The distinction is probably much looser than that he said  I would say there are probably some interesting differences between males and females but I dont know if we could say that one group is more emotional than the other or more cognitive than the other Morris said  Morris added that to further perfect the study researchers would need to perform the tests before and after parents have children to show that these changes occurred after the birth of their child  For now primary caregiving fathers like Hooper say they are heartened by the researchers findings It does thrill me as a parent because I think were doing a pretty nice job raising our little girl Hooper said I love that were having this conversation Researcher Feldman was not particularly surprised by the findings saying she expected to discover some degree of plasticity in the male brain  What was surprising was how neatly and how beautifully these things worked together she said
