If youve ever tried to lose weight youve probably wished you could speed up your metabolism and burn calories more easily Weightloss programs often promise to provide metabolismboosting secrets but the   should know that many of these are just gimmicks Many theories about metabolism are falsely rooted in the idea that there are particular foods or beverages that will magically increase your ability to burn calories While most nutritionists agree that eating meals based on whole grains and lean proteins is a healthy diet practice this approach wont actually help you burn calories faster Neither will fatburning foods like grapefruit or cabbage Unfortunately there isnt a food that we can eat that is going to burn away those excess pounds says Jenna Anding PhD RD of the department of nutrition and food science at Texas AM in College Station Texas Heres the truth about other popular metabolismboosting theories including the one that actually works You may have been told not to eat too close to bedtime because of the theory that your metabolism slows down at night and youll lose less weight than you would if you ate the same food earlier in the day Not true says Donna L Weihofen MS RD health nutritionist at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics in Madison Wisc   whether you eat them in the morning or at night The problem with nighttime eaters is that they are usually eating far more calories than they think and the calories are denser Drinking plenty of water is healthful for a number of reasons but it doesnt make your body burn calories faster It can help you feel full which may keep some cravings at bay But that effect doesnt last very long Weihofen cautions One of the things that does help is soup before a meal A brothtype soup does help cut down on the amount of calories you will eat Of course broth wont speed metabolism either but it will help you stick to your diet plan Some diets recommend eating every couple of hours while others advise sticking to a consistent schedule or number of meals for weightloss success Following a set schedule may help you stick to a diet plan but doesnt help you burn more calories Theres no magic to that explains Weihofen Its whatever fits your lifestyle and your diet Eating breakfast on a regular basis is important for shedding pounds but not solely because it improves your metabolism says Emily Banes RD clinical dietitian at Houston Northwest Medical Center People who eat only one meal a day will shut down their metabolism So   is partly a metabolismbooster and it is partly to make sure you stay on track for the rest of the day notes Banes People who eat breakfast are less likely to binge later in the day which of course promotes weight loss The reality is that there is only one way to enhance metabolism Build more lean muscle mass The best way to increase metabolism is by incorporating physical activity both cardio and weight training to increase lean muscle mass which is what burns the calories advises Dr Anding Even at rest muscle tissue burns more calories than fat Anding says So weightloss programs that encourage strength training and other forms of   to improve your metabolism are your best bet
