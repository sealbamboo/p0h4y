Researchers have some good news for women and their partners  those who are sexually active during middle age are likely to remain sexually active in the coming years That conclusion published online Monday by   is based on survey results of  women who were being followed as part of a study that began in  The study known as Do Stage Transitions Result in Detectable Effects or Stride is intended to track womens health as they experience various stages of menopause Four years into the study  of the participants completed a questionnaire called the   or FSFI A total of  reported that they were sexually active at that time Four years after that these women were asked During the past six months have you engaged in   sexual activities with a partner The question included the italics For  of them the answer was still yes In contrast to prior research we found that most sexually active midlife women remain sexually activeaccording to the researchers four women from the University of Pittsburgh Several factors helped predict whether women were likely to keep their home fires burning Women who reported on the FSFI that sex was moderately quite or extremely important to them were  times more likely to be sexually active four years later than were women who said it was not at all or not very important to them In addition white women were  times more likely than women of other races to remain sexually active as were those who reported a lower body mass index women with higher BMIs were  less likely to keep having sex One factor that did not predict a womans likelihood of remaining sexually active was the quality of her sex life as measured by the FSFI survey That led the researchers to write that midlife women have many reasons for engaging in sex that go beyond quality It also prompted them to note that the FSFI survey was an imperfect way to measure whether women have satisfying sex lives Other studies have found that as women age kissing and intimate touching become more important relative to  intercourse the researchers wrote But the FSFI doesnt ask about those things Therefore it may not accurately reflect what constitutes satisfying sex in this population Which factors separated the twothirds who were sexually active when they took the FSFI survey from the onethird who werent The most striking and perhaps least surprising was whether they considered sex important Among the  women who didnt think it was  were not having it and  were But among the  who said it was important  were having it and only  were not These findings challenge prior assumptions about female sexual function in midlife the researchers concluded As we study and care for these women a more nuanced understanding of female sexuality is essential You might be wondering why its important to study the sex lives of middleage women in the first place If so the researchers have an answer for you To learn more about how to help them achieve a high healthrelated quality of life    and like   on Facebook
