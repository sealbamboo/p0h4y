Researchers used to think that children who started eating fish at an early age were more likely to develop allergies But lately the tide has turned Now scientists suspect that introducing fish at an early age may help protect against allergies Some   that the rising prevalence of allergic diseases may have something to do with a corresponding drop in our consumption of immunestrengthening omega fatty acids Theories abound and no one knows for certain But a number of   show an association between earlier fish intake starting around age  and a lower incidence of allergic diseases Among them was a study last year in   which found a lower prevalence of asthmalike symptoms among children introduced to fish between  and  months  in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition this month followed  children from their first birthdays until they turned  Tests showed that those whose diets included at least two servings of fish monthly were about  percent less likely to have allergy symptoms Though several other studies have yielded similar findings they have all been observational showing only a correlation not cause and effect Some scientists say that early fish consumption may be associated with a lifestyle that lowers the risk of allergic disease in nondietary ways Government   that young children can benefit from eating up to  ounces weekly or roughly two meals of lowmercury fish Studies show a link between early fish consumption and reduced allergies later on but it is not clear what is behind the association
