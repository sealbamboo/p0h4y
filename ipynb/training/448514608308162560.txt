The lack of action to tackle liver disease in the UK is scandalous according to a group of MPs  the allparty Parliamentary Hepatology Group says deaths from liver disease in England have risen  between  It argues continuing complacency is leading to a shameful waste of lives  Liver disease accounts for the fifth highest number of deaths in the UK but is the only one of the major killers that does not have a national strategy David Amess MP who cochairs the Parliamentary Hepatology Group said if the rise in liver disease continues to be ignored then before long every one of us will know somebody with cirrhosis end stage liver disease or liver cancer The main causes of liver disease  alcohol misuse obesity and viral hepatitis  are all preventable The MPs took evidence from liver specialists patients charities and Public Health England for their inquiry  Many patients dont find out they have liver disease until it is too late to reverse the damage Dave Norris from Forest Gate in northeast London said he was devastated to learn last year that he needed a liver transplant Mr Norris  said he had always been overweight but never realised that it might permanently damage his liver I was completely shocked when I was told I had nonalcoholic fatty liver disease  I had Type  diabetes and weighed  kilos nearly  stone but thought you had to be much fatter than that to do such damage to the liver Mr Norris had a liver transplant in November   He is now back at work and says he is taking better care of his health and watching his weight Chris Wilde a retired dentist from Devon nearly died eight years ago as a result of decades of drinkrelated liver damage He suffered massive internal bleeding due to liver malfunction and was told that unless he gave up alcohol he would die Mr Wilde  said I considered myself a social drinker but now realise I was dependent on alcohol  I had two cans of lager and maybe half a bottle of wine each day which was similar to my friends  But it was scarring my liver He gave up alcohol and hopes his story will make others aware of the potential hidden damage they may be doing to themselves through drink Although overall alcohol consumption in the UK has fallen in recent years it has doubled since    Public Health England said the UK was one of the few European countries where drinking levels and alcoholrelated harms are increasing  Among its recommendations the report calls on the government to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol of  pence as recommended by dozens of health organisations It says the UK should introduce universal hepatitis B vaccination and set a clear goal for eliminating hepatitis C within the next  years Prof Graham Foster consultant hepatologist at Barts Health NHS Trust said GPs needed to be far more aware of liver disease   He said blood tests and ultrasound scans could pick up liver disease years before permanent damage was done but far too few were carried out Prof Foster said We need a network of specialist liver centres with firm targets  Part of the problem is that liver disease is lumped together with GI gastrointestinal  Consultants have targets for the number of endoscopies they do and this takes resources and the focus away from liver disease Last year NHS England announced it was not planning to publish a longawaited national liver strategy   Dr Michael Glynn National Clinical Director for GI and Liver Disease at NHS England said Theres no doubt that more needs to be done across the system to address the large areas of liver disease that are preventable and to improve survival rates To do this early detection and prevention is vital NHS England said it would consider the recommendations of the MPs report
