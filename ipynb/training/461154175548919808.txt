The bump on the back of the mouse is the size of a Tic Tac breath mint or possibly a small pea But for Matt Freedman a New York artist grappling with a rare and deadly neck cancer the tiny tumor  his tumor  represents a lastditch hope for a healthy future Freedman  who was diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma in  is among a small but growing group of cancer patients turning to a kind of very personalized medicine in which animals serve as standins to treat human disease Called mouse avatars in some circles  like the virtual characters in online games  the critters are implanted with pieces of tumor harvested from their human counterparts Theyre then propagated to create a colony of animals in which to test drugs and other treatments that would be too aggressive  or take too long  to attempt in a person Right now Im living my life more or less normally and hoping this can happen in parallel said Freedman who has already undergone radiation and chemotherapy to fight the tumors that spread from his tongue and salivary glands to his lungs If a drug does emerge from this it could be more targeted and less toxic he said Its a whole different idea about what a lab rat is Regular lab rats have been used by scientists for decades of course including in experiments in which they were implanted with peoples tumors But now commercial companies like Champions Oncology of Hackensack NJ the firm behind Freedmans mice are offering ordinary patients the chance to tailor their treatments to what works best for them Most patients dont realize that there is no major rhyme or reason for an oncologist who has four or five drugs to use no real test to say we should use this one or that one said Dr Ronnie Morris president and director of Champions where  patients have been implanted since  There are really good reasons for taking the most effective drug early on We certainly cant clone people so the secondbest option is to take the tumor out and let it grow outside the body said Morris an internist But while theres been some success theres limited evidence that treatments tested on personalized mice can help cancer patients live longer experts say In addition the cost of growing and testing the mice sometimes for dozens of potential drugs can climb into the tens of thousands of dollars fees that are not yet covered by health insurance  though that could change The technique does not come without its limitations and pitfalls University of South Florida researchers evaluating avatar therapies wrote in a paper in the journal Cancer Letters last year For one thing it can take months for implanted tumors to take hold and grow  sometimes longer than patients have to live In Freedmans case his tumors were harvested in January and its still not quite clear whether theyve been successfully grafted into the mice Even if they have it probably will be next January before the mice will be ready to test with some four dozen possible drugs Thats one thing that gets lost in the noise said Matts brother Dr Joshua Freedman a California neuropsychologist who helped spur the experiment In order for it to be useful in a person they need a long lead time in mice But for Matt Freedman whose cancer called ACC is so rare it hasnt been studied widely and has no known effective treatment trying the mice made sense Were only trying to get it to work in this one ACC Joshua Freedman said While it used to cost up to  out of pocket for the treatment now patients pay about  to build an avatar and then  per test Morris said Champions is a leader among more than  companies worldwide to offer commercial patientderived tumor xenografts or PDTX Champions is working with about  patients a year now and expects the numbers to grow to between  and  annually said Morris So far theres some evidence that testing cancer treatments in mice first pays off for humans In  patients with rare sarcomas cancer of the connective tissue  successfully engrafted their tumors in mice and identified drug protocols according to Champions researchers reporting in a recent issue of the journal Cancer Six of those patients died before the testing was complete but in  of the remaining  there was a correlation between the results of their tests and their outcome the study found Freedman chronicled the ordeal of radiation and chemotherapy in a new book out Tuesday titled after the description of his slowmoving but lethal cancer Relatively Indolent But Relentless A Cancer Treatment Journal He is feeling better these days off prescription pain medications and back to teaching fine arts at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design Next week hell have his threemonth chest scan to tell whether the cancer has changed In the meantime his mice are growing preparing to become Freedmans surrogates for the treatment that could heal him Patients typically dont view their mice in the labs that house  of the creatures so when Freedman saw photos of his avatars he said he was more moved than he expected I feel a tremendous tenderness and gratitude toward them as though they were willing little soldiers fighting in my behalf he told NBC News The fact that I know they have no choice in the matter only makes me feel a greater sense of debt towards them
