When it comes to treating a stroke victim every minute counts Each moment that passes without treatment increases the likelihood of permanent damage or death So the first steps to getting help are being able to spot a stroke in yourself or others and knowing how to respond But a   published Wednesday in the journal   finds that  in  US women cant identify a single warning sign  even though stroke is the   of death among Americans and the third among women affecting roughly  more women than men each year The classic symptoms of a drooping face speech difficulty or weakness or numbness in one of the arms can be signs of stroke says   an epidemiologist at Columbia University and the studys lead author That means your brain isnt getting oxygen either because the blood supply is blocked or because a blood vessel has ruptured But those arent the only indicators Lesserknown and more ambiguous symptoms can include a sudden onset of dizziness severe headache or vision loss When the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association first began tracking womens awareness of stroke back in  only  percent of women said they felt wellinformed about what to watch for The number today has crept higher but still not high enough researchers say And previous research has suggested that men are as fuzzy about signs and symptoms as women are says   a neurologist and the director of the Duke Comprehensive Stroke Center In the study published Wednesday  women were asked to name the signs of a stroke along with the first thing theyd do if they thought they were having one While  percent of all women knew to call  if they thought they were having a stroke just  percent recognized sudden weakness or numbness of the face or limb as harbingers of this sort of brain attack Less than half identified loss of speech as a sign and even fewer  a little under a quarter of the women  recognized sudden severe headaches unexplained dizziness or loss of vision as stroke symptoms Among Hispanic women in the survey knowledge about stroke symptoms was generally lower than among their white and black counterparts the researchers say Goldstein who wasnt involved in the study says that might in some cases be due to language subtleties For example a symptom like hypertension suggests a risk factor for stroke in one language but might connote stroke in another he says MochariGreenberger says the signs of stroke vary from person to person so its important to recognize not just one or two of the warning signs but all of them Treatment within about   hours of the first symptom is the most effective Goldstein tells Shots Theres no absolute threshold he says But after about   hours after symptom onset theres no statistical benefit from treatment with a clotbusting drug To speed response time cardiologists have been pushing the   campaign a mnemonic to remind anyone who notices face drooping arm weakness and speech trouble to call  immediately The simplicity of that campaign makes it useful Goldstein says but it leaves out some other symptoms that can indicate a stroke such as visual loss or a sudden severe headache So theres this yin and yang he says in creating a campaign thats easy to understand but also comprehensive The most important thing to remember and watch for he says is if there is an abrupt change neurologically  any abrupt change That could be a stroke and that needs to be taken seriously
