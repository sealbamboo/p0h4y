Before my yearold son wracked his knee this summer I considered myself a wellinformed medical consumer and a relaxed dispassionate sports parent It turned out that I was neither  The experience has been disconcerting but also educational allowing me to develop a checklist of practical information to help other families deal with a serious sportsrelated knee injury and particularly a torn anterior cruciate ligament  In our case my son a frequent freestyle skier in the wintertime was practicing a double back flip on an indoor trampoline in July when he landed off balance and torqued his left knee The resulting pop reputedly resounded like gunfire through the facility His mother was not in attendance His mother could not have changed the outcome had she been there His mother needs to stop regretting that she cannot reverse time or protect her offspring from the consequences of physics This is lesson No   
An MRI scan of my sons knee completed the next day showed that he had ruptured his ACL and also torn his medial collateral ligament and slightly frayed one of his menisci the little pillows of cartilage that cushion the bones in the knee This particular knee injury is called the terrible triad a term I could have spent my parenthood happily not learning  It is important however to be fully conversant with your childs injury Ask for copies of any scans and for accompanying radiologists reports which might not otherwise be included Ask to have terminology explained in excruciating detail If your child is a teenager he or she should be in attendance during these explanations I think although that decision is yours Bear in mind that a teenager may soon be in college and needing to explain his or her medical history to doctors and coaches there  The above advice applies to any injury of course But dealing with ACL tears which by some estimates occur at the rate of about  per hour in the United States requires certain unique considerations from parents For the first few weeks after an ACL tear the most widely accepted treatment involves icing the joint performing rangeofmotion exercises and bracing if needed to allow your child to walk Visit a pediatric sports medicine specialist for the brace fitting if your child is small or lanky adultsized braces we discovered tend to slip down the leg  Use these weeks to consult orthopedic surgeons about why you might not need an orthopedic surgeon Reconstructing a torn ACL is common but requires fashioning a new ligament from other parts of your childs leg or from a cadaver The surgery is invasive and may not improve longterm knee function when compared to physical therapy alone In a   active adults who had opted for physical therapy after an ACL tear had knees that were basically the same after five years as those of adults who had undergone surgery based on clinical measures of stability and function  But active adults are not my son who is a teenager  a group little studied so far in terms of longterm treatment outcomes  and plans to return to varsity soccer and skiing Anecdotally athletes perform better with surgically rebuilt knees So discuss at length with your surgeon whether reconstruction is necessary or desirable for your son or daughter And talk too with your child about the future One ACL tear can contribute to an increased risk of another tear later especially if he or she returns to competitive sports  Sometimes you need to consider whether just maybe your child should do something else said Dr Andrew Veitch a professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of New Mexico and the head team physician for the universitys sports teams A young athlete with a wounded knee might for example want to think about taking up lowimpact swimming or bicycling instead of returning to soccer or football in which case he or she could probably skip surgery But my son loves soccer and consequently will undergo knee surgery with Dr Veitch next week using tissue from his left kneecap to build a new ACL We could have opted to have the surgeon use a piece of his hamstring instead But   that removing a strip from the hamstring permanently weakens the muscle Again quiz your surgeon about which method he or she prefers and why  Be wary however of cadaver ligaments for a young athlete Dr Martha Murray an orthopedic surgeon and researcher at Harvard Medical School told me A number of studies have shown that these tissues which are frozen and sterilized to kill any infections tend to be too fragile to withstand the forces applied to them during sports like football basketball and soccer Too frequently they rip Meanwhile whether you decide to proceed with surgery or not gather recommendations from physicians and friends about local physical therapists with lengthy experience dealing with ACL rehabilitation A welldesigned   not just your childs joint range of motion but his or her balance and proprioception or sense of body positioning as well Researchers Dr Murray said suspect that tearing an ACL severs the ligaments intricate connections to the nervous system making the knee and adjoining muscles a millisecond less responsive during movement which could contribute to reinjury later With proper supervision hopping lunging and catching a ball while perching on one leg could help your child to regain fuller control of his or her lower body Whether you encourage your child to maintain close ties with his or her sports team during this time is up to you It may seem as if showing up for games and practices should buck up an injured athlete But for many such vicarious involvement is frustrating and depressing said Dr Murray who recommends that her young patients volunteer at an animal shelter or find another means to productively use their afterschool time and avoid the playing field  The same advice applies to parents I am sorry to say that I have mourned my sons absence from the soccer field this fall more than he has Instead he has been busily strengthening his leg and body for surgery talking about next season and remodeling himself into a man If we are all lucky I will be that grown up someday
