On Jan  people in and around Charleston WVa began showing up at hospitals They had nausea eye infections and some were vomiting It was later discovered that around  gallons of toxic chemicals had leaked into the Elk River just upstream from a water treatment plant that serves  people Citizens were told not to drink or bathe in the water and while some people are now using water from their taps many still dont trust it or the information coming from public officials  reporter Ken Ward tells  s Dave Davies that the spill included a chemical called crude   which was sold by a company called Freedom Industries  sold to coal companies for use in the process of cleaning and washing the impurities out of coal before they ship that coal to market For Ward the episode is far more than the story of an accident and a cleanup Ward says the spill and the sometimes confusing information authorities have provided about the risks to citizens reflect longstanding regulatory failures in West Virginia and across the nation Ward is an awardwinning investigative reporter who has been covering West Virginia energy and environmental issues for    for years Some people who live in that part of town called in both to the metro   the county emergency operation center  and to the state Department of Environmental Protection complaints of an odor They said they smelled some sort of a strong licorice odor in the air The Department of Environmental Protection sent a couple of air quality inspectors out and  when they first went there they were told by company officials No were not having any problems What are you talking about The inspectors asked to tour the site They went out and they noticed there was a problem at one of the tanks They described to me a squarefoot  to inchdeep pool of this chemical that had leaked out of a hole in the tank and a footwide stream of this stuff that was pouring across the containment area  and it was kind of disappearing  into the river  Much of the Elk River was frozen over so you couldnt immediately see that it was in the river The problem that arises from that is that Freedom Industries the company that owns the chemical storage tanks had a permit from the state Department of Environmental Protection  a storm water permit a permit to govern runoff from its facility One of the requirements of that permit is that they immediately report any spills The Department of Environmental Protection says they didnt report this spill to the state And the fact that they didnt report it immediately delayed some efforts at containing the spill and certainly affected the size of it and made the situation worse than it necessarily had to be Eastman Chemical which makes it puts out whats called a Material Safety Data Sheet An MSDS is something thats required under the Occupational Safety and Health Act Its supposed to be kept on site for workers to look at and its supposed to be filed with emergency responders and local environmental authorities Its supposed to list the properties of the chemical its flashpoint and whats the toxicity of it And the problem with this particular substance is that if you read the MSDS for it where it lists toxicological effects Is it a carcinogen No data Does it cause developmental problems No data Most of the basic health effects that youd want to know about theres no data available listed on the MSDS for this material My family and I were not drinking this water I know a lot of people that arent When you go to the grocery stores here you still see people buying pretty significant quantities of bottled water filling up their carts When you go to restaurants you hear people asking Are you using bottled water Are you using tap water And restaurants are putting out press releases and they have signs that say Were using only bottled water The Chemical Safety Board has been to West Virginia quite a few times and they came here in  after an explosion at a Bayer CropScience chemical plant  The Chemical Safety Board came in and investigated that and found a lot of problems at the plant and found a dearth of regulation of that sort of a plant And one of the things the Chemical Safety Board said was that our state  should work with the KanawhaCharleston Health Department to create a new chemical accident prevention program through which government inspectors would more frequently go into these plants would ensure theyre being operated safely The Chemical Safety Board came back again after a series of accidents at a DuPont chemical plant  in West Virginia  a series of accidents there in January of  ended up with one worker being killed And the Chemical Safety Board repeated its recommendation after that incident  The state has really done absolutely nothing to implement that recommendation The Kanawha County officials have encouraged the state to work with them  and the state has just basically ignored the recommendation The industry officials didnt like the Chemical Safety Board recommendations They insisted theres enough regulation already and that agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration do enough already And I think there seems to be this idea that  agencies like EPA and OSHA are these jackbooted thugs that are kicking down the gates of manufacturing facilities and stomping out jobs When in fact a lot of these facilities will go for years and years without ever seeing an OSHA inspector coming in and checking on the workplace conditions without ever seeing an EPA inspector who is looking at their environmental conditions The notion that these places are just terribly overregulated is wildly exaggerated The Obama administration certainly has broad rulemaking authority at EPA and the Environmental Protection Agency can make rules about all sorts of things about this the Occupational Safety and Health Administration can make rules about these things One example is that the coal industry here likes to complain about how tough the Obama administration is on them but a few years ago we had a major spill of toxic coal ash from an impoundment in east Tennessee and the Obama administration promised after that Were going to write new rules to govern toxic coal ash and ensure that its handled and disposed of safely Well they still havent done that OSHA knows that combustible dust is a big problem They havent written rules about that
