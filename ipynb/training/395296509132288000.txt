We all know were supposed to exercise daily but precious few of us do And it only seems to get harder with age Theres a reason to try harder though Tacking more years of good health on to your life may be as simple as mowing the lawn more often and engaging in other everyday physical activities Researchers in Sweden measured the health of almost  yearolds in the late s A dozen years later they checked back in The people who had been active but not exercising at age  had a  percent lower risk of heart attack and stroke over that time and a  percent lower risk of death The most active people also had trimmer waists and better   and   considered risk factors for heart disease and diabetes Thats compared to people who are sedentary which tends to become more common as people age What kind of activity does it take to get those kind of numbers Things like mowing the lawn housework fixit projects gardening bicycling and for a nice Scandinavian touch gathering mushrooms or berries That last one got me thinking of my yearold dad who gathered  pounds of chanterelle mushrooms just a few weeks ago near his home in Oregon Dad also mows the lawn cleans the gutters and fixes the roof He grows roses tomatoes and grapes too You could say he does this because hes cheap Hes a child of the Great Depression after all Or maybe hes just restless Either way hes in good shape and if hes jogged even once in his life its news to me Other recent studies on nonmushroomgatherers have found similar health benefits for the kind of simple daily activity that doesnt require Spandex pants including walking or biking for transportation instead of driving The Swedish researchers also looked at people who were doing the kind of moderatetovigorous activity that were all supposed to be doing for   according to federal guidelines Regular exercisers had better blood pressure numbers than nonexercisers When it came to cardiovascular health and risk of death they didnt lower their risk any more than the active nonexercisers unless they were getting a lot of highintensity exercise more than  minutes three times a week The   was published online in the   This study doesnt prove that being active is what made these people healthier of course It could be they were more active because they were healthier to begin with and then stayed that way But the researchers tried to account for that by excluding people who already had heart disease and other health problems But given other recent reports showing that being   is pretty much a death sentence mowing the lawn sounds less like a chore and more a gift of life
