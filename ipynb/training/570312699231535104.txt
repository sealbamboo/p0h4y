The researchers who designed the trial said they were looking for a simple and inexpensive way to aid smokers who were already motivated to kick the habit They estimated that once their day program was set up it could be maintained at a cost of less than  per quitter For the trial  patients received the usual care  a recommendation for specific tobacco cessation medication that could be prescribed by a doctor upon discharge and the number for a tollfree   An additional  patients got sustained care which included a free day supply of medication that was chosen by the patient and his or her counselor The medication could be refilled twice during the trial Patients getting sustained care also got five automated phone calls that encouraged them to keep taking their medication offered advice to help them stay smokefree and identified those who needed to talk to the counselor oneonone After six months  of the patients who got the extra help told researchers that they had not smoked anything including electronic cigarettes in the previous week The researchers didnt just take their word for it  they used a saliva test to check for a chemical called   which the body produces as it metabolizes nicotine and they tested for carbon monoxide in exhaled air These biochemical tests confirmed that  of the former smokers had abstained for at least seven days By comparison  of the patients who got the usual care said they had not smoked for the previous week and  were deemed smokefree by a biochemical test Overall the patients who got sustained care were  to  more likely to be nonsmokers after six months than the patients who got the usual care the researchers found The patients who enrolled in the study were not just casual smokers  before they wound up in the hospital they smoked  cigarettes a day on average The  of study participants who were hospitalized for a smokingrelated disease were just as likely to benefit from the extra help as the  of patients who wound up in the hospital for other reasons However the researchers found that the program was most beneficial for the African Americans Latinos Asian Americans and Native Americans in the study Among these patients  who got the extra help were still not smoking after six months compared with only  who received the usual care The researchers said that the biggest difference between the two groups is that patients who got sustained care used nicotine replacement therapy longer than patients who didnt For instance  of patients in the usual care group used some form of NRT such as nicotine patches gum or lozenges for only two weeks or less By comparison  of patients who tried the sustained care stuck with the medication for eight weeks or longer according to the study The researchers calculated that the added cost of the more intensive program was  per successful quitter in the first year and  per quitter in subsequent years after the staff had been trained and the automated phone system had been built However the program costs would have been lower if health insurance companies had paid for the antismoking medication as required by the Affordable Care Act The researchers said that once the program had been set up hospitals could keep it going for as little as  per successful quitter Nearly  million Americans smokers are admitted to a hospital each year according to the researchers Among the  daily smokers who were treated at Massachusetts General during the course of the study   told counselors they would like to quit
