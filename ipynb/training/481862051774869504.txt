Health officials are warning that ingredients in some popular acne products including brands such as Proactiv, Neutrogena, Aveeno and Clean & Clear have been linked to potentially life-threatening allergic reactions.. Products containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid can cause rare but potentially dangerous reactions or severe irritation, Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday.. At least 131 reports of allergic reactions and cases of reactions related to hypersensitivity were logged with the FDA over 44 years, from 1969 to 2013. Symptoms ranged from tightness in the throat and difficulty breathing to other harms; 44 percent of the people were hospitalized. No one died.. FDA officials said they’re not sure whether the reactions were triggered by the active ingredients, inactive ingredients or a combination. They urged consumers to test small amount of the products for three days to make sure no reactions occur.. - JoNel Aleccia
