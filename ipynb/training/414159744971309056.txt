I have never been a gravy fan but I am a fan of what I call Mushroom Ragot Gravy which is not a gravy at all but a mushroom ragot or stew I always make too much I double the recipe if we are going to be a dozen people which we usually are during holiday gatherings even though I know that nobody will have enough room on their plates for more than a spoonful  The surfeit is a calculated one because I know that I can recycle the leftover mushroom ragot into a number of dishes from omelets to tarts risottos to tacos I spoon the ragot over polenta and heat it with toast for bruschetta The ragot makes a great pasta sauce and pizza topping as well It is a great dish to have in your repertoire because it is so versatile as a building block or as a side dish The recipe makes quite a lot of ragot but you wont mind having it around It keeps for three or four days in the refrigerator and freezes well and the leftovers can be used to make omelets strudels and more  This versatile dish can be used as the base for a number of other recipes or enjoyed on its own  A simple omelet with a delicious filling  Once the ragot is made this tart can be assembled quickly  Wild rice adds great texture to the meaty mushroom filling  Mushroom ragot forms the basis for delicious quesadillas that can be assembled in no time
