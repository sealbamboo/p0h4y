Hundreds of overweight or obese people with diabetes have been able to do something very few Americans have done lose a big chunk of weight and keep it off for  years So should it matter if that epic weight loss didnt reduce the risk of heart disease Maybe not Thats one response to the results of the   clinical trial which checked to see if losing weight reduced heart disease risk in people with Type  diabetes Maintaining a healthful weight is an important way to prevent and manage diabetes Its also helps reduce heart disease risk So the researchers were surprised to find that even though the study participants lost weight and kept it off they didnt reduce their risk of heart attacks stroke and chest pain Researchers at  institutions had organized a longrunning clinical trial to measure the effect of weight loss enrolling more than  obese or overweight people ages  to  with Type  diabetes They averaged about  pounds Half of the group was assigned to an intensive lifestyle intervention that involved eating less   to  calories a day  and putting in at least three hours of moderate exercise a week They got counseling and attended meetings to help them stick with the program Those people lost an average of  percent of their body weight in the first year which isnt easy to do Most weightloss studies can eke out only a few percentage points of change in that time The people in the control group who didnt get the lifestyle help lost almost  percent of body weight in the first year Both groups managed to avoid major backsliding which typically happens with weightloss trials The intervention group gained some weight back in years two through five but ended up with a  percent loss over  years The control group lost weight gradually and was down about  percent at the end All told  people stayed with the trial throughout Excess weight is considered a risk factor for both cardiovascular disease and diabetes so the researchers figured theyd see improvements in both Instead they had to stop the trial early after almost  years when it was clear that the people in the weightloss group werent getting any extra protection from heart attacks strokes or angina But the trial wasnt a failure the the researchers say It shows that people with diabetes can lose weight and maintain that weight loss lead author   a professor of psychiatry at Brown University reported at the American Diabetes Association meeting in Chicago The   were published online in the   The weightloss group also had better glycemic control and lower systolic blood pressure spent less money on medications had less sleep apnea and was more likely to have a partial remission of diabetes They were less likely to land in the hospital And they also felt better This study in no way disproves the important of weight reduction and exercise says   a distinguished professor emeritus at the Indiana University School of Medicine and past president of the American College of Cardiology There were significant benefits achieved The control group took more statins and other drugs to reduce cardiovascular risk Zipes notes which could have clouded the studys findings And he says that years of evidence showing that eating well and exercising reduce heart disease risk still stand Weve been able to reduce mortality from heart disease by  percent over the past three decades he said
