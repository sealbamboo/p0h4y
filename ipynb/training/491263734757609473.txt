One dewy morning back in May  a dozen children gathered in an elementary school courtyard to play soccer in Addis Ababa Sevenyearold Sisay Gudeta stood alone on the balcony above them Sisay poked his head through the arms of a rusty blue  guard rail staring down at his classmates as they kicked an empty plastic bottle across the pavement The kids rarely ask him to play Sisay says They are afraid to touch him afraid of the bump on his back that stretches out his neatly pressed school sweater He is such a beautiful child Sisays grandmother says I ask God what I did to do this to him For reasons unknown thousands of children in Ethiopia suffer from congenital spine conditions so severe that humps grow from their backs Their spines resemble flattened pancakes and rollercoaster tracks says   an American who runs the only spine clinic in Addis Ababa a city of  million people Such extreme scoliosis cases are found in many poor countries But Hodes thinks that lack of screening and access to basic medical care leaves Ethiopia with some of the worst spines in the world If not effectively treated   can lead to permanent deformity disc injuries and neurological damage Here in the US the National Institutes of Health   doctors use a brace to help straighten a childs back when the spine curves more than  to  degrees When the curve reaches more than  degrees surgery is often needed Yet thousands of Ethiopian children receive no medical treatment for their scoliosis In villages a traditional healer may try to flatten the childs back by pressing hot rocks to the skin Others with twisted spines and humpbacks are ostracized or abandoned and left to die In   Hodes examines more than  spine patients each year The majority have curved protrusions on their backs greater than  degrees Hodes says he once saw a patient with a degree curve like a saxophone Were sort of setting world records for spine curvatures says Hodes who leads the Ethiopian medical branch for the nonprofit American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee Without continued treatment to correct the degree curve in Sisays spine doctors say he will have only the lung capacity of an yearold His limited breathing will be unable to support his growing body and he will likely die perhaps as early as age  But despite his condition Sisay sounded like a typically yearold boy at his home when we visited him His biggest worry on that day was keeping the TV antennae working Otherwise how would he watch   I dont touch it Sisay says of the TV If I touch it it will break And if it breaks I will not be happy Surgeons in Ethiopia are illequipped to perform procedures as complicated as the one Sisay needs But a doctor nearly  miles away in Ghana can do the  corrective surgery Twice a week Hodes evaluates patients from Ethiopia to see if theyre candidates for the surgery Every three months he sends about a dozen of them to Accra Ghana where   examines and sometimes fixes their backs Adjel an orthopedic surgeon at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City leads the nonprofit   offering complex medical procedures to poor people across Africa If you leave these kids alone you wont see them as teenagers BoachieAdjei says of his patients Sisay is one of the lucky few In late  BoachieAdjei drilled four holes into Sisays skull and affixed a metal halo to his head The halo contraption stretches out Sisays back so theres enough space for his spine once its straightened During the month of December Sisay grew about  inches to foot Then in March BoachieAdjei sliced opened Sisays back and inserted screws into many of Sisays vertebrae The surgeon also attached   to Sisays spine to help straighten and lengthen it Around the time Sisay hits puberty he will likely undergo a final procedure to finish correcting the curvature But for now Sisay is healing at home in Ethiopia  and looking forward to the next episode of
