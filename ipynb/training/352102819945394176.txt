Humans have long relied on the sense of taste in the struggle to survive and multiply A bitter taste alerts us to a plant that may be poisonous A sweet taste tells us that a plant is likely high in calories and can help sustain us Our sense of taste may be even more closely linked to the propagation of the human race than we ever suspected Some of the same genes that allow us to sense sweet and   flavors are also active in a mans   According to a   published in  Tuesday suppressing these genes may affect not only his ability to taste but also his ability to reproduce When food touches our tongue it activates taste receptors which deploy proteins into our nervous system and alert our brain to the flavors The taste receptor is like a microphone and the protein is the microphone cable says geneticist   who specializes in the science of taste Experiencing a taste is like hearing a sound through an amp he tells Shots If you lose either the mic or the cable it wont work In this case the microphone is the taste receptor controlled by the gene TASR and the cable is a protein called gustducin that is expressed by the gene GNAT Mosinger and his team at the   in Philadelphia were exploring the specific role of these genes when they discovered something unusual Curious to see what would happen if the genetic microphone and cable were both removed they inactivated the genes in some mice Then they let them mate Nothing happened It turned out the male mice were sterile The result surprised Mosinger We wanted an animal with both genes inactivated he says We didnt expect to find much and we certainly didnt expect these genes to have such a fundamental role in male reproduction Too bad for the mice But what does the finding mean for humans There is a worldwide decline in male fertility Mosinger says Sperm count and sperm function are going down and getting progressively worse We speculate that there is something in the environment causing this In support of this hypothesis Mosinger points to a class of drugs called   used to treat high cholesterol which are   of the gene TASR Also some herbicides are known to have the same effect If a man who was already dusting his crops with phenoxy herbicides were to become exposed to a substance that inhibits the GNAT gene it could be bad news for his sperm How likely is that Shots called human geneticist   of the National Institutes of Health to find out We dont know of any environmental things that contribute to the function of gustducin or GNAT he says We dont even know if there is any evidence for the existence of such things So its not clear if the findings will help us understand male infertility The real power of science is surprises like this Drayna says This is another example of how basic biomedical research produces surprises that open our eyes to new and interesting areas of biology that were previously completely unrecognized Monells Mosinger pointed out a provocative possibility raised by the findings The inhibitors that we found are specific to humans but with a little more work we could find rodent specific inhibitors for these genes he says With still more work he says the inhibitors might find use as a better mousetrap
