Sure you know the basics about the birds and the bees but how much do you really know about what goes on in your bodyand your mindwhile youre falling head over heels or doing the deed Here are  fascinating facts about love and sex that may surprise you Scientists already knew that people tend to choose romantic partners with similar characteristics such as age race religion income and upbringings But a study published in the   found that   When researchers studied the genetic material of  white American couples they found fewer differences in the DNA between married people than between two randomly selected individuals within the same race In fact they calculated that the tendency to pair up with a genetically similar spouse is about onethird as strong as the tendency to do so with someone with a similar education  says Matthew Johnson PhD director of the Marriage and Family Studies Laboratory at Binghamton University In his study couples attended counseling or watched relationshipthemed movies and completed discussion guides together Both strategies cut the groups divorce rate in half after three yearsbut the moviewatching activity took  less time and took place almost entirely at home The key is to talk with your partner about your relationship in the context of a movie says Johnson  according to a University of California Los Angeles study Researchers performed brain scans of volunteers while they viewed images some sexually suggestive and also asked their sexual behaviors within the past year Turns out those whose brains were most active when viewing the sexual images also tended to have had the most partners Levels of sexual motivation do vary form one person to another says Justin Garcia PhD assistant professor at the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University Along with damaging arteries and working the heart overtime   In fact ED may serve as a warning sign for cardiovascular disease The good news Men who take statins or other medications to lower their cholesterol are also likely to see an improvement in their sexual function according to a  study by researchers at Rutgers Universitys Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Of course stains should not be prescribed to treat ED on its own say the researchers since the condition can also be caused by other physical or emotional issues  say Ohio State University researchers In a  study they asked  married couples to test their blood sugar each night and morning and to stick pins into voodoo dolls that represented their spouses based on how angry they were with them The lower their blood sugar over the course of  days the more pins they used One possible reason Low blood sugar can cause people to feel hungryand therefore cranky and irritable Its simple advice but it works says lead author Brad Bushman PhD Before you have a difficult conversation with your spouse make sure youre not hungry Heres a   for you   a type of virus that is transmitted through sexual intercourse and oral sex Thats what NYU Langone Medical Center researchers found when they tested the DNA of  men and women in a  study The notsoscary news however is that only four of those people tested were infected with the types of HPV that are known to cause cervical cancer throat cancer or genital warts And even though the most highrisk strands known as genotypes  and  can cause cancer the good news is they usually dont Most of the time the body eliminates HPV without special treatment Having trouble getting a date   according to a published in the   When volunteers were asked to read fake dating profiles and rate them on likability friendliness fun and likelihood of going on a date they rated humbler profiles more favorably In a second study volunteers who considered their significant others to be humble were more likely to forgive them for a transgression This suggests that humility in a relationship encourages relational repair in ongoing romantic couples says Daryl Van Tongeren assistant professor of psychology at Hope College in Holland Mich A long car ride may sometimes seem like the worst place to hash out important issues with your significant otherafter all youre stuck in your seat for hours But   says Johnson Many couples find long car rides to be a good way to work on problems that need sustained attention he says Road trips can also be a good time to get to know your partner better he adds Ask detailed questions about their hopes for the future their wildest fantasies or their childhood memories Then be a good listener and ask real followup questions that are meaningful to both of you In a  study Albright University researchers found that  while counting from one to to sound more attractive But sorry guys When men tried to be sexier they were actually rated as sounding worse When a woman intentionally drops her voice to make it sound low and breathy shes often perceived as more attractivebut not exactly for the reasons you might think Men tend to prefer women with higher more feminine voices says coauthor Susan Hughes PhD associate professor of psychology But when a woman lowers her voice to sound sexy shes signaling her interest in a potential matea clue that men are able to pick up on Research shows that   they show less of an attraction toward men with high testosterone levels and masculine physical characteristics And one  Scottish study found that   were less sexually attracted to their mates and less sexually satisfied during their relationship At the same time however they tended to be more satisfied with their partners financial status and less likely to separate than women who werent on the Pill  during the most fertile times in their cycle according to several studies In one German report women were asked to rate their desirability for soldiers returning home from war some of which had traumarelated aggressive tendencies Those in their most fertile times of the month were more likely to prefer the traumaimpacted soldiers as potential shortterm mates but not as longterm mates Other research suggests that women may want more sex in general during ovulation says Garcia Its often assumed that people fake orgasms because they arent enjoying themselves or they just want it to be over say Garcia But sometimes putting on a big show is part of the enjoyment he adds Sex is performative and sometimes its fun for both parties to get carried away 
                   
                  Speaking of faking orgasmsdid you know that men do it too They can and often do says Garcia often for the same reasons women do Since sex involves a lot of fluids anyway its not always easy to tell whether hes ejaculated or not  may be just as important to relationship satisfaction as intercourse itself suggests a  University of Toronto study When researchers asked couples to spend more time cuddling together after sex those who did  especially those couples with kids This may have to do with the release of oxytocin says Johnson which is released during sex and continues to be released with prolonged skintoskin contact Couples who augment their sex with cuddlingor other behaviors before during or after sexare probably reinforcing their bond he says  with lots of fluids and smells but in the heat of the moment none of that usually seems to matter According to a study from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands thats because sexual arousal overrides the bodys natural disgust response When researchers asked women to watch either an erotic film a sports video or a neutral video of a train and then perform a series of unpleasant acts like drinking out of a cup with a bug in it they found that those whod watched the sexual acts rated the tasks as less disgustingand were also able to complete more of them Previous research has suggested that sexual arousal has a similar impact on men as well Theres a reason you cant stop thinking about that special new guy or girl in your life   that falling in love sends blood rushing to the pleasure center areas of the brainthe same areas that are responsible for obsessivecompulsive behaviors Falling in love also lowers serotonin levels which is common in people with obsessivecompulsive disorders says Mary Lynn DO codirector of the Loyola Sexual Wellness Clinic at Loyola University in Chicago This may explain why we concentrate on little other than our partner during the early stages of a relationship she says and also why we tend to idealize new partners and turn a blind eye to their faults Marriage appears to strengthen mens skeletons according to a University of California Los Angeles study   Researchers arent sure why but they point out that its not the first time marriage has been linked to health Other studies for example have suggested that   are   and have a   Is he or she really the one According to a  study published in   deep down you probably know the answer  all of whom reported high levels of relationship satisfaction at the timeto look at images of their spouses paired with either negative or positive words and rated their response times in distinguishing between them Four years later those who had quickly identified the negative words were more likely to report lower relationship satisfaction suggesting that theyd had subconscious negative thoughts about their spouse all along Dont panic if you get red during sex Its probably your bodys natural response to increased blood flow and skin temperature says Garcia This socalled sex flush may appear on your cheeks chest genital area or across your entire body 
                   
                  Some people get worried and think I must be allergic to something youre wearing or maybe its your beard scratching me says Garcia But more often its just a natural part of the sexual arousal process and it should go away once things cool down and return to normal Getting busy between the sheets for an hour can   according to a  study from the University of Quebec To crunch the numbers researchers asked  couples ages  to  to wear calorietracking armbands while they ran on a treadmill while they had sex once a week for a month They found that men burned an average of  calories a minute during sex while women burned about  Overall men and women burned about  and  calories per session respectively Sexual interest and sexual function do both decline with ageespecially as adults begin to take more medicationsbut that doesnt mean that senior citizens arent still getting it on Many people do continue to have sex into their old age often until death Garcia says And theyre not always careful Besides teenagers and young adults the elderly is the biggest population for sexuallytransmitted disease spikes he adds Theyre not worried about getting pregnant so theyre not using condoms
