Some are working in the fields that feed the entire country and then they dont have the resources to support them and their health Its heartbreaking  For the last two years Ramirez has been on a mission to build a healthier community in her impoverished hometown of Pixley She and her husband launched Be Healthy Tulare a grassroots movement to collect produce that would otherwise go to waste and get it to neighbors in need The group is named for the county where Pixley is located Looking outside and seeing trees just loaded with fruit I was just feeling like why arent we connecting these pieces Ramirez said   Twice a month Ramirez and volunteers gather fruit and vegetables from farms and backyard trees They glean from growers and residents who contact them about their excess produce The group then provides the bounty to a local food bank that distributes it to families in need So far this year Ramirez said she and her group have collected and donated  pounds of produce Growing up the daughter of farm workers Ramirez watched her familys health suffer In my own family I have witnessed young family members die of preventable diseases she said While she was attending college in northern California she began working at a free health clinic in Sacramento I realized that the illnesses and conditions I was seeing there were not that different from what I saw at home And I began to ask  why  In Tulare County  of adults are either overweight or obese according to a recent California Health Interview Survey Many community members do not own a vehicle or have easy access to public transportation Ramirez said The result People are not getting the quality foods that often grow nearby There isnt a full service grocery store that provides the best and most wholesome food at affordable prices here in the community Ramirez said While working toward her masters degree and ultimately her PhD Ramirez worked parttime as Tulare Countys epidemiologist With a background in public health and cultural studies she saw the link between food insecurity and the high rates of obesity and diabetes Ive talked to a lot of people who end up being referred to me  because they have chronic diseases or their children have chronic diseases Ramirez said I lost count of how many yearolds I was seeing with high cholesterol or how many people came in due to obesity Ive had moments in the clinic where I have people literally cry because they tell me they cant afford to eat well or eat healthy When Ramirez set out to help her community she gathered residents and asked them for their input By involving them in her efforts she aims to instill hope and dignity We wanted to start a project where the community sees the value of their own experiences she said In addition to salvaging produce residents learn how to live a healthy life The group runs a community garden a fitness program and nutrition classes that Ramirez calls food labs This is an educational opportunity to find out how to use foods we grow in the garden she said I like to have community members offer their own recipes I welcome the community to teach as well We want everyone to feel involved  Adults and children participate in the food labs and generations of families get involved Grandma will bring a potluck and the rest of the family  and community  will enjoy the meal Ramirez said For Ramirez its about creating a sense of belonging and purpose in her community Its not about us looking for someone else to come in and save these communities she said Its how we recognize that the people here already matter that they have value
