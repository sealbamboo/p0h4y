Two British military healthcare workers flown to the UK with suspected Ebola have been discharged from hospital in London. . They were kept under supervision after needle-stick injuries while on the frontline of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.. They were flown back to London on 31 January and 2 February.. They have not developed symptoms of the virus and have now been discharged from the Royal Free Hospital.. Needle-stick injuries involve a sharp object, often a needle, piercing the skin.. They are a dangerous potential source of infection as the virus can be delivered directly into the bloodstream. . Prof Paul Cosford, from Public Health England, said the healthcare workers would be closely monitored.. He said: "The individuals will receive ongoing monitoring and support while residing in appropriate private accommodation close to the Royal Free. . "The risk to the public from Ebola remains very low.". They will have to be monitored throughout the 21-day incubation period of the virus.. Nearly 22,900 people have been infected with the virus in West Africa and more than 9,000 have died.
