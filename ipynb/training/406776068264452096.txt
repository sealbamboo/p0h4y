Saturday is the day the Obama administration set as its deadline for making HealthCaregov a smooth experience for most users A techsavvy team of engineers database architects and contractors has been   to ensure the White House makes good on that promise but judging the success of their efforts may take some time How will we know whether the website is fixed NPRs health policy correspondent Julie Rovner says that partly depends on how you define fixed She joins   host Scott Simon to explain what that means Remember the promise is to have it working for what they call the vast majority of users by which the administration means  percent of visitors to the site That means  of every  people will still need to use a call center an inperson counselor or a paper application due to a technical problem or because his or her individual situation is too complex to be handled online So Amazon or Orbitz this is not But then again this is not buying a TV or a plane ticket either Many people have pointed out that spending a couple of hours buying health insurance online is still a lot faster than the old way when you might have had a page paper application and a process that literally took weeks There was a little show and tell earlier this week where the White House actually showed reporters some of the  or so people who have been working pretty much around the clock from various centers located in the Washington DC suburbs Theyve got a separate hardware team doing upgrades to increase the websites capacity for example  theyre saying it should be able to handle  separate visits per day going forward Then another team is working on software Theyre fixing bugs and trying to make the website more userfriendly for consumers Thats the really frustrating part Im not sure we will at least not at first We do already know its working better than it was in October  which frankly was a pretty low bar to get over The administration has all kinds of fancy metrics to show how well the website is working but we dont have our own independent access to them We do know a big test is likely to come on Monday when people who have been talking to relatives over the long holiday weekend  or who wake up and suddenly realize its December and they want coverage in January  all try to sign on at once Insurance companies are getting increasingly worried It seems that while so much effort has been going into what they call the front end of the site  where consumers go to compare insurance plans and sign up for coverage  some parts of the back end of the site  where insurance companies actually get paid  havent even been built yet The administration says it will get that done before money has to begin to change hands sometime in January but given that nothing up until this point has happened on schedule that doesnt make insurance companies feel a whole lot better about things Small businesses were supposed to be able to sign up online to enroll their employees through the federal website starting this month That was already delayed from Oct  Now that wont happen online until next November They can still compare plans online but theyll have to use paper applications and go through an insurance broker or agent or an insurance company directly unless theyre in one of a handful of states thats got its smallbusiness exchange up and running The administration has been pretty candid about this  theyve said their top priority is to make the website work for consumers first and pretty much everything else is taking a back seat
