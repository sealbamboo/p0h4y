Take everything you learned about the traditional situp and toss it out the window Bob Harper best known for his work on NBCs The Biggest Loser would like to introduce you to a new way of doing situps that uses momentum to get the job done It will also send your heart rate soaring This movement tightens the core and flattens the abs especially the lower abs but takes the legs and hip flexors out of the way literally so you are forced to use your abs to get you off the ground The move also tones the lower back and inner thighs Many of us have been taught to avoid using momentum as it can rob an exercise of its value Not in this case Use momentum all you want Harper says Theres nothing that can make this exercise any easier And in fact the momentum just helps add to the calorie burn Sit on the floor the soles of your feet together knees out to the sides Lie down and reach your hands over your head Begin the movement by engaging your abs and reaching up and forward Ideally your shoulders will come past your knees hands past your feet or as far as your flexibility allows Reverse the movement If youre like most of us youll struggle and wobble and your feet may come apart No matter Collect yourself and resume Harper favors Tabata training which he calls the hardest workout you can do in the least amount of time It looks like this  seconds of movement followed by  seconds of rest for eight rounds So As many situps as you can do for  seconds rest for  and then get back to it for eight rounds in all
