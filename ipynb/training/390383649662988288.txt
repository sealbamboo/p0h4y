Irene Adams cooks supper for husband Luke and yearold son Cole at their home in Fayetteville Ark She used to serve lots of green beans but switched to edamame after tasting it at a local restaurant Cole used to split his green beans and take out the little seeds inside Adams says So I told Luke we should try edamame because its bigger seeds and has more flavor so thats why we decided to try it and he loves it Cole squeezes the bright green buttery beans out of the pod and pops them into his mouth Edamame it turns out is a healthy finger food high in fiber and protein China produces most of the worlds edamame handpicking and processing it there Now lots of locally grown edamame are being packed in the town of Mulberry Ark Freshpicked pods jiggle across a massive highspeed conveyor for automated sorting washing blanching and flash freezing A Texasbased Asian foods importer   to build its company American Vegetable Soybean and Edamame Inc here Raymond Chung the chief financial officer says one reason is because plenty of local farmers are willing to grow the nongenetically modified vegetable soybeans The bulk of soybeans in the US are genetically modified and grown for industrial purposes but edamame is a special variety he says Arkansas ranks th nationally for conventional soybeans and is the first to develop an edamame variety licensed for commercial production  expects more states to follow Arkansas lead Shes with the Iowabased trade group   Most people when I tell them about edamame and say its really a soybean they are shocked she says They just feel like its a vegetable  its a more familiar food to them than maybe tofu or soy milk Like tofu edamame is widely available in many major supermarket chains supplied by smaller producers in California Minnesota and Ohio The Soyfoods Association of North America says frozen edamame sales grew  percent from  to  Arkansas processor Chung intends to be the top link in the chain Since his factory opened last summer production has doubled He now supplies Costco Whole Foods and Sams Clubs We are turning Arkansas into the edamame capital of the US and eventually the capital of the world he says And if Chung can get Cole Adams and millions of other kids to eat their vegetables The town of Mulberry may have to change its name to Edamame
