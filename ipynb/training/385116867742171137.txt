Like most middleaged women I am stressed out The work the family the aging parents  all things that jolt me awake at  am Does this mean Im setting myself up for Alzheimers in old age Well maybe Researchers in Sweden say that women who reported stress in midlife from experiences like divorce or a family members illness were more likely to have dementia or Alzheimers disease in old age The study used data gathered from  women ages  to  starting in  then tracking their health over  years Over the years  of the women died and  developed dementia The women were asked about a range of psychosocial stresses including divorce widowhood and serious problems with children such as illness or death The researchers also got information about loss of work mental illness or alcohol abuse in a spouse or close relative and illness or social problems related to a husband The women who reported stress in  were  percent more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimers or other forms of dementia later on The   were reported online in the journal   Distress also played a role the researchers found In followup interviews over the years the women were asked if theyd experienced anxiety nervousness sleep problems irritability or other signs of distress The women who reported being distressed over several decades also had a higher risk of Alzheimers in old age To be sure a longitudinal study like this one cant prove that the stresses caused disease later in life It just suggests an association one that would need to be confirmed by other studies Mild social stress is common and hasnt been linked to longterm health problems But other research has found that severe psychological stressors like being in a war or a natural disaster can affect health decades later That may be because   boosts levels of hormones like cortisol contributing to the risk of heart disease depression and memory problems among other ills So how much stress does it take to get Alzheimers I really cant say says Lena Johansson a postdoctoral researcher in the Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology at Gothenberg University in Sweden who led the study There are good reasons for that equivocation Johansson tells Shots many of them having to do with the questions that the original study did or didnt ask Some of the stressors the women reported are severe and others are relatively trivial this study gave them equal weight Some obvious ones like physical abuse and illness for the women themselves werent included in the data And the women werent asked to rate the impact of the stressful events in their lives The original study also didnt ask women if they used psychotherapy exercise or other methods to counteract stress so the presentday researchers couldnt probe how that would affect Alzheimers risk Its really an important question for the future Johansson says And what about the stress in her own life Johansson is  totally in the right demographic for her study I try to take it easier she says I know stress is dangerous for the brain But its one thing to know and another thing to really handle it Its difficult for us all to change
