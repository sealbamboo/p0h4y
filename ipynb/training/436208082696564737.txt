Obesity can take a heavy toll on older women too Their risk of developing chronic diseases losing the ability to walk or dying earlier increases with excess weight We get   recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine that tracked more than  postmenopausal women at  research centers and universities around the country When the women enrolled in the Womens Health Initiative between  and  they were between  and  years old average age  The researchers recorded the subjectss heights weights and health information then followed up periodically thereafter When the study concluded in  the researchers found that the women fell into five categories When the researchers looked at the impact that obesity or being overweight  calculated by    took on the womens health we found that women with a healthy body weight had a greater chance of living to  without developing a chronic disease or a mobility disability Dr RillamasSun said The heavier you are the worse your chances of healthy survival Now some New Old Age readers  you know who you are  are already mentally composing comments like Didnt we already know that obesity is bad for us and We needed a study funded by the National Institutes of Health to tell us this We did on both counts But older people and women have historically been underrepresented in  or actually excluded from  research trials For years experts assumed that findings from allmale studies applied to women too which has proved to be untrue  Also aside from gender disparities a lot of research focuses on everyone  and older Dr RillamasSun pointed out We looked at the oldold  those who are plus But it is true that this work confirms what we thought we knew Overweight women run a higher risk of health problems and disability and those risks rise sharply when overweight becomes obese Compared to older women with healthy body mass indexes below  overweight women had a  percent greater chance of developing one of the five diseases But women with Level  obesity BMI over  but below  had a  percent higher risk of disease and women with higher levels of obesity were more than twice as likely to develop disease The likelihood of dying before age  showed a similar pattern The data has been adjusted to account for demographic differences and health behaviors like smoking When it came to losing mobility the researchers found even more striking differences Overweight women had a  percent higher risk of losing the ability to walk but obese women were three to six times more likely to lose their mobility For AfricanAmerican and Hispanic women who were overweight or obese the odds of disease disability or death before age  were higher yet What this study doesnt address is whether losing weight later in life can protect older women from disease and disability But the researchers are working on that And of course some factor other than obesity might be involved because  all together now  correlation is not causation But we shouldnt wait for Dr RillamasSuns next publication to try to reduce obesity in older women Paging the First Lady Women often do gain weight after menopause and losing it can be harder than when were  a challenge with which Im all too familiar But its not impossible and the effort is worth undertaking  for our aging parents and for ourselves This says you cant be in denial any longer said Dr RillamasSun Most people need to see the numbers they prove what is supposedly obvious And we do have the numbers
