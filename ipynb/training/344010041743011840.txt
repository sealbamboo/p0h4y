Barton Holmes was  months old when he had his first seizure He was convulsing and his eyes were rolling in the back of his head his mother Catherine McEaddy Holmes says His lips were blue I thought he was dying The seizure ended in less than a minute And by the time an ambulance arrived Barton was back to his old self Even so doctors at Childrens National Medical Center in Washington DC where the family lives kept him overnight while they tried without success to figure out what had caused the seizure When Barton had a second seizure  days later doctors didnt hesitate They were very aggressive and wanted us to start medication immediately Holmes says So Barton who is  now began taking an antiepileptic drug called Keppra An aggressive response to a second unprovoked seizure is pretty standard these days says   who is Bartons doctor and runs the   at Childrens And thats a marked change from the approach of just a few decades ago When I was trained the general sense was that seizures were not necessarily a bad thing Gaillard says But a growing body of research shows that even some seizures once thought to be benign can affect the brain he says and frequent or prolonged seizures can eventually cause problems with memory and thinking So the new mantra in treating childhood epilepsy is no seizures no side effects Gaillard says Epileptic seizures are often compared to electrical storms in the brain They can last for a few seconds or a few minutes and may cause convulsions a loss of consciousness or just blank staring More than  children in the US have   In the past decade or so researchers have begun to replace the term epilepsy with epilepsies says   a program director at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke She says this reflects a new appreciation that epilepsy is more than one disorder with more than one cause Scientists have known for a long time that head injuries tumors or a lack of oxygen at birth can all lead to epilepsy But in recent years theyve also identified a range of genetic mutations that can lead to seizures by affecting the activity of nerve cells New brain imaging techniques have shown that even infrequent seizures can have subtle effects on a childs brain Fureman says One study found that seizures can actually change the way language centers in the brain develop That sort of research is why Bartons parents are determined to stop his seizures But it hasnt been easy It took months for doctors to find the right dose of Keppra for Barton Catherine McEaddy Holmes says For several months he was seizurefree But in May Barton had another seizure Holmes says So now hes taking a second drug called Trileptal Fortunately for Barton and kids like him doctors now have more and better ways to prevent seizures Gaillard says One major advance has been a series of new epilepsy drugs introduced since the early s that have fewer side effects Older drugs often left patients drowsy or feeling sedated Another recent advance has been the resurgence in the use of lowcarbohydrate diets including the highfat ketogenic diet that was used in the s and s before anticonvulsant drugs came along Scientists say these diets appear to change brain metabolism in a way that reduces seizures for some patients Then there are new implanted devices that send electrical signals to the   which runs from the abdomen to the brain The device can dramatically reduce seizures though it rarely stops them completely And for more than a decade now doctors have been able to provide parents and other caregivers with an emergency kit that lets them administer a fastacting drug to stop a seizure Its like carrying an insurance policy around with you Gaillard says This makes it easier for families to travel Its easier for kids to get out and about For some children though the most effective treatment is an old one surgery Epilepsy surgery is underutilized in this country Gaillard says adding that it represents the best chance at cure if the first round or two of medications is not effective Surgery isnt an option for all patients though Gaillard says The approach can work if theres only one problem area in the brain and if removing the area wont interfere with something like speech or memory For about  percent of children with epilepsy none of the existing treatments is adequate Fureman says one new approach that has worked in mice is different than anything previously tried It involves transplanting a type of cell that reduces excessive electrical activity in the brain Cell therapy may be one way that we can very specifically target the region of the brain that is overexcited and quiet that area of the brain Another experimental approach involves devices that monitor the brain for abnormal activity Some are able to predict when the brain activity is headed toward a seizure Fureman says and actually deliver stimulation that shuts down that seizure activity Despite all the improvements in treatment epilepsy can still take a toll on kids like Barton and on their families Catherine McEaddy Holmes says her yearold daughter Eaddy sometimes cant sleep because she is afraid her little brother will have another seizure The family also has absorbed some big medical bills even though they have insurance And instead of using babysitters theyve now hired a fulltime caregiver who knows what to do if Barton has a seizure Its all worth it Holmes says if it means Barton can do the things other kids do We have this precious child whos perfect she says We want to make sure that we dont let the seizures stop him from having the life that we want him to have
