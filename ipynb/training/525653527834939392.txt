Working within the public sector inevitably comes with its perks and its disadvantages The recent NHS and civil service strikes show infuriation over pay cuts and job losses is stronger than ever But equally public service jobs are interesting challenging and handson and at their best come with a feeling of fulfilment and accomplishment And often this feeling is passed down through the generations So what is it that spurs people on to follow in their parents footsteps down the road of greater public good From NHS workers to Teachfirst advocates being part of the mesh that ties our community together also ties families together Joseph Stone  a trainee social worker in child protection on the Frontline training programme comes from a family devoted to the public sector My dad is a palliative doctor and my mum is a special educational needs worker in a state school he says Throughout my family weve always wanted to support others He explains how being involved with his parents work from a young age helped him decide on his future When we were little I my sisters and my mum went into dads work at Christmas and sang with the patients Theres a massive positive side from working with people in that way he says I also have dyslexia so had support at school and got to see the side of work my mum did with special educational needs I realised if there arent people supporting these individuals in society then they wouldnt be able to reach their full potential Aside from this need to help people what other factors come into play Gillian Marnie from Dundee has worked in the NHS for  years and is an assistant information governance officer answering the publics queries and dealing with Freedom of Information requests Her first job was at the thenpublic British Telecom the same company her father worked for before later moving into the NHS I didnt know anyone in the NHS I started as a part time receptionist because of the hours and location she says Now a keen advocate for the NHS she has helped her sister get a job in the organisation and hopes her yearold son Fraser will soon follow suit Fraser is desperate to get into the NHS she says Ive persuaded him its a great career Conditions are very good  if he was ill and needed time off theyd recognise it and would be very good with that Theres job security and the terms and conditions are excellent Weve got more annual leave than most people at  days a year Fraser who is studying biomedical science at university agrees that the job security has attracted him to the sector The NHS has a clear pay structure and further employment opportunities he says I also like the idea of going into healthcare and processing patient samples because you are helping patients to get diagnosed and cured In the private sector its more researchbased His mothers involvement in the sector has certainly swayed him My mum has influenced me on a subconscious level he says Shes always worked in the NHS and while Ive grown up Ive picked up what the NHS is about Steve Cook a yearold watch manager in the fire and rescue service also followed in his fathers footsteps who served for  years while his mum worked as a primary school teaching assistant As far back as possible I have had an interest in joining the fire and rescue service he says People have asked whether I joined because my dad had been a firefighter I always say I dont know Maybe because thats all I have known Steves wife is also a primary school teacher He explains that their jobs complement each other as he goes into schools to give safety advice and raise awareness of the fire service while she helps with his assignments for teaching qualifications as part of his training Working in public services isnt really an ethos within the family as such  it is just what we do and have always done he says yearold Finn Madell on the other hand who followed her mother into social work says that the public welfare ethos in her family has always been strong There are strong socialist roots in my family My little boy was really keen to take lots of food in for the harvest festival collection for the food bank last week That made me and my husband really proud Whether the influence is built on social values subconscious instinct or practical reasons its obvious that devotion to the public service is passed down through generations Regardless of field the satisfaction gained from helping people on a daily basis must be addictive I dont think I could ever do a job where I was sitting at a desk says social worker Joseph Stone I like to come back from a day thinking Ive achieved something tangible  and thats all around working with people
