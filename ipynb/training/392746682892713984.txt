Getting a flu vaccine is associated with a lower risk of death in people with heart disease a review of studies has found and the effect is greatest in those who have had a recent heart attack or chest pain The review included five randomized trials that involved more than  heart patients In all there were  heart attacks and other major cardiovascular events and  deaths from heart disease  For patients with stable heart disease a vaccination decreased the relative risk for a cardiovascular event by  percent For those who had had a heart attack within the last year the effect was greater a  percent reduction in relative risk Over all those who were vaccinated had a  percent reduced risk of death The authors acknowledge that their conclusions are based on a relatively small number of cardiovascular events and deaths At the same time the review   covered all randomized trials done on the subject and there is no suggestion of inconsistency among them People who dont like vaccines probably dont like dying from heart attacks either said the lead author Dr Jacob A Udell a cardiologist at the University of Toronto Maybe this is a good enough reason for the skeptics to go and get their flu shots
