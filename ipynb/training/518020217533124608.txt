Tobacco plants may hold the key In the world of health and medicine the word tobacco usually brings to mind cancer emphysema and heart disease But in recent years the plants tarnished reputation is getting a makeover from the development of pharmaceuticals through an effective swift and costcutting technique that has been dubbed biopharming  Tobacco plantbased drugs are not a new concept But there are no treatments currently developed through tobacco plants that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration That may change as the deadly Ebola virus continues to spread through West Africa where it has killed more than  Kentucky BioProcessing in Owensboro was one of the first biopharmaceutical companies   through tobacco plants The company has been working in collaboration with San Diegobased Mapp Biophamaceutical which developed the ZMapp vaccine since August  Eyes have also turned to Texasbased biotechnology company Caliber Biotherapeutics which that same month claimed it was ready to fasttrack the drug if need be The company which says it operates the largest tobaccobased pharmaceutical facility in the world has been working on cutting costs and increasing quantities of certain cancer drugs through genetically modified tobacco  Drugs and vaccines are manufactured in a variety of ways   for example are most commonly produced by injecting fertilized hen eggs with the virus The virus is incubated for days so it can replicate be harvested inactivated or weakened and then made into either a flu shot or nasal spray  The process can cost around   using  eggs each day Tobacco plants can produce antibodies in much less time for a fraction of the cost advocates say  The process begins by cloning a gene and inserting it into a virus That infected gene is then injected into the tobacco plant where it multiplies within the leaves before it is extracted and purified  Unlike with eggbased and mammalian cellbased products each tobacco plant can produce enough antibodies for  of a pharmaceutical experts say The plants are also easy to contain and manufacture in controlled environments such as greenhouses Medicago Inc a biopharmaceutical company in North Carolina produced  million flu vaccines in  days using tobacco plants in a federally funded effort called   The program tested the prospect of rapid vaccine production in the hypothetical case of a global health pandemic It is estimated the company could make as many as  million doses for as little as  million The Canadian biopharmaceutical company PlantForm is using tobacco to produce a drug that reduces the growth rate of breast cancer tumors The drug is a   form of a current drug on the market called Herceptin usually produced by creating antibodies in   from hamsters ovaries  The current treatment costs up to   according to PlantForm The company estimates up to  million could be saved   by manufacturing the drug with tobacco plants instead One of the pioneering programs to use tobacco for vaccine manufacturing is the University of Louisvilles Owensboro Cancer Research Program in Kentucky Since  it has used a relative of tobacco called   to develop vaccines for everything from cholera to cervical cancer In August the center  it had received a  million grant to produce a gel made from crushed tobacco leaves that prevents HIV transmission The process involves isolating a protein called   which can be found in red algae The protein fends off HIV by sticking onto the outer surface of an HIVinfected cell shielding noninfected cells from the virus Once isolated the protein is injected into the tobacco plant and then extracted  days later It is then crushed purified and mixed into a gel that can be used as a lubricant Our hope is for the gel to be as effective as the condom senior scientist Dr Kenneth Palmer said Palmer a native of Zimbabwe has been studying plantbased pharmaceuticals since  when he received his doctorate at the University of Cape Town in South Africa Before working with tobacco Palmer studied the prospects of using corn to develop pharmaceuticals But while edible plants are just as wellsuited as tobacco for biopharming Palmer said they are not the way to go You dont want to risk contaminating the food supply with pharmaceuticals One company learned that the hard way In  ProdiGene a biopharmaceutical company based out of College Station Texas was fined  million after a cornproduced vaccine for diabetes and diarrhea nearly   a crop of soybeans in Nebraska and Iowa The incident ignited a massive backlash against the development of plantbased pharmaceuticals and the FDA and US Department of Agriculture implemented new and stricter regulations for fieldtesting of pharmaceuticals engineered through food crops To date there is only one plantbased pharmaceutical approved by the FDA   which contains an enzyme engineered through carrot cells The medication treats   a rare genetic disorder that stops cells and organs from functioning properly Palmer doesnt blame the FDA for the bottleneck in biopharmaceutical approval Rather he concedes that compared with competing technology used to make pharmaceuticals biopharming is still relatively new He sees the success of ZMapp as a big catalyst for movement in the industry Unfortunate as it is the Ebola epidemic in West Africa is a huge leg up for the field Palmer said I think it will only help validate the technology as a viable option
