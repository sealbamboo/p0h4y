If youre among the estimated  million Americans who suffer from osteoarthritis of the knee or hip then perhaps youve tried the nutritional supplements glucosamine and chondroitin Theyve been marketed for joint health for about  years and sales are still brisk But do they help Some horses might say yes The supplements were first tried in horses and theres some   that the supplements might improve joint function for them Glucosamine and chondroitin are also marketed to dog owners But what about us humans Unfortunately researchers say that for us the results just dont match the glowing testimonials It would seem to make sense that glucosamine and chondroitin could help Theyre both natural substances found in cartilage that hard connective tissue that pads joints Glucosamine is an amino sugar that may help renew cartilage and chondroitin sulfate is a complex carbohydrate that is thought to help cartilage retain water   causes pain swelling and stiffness in joints and damages cartilage over time So the thought was maybe extra glucosamine and chondroitin could help maintain and even repair the damage That was plausible enough for the National Institutes of Health to fund a  million   to test the supplements effectiveness It assigned  people around the country to take either glucosamine chondroitin a combination of the two an antiinflammatory drug   or a placebo Neither participants nor the researchers knew what they were taking The vast majority of patients reported no significant difference in pain relief between glucosamine chondroitin a combination of the two and placebo In all  percent of patients taking the sugar pill said their pain was reduced by about  percent while  percent of those taking the supplements reported similar pain reduction The   were published in  in the  But for a small subset of patients those with moderate to severe arthritis pain in a knee there was some benefit About  percent had a  percent or greater reduction in pain compared to about  percent for placebo says   a rheumatologist at the University of Utah Hospital and Clinics and coleader of the GAIT study So some patients who have severe pain may get more benefit than somebody whos got a mild case Because the number of patients in that group was so small Sawitzke cautions that finding is only preliminary and needs to be confirmed by further study Two large studies currently underway one in Europe and one in Australia may help answer that question Theyre expected to wrap up within one year which Sawitzke says will either reopen the debate or put an end to it depending on the results But the findings from the GAIT study were crystal clear says   a rheumatologist at Boston University School of Medicine There was just no benefit for most patients who took the supplements compared to placebo meaning that it didnt relieve pain any better than placebo The supplements didnt affect structure of the joint they did Xrays and it didnt cause any delay in the progression of the disease compared to placebo he adds It basically didnt have any effect On the other hand Felson says he doesnt disabuse patients of the notion that the supplements are helping if patients truly believe they are even though a months supply can cost  to  Far be it from me to take away either the placebo effect or an idiosyncratic reaction that might be of benefit he says And if taking supplements or a placebo pill make it more likely that people will be active and lose weight thats a good thing according to   a rheumatologist and spokesperson for   My goal as a practicing physician is to decrease pain so patients will actually do the things that really make a difference in terms of changing the natural history of osteoarthritis which is weight reduction and physical activity she notes People have a hard time exercising and losing weight if they hurt Theres abundant evidence that losing weight and regular exercise are the   available for osteoarthritis pain White adds Its quite striking she says If you lose only five pounds youre talking about the equivalent of  pounds less stress across those knees so you can imagine it would make quite a difference Pretty much any type of exercise seems to reduce pain and increase flexibility according to Felson There have been a variety of different exercise studies which have tried everything from water aerobics to walking to muscle strengthening and they all seem to work
