A test that analyzes fetal DNA found in a pregnant womans blood proved much more accurate in screening for Down syndrome and another chromosomal disorder than the nowstandard blood test a new study has found The promising results may change how prenatal screening for genetic diseases is done though the test is costly and generally not yet covered by insurance for women at low risk The study published on Wednesday in   found that the fetal DNA test was  times better in predicting cases of Down syndrome than the standard blood test and ultrasound screening and five times better in predicting the other disorder Trisomy  It also greatly reduced the number of falsepositive results It could prevent many women who would otherwise get the standard blood test from needing to confirm positive results with invasive tests like amniocentesis or   which can be stressful much more costly and carry small risks of miscarriage Nine out of  women who are currently being referred for further testing would not need invasive tests said the lead author of the study Dr Diana Bianchi the executive director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Centers Floating Hospital for Children A positive result on the DNA screening would still need to be confirmed with invasive tests because in more than half the cases in which the newer test predicted a disorder there was no chromosomal abnormality But a negative result would provide confidence that these two major chromosomal disorders are absent Its a better mousetrap theres no doubt about that said Dr Michael Greene director of obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital and coauthor of an   If the test is normal the overwhelming probability is that your fetus is normal There will be far fewer women who will be encouraged to have invasive testing and as a result far fewer miscarriages The screen analyzes blood from women who are at least  weeks pregnant At that point about  percent of DNA in the blood will be fetal DNA from the placenta Dr Bianchi said Dr Bianchi is a paid advisory board member for Illumina one of the laboratories that performs the test which is known as the   because the fetal DNA floats freely in the mothers blood not inside a cell Illumina which is based in San Diego financed the study Dr Greene an associate editor at The New England Journal of Medicine said that the study would sort of be purer from an academic perspective if somebody else pays for it but that companies are the ones that are going to finance the research to get it to where its marketable He added We cant have our cake and eat it too He said the journal had rejected other cellfree DNA studies but considered this one well done Experts said they expected the test would ultimately be offered to all pregnant women but noted limitations The test costing  to  is not now typically covered by insurance for women at low risk for having babies with chromosomal abnormalities Nor is it regulated by the Food and Drug Administration because it is considered laboratory developed to be used by the lab that created them and not sold to other labs or companies Dr Greene said The test also appears to work inconsistently in very obese women And it screens only for major chromosomal disorders and some sexlinked diseases This is a very good screening test for what its designed to screen for said Dr Ignatia B Van den Veyver a prenatal geneticist at Baylor College of Medicine But she added were concerned that if women stop there they miss the opportunity to have a diagnostic test like amnio that can detect other chromosomal abnormalities For now this new technology which became available in  is primarily used for women deemed more likely to have babies with abnormalities because they are age  or older or have other risk factors At least four companies offer the tests Medical organizations for other women because of a lack of data showing they work in the general population The new study which involved  pregnant women from diverse backgrounds at  medical sites around the country is the first large study to evaluate the cellfree DNA screen in average American women Most women in the study were younger than  had conceived naturally and were pregnant with their first child Dr Deborah A Driscoll a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the research said that given this new evidence this should be a test that we can offer women universally The women received standard screening from their doctors a blood test that identifies proteins or other biological markers associated with chromosomal disorders Some also got ultrasounds examining the fetuss neck for fluid associated with Down syndrome Separately and without knowing the results of the standard tests technicians at the Illumina lab screened samples of the womens blood for three copies of chromosomes instead of the normal two seeking to identify chromosomes for Down syndrome and for Trisomies  and  often fatal disorders Researchers later checked whether babies were born with or without these conditions In the study the rate of false positives for Down syndrome was  percent with the cellfree DNA screening while the rate for standard screening was  percent  times higher The falsepositive rate for Trisomy  was  percent with the DNA screening the rate with standard screening was three times that Not everyone received standard screens for Trisomy  so complete comparisons could not be made The DNA screen was correct in predicting Down syndrome  percent of the time while the rate for standard screens was  percent The DNA screen accurately predicted babies with Trisomy  almost  percent of the time five times better than standard screening whose rate was  percent The cellfree DNA screen worked equally well in first second or third trimesters and in high and lowrisk women Since positive tests are often wrong women should get positive findings verified with amniocentesis or CVS experts aid The greatest risk is that the test will be oversold or overinterpreted and that women wont take the step of an invasive diagnostic procedure before they do something irreversible like terminate a pregnancy Dr Greene said In the study one of the five fetuses with Down syndrome was aborted one of two with Trisomy  was stillborn and the sole fetus with Trisomy  died in utero The other five chromosomally abnormal babies were born alive Jennifer Fontaine  of Groveland Mass was not in the study but chose cellfree DNA screening last year after standard screening showed an elevated risk of Trisomy  in her fetus She was offered amniocentesis but she said I wanted the noninvasive procedure Her DNA screen was negative for Trisomy  and her daughter Morgan was born healthy
