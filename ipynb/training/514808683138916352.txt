An epidemic had been raging for months in nearby Guinea but Ebola was not considered as a possible diagnosis After all nobody at Phebe had ever seen a patient before with Ebola and as the axiom goes in medicine when you hear hoof beats think horses not zebras Certainly dont start imagining unicorns The nurse who cared for the woman that night drew her blood and helped her to the toilet to urinate When the woman began vomiting and soiled her sheets the nurse cleaned up the mess as nurses do all over the world every day   For a disease whose transmission depends on the direct contact of one human being with the body fluids of another Ebola has no better customer than nurses The other thing about nurses that the virus finds particularly helpful is they tend to work in shifts Before the week was out Bong Countys first Ebola patient had died and seven nurses caring for her had fallen ill Six of them would also die in the coming weeks  The remaining clinical staff watching their colleagues falling ill all around them abandoned the hospital When the patients saw what was happening those well enough to walk out did just that  Over the ensuing months the epidemic rippled across Bong Hundreds of individuals were infected and perhaps more importantly basic social institutions also began to collapse  One by one all three hospitals in the county shut down due to fear of the spread of the virus followed by most of the primary care clinics Women were left without midwives to deliver their babies accident victims without emergency rooms to care with them Next the primary schools closed then the secondary schools and finally Cuttington University  Ebola is not just a disease of individuals but also one that infects societys most basic health and social welfare structures As a disease that afflicts health care institutions it is perhaps fitting that the most powerful weapon in the fight against Ebola is not a single drug or vaccine but instead a particular type of health care institution the Ebola Treatment Unit or ETU  On September  I helped International Medical Corps open the first ETU in Bong County I have worked in many hospitals both rich and poor and have set up refugee camp clinics and trauma field hospitals in povertystricken and wartorn countries  But managing an ETU has been an entirely different experience  The primary goal of a hospital or clinic is to care for patients and if possible to save their lives The primary goal of an ETU is to protect the lives of its staff  The secondary goal is to protect surrounding communities and resuscitate local health care systems by taking patients suspected of having Ebola out of their homes and hospital emergency rooms breaking the chain of transmission  Caring for patients comes third on the list of priorities though still remains important After all why would people go to an ETU if they did not think there was at least a chance that it would help make them better During the week before opening our ETU I can honestly say that I worked harder and slept less than during any other time in my life The sheer number of details involved in the construction and management of this unique type of health care facility is almost endless  First a site had to be chosen which has been a significant roadblock to the opening of other ETUs Hospitals tend to be built close to the communities they serve most communities however tend to want their ETU as far away as possible  Our ETU sits in the middle of a forest  kilometers more than a mile down a rough dirt road on the grounds of an old leper colony Perhaps it is not surprising that the survivors of one of humanitys oldest and most stigmatized diseases would be among the few to welcome a treatment facility for one of the newest stigmatized diseases  Second the design and infrastructure of the ETU had to be perfected with separate spaces and wards designating different levels of risk where staff members would know to take different kinds of precautions  A borehole was drilled and giant tanks erected to mix up the nearly  liters of chlorine required each day to disinfect the ETU and its staff properly A giant incinerator was built to burn the vast amounts of infected waste produced by the facility safely Third supplies had to be purchased both the normal kind present in any hospital such as bed sheets and intravenous fluids but also the expensive and increasingly difficult to purchase personal protective equipment A single outfit of boots gloves suit mask hood goggles and apron costs as much as  and at full capacity the ETU might go through  outfits a day Finally and most importantly local staff had to be hired and trained to work in the facility While a small team of expatriates working with International Medical Corps manages our ETU more than  of the staffing remains local  During the week before opening our facility I helped organize an intensive training for our first  staff members including physician assistants nurses nursing aids hygienists sprayers safety monitors waste handlers chlorinators laundry staff and burial team members to ensure they knew how to protect their health and the health of their colleagues while working in the ETU Just  hours before our opening day we had a checklist of almost  items ranging from goggles to gravediggers that we still needed to be able to begin admitting patients safely to the ETU The pressure to open the ETU had been building for weeks as the numbers of cases of Ebola in the county began to skyrocket  Somehow and Im still not sure how we made it happen
