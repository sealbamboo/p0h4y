
 One in two adults takes a daily vitamin pill and Americans spend tens of billions of dollars each year on supplements Now a small coterie of physicians writing in a leading medical journal has offered this blunt advice Stop   money In an unusually direct opinion piece the five authors say that for healthy Americans worried about chronic disease theres no clear benefit to taking vitamin and mineral pills And in some instances they may even cause harm The authors make an exception for supplemental   which they say needs further research Even so widespread use of vitamin D pills is not based on solid evidence that benefits outweigh harms the authors wrote For other   and supplements the case is closed The message is simple the editorial continued Most supplements do not prevent chronic disease or death their use is not justified and they should be avoided We have so much information from so many studies Dr Cynthia Mulrow senior deputy editor of   and an author of the editorial said in an interview We dont need a lot more evidence to put this to bed Officials with the   a trade organization that represents supplement suppliers and retailers said they were shocked by what they termed an attack on their industry pointing to a study published last year that found a modest reduction in overall cancers in a long randomized controlled trial of  male doctors Our members market and sell their products in order to assist people to achieve a healthier lifestyle said John Shaw executive director of the association adding that he could not understand why the industry was being criticized for trying to promote health and wellness Demand for vitamin and mineral supplements has grown markedly in recent years with domestic   More than half of Americans used at least one   from  up from  percent from  according to national health surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The most popular products are multivitamin and mineral supplements which are   in the United States according to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Whether regular longterm use can prevent heart disease and   has never been clearly established and the authors of the editorial are not the first to point that out  which publishes reviews of medical evidence has also concluded that taking vitamins does not extend life An updated review of the evidence by the United States Preventive Services Task Force published online on Nov  likewise concluded that there was limited evidence that vitamin and mineral supplementation could prevent cancer or cardiovascular disease The task force pointed out however that two clinical trials had found slight cancer reductions among men who took multivitamins Yet other studies have found that   supplements may actually increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers the task force review noted and that   and may increase the risk of death The editorial in the Annals is accompanied by two new studies reporting dismal results for multivitamins in helping preserve cognitive function and preventing heart attacks In one study of nearly  male physicians  and older participants who took a multivitamin for over a decade were no more likely to retain cognitive function as they aged than similar doctors who took a dummy pill But   one of the lead authors of that study said that since physicians tend to have healthy diets and be wellnourished the added nutrients may not have made a difference in their cases I do think theres room for more research said Dr Grodstein who did not write or sign the editorial Demonstrating the prevention of chronic diseases can take decades and conducting longterm randomized controlled trials is both tricky and very costly We dont and probably never will have randomized trial data over decades she said The results of another clinical trial published in the journal found that highdose vitamins and minerals did not protect heart attack patients  and older from experiencing additional cardiovascular events though the research was marred by a high dropout rate There have been few randomized clinical studies of the effects of multivitamins and minerals on heart disease cancer and risk of death said   of the   who led the task force review A draft of new task force recommendations based on the updated review said there was insufficient evidence to recommend taking or not taking vitamins But Dr Fortmann who also did not write or sign the editorial suggested that those who buy vitamins may be throwing their money away adding Dont think it makes up for a bad diet that you can eat a lot of fast food and then take a bunch of supplements Thats not a good idea
