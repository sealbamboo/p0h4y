When the government unveiled its plans for a  cap on elderly care costs from  ministers were quick to claim they had solved the problem The era of huge bills for care an issue which resulted in tens of thousands of people selling their own homes each year was over they said But as politicians and campaigners sift through detail it is becoming more and more clear that all is not quite as it seems One of the measures trumpeted by ministers was the fact that the bill individuals face could be deferred by getting councils to pay for the care and then allowing them to recoup it from an individuals estate after their death This option is already available in some areas but under the changes every council would have to offer it they said But it has now emerged the option of deferring payments will not be open to wealthier people Only those needing residential care who have assets of less than  excluding the value of their home will be able to get their local council to pay the costs For example it means someone with  in the bank when they enter a care home will have to pay the bills as they come in until that has been reduced to  Only then will they be able to defer the costs Labour peer Lord Lipsey believes this is such a significant loophole that it amounts to a sabotaging of the safeguards The  cap will not include the amount an individual pays for the hotel costs of a care home  that is to say the normal cost of daily living such as food energy bills and the accommodation Under the reforms these socalled hotel costs will be set at  a year For a typical care home place that accounts for about a third of the fees Therefore it would mean that an individual could find themselves paying over  over three years  in care fees and  in hotel costs before the cap kicks in And once it does they will still be liable for the ayear hotel costs until their wealth is whittled away With any system there is always winners and losers In this case it is those in the middle The poorest will continue to get social care free as they do now  But those with assets of over  including the value of property will be liable for care home costs until they reach the  cap or their assets fall below the mark It means those with assets of between  and  face losing between a third and nearly a half of their in care costs That compares to  for people with below  and a sixth for those with  Those even wealthier than that lose even less It will be up to local authorities to calculate how much an individual has to pay They will do this by working out the average they pay for care home places for those who get state help This will stop people moving into a luxury care home and racking up  in costs in super quick time Fair enough you might say But the problem  recognised by the Health Select Committee earlier this year  is that councils with the benefit of buying places in bulk can often negotiate lower fees than an individual can This could lead to disputes over what the true costs are The original proposals suggested setting the cap at a much lower level But in the end ministers came up with the figure of  This was not plucked out of thin air Once a person enters a care home not many live beyond two years In that time just those requiring the most intensive care are ever likely to accrue bills in excess of  It means only an estimated one in eight people will benefit from the cap according to estimates by the government And that is why Age UK which has been campaigning for years for reform of the social care funding system sees the cap as only a start It argues the cap only benefits those with the greatest needs who end up in care homes for a considerable amount of time
