One legend says it all began when a North African herder saw his goats eat some wild berries then frolic with unusual verve Another story cites a few small leaves blown off a nearby bush into the Chinese emperors mug of hot water Either way whether caffeine entered the life of man by coffee bean or tea leaf happiness ensued Happiness that is for all but the poor souls charged with saving us from our drugs for no regulatory challenge trumps the one posed by caffeine molecule of elegant enjoyment and increasing abuse mans best friend and occasional killer As Murray Carpenter makes clear in his methodical review our societys metrics are no match for this substances nuances whether among athletes teenagers experimental subjects or the average dependent Joe   Pure caffeine is a bitter white powder In the body it blocks the effects of the molecule adenosine a crucial brake on many physiologic processes With just enough caffeine in the system the bodys organs become a little more themselves the brain a little brainier the muscles a little springier the blood vessels a little tighter the digestion a little more efficient With too much caffeine all can accelerate into cardiac arrest It takes only about  milligrams of caffeine less than a cup of coffee or can of cola for stimulative effects to be noticeable A hundred milligrams a day will hook most people They feel immensely unhappy without their daily fix and the organs all whine in protest for a few days It takes more than  grams to kill you  a dose impossible to achieve with traditional beverages alone However the new caffeinerich energy shots make it alarmingly easy for partyminded people to achieve the zone between enough and much too much A freelance journalist who has written for The New York Times Mr Carpenter dutifully circles the globe to visit the various landmarks of caffeine history the birthplace of chocolate in the Soconusco region of Mexicos Pacific Coast a tea shop in Beijing a coffee plantation in Colombia where the local brew is nothing special most of the best beans are exported Then it is off to some of the newer landmarks of the industry including the Vermont headquarters of Green Mountain pioneering developer of the individual KCups whose freshly brewed ounce portions replaced the fetid pot of office coffee Mr Carpenter has no luck in his efforts to tour some of the other new outposts namely the factories in China and India that now supply softdrink companies with synthesized caffeine powder None of these plants would allow him in And none of the employees he found smoking outside the worlds largest plant in Shijiazhuang China had much to say  When I asked if it was modern and sophisticated on the inside they said Yes it isÂ  This industrial caution is emblematic of the shuffle performed by the beverage industry over the last century around the subject of caffeine From its beginnings in the late th century CocaCola was advertised as a stimulant In  the federal government seized an interstate shipment of syrup charging that the beverages caffeine content violated the Pure Food and Drug Act It took five years for the CocaCola Company to win that case whereupon it promptly reduced the amount of caffeine in the proprietary formula Industry policy began to emphasize the sodas taste over its buzz with caffeine increasingly characterized in the words of one corporate report as a flavor concentrate ingredient In  the American Beverage Association baldly stated in a news release Caffeine is not a drug But even while vigorously playing down the pharmaceutical qualities of their sodas the big beverage makers now cheerfully bottle their own versions of concentrated caffeinecontaining energy products including some that have been associated with   and the rare death So whats a regulatory agency to do Athletic organizations disagree As of Mr Carpenters writing the Olympic Committee no longer included caffeine in its drug screens but the National Collegiate Athletic Association did The Food and Drug Administration faced with a huge array of caffeinecontaining foods beverages and supplements leaves most of them alone although it did   The FDAs equivalents elsewhere in the world have imposed more stringent controls Canada restricts the caffeine content of both energy drinks and sodas while Europe mandates that the labels of highcaffeine beverages disclose the precise amount in the same field of vision as the brand name Mr Carpenter packs all this and more into a dataheavy narrative that occasionally degenerates into regrettable summary moments such as one chapters finale Caffeine can really mess with your head The big numbers are all here tons produced cups consumed dollars spent along with the results of many many studies of experimentally caffeinated athletes soldiers and students But if you are a person whose best most accepting most forgiving friend in a cold world is all too often contained in a steaming ounce mug and you crave a few poetic words of tribute to the fragrant magic of your faithful companion Mr Carpenter never quite provides them His best homage consists of the last line of his acknowledgments when finished with friends family sources and editors he graciously thanks the bitter white powder that inspired this book and provided the focus and stamina to write it
