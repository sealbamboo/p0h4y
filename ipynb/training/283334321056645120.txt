This is a story about loss and meaning Its the story of a boy who died and a mother who tottered at the precipice of despair Its about faith  not in God but in the ability to build from ashes The story begins in a Phoenix office building Here at the weekly   group for grieving parents about a dozen people mostly women are telling their stories One mothers son was murdered Anothers daughter died a month after she was born A baby was born premature a yearold boy died in a skateboarding accident As the stories unfold Maya Thompson is on the verge of tears Shes pregnant and all this talk of death rattles her Shes seen a childs death up close Her son Ronan died of cancer in May  just three days before his fourth birthday I called him my spicy little monkey because out of all of my three kids he was very strongwilled and a little rebel Maya recalls the next day in her Phoenix home He was my little sidekick I think from the time he was born we werent really ever separated She flips through a photo album chronicling the brief life and decline of her son a sturdy blond boy with eyes so brilliantly blue that you did a doubletake Ronan was her third son and the most robust He rarely had a sniffle She points to a striking snapshot This was about two weeks before he was diagnosed He looks perfectly happy and healthy she says in wonder He was fine right But he wasnt The cancer spread invisibly until one day Maya noticed that Ronans left eyelid was drooping At first the doctors thought it was an infection or a stye but eventually they realized the boy had stage  neuroblastoma a cancer of the nervous system Maya began   right after Ronan was diagnosed Her   dated Aug   is called The Journey Begins It is hopeful Initially Maya and her husband Woody were optimistic even though  percent of children with stage  neuroblastoma die As we marched through it the cancer kept dissipating and he was tolerating the treatments very well Woody says And so we were we were very optimistic Just looking at him and his spirit we really did think Yes maybe the odds are against us but we feel like if anybodys going to go up against these odds its going to be him  They were very naive at the time Maya says I will never be naive again I mean I just had an ultrasound yesterday where I made the technician check for a mass in my unborn babys stomach The cancer can start in a fetuss stomach Maya explains Over the next eight months Maya continued blogging At first she did it for family and friends but soon the blog began drawing millions of readers Mayas writing was raw lurching from giddy hope to anguish to blazing anger Heres what she wrote a week before Ronan died Ronan died on May   For months Maya prayed she would simply die I went through a very long period of not caring about myself or anybody around me she says But to come out of that I almost feel like Ive been reborn again And you either let this pain kill you or you let it make you stronger I mean its a choice She set up the   to try to develop a cure for neuroblastoma and blogged almost daily about her pain and her plans for the organization A few months after Ronans death Maya was given tickets to a Taylor Swift concert and a chance to meet the young star before the show Maya assumed a friend had set it all up She was standing in the green room her back to the door she recalls And I heard this girl come walking in saying Maya Maya Maya Maya And I turned around and it was Taylor Maya continues I had no idea that she even knew who I was or who Ronan was But shed been reading my blog for a really long time and her parents had been reading it as well and they were just heartbroken over our story The two women talked and Swift left to perform A year went by and then one day in September of this year Mayas phone rang It was Taylor Swift She said she had written a song about Ronan She had used a lot of the words off my blog so she asked if she could make me coauthor Maya says Taylor performed the song Ronan at the Stand Up To Cancer benefit concert in September nearly breaking down at one point The song has sold more than  copies on iTunes and Swift is donating her half to cancer research Maya is putting her share of the proceeds  about   into the Ronan Thompson Foundation And donations also poured in many from Swifts fans who call themselves Swifties Ive got these little girls writing me saying You know I have  its yours Or I want to be a pediatric oncologist now Youve changed my life  Maya says I mean all these little tween girls that my son is helping to see whats really important in life With the money Maya hopes to fund clinical trials and build a worldclass neuroblastoma research center Its an admittedly ambitious plan but I would never bet against my wife Woody says These days Maya spends a lot of her time on the cancer floor at Phoenix Childrens Hospital She says its the only place she feels at peace The world that I used to belong in and exist in will never exist for me again she says So this new life is completely different and I find it extremely beautiful and heartwarming and inspiring and hopeful in a way She says trying to defeat the cancer that stole Ronan is now her lifes work I made him a lot of promises You know my biggest one to him was that I was going to fix him and obviously that didnt happen Maya says So my next big promise to him was that I would fix the world and continue to fight for him since he cant be here to fight for himself anymore And then fight for these other kids as well The enemy has been engaged The Ronan Thompson Foundation has raised  and has just funded its first clinical trial at The Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia Its a victory  but one that Maya would instantly trade to have another day with her son
