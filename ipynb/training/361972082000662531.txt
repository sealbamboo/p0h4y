Mac now  got to work putting one foot in front of the other But it wasnt long before he looked down and saw smoke emerging from underneath the treadmills track The trainer rushed in quickly explaining that the treadmill was old on its last leg and he would set Mac up on a better one  Mac obediently followed the trainer to another treadmill The track moved and Mac walked Before another  minutes passed smoke again rose from underneath the belt After that I knew enough to stay off the treadmills he says That was another one of my excuses Mac would balloon to more than  pounds and be attacked by a lifethreatening flesheating bacteria before reentering a gym with any serious intention to improve his health But when he did the stayathome dad would lose  pounds in less than three years At  feet tall Mac was always a big guy says his best friend Tim Scrivner owner of   and   a Texasbased adventure raceevent company The men met when they were sophomores in high school at   I played tailback and he was an offensive tackle which made me automatically like him says Scrivner   Mac weighed between  and  pounds when he played football and made allstate his junior and senior year He played one year in junior college and then quit  Football wasnt life for him says Scrivner His personality was being a big nice guy that everybody loves Mac moved to the family farm near   where people began noticing his rapid weight gain His younger brother Clint remembers visiting and seeing a minifridge in the living room next to Macs chair I think he never stopped putting in the calories even though he was no longer expending them he says Mac was up to  pounds and taking classes at   in  when he met his future wife Jessica McDonald He was the cool guy that had the cool apartment that everybody hung out at she says A year later Mac asked Jessica on a date She accepted with reservations I remember telling a friend I dont want anything serious because Ive got goals to accomplish and he is not very healthy she says But Mac won her over with his chivalry and charm Jessica remembers that they were only supposed to go miniature golfing on their first date but ended up going to dinner and a movie too I remember thinking Oh mercy Im in deep she says Macs relationship with Jessica did not change his eating habits Fast food continued to contribute to his weight gain Hed devour bacon double cheeseburgers from Whataburger gobble chicken McNuggets from McDonalds and wolf down bean burritos from Taco Bell When these offthechart sodium servings made him thirsty hed wash them down with the nectar of the Gods Dr Pepper Nothing could keep him from frequenting these eateries even hitting the big  on the scale Thats the thing about drivethrough windows he says You can hide when you order five things and they ask you if youd like two drinks with it Jessica remembers going on vacation to the   near Asheville North Carolina where she toured the mansions sprawling gardens by herself because Mac was too embarrassed to walk around I wanted to be so protective of him because people would just stare she says He saw the world from the seat in the car In November  Mac saw the world from a hospital bed when necrotizing fasciitis a flesheating skin bacteria assaulted the left side of his body The infection was dangerously close to his heart forcing doctors to remove softballsize chunks of infected tissue   Mac tried to laugh off what was happening but the situation scared him He didnt want to die A year later Mac hit  pounds and realized he had to try to lose weight There is not an aha moment he says It was more like OK if Im going to try to do this Im going to have to do it a little bit at a time But I better do something before I lose my family to my untimely demise Mac started dabbling at Scrivners gym Next he gave up fast food and allyoucaneat buffets Then stopped ordering soft drinks Finally he started buying healthy food from the grocery store Mac describes his strategy as the lowhanging fruit method It allowed him to lose weight without having gastric bypass surgery hiring a nutritionist or discovering a dieting secret folks in Hollywood would give their big toe to know about It was simple but it wasnt easy says Mac I knew that I had to make a change because I was sick and tired of not being able to do anything I wanted to do Rachel Berman a registered dietician and director of nutrition for   says setting small attainable goals like the ones Mac made is a better approach to weight loss than using an allornothing mentality because people appreciate the progress that comes from each change If you do too much at once it can be overwhelming and that makes you less likely to maintain it she says Scrivner says he avoided Mac when he first started showing up at the gym asking members to not say anything to his friend Weve hounded him so much over the years he says We were all just kind of holding our breath and hoping he would stick with it After Mac lost about  pounds Scrivner approached him about entering an upcoming Jailbreak race Together they made a video inviting people to sign up to run the approximately mile obstacle course promising Mac was going to keep exercising and enter the event too True to his word Mac competed in the Jailbreak race at  pounds I just knew I wanted to complete it says Mac I remember crossing the finish line and being ecstatic He has since entered and completed K and K runs a halfmarathon a duathlon and a sprint triathlon He will enter the  mile bicycle race this August At  pounds Mac is now light enough to ride a motorcycle an activity his weight kept him from for years In November he will fulfill a lifelong dream by racing a motorcycle in the Baja  in Baja California Mexico I had people in my life that I could go to and ask questions and I could use their knowledge he says I did not do this alone Mac still does weekly weighins and says the battle to maintain his weight will last the rest of his life He spends his free time with Jessica and their two children Matthew  and Libby  The McDonalds will celebrate their th wedding anniversary in December I think were stronger now than weve ever been says Jessica who is writing a PhD dissertation about obesitys impact on the learning process Hes my biggest cheerleader Mac also takes time to share his story with others struggling with obesity He   and occasionally speaks to kids at the   encouraging them to begin healthy nutritional habits early He recently took two pound men grocery shopping invited them to his house to show them the types of foods he now eats and gave them some of his old regular and workout clothes Scrivner says he believes Macs story is better than a personal trainer for those trying to lose weight because he has walked in their shoes Hes about the most inspirational person I know
