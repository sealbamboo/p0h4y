As a gift one year an eminently practical cousin presented my family with five funeral plots in a Cape Cod cemetery  sufficient for Mom and Dad my two siblings and me As Cousin Nina told my father they were cheaper by the dozen so she had purchased not five but  giving the rest to other cousins I was  at the time  Nina was a bit of an outlier in our family which was never known for dwelling on final dispositions In fact my journalist father who harangued me when growing up about the proper use of tenses and moods would later in life preface any mention of his own passing with   I die To which I had the satisfaction of responding that this was no time for the subjunctive Dad its when not if   But it wasnt just denial that stood in the way of us choosing a final resting place my parents also had little tradition to go on My maternal grandparents were buried deep in a Queens mausoleum that Ive never visited my fathers father had his ashes buried under one of his prize rose bushes in the backyard of a house now owned by God knows who My other grandmother Soon after dying she was dispatched to New York Universitys medical residents On this subject I am a very different beast from my parents Perhaps because Id been   or because Im a planner par excellence Ive long had a manila folder in my desk called Notes for SP FuneralMemorial  Among the detritus is a program from a friends gorgeous church wedding its there because Id like to make sure my funeral is held there Then theres a Postit that says I want The Mary Tyler Moore Show   Who can take a nothing day played Oh and theres a photograph of the   for President and Mrs Kennedy specifying that my stone be from the same Massachusetts foundry  By  I had planned my last party My afterparty however remained as opaque as my parents None of us were planning to use Ninas gift but I had nowhere else in mind as my final resting place Until one day in Sag Harbor NY an old whaling village where as a child Id had happy memories of Fourth of July  parades and strawberry shortcake Drawn there again as an adult I drove past a   A local poet described it like this I have stood alone and quiet in the filtered sunlight beneath the old trees listening to the sighing winds and the chattering of birds  Eureka Walking the grounds I discovered that many notables had been interred there the choreographer George Balanchine two Iranian princes and a Revolutionary War hero David Hand who is buried with his five wives I put in a call to ask about the availability of plots and a Mr Yardley said they still had some in the original burial ground  although like everything in the Hamptons nowadays they were adding on We scheduled a visit My parents canceled We need to take the dog to the vet We rescheduled they canceled again Oh no were double booked On the fourth try we made it out there Mom Dad my sister Julie and her wife and me My brother and his wife didnt want any part of this real estate deal  In the dead of winter Mr Yardley walked us to a site where lo and behold we could have six plots for  apiece  cheaper by the halfdozen in this case and surely the best real estate deal on the East End  Mom who was complaining that her feet were frostbitten was willing to say yes if it got us closer to lunch and a gimlet I could see Dad was ambivalent not as much about Oakland but about dying As is customary for him he took off to wander a bit heading down toward the new development Ten minutes later  he returned and said OK well do it I saw   grave marker over there This is a good hood for me Dad was satisfied to share his final quarters in the company of the founder and editor of New York magazine And so we agreed to buy all six plots My mom especially liked the notion that  eventually  wed all be together again A decade later were all still here not there with the deed to my plot in my manila folder Yes we all now have a shady place to call home for eternity Older and more like my dad these days Ive also caught myself misusing my tenses   I die  I guess old subjunctives die hard
