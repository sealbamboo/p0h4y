Remember that worrisome new form of botulinum toxin we   you about in late  the one that supposedly had to be kept secret out of fear it could be used as a bioweapon that would evade all of our medical defenses Well as it turns out its not that scary after all The antitoxin stored in the governments emergency stockpile works and would neutralize the toxin just fine Thats the conclusion of some recent studies done by folks at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which after two years of waiting finally received the strain of   bacteria from the public health department that identified it Botulinum toxin is one of the most poisonous substances known and for a long time scientists knew of seven different types Then researchers at the California Department of Public Health announced that theyd discovered the first new form of the toxin to turn up in over  years They called it type H and   their find in a medical journal But heres the unusual and worrying part The   of the journal allowed the researchers to withhold key genetic details that would allow others to make or study this toxin The reason given was that no antitoxins as yet have been developed to counteract the novel   toxin As NPR reported however other botulism researchers soon raised serious   They said the California lab wasnt sharing the genetic information and was also keeping the novel strain under lock and key No one could independently confirm the claims that this was a new and potentially lethal toxin  or consider how to protect the public if the concerns were valid When other scientists finally got the strain they were relieved We dont think it poses a new novel threat says Robert Tauxe of the CDCs division of foodborne waterborne and environmental diseases It appears to be a hybrid that is a naturally occurring combination of two other existing toxins Tauxe explains that the botulinum toxin is a protein with two different parts I think of it as being like the scissors on a Swiss Army knife he says There is the scissors part that actually does cut a piece of protein on a nerve cell And that is held in a larger handle And the larger handle is really how the immune system recognizes the toxin and reacts to it He says the newly discovered hybrid toxin has a scissors part that cuts like a type F toxin but the handle is very similar to a type A toxin What this means is that our medical countermeasures our antisera that we have produced in quantity and have stocked in the national stockpile and that we use to treat botulism routinely contain antibodies that protect against this novel toxin says Tauxe At the CDC scientists did experiments with mice showing that the current antitoxin offers protection Other studies using cultures of nerve cells came to the same conclusion NPR asked the California Department of Public Health how it responds to criticism over the decision not to make the genetic sequence and strain available to others earlier given that other labs were able to quickly ascertain that the current defenses would work In reply a spokeswoman sent a statement from James Watt chief of its division of communicable disease control He said that discovery of the new strain was unusual for the department The department has transferred governance over the new strain to the feds he said adding any decision regarding both releasing the sequence and the strain will be made by them now
