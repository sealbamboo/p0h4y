The use of ecigarettes has surged since smoking bans came into place  In the UK there are an estimated m users compared with m smokers Ecigarettes come in two parts in one end there is liquid nicotine and in the other a rechargeable battery and an atomiser  When the user sucks the liquid nicotine is vaporised and absorbed through the mouth  What looks like smoke is largely water vapour hence smoking ecigarettes is often called vaping As the ecigarettes contain nicotine the user gets the hit that makes smoking addictive without being harmed by the toxins found in real cigarettes The British Medical Association says the simple answer is that we dont yet know pointing out that only longterm research can determine that The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency will regulate ecigarettes as medicines from  Part of the reasoning for this move was that there was concern the ecigarettes currently on the market did not meet appropriate standards of safety quality and efficacy The regulator has said levels of contamination have been found in some products and others have been poorly manufactured However there is a consensus that they are certainly less harmful than smoking tobacco which is responsible for  deaths a year in the UK They are not recommended by the NHS yet but there is some evidence they may help  A team at the University of Auckland in New Zealand last year released the results of the first clinical trial comparing the devices with nicotine patches   published in the Lancet showed  using ecigarettes had quit after six months compared with  using patches  What is more after six months  of ecigarette users had halved the number of cigarettes smoked each day compared with  among those using patches  However the study did not involve enough people  just   to prove definitively which is the better option  There are also concerns that the increase in popularity of ecigarettes could act as a gateway to smoking particularly for young people The Local Government Association has been critical of the way they appear to be marketed at children through social media and the sale of fruitflavoured versions Not a great deal The UK  like many countries  is playing catch up Earlier this year ministers in England said they would   Similar legislation is being considered elsewhere in the UK Wales is also considering a proposal to ban the use of them in public places  to mirror the law covering real cigarettes Some companies including train firms airlines and the pub chain JD Wetherspoon have taken the step themselves Other countries have gone even further Brazil Singapore and Mexico have banned importing and selling the devices even though tobacco is still on sale in all those countries
