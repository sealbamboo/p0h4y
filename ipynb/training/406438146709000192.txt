Weve all been there unable to stand in line at Starbucks or wait for a movie to start without checking our phone as impatiently as if we had a loved one in the ER  Click away but know that all that hunching over and tapping on handheld devices like tablets and smartphones is leading to more  and younger  patients with arthritis and tendinitis in the elbows   and thumbs  In a study in the journal Applied Ergonomics for instance  of mobilephone users reported having pain in at least one body part most often the base of the right thumb Even light pressure can be magnified five or  times at the base of the thumb joint causing strain says Dr Kenneth Means Jr a handsurgery specialist at MedStar Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore Socalled BlackBerry thumb could eventually require surgery he warns That doesnt mean you have to give up Instagramming but do take some simple precautions while you type First Means advises hold up your phone to about chesthigh when youre looking at the screen  another Applied Ergonomics study shows that as many as  of us may be staring down at navel level straining the backs of our necks  If you have a tablet use a stand instead of placing it flat on a table or holding it up both positions can curve your shoulders painfully Get up and stretch periodically while using phones and tablets and try not to slam your fingers down on the screen or keyboard  Finally consider making calls remember those instead of so many texts and emails Once limited mostly to construction workers rock stars and the elderly noiserelated hearing loss is now a concern for regular folks of all ages Thats according to a report from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health which stated that the country may be facing an epidemic partly from the growing use of personal listening devices  Moreover this hearing loss and related problems  like tinnitus or buzzing and ringing in the ears  are occurring earlier and showing up more profoundly once they set in  I have more and more younger patients lately asking to be tested because theyre worried about their hearing says Dr Jane Sadler a family practitioner at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas No wonder Unlike the bulky Walkman headphones of decades past earbuds pipe highvolume highfidelity sound right through your eardrum and their tiny size  not to mention the ubiquity of portable listening and viewing devices like your Kindle Fire or iPod  makes it convenient for you to listen to tunes and watch TV shows and movies anywhere anytime  Long or repeated exposure to sound over  decibels can damage your hearing an MP player at full volume is around  decibels  louder than a power drill or a passing motorcycle The solution naturally is to turn down the volume and limit the amount of time you have those wires sprouting from your ears Try following the  rule listening to music through your earbuds for no more than  minutes a day using  of the maximum volume  Better yet spring for noisecanceling or noiseisolating buds  or best of all sport oldschool headphones Theyre generally safer Sadler says  as long as youre not walking around in traffic with them on Raise your hand if you sleep curled up with your iPhone or stay up too late to watch your favorite television shows in real time Mad Men were giving you the sideeye  Beware More and more research suggests that blue light from a lightemitting diode LED screen  the type of screen on most computers phones TVs and other devices these days  can inhibit the production of the sleepinducing hormone melatonin and disrupt our circadian rhythms Researchers think this is because LEDgenerated blue light emits wavelengths very similar to daylight so it can make our bodies think its daytime all the time In a  study in the Journal of Applied Physiology participants who viewed an LED screen at bedtime had melatonin levels that took longer to rise and remained lower during the night than when they looked at oldfashioned fluorescent monitors  This doesnt give fluorescent lighting a pass Other research has found that energyefficient fluorescent bulbs  which release blue light  suppress melatonin more than traditional incandescents which emit a redorange glow thats less similar to daylight and can keep people awake longer  Studies like these prompted the American Medical Association last year to issue a report that exposure to excessive light at night including extended use of various electronic media can disrupt sleep or exacerbate sleep disorders No youre not going back to a dumbphone or a computer from  but you can turn down your screen brightness at night or install the flux app which automatically adjusts the light your computer emits depending on the time of day and where you are  Better yet do some reading under an incandescent light when youre winding down at night Another solution I tell people to do stretching and yoga before going to bed Sadler says both to unplug and to relax yourself into a sleepier state   High heels have been fashionable for  what  centuries the stiletto debuted back in the s Then Sex and the City made Christian Louboutin and Jimmy Choo household names  Today spike heels are more popular than ever thanks to the proliferation of lowerpriced  and experts warn often lessstable  models sold at chain stores for those of us who cant swing the designer version Theyre even popping up at the gym replacing sneakers in fitness classes such as the Stiletto Workout Podiatrists have been watching this trend with some alarm  The higher you go the more changes in your gait pattern and the more stress on your feet knees and back says Marlene Reid of the Family Podiatry Center in Naperville Illinois Potential problems are going to be greater  In fact she prefers patients to wear shoes with heels under  inches Researchers from the University of Southern California reported last year that very high heels were talking over  inches here were significantly more likely to lead to foot pain ankle stress and an increased risk of sprain than halfinch heels  Another study found that superhigh stiletto heels were more likely than medium heels to cause varicose veins which can lead to fatigue and pain And in  a study at Iowa State University found that the higher the heel the greater the stress on the knees and the risk of osteoarthritis Dont kid yourself that wedges or platforms are a safer bet Reid says They may place your foot at a lesssevere angle but your staccato walk is still putting an unnatural burden of weight on the small delicate bones of the feet and toes  Her advice If you must wear towering heels give your feet a rest and go low the next day We live in a world where the gym never closes  and neither does the drivethrough for that matter  Our  lifestyle can have potential health consequences that researchers are only beginning to understand  For example staying up late may predispose us to digest food differently possibly contributing to obesity In one study mice exposed to dim light at night gained  more weight than mice kept in a naturallightcycle environment  even though both consumed the same number of calories and had similar activity levels Studies also find that folks whose routines are not in sync with regular circadian rhythms like people who work at night and sleep during the day  might be more vulnerable to heart disease depression diabetes and cancer  We evolved under cycles of light and dark says Richard Stevens of the University of Connecticut Health Center Modern lighting has turned that on its head So if youre up late  or wake in the middle of the night  keep lights and activity as low as possible to stay in tune with your body clock he says And remember Its not a time to snack
