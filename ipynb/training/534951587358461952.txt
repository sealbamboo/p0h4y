Brittany Maynard would have turned  on Wednesday but less than three weeks after her   shes still elevating the aidindying push politically  and igniting that cause with social energy its leaders say The movement has spent  years preparing itself for Brittany Maynard to give it real life said Barbara Coombs Lee president of Compassion  Choices a national nonprofit dedicated to expanding the rights of the terminally ill The organization  with which Maynard partnered to publicize her endoflife wishes  has been measuring the impact made by the California newlywed during her final days and now after her death The group notes  positive newspaper editorials published since Maynard went public Oct  with a   explaining  to consume lethal medication Nov  rather than let terminal brain cancer run its natural course That same month she moved from the Bay Area with her family to a rental house in Portland Oregon one of five states where doctors can legally prescribe drugs for terminally ill adults seeking to end their lives During October  volunteers joined Compassion  Choices  almost six times as many as did in September Another  people signed up during the first week of November the group said The   has received more than  million page views since early October  at one point getting  hits per hour It said its email list has swelled by more than  people over the past six weeks and the median age of those subscribers is now  down from  Maynards own website meanwhile received  times more traffic on one day during her October campaign than all Compassion  Choices sites combined had ever logged For example from Oct  to Nov   the organizations sites recorded about  hits On Oct  Maynards personal site received that amount of traffic in just  minutes  seconds Its the mood and the tempo that I pick up from our field staff all around the country  its their world that is rocked Coombs Lee said This is what Brittany intended This is what she started to plan almost as soon as she knew she was dying Politically Maynard is making marks as well On Nov  the New Jersey state General Assembly    to  A state lawmaker supporting the proposal mentioned Maynard during a floor debate It still must pass the state Senate before going to Gov Chris Christie But Coombs Lee called that vote our first victory in the memory and spirit of Brittany Maynard People will be talking about her for decades and decades Coombs Lee told NBC News She compared Maynard to Elizabeth Cady Stanton a thcentury advocate for womens voting rights From this time forward its not too much to say people will associate the freedom to choose at the end of life with Brittany Maynard Coombs Lee said Maynard however also stirred criticism  some of it in high places  by choosing to end her life rather than let cancer to take her organically Over the past  years despite well over one hundred legislative efforts and many ballot initiatives assisted suicide advocates Compassion and Choices have only been successful in a tiny fraction of states said Jennifer Popik legislative counsel for the National Right to Life Committee which calls each aidindying death a preventable tragedy While Brittany Maynard certainly received a great deal of media attention the hope is that her death drives conversations about medical wishes not the push to legalize doctors dispensing lethal prescriptions Popik added The claim that Brittany Maynard somehow propelled a bill through the New Jersey Assembly is false The state has become a perennial target and the bill is unlikely to become law due to an uninterested state Senate as well as a veto indication from Gov Christie The Vatican meanwhile  four days after Maynards death A Vatican official told an Italian news agency that Maynards choice was reprehensible That statement spurred Maynards mother Debbie Ziegler to write a retort and share it Monday exclusively with MSNBCs Lawrence ODonnell Reprehensible is a word Ive used as a teacher to describe the actions of Hitler other political tyrants and the exploitation of children by pedophiles As Brittany Maynards mother I find it difficult to believe that anyone who knew her would ever select this word to describe her actions Ziegler wrote Brittany was a giver She was a volunteer She was a teacher She was an advocate She worked at making the world a better place to live This word was used publicly at a time when my family was tender and freshly wounded Grieving she added Such strong public criticism from people we do not know have never met  is more than a slap in the face It is like kicking us as we struggle to draw a breath Zeigler along with her husband and Maynards widower Dan Diaz have since moved out of the Portland rental house they shared with Maynard And they will not attend a th birthday candlelight celebration for Maynard that deathwithdignity advocates plan Wednesday night at the First Unitarian Church of Portland It will be particularly poignant for me because I view that church as a sanctuary birthplace of the Oregon Death with Dignity movement Coombs Lee said In the basement of that church activists drafted what was to become Oregons Death With Dignity Law in the early s The church became headquarters for press events throughout  before Oregon voters eventually approved the proposal Janet Adkins also attended that church She later became the first person Dr Jack Kevorkian helped to die This was the sanctuary where  when Brittany was about to turn  in November of   the celebration took place after the Death with Dignity Law was passed Coombs Lee said This birthday celebration will bring everything full circle for that church and for Brittany
