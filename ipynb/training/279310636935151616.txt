People around the world are living longer than they did two decades ago but many people arent very healthy during those extra years Thats a key finding from a   estimating what makes people sick worldwide Researchers from over  institutions drew conclusions from nearly  data sources including surveys censuses hospital records and   They then used computer models to estimate how long people live and how healthy they are From  to  life expectancy continued to tick up in most parts of the world The average age of death rose to  from  with women outliving men by about five years But the number of years that people live with chronic diseases and disabilities like depression back pain arthritis and diabetes has also increased The worlds population is aging And what makes us sick is no longer killing us as often or as early But chronic illnesses are hurting quality of life There may have been a perception that this is a problem in rich societies says   a global health specialist at the Harvard School of Public Health Its a global problem and its predictive of whats coming  a tide of disability he tells Shots Salomon who worked on two of the seven papers in a package   by   says the extra years come near the end of life when many people have disabilities The rise in chronic illnesses is apparent in most parts of the world except in subSaharan Africa where infectious diseases like diarrhea AIDS and malaria are still major problems Elsewhere Japan and Singapore are leading the way in healthy aging Their people enjoy on average almost  years of diseasefree living Taiwan Switzerland Spain and Italy arent far behind The US ranked about nd in healthy life expectancy behind both Canada and the UK Heres some of the other big themes that emerge from the study Although the analysis offers a bigpicture look at health around the world some researchers caution that the details shouldnt be overinterpreted For some countries the researchers had to use complex computer models and statistical tricks to estimate cause of death and life expectancy from relatively sparse data Estimates made with this approach are subject to large errors says   an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who worked on the study Im pretty good at modeling and I still dont know whats going on sometimes Its such a complicated process This study was funded by the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation which also supports NPR
