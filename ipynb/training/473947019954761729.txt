Veterans across the country are still waiting too long for medical care a situation that drove the   of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki last week Now Republicans and Democrats in Congress are competing to pass laws they think will fix the problem of medical wait times and other problems at the VA The discussion over how to reform veterans health care is starting to sound familiar Every debate about the VA becomes a parable for governments role in health care generally says   with the nonprofit Center for a New American Security Efforts to improve and build the VA will run into opposition based on a desire to minimize the governments role in health care Carter says Efforts to strip the VA or shift functions to the private sector will run into intense opposition from  members of the vet community who believe the VA represents the nations brickandmortar commitment to its veterans One measure now included in bills from both sides of the aisle aims to make firing and hiring easier within the VAs massive bureaucracy something that veterans groups have been pushing for We represent  million members who do not understand why the secretary of VA does not have the authority to manage his department as he needs to says   legislative director of the American Legion If he needs to remove someone if he needs to demote someone he does not have that authority In his last public speech as VA secretary Eric Shinseki said he had   of removing senior leadership at the Phoenix VA Hospital where   revealed that executives were lying about performance goals But VA employees are federal workers and belong to a union  which makes it hard even for a Cabinet secretary to fire them A few opponents of the recently proposed legislation say its already hard enough to lure top executives to the VA and these bills could drive them into higherpaying jobs elsewhere Another private sector solution on the table is a sort of voucher system which Sen John McCain has been pushing since his presidential campaign in  We need to allow flexibility for the veterans to go to the place where they can get health care in the most efficient way possible rather than these unconscionable delays McCain has said In a   in which he and several Republican colleagues introduced the Veterans Choice Act McCain again stressed that point saying It would empower veterans who cant schedule an appointment within a reasonable time or who live too far from the VA to exercise the choice of getting medical care from any doctor in Medicare or the Tricare program To address the crisis in wait times the VA is ramping up a system that would explicitly allow veterans to get private care if theyve been waiting more than  days for medical attention Some in Congress have put forth measures to do the same But thats something the VA already has the authority to do  in fact in  the department spent  billion on care outside the VA system While veterans service organizations support many of the measures before Congress the majority of such groups say the VAs medical care is excellent once vets get access to it And they worry that the private sector doesnt have needed expertise If youre a private health care company are you going to spend money on research and development on prosthetics Are you going to spend money on research on Gulf War illness Probably not says Stewart Hickey the executive director of   because thats not a big group for you  to make money Hickey says politicians should beware of preaching fullscale privatization You wouldnt want to be the congressman who said Im going to do away with the Veterans Health Administration  Hickey says
