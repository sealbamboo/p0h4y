She was obese and suffering from a severe complication of Type  diabetes a foot ulcer which required an urgent amputation At the time Dr Attia admits he silently judged her If she had only taken better care of her health maybe exercised more and eaten less he thought to himself this never would have happened to her But a few months ago in a TED talk Dr Attia stepped onto a stage and offered a few words to his former patient I hope you can forgive me As a doctor I delivered the best clinical care I could but as a human being I let you down Dr Attia his voice breaking said in his talk You didnt need my judgment and my contempt You needed my empathy and compassion For many Dr Attias talk delivered at a TEDMED conference in April and opened to the public on the   in June has struck a chord in part for its unusual candor Dr Attia admits to something he believes many doctors may in fact be guilty of That compassion for overweight and obese patients often is not quite as deep as it is for those who are sick for other reasons  the unlucky ones for instance who develop cancer or another disease through no apparent fault of their own I probably spent a lot of my time in medicine judging people who I thought brought conditions on themselves he said in an interview on Thursday without thinking Maybe I need to walk a mile in that persons shoes Theres probably a reason this person lived the life that they did and maybe I have a privilege that they didnt have Dr Attias insight was informed in part by the startling discovery a few years ago that despite paying close attention to his diet and exercising frequently often for hours at a time he had developed metabolic syndrome a precursor to Type  diabetes He had made all the right lifestyle choices he thought and yet he was overweight and on a fast track toward obesity and diabetes The revelation Dr Attia says in his talk forced him to make drastic changes in his life And it led him to question whether the conventional wisdom about obesity that has prevailed for decades may be fundamentally wrong Obesity itself may not be the cause of disease he suggests but one symptom of an underlying metabolic problem  We have this paradigm that says that if you eat too much you dont exercise enough you get diabetes and you die he said With that belief in that paradigm weve been treating people for  years and things are getting worse dramatically Dr Attia eventually left clinical practice and became the cofounder of a nonprofit nutrition organization the Nutrition Science Initiative which funds experiments and medical research on the causes of obesity and Type  diabetes The group expects to launch several major studies at universities around the country this year Since the talk went public two weeks ago Dr Attia said he has received hundreds of emails about it daily Many are from doctors who express regret about their judgment of former patients I remember getting one the other day from a retired physician he said He was saying Im a retired internist and Im just ashamed to say I spent my entire career doing the same thing and I wish I had the opportunity to apologize to some of my patients as well Countless emails have poured in as well from people who have been on the other side of the examination table Many are from people who are overweight or obese with diabetes who feel they have been dismissed by doctors and looked down upon as deliberately ignoring their health even when they struggle to make good choices Ive had many from people who say Even though you werent my doctor Ive accepted your apology to that woman and Ive forgiven my doctor who treated me poorly he said Its really moving and it humbles me to get literally dozens of these emails a day Dr Attia however has not heard from the woman he described in his TED talk and he suspects he never will The sad part is that my fear is this woman probably isnt alive today he said Once a patient undergoes an amputation their five year survival is about  or  percent and this was seven years ago Perhaps the most important thing to take away from this he added is that time is of the essence We have to figure this disease out
