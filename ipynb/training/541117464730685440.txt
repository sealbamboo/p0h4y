The herb   is one of the best known and widely available herbal cold treatments Study results have been negative but its effectiveness may vary depending on the preparation Two studies funded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine found no benefit from echinacea in a juice formulation or in an unrefined combination of root and herb However David Leopold MD recommends mixing  to  drops of an echinacea tincture with warm water four or five times a day or as directed on the bottle It tends to be a little more potent than pills says Dr Leopold who is the director of integrative medical education at the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine and a faculty member with the Scripps Natural Supplement Conference in La Jolla California There may be even less evidence for the efficacy of goldenseal but some folks swear by it Goldenseal hasnt been studied as much but I dont think that theres any inherent problem to using it as long as somebody doesnt have an allergy to it Dr Leopold says Although this Asian herb is taken mainly to boost energy stamina and overall health researchers have begun to examine its efficacy in fighting the common cold A  study conducted by Canadian researchers found that taking   reduced the severity and duration of cold symptoms and appeared to prevent colds as well Long popular with the holistic crowd daily rinsing is thought to fend off cough sniffles and sore throat A  study found that   six times a day had an improvement in cold symptoms and fewer recurrences However a  study published in   found that daily rinsing may deplete the nose of protective mucus and up your risk of getting a cold and other infections If you do decide to use a neti pot   Due to rare brain infections the   that its best to use distilled or sterile water or boil water for three to five minutes and then cool before using Though less wellknown than some other herbal cold remedies extracts derived from this plant have been shown to decrease the symptoms of acute   One study published in the journal   in  examined  adults with acute bronchitis lasting less than two days who were given either placebo or an extract of the roots of   those in the latter group were told to take  drops three times a day for a week The treated patients saw quicker resolution of symptoms including pain during cough and fever and were able to return to work in an average of  days compared to  days for placebo  may be the most studied of the available alternative cold remedies Again study results have been mixed but experts seem to more strongly support vitamin C than other remedies Even the purported benefits of Airborne may have more to do with its vitamin content than other ingredients Theres nothing intrinsically wrong or right with the product says Steve Gardner litigation director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest Its an extraordinarily expensive vitamin C delivery system If theres any benefit it may be from the vitamin C which for some people might reduce the severity or duration of a cold but wont prevent one The recommended daily intake is  milligrams for adult women and  milligrams for adult men Dr Leopold recommends that people with colds take a gram or so of vitamin C several times a day depending on what other medical conditions they may have A  study found that zinc lozenges   from  days to  days Other studies have been mixed but doctors do sometimes recommend the supplement However there may be some risk to Zicam Cold Remedy products In  the manufacturer of the zinc spray paid  million to settle  lawsuits from consumers who claimed to have lost their sense of smell after using the product And in June  the   to stop using three Zicam products due to the risk of a loss of the sense of smell The good news is that in general most of these compounds wont hurt youalthough its worth checking with your doctor before starting a new supplement And there may be another upside to herbal supplements I believe that most of the   just mask symptoms which is great to get you through the day Dr Leopold says But a lot of the oral supplements are working more with the body maybe stimulating the immune system and also helping the body to heal Still he adds Err on the side of caution I dont recommend that any of my patients take any of this stuff every day
