Young people in their teens and early s probably arent thinking about heart disease But maybe its time they did People who have slightly higher blood pressure when theyre  to  are more likely to have high blood pressure and hardening of the arteries in their s a study says About one quarter of the people in this study were in that group We need to be aware that what happens when were young adults is going to have an impact says   an epidemiologist and the studys lead author She and her colleagues at Northwesterns Feinberg School of Medicine looked at data from  men and women in Chicago Birmingham Ala Minneapolis and Oakland Calif who have been followed for over  years About  percent of the people had blood pressure that was consistently higher than their peers Another  percent started with higher blood pressure that then rose over time With both groups most of them had blood pressure readings that still fell within the normal range for their age But they were much more likely to develop hypertension by age  Those with with increasing blood pressure were four times as likely to have hardening of the arteries in middle age while those with consistently high blood pressure were  times as likely to do so Both are considered risk factors for heart disease The findings were   in   the journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday About one third of American adults have high blood pressure but doctors typically dont focus on controlling it until middle age If the trend found in this study is verified by other research it could mean that teenagers and young adults will need to pay a lot more attention to their blood pressure Young people should start by getting yearly physicals and making sure that theyre at least aware of their blood pressure Allen tells Shots And she says that physicians should take the blood pressure readings of their younger patients more seriously While you wouldnt prescribe medications for this group you might have conversations with those individuals about ways they can improve their diet or increase physical activity Allen says Lifestyle changes arent always easy she says but they can have a big influence on blood pressure The study does have a few limitations For one the researchers only looked at participants risk for heart disease The next step is to see how many of these people actually go on to develop heart disease or have heart attacks More importantly Allen says researchers dont know yet know what will work best to reduce the apparent risk for that  percent But many of these cardiovascular risk factors are cumulative Allen says So the sooner someone quits smoking and starts eating healthy and exercising the better Eighteen is when a lot of people move out and become more independent Its a great time to pick up healthy habits that will influence your lifestyle for years to come Allen says and maybe decrease your risk of heart disease as well
