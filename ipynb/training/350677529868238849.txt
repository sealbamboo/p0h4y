You dont see supermarket products emblazoned with ribbons to help support research on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Major corporations dont sponsor walkathons for thousands of cheering supporters This group of respiratory disorders including emphysema and chronic bronchitis is the third leading cause of death in the United States and accounts for a fifth of all hospitalizations among people over age   yet we hear surprisingly little about it Why is that COPD has a stigma said Dr Gulshan Sharma director of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston Because smoking accounts for most COPD in this country the prevailing public attitude is You did it to yourself he said So the disease which strikes older people more frequently remains both underdiagnosed and undertreated Yet the research Dr Sharma and his colleagues recently published in The American Journal of Medicine documents considerable progress The number of hospitalizations has been reduced drastically he said This shows that care of patients with COPD has improved COPD comprises two illnesses one emphysema destroys air sacs deep in the lungs the other chronic bronchitis causes inflammation congestion and scarring in the airways People with COPD  their breathing problems frequently compounded by other illnesses including heart disease diabetes and osteoporosis  are no strangers to hospitals Exacerbations can land them there as often as two or three times a year But the Texas team analyzing a decade of Medicare data looked at the experiences of more than  patients and found that from  to    The number of patients whod had two or more acute exacerbations requiring hospitalization had dropped  percent Thats not because fewer people have the disease Eventually reduced smoking may also reduce the prevalence of COPD but that hasnt happened yet according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for about a decade the   and the figures are much higher among older people Yes there are more women with COPD  and because as a group they began smoking more recently the rates are likely to rise at least for a while The researchers also found that the proportion of COPD patients with more than three accompanying medical conditions grew substantially which youd expect to lead to more hospital admissions not less It hasnt On the contrary for every  patients followed for a year there were  hospitalizations in  By  there were  Given the more than  hospitalizations for COPD each year these small numbers can translate into a very large impact Dr Sharma said The primary factor keeping people with COPD out of hospitals is more effective treatment We have better medications now Dr Sharma said listing a host of examples like longacting bronchodilators inhaled steroids and combination drugs introduced in the past decade and being more widely used None of these can reverse the damage but they help you breathe better and reduce your risk of exacerbation he said They improve your quality of life Redesigned devices like inhalers have become easier to use especially for older patients with less dexterity The reduced hospitalization rate probably also reflects improved treatments for the other diseases COPD patients often have Were managing their heart disease better for instance Dr Sharma said He and his colleagues think that increased use of the flu vaccine and legislation thats reduced exposure to secondhand smoke have probably helped too since either illness or smoke can lead to exacerbations A decade ago two hours in a bar was like smoking a full pack he said All of which means theres now good reason to see if your or your parents constant coughing wheezing shortness of breath especially when it accompanies physical activity or frequent respiratory infections might be caused by COPD the diagnostic process includes breathing into an apparatus called a spirometer Medical professionals who havent kept up with treatment advances   about this disease A  study of family physicians nurse practitioners and physician assistants working in primary care for example found that many werent using appropriate medical guidelines and felt they lacked knowledge and training in COPD Very few said they believed treatment would be useful in improving symptoms or reducing exacerbations despite considerable published data showing it can For years Dr Sharma said we had a nihilistic approach Its a done deal heres an inhaler Now theres more to offer The single most important action COPD patients can take to stay out of hospitals of course is to stop smoking The single best way to avoid developing COPD is not to start Its hard to argue with prevention strategies and smokingcessation efforts ultimately fewer smokers will mean less COPD But many older adults who already have COPD can still feel better be more active and spend less time in hospitals This   provides further details
