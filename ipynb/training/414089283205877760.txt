In most discussions of suicide and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  including the online buzz that followed publication of a Times   on how young California veterans die  one statistic gets repeated most  veterans kill themselves each day That number comes from a   published in early  by researchers at the federal Department of Veterans Affairs But the recent wars were not the studys primary focus In fact they play a minor role in veteran suicides overall The VA researchers used death records from  states to come up with a  national estimate for veterans of all ages As a group veterans are old Military service being far rarer than it was in the days of the draft more than  of the nations  million veterans are at least  years old and the overwhelming majority did not serve in the post era About  of veterans are at least  It is not surprising then that the VA found that people in this age group account for  of veteran suicides  or more than  of the  per day Many experts believe that the farther a veteran is from military service the less likely it is that his or her suicide has anything to do with his or her time in uniform In other words many older veterans are killing themselves for the same reasons that other civilians in the same age group kill themselves depression and other mental health problems coupled with difficult life circumstances The VA analysis does not attempt to determine rates of veteran suicide or how they compare with rates for people who never served Those are surprisingly difficult questions to answer mainly because the government does not systematically track service members after they leave the military The Times tackled the problem using data on California deaths from  to  the most recent six years available Rather than focus exclusively on suicide the analysis considered all  deaths of adults under  a group that includes those veterans most likely to have served in the recent wars In addition to the cause of death and a variety of other information each record includes a box indicating veteran status In the course of reporting it became clear that the local coroners and funeral home directors who fill out the forms also use that box for activeduty deaths The Armed Forces Medical Examiner System provided data on activeduty deaths in California by age gender and cause allowing The Times to subtract those figures and arrive at the veteran totals The VA provided the California veteran population estimates that The Times used to calculate overall death rates and break them down by cause The death rates for other civilians were determined using population data from the US Census Bureau One more step was required to make the comparisons relevant California veterans under  are about  male and nearly half are over  A straight comparison to the general population in that age group would be less than ideal since suicide and accident rates vary significantly by gender and age The Times adjusted the nonveteran death rates so they reflected the age and gender mix of the veteran population As the   explained suicide and accident rates were substantially higher for veterans Over the six years examined by The Times  California veterans under  took their own lives That amounts to an average annual rate of  suicides per  veterans If that rate were to hold true across the country about  young veterans are committing suicide each year  roughly  each day Thats probably an underestimate because there are regional variations in suicide and California tends to fall on the low side But in talking about the aftermath of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan its far closer to reality than  each day Twitter
