Far from the global glare on   physicians across America are risking prison by covertly helping terminally ill people end their lives via lethal overdoses asserts a leading deathwithdignity advocate In the  states where physicianassisted suicide is illegal some doctors and nurses leave those drugs with their patients or with patients families while giving cryptic instructions  all to avert prosecution said Barbara Coombs Lee president of Compassion  Choices a national nonprofit working to expand the rights of the terminally ill There is a surreptitious clandestine aidindying practice in every state of the country said Combs Lee who bases that claim in part on eight surveys of US doctors and nurses conducted since  That includes a   published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in which responding physicians acknowledged  instances of euthanasia requests being honored In an unauthorized state when the patient is vocalizing their intention to die the conversation has to be in code Coombs Lee said The physician or nurse might say Now this is the amount of sedatives and morphine you should give your loved one  be careful not to give more because that could cause their death Or they might say Dont worry about how much morphine to give Do you understand me Give as much as he needs But that intentional ambiguity creates a murky situation that can lead to unintended negligence Coombs Lee said Nobody in the family can ask the doctor questions Is it time Do we really want to do this Are there other alternatives we could try You cant have the open conversation You dont have all the safeguards of good medical practice she said You just have these surreptitious winks and nods a conversation of code words A New York state doctor who has faced criminal scrutiny for knowingly prescribing a leukemia patient the drugs she used to end her life agrees that aidindying is likely practiced in secret by physicians and nurses coast to coast It is of course very hard to study something thats ostensibly illegal said Dr Timothy Quill director of the center for ethics humanities and palliative care at the University of Rochester Medical Center But that seems to be true in all states  Its an underground practice He has meanwhile watched Maynards personal story erupt into a  Maynard  diagnosed this year with terminal brain cancer publicly   to move from California to Oregon where she plans to end her life on Nov  before her disease runs its course Oregon is one of five states that have aidindying laws Waiting till the wheels are falling off physically to possibly get palliative sedation does not have a lot appeal to the folks who are interested in lifeending options Quill said In  a New York grand jury   Quill for aiding in a suicide  a conviction that could have sent him to prison for  years The panel investigated Quill after he authored an article in the New England Journal of Medicine describing how he agonized over prescribing enough barbiturates to enable a yearold woman with terminal cancer to end her life as she had requested Other terminally ill patients he sees still ask for that kind of final help he said Its not a common conversation but it does occur Quill said Because people are afraid Generally what I tell people is that palliative care pain management really works pretty well and Im very committed to make sure their suffering is not unacceptable to them Most of the time we can find answers that are very acceptable If they end up in a very bad situation I will talk with them about that option with an open mind Almost never does that have to require a physicianassisted death For most people thats more than enough They want to know that youll face up to a tough situation if theyre in one and you wont turn your back on that and youll help them find an answer Quill added What does find an answer mean though given New Yorks laws Im an expert in palliative care so most of the time within the realm of palliative care I can help people find their answer particularly the option of sedation for the toughest cases Quill said But it means that if they really want a physicianassisted death  medicine that they could take as an overdose  I would have a conversation with them about that and wed try to find some common ground that would work for them Indeed one of the three choices for terminally ill Americans seeking a physicians aid to end their lives is to get illegal assistance in your home states said I Glenn Cohen director of the PetrieFlom Center for Health Law Policy Biotechnology and Bioethics at Harvard Law School The other two options according to Cohen Move to a state like Oregon where the practice is legal or travel to Switzerland where assistedsuicide is legal and where no residency is required But some terminally ill Americans prefer to stick with their own doctors if mulling an early escape from the misery of a diseases end stage That even happens in California the state from which Maynard moved because the law there bans assisted suicide In Los Angeles Dr Laura Mosqueda chair of family medicine and geriatrics at Keck Medicine of USC has listened as patients asked her to help them end their lives What Ive said to them is Im going to do everything I can to make sure youre not suffering but it is illegal for me to do this so Im not going to Im really clear with them Mosqueda said I have these conversations with patients and its really heartbreaking and based in fear she added If euthanasia was allowed where I work I would be willing to participate in assisting people Buts its not so I dont
