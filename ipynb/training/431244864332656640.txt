Two West Virginia schools dismissed students early Wednesday after a teacher and a student became ill from vapors believed to be related to last month's chemical spill.. The sicknesses were in Belle, about 10 miles from Charleston, where about 10,000 gallons of Crude MCHM, a chemical used in coal processing, leaked into the Elk River on Jan. 9. The spill contaminated the drinking water for 300,000 residents in and around the state capital, including in Belle, for at least five days.
