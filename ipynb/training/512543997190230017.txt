Like many clinics nationwide my surgery office recently started using electronic medical records Headaches and glitches abound but over all it has been a godsend no more lost forms deciphering lousy handwriting or waiting endlessly for someone to pull the chart if you want to look up a patient Everythings in one centralized computer system accessible anywhere   This brave new world however has created a singularly embarrassing moment at the end of all my new patient encounters After saying hello performing a history and physical examination talking over the details of surgery and answering questions I fire up the computer and start entering orders and preparing an aftervisit summary for the patient to take home  Heres where it becomes awkward Ive just finished instilling in my patient a sense of confidence in my abilities promising that my wellhoned dexterity will result in the smoothest operation possible Ive outlined my surgical success rate over several years experience assuring the patient that mine are hands to be trusted Then I turn to the keyboard and start tripping over letters like a drunken giraffe I cant type My s and s childhood was sandwiched between the typewriter and personal computer eras and I never had any formal instruction in how to properly navigate a keyboard I churned out papers in high school college and medical school through the huntandpeck method and things turned out just fine A senior thesis masters dissertation a bunch of now longforgotten articles in obscure surgical journals  all typed with my two index fingers with recurring guest appearances by the right middle on the delete key My yearold son just started typing lessons in school and is already far more capable than I His skill on the keyboard has resulted in much merriment at my expense an increasingly common phenomenon these days  I had always regarded my absence of typing skills as not much of a problem part of the considerable dust pile of things I never learned how to do alongside whistling and driving a stick shift Until my surgery clinic went electronic Not long after the transition I began noticing distinct signs of discomfort from patients as I fumblingly clacked away raised eyebrows a shifting of weight in the chair even some subtle throatclearing The thought bubble was pretty transparent   is the guy whos going to cut me open and rearrange my insides There are many ways I could circumvent this uncomfortable pause and maintain an image of precision and infallibility Wait until after the patient leaves to start charting impractical given our clinic workflow hire a medical scribe to do my documentation for me as detailed in a recent New York Times article not happening with recent budget cuts use the nifty speechtotext dictation device provided to all clinicians feels extremely weird and offputting to do this in front of patients actually learn to type old dognew tricks dwindling brain plasticity  Instead Ive chosen to meet the awkwardness headon I turn towards the patient and say Forgive my hunting and pecking I never learned how to type Dont worry I can operate just fine  It has become a funny disarming moment in an otherwise usually serious encounter Surgery consultations are rarely laughaminute affairs as it is and Ive found that this little injection of levity helps mitigate some of the tension that can develop By admitting a little bit of vulnerability I also show the patient that Im human Surgeons have traditionally been perceived as heroic mythical figures who do great work in the OR but may not possess the best people skills Typical surgeon communication of the past was gruff paternalistic and authoritarian my way or the highway  As a profession surgery is now trying to improve channels of communication with patients encouraging twoway dialogues about treatment options providing more time for questions or concerns even making room for open displays of emotion such as joy and grief Surgeons are still expected to convey a sense of confidence skill and cool under pressure but that doesnt mean they need to spend all their time on a pedestal  The brief moment when I acknowledge my fumbling typing skills has become a chance to show my patient that while I feel very comfortable in my surgical abilities I am also well aware of my limitations Suddenly the pedestal is not so high The aura of invincibility that has long shrouded the surgical profession that can sometimes spill over into arrogance coldness and toxic relationships between surgeons and those around them starts to melt away Consider it my attempt at revamping stereotypes two fingers at a time
