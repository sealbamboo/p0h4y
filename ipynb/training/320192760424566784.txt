Think that freezing food kills   and other nasty microbes Think again Thats the lesson from the new    caused by frozen chicken quesadillas and other snacks that has sickened  people in  states Freezing does slow down the microbes that cause food to spoil but its pretty much useless for killing dangerous bugs It actually does a pretty good job of preserving many of the pathogens and microbes that will cause problems later if thawed out says   an extension research specialist at the University of California Davis who studies food safety The strain of    shiga toxinproducing   involved in the current outbreak hasnt been seen in frozen food before but other pathogens have caused illness through frozen foods like pot pies says   a professor of food science at Cornell University He is working with   of Buffalo NY producer of the foods involved in the outbreak to figure out the source of the contamination A   first issued last week was expanded Thursday to include all food produced at the companys Waycross Ga plant Its frozen snacks cheesesteak sandwiches and the like are sold nationwide Weidmann also wasnt surprised to hear that frozen food could harbor   We store a lot of microbes in the lab he says The easiest way is at minus  degrees But while freezing doesnt defeat pathogens heat will Bacteria die if theyre heated to F Cooking instructions on frozen food packages are designed to deliver a temperature of F to the coldest part of the product according to the Grocery Manufacturers Association The foods involved in this outbreak are all meant to be cooked not just warmed up before theyre eaten Snacky foods like mini pizza slices and cheese steaks implicated in the outbreak are often heated in microwaves and microwave ovens are notorious for heating food unevenly Thus the sometimesintricate package instructions involving turning stirring and waiting The median age of the people who have fallen ill is  Its easy to imagine a scenario where a hungry teenager briefly nukes the pizza dippers and dives in Thats not to say thats what happened in this outbreak I dont mean by any stretch to imply that the consumer is at fault here Wiedmann says But safe equals piping hot when it comes to frozen foods Wiedmann says the most foolproof way to do that is to give up the convenience of the microwave and put foods that require cooking in the oven for a good hot bake With a frozen readytocook food I would always go with the stove not the microwave he says
