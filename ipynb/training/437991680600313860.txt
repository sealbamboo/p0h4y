Forty years ago a beloved neighbor was bedridden for weeks at a time with a mysterious ailment She knew only that it involved her liver and that she must never drink alcohol which would make things worse It was decades before the cause of these debilitating flareups was discovered a viral infection at first called nonA nonB   then properly identified in  as hepatitis C The apparent source of her infection was a blood transfusion she had received decades earlier A screening test was soon developed making it possible to check all blood products for the   virus But that by no means put an end to the infection Transmission persists today commonly the result of intravenous   with shared needles sexual and especially anal intercourse and among health care workers accidental needlesticks or other contact with infected blood An estimated  million people in the United States are infected but the vast majority of them dont know it Dr Mark S Sulkowski a liver specialist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said in an interview For several decades only people at high risk for the infection were advised to be screened for it That meant anyone who had ever injected illegal drugs recipients of blood transfusions or organ transplants before  or of clotting factor concentrates made before  children born to infected mothers patients who underwent longterm kidney   anyone infected with   or with symptoms of   or an abnormal liver enzyme test organ transplant recipients whose donors were later found to have the virus and health care workers possibly exposed to infected blood But even this wide net has missed huge numbers of infected individuals Dr Sulkowski said Many at high risk are reluctant to identify themselves for screening Others are unaware that they might be infected including those exposed as infants or children In more than half of infected people the abnormality does not show up in routine blood tests until serious damage has occurred A chronic infection can cause   and   and often necessitates a   Recognizing that deaths from hepatitis C are rising and more than threefourths of infections are being diagnosed in baby boomers the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends that everyone born from  through  be screened for the virus But what about other people who are walking around with undiagnosed hepatitis C infections Should they wait until their livers are seriously damaged I would recommend that everyone who comes in for a checkup be screened for hepatitis C said Dr Hillel Tobias a liver specialist at New York University Medical Center It can be added to a blood test and is covered by insurance   Thomas Carley a yearold resident of Mahopac NY and father of yearold   knows the value of early detection Apparently infected with hepatitis C as a child he was diagnosed with Stage  liver cirrhosis in his s and eventually needed a liver transplant He is now an enthusiastic volunteer for the   which he said in an interview taught me everything I needed to know to fight this disease In about  percent of cases the virus disappears on its own within six months of the initial infection But the remaining  percent develop into a chronic infection that can slowly destroy the liver The younger you are when youre infected the longer it takes to develop cirrhosis Dr Tobias said It could take  years or more in someone infected at age  But a yearold can develop cirrhosis in just  to  years The earlier an infection is diagnosed and treated the less likely that liver damage will occur But even in people who already have cirrhosis eradicating a hepatitis C infection markedly reduces the chances of it progressing or of developing liver cancer Dr Tobias said Even with advanced cirrhosis people can live longer lives if you get rid of the virus Until late last year the standard treatment for hepatitis C infection was a challenging week regimen of weekly injections with interferon along with one or two oral antiviral drugs ribavirin and a protease inhibitor The treatment almost invariably caused fatigue depression   nausea and other debilitating side effects prompting many infected individuals to refuse it unless obvious liver damage had occurred But with two newly approved drugs and a few more in the pipeline a new era in treatment of hepatitis C is at hand These regimens are more effective at curing patients and generally work much more quickly than previous treatments Hepatitis C has a variety of genetic forms  at least six Most American patients are infected with genotype  The new treatments must be carefully selected for each patient because some drugs are more effective than others against particular genotypes The new drugs   Sovaldi and   Olysio are each approved for use with interferon and ribavirin for treatment of genotype  infection Sovaldi already can be used without injected interferon to treat people infected with genotypes  and   about a quarter of all hepatitis C patients in this country The Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve an alloral drug treatment for genotype  infection without interferon toward the end of this year But many patients are already taking oral combinations of the newer antivirals prescribed offlabel by their doctors or obtained in clinical trials A major study of the new drugs called the Cosmos trial  who could not be cured by previous treatments One very grateful recipient John DiFazio  a Vietnam vet and retired firefighter living on Staten Island said that since the late s he had tried half a dozen different treatments for hepatitis C all various combinations with interferon and none had cleared his body of the virus He started the new drugs in January and within seven days his viral count had dropped to  per milliliter from  million Now six weeks out it is  per milliliter Ive had no side effects Mr DiFazio said I can do everything I want to do
