Wayne Schneiders heart stopped beating late last year while the Minneapolis paramedic was out on an emergency call Another medic performed CPR for a few minutes and then used a medical device that delivered cardiac compressions mechanically for  minutes until Mr Schneiders heart started beating normally on its own Im not sure people would have been able to sustain manual CPR for so long said Mr Schneider  Im a lucky guy He may have been luckier than he knows Though widely available the machine used to keep him alive called an external cardiac compressor was never subjected to the rigorous premarket approval process that the Food and Drug Administration routinely requires for new drugs Now some researchers fear this medical device and nearly a dozen others may never be thoroughly evaluated by the agency People would be shocked to know that the FDA never got its act together to require the studies said Diana Zuckerman president of the   The reason These products have been around in one form or another since before the FDA started regulating devices in  They were cleared for sale without close scrutiny because they were presumed to be roughly equivalent to products that already were in use They also were designated by the FDA as highrisk devices meaning they sustain human life are instrumental in preventing harm or pose an unreasonable risk to patients In recent years Congress has directed the agency to put such highrisk devices through rigorous testing or to change their classification To the consternation of several consumer watchdog and patient safety groups the FDA has proposed changing the classification of many of the products so they are no longer considered highrisk or to vary their classifications depending on their use Either way they could still be sold without going through premarket approval Among highrisk devices to be   are external pacemakers access tubes implanted in blood vessels a component of a lung device used for newborns dental devices that are implanted near the brain and screw systems used in spinal surgery At least  devices including defibrillators metalonmetal replacement hips implanted pacemakers and female condoms will remain highrisk and must undergo premarket approval In a statement to The Times FDA officials said that every medical device comes with a certain level of risk whether it is a pair of crutches or a heart valve Devices no longer designated as highrisk are still reviewed the statement said and in situations where additional information is needed the agency may request additional data from the company to ensure that reasonably safe and effective devices are coming to market The external cardiac compressor may have saved Mr Schneiders life but others have not been so fortunate One of the largest clinical trials of mechanical CPR had to be stopped when safety monitors noticed that patients receiving CPR from external cardiac compressors were much more likely to   The  trial used a different device from the one used on Mr Schneider and some critics have questioned its methodology and design The results of a fiveyear randomized clinical trial of  patients published Sunday by JAMA found   The vast majority of surviving patients in both groups had good neurological outcomes at six months The study tested the   made by PhysioControl the device used on Mr Schneider Despite the mixed data the FDA plans to take the external cardiac compressor off the highrisk list and reclassify it The controversy over highrisk devices is the latest chapter in a long debate over how medical devices are brought to the market In  an Institute of Medicine report called the FDAs system for regulating medical devices flawed saying   before they were sold The institute urged the agency to develop a new approach In a  study Dr Zuckerman and colleagues found that the vast majority of medical devices recalled from  to  because of lifethreatening risks had gone on the market   Some were considered equivalent to earlier products but were designed differently or made of different materials And some of the earlier devices were themselves problematic But although the FDA may never require proof that these devices are safe and effective the market may Two companies that make external cardiac compressors have sponsored expensive timeconsuming clinical trials to prove that their devices which sell for up to  apiece are as safe as manual CPR Jonathan A Rennert president of ZOLL Medical Corporation which makes   said a trial sponsored by the company found similar survival rates and no difference in neurological status between manual and mechanical CPR The results have been presented publicly but not yet published in peerreviewed medical journals That was not a trial we were required to do by the agency he said It was a trial we felt we needed to do to drive clinical acceptance of the product in the marketplace Also it was the right thing to do
