Radiographers have gone on strike over pay in the latest walkout by NHS staff Society of Radiographers members were on strike from  BST and will follow a worktorule policy for the rest of the week The society said urgent care would still be provided Thousands of NHS staff including nurses and midwives held a strike last Monday The Department of Health said it was disappointed by the radiographers strike and said a larger pay rise would risk frontline jobs The strike was held across the UK due to an ongoing pay freeze and because the government rejected a recommended  pay rise for staff in England the society said An independent pay review board proposed a  increase for all NHS staff but ministers decided to exclude staff who receive progressioninthejob rises These designed to reward professional development are given to about half of staff and are worth  a year on average The pay proposal was implemented for all NHS workers in Scotland and Northern Ireland is yet to make a decision Wales did the same as England but gave extra money to the lowestpaid staff It is not clear how many patients will be affected but the Society of Radiographers said  scans and Xrays had been cancelled across Wales on Monday The action is the societys first UKwide strike for more than  years  and it warned there was a possibility of more action The anger that they and other health professionals feel is very strong said Richard Evans the societys chief executive Radiographers will try and keep the effect on patients to a minimum but radiographers and other healthcare workers have got to the stage that they feel there is no alternative Unless we show the government that we are serious about our claim that NHS staff should be treated fairly they will continue to take advantage of our goodwill He also said there was a shortage of radiographers which was already affecting patients and was likely to get worse if staff did not get reasonable and proper recognition of their work A Department of Health spokesman said NHS staff are our greatest asset and weve increased the NHS budget to pay for over  more clinical staff since  We cannot afford a pay rise in addition to increments  which disproportionately reward the highest earners  without risking frontline jobs Last Mondays NHS strike was also followed by four days of worktorule during which staff refused to do unpaid overtime and insisted on taking their breaks Tens of thousands of people joined antiausterity protests Belfast Glasgow and London on Saturday
