A programme to vaccinate girls against the virus that causes cervical cancer has begun in Laos South East Asia  Its one of nearly a dozen developing nations where the HPV vaccine is being introduced in the coming year as part of a scheme to enable poorer countries to benefit from the newest vaccines   It is five years since the jab was first offered to girls in the UK   The project is being organised with the support of  The vaccine protects against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus  preventing the infections that cause  of cases of cervical cancer Khonekham Sirivong  stood patiently in the queue of girls waiting for the HPV vaccine   This was a poignant moment for her and Somsouk her aunt one of the nurses under the shelter of trees in the school grounds   Somsouks mother  Khonekhams grandmother  died from cervical cancer  The two helped nurse her through years of illness   I remember she was in a lot of pain said Khonekham The family did everything it could but she died  I am very proud to be immunised   and to have the HPV vaccine free of charge Cervical cancer is a far bigger cancer killer in developing countries because most lack a national screening programme which can detect precancerous changes in the cervix enabling timely early treatment In Laos most cases are discovered too late  Cancer treatment in the worlds poorest nations is also limited  Laos has no radiotherapy  Patients who can afford it are sent to Thailand Approximately  women die every year from cervical cancer and over  of those deaths are in the developing world said Helen Evans Gavi deputy chief executive    The number of deaths is projected to rise dramatically so thats why it is absolutely crucial that this vaccine is introduced  The HPV vaccine represents a very significant commitment to womens health in the coming decades  I have visited a lot of hospitals in many of the worlds poorest countries  from Sierra Leone to Malawi and Bangladesh But they have rarely been as crowded at Setthathirath hospital in Vientiane   A senior oncologist Dr Keokedthong Phongsavan showed me round one of the wards where the beds had spilled out into the corridor and were squeezed next to each other to accommodate more patients However it was not the overcrowding  but the limited treatment options that presented the biggest problem  I feel helpless said Dr Phongsavan  Patients are often diagnosed very late and then there is often very little I can do to help them  I have to send them home to die The mortality rate for cervical cancer in Laos is six times that of the UK  But there are some success stories  Sommay Khamkeomany was diagnosed with cervical cancer last year when she was just  She had surgery and has now been told she has a  chance that her cancer will not recur I have two girls aged five and three said Mrs Khamkeomany When they are old enough I will ensure they have the HPV vaccine  and fortunately I should still be here to see that happen I feel lucky to be alive The HPV jab is the most expensive of all childhood vaccines A course of three injections can cost more than  privately in the UK and other wealthy countries  It was well beyond the reach of most developing nations until Gavi negotiated a price of less than    Like other Gavisupported countries Laos has to make a token financial contribution but also has to supply the nurses and organise distribution of the vaccine   The twoyear pilot project in Laos involves about  girls being immunised  If successful it will lead to a national rollout of the jab     By  Gavi hopes to have supported HPV immunisation of more  million girls in over  countries   The benefits in terms of lives saved wont be felt for decades but it represents a milestone in the promotion of womens health
