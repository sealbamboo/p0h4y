Taking some types of vitamin supplement may make it harder to train for big endurance events like marathons researchers in Norway suggest They said vitamins C and E should be used with caution as they may blunt the way muscles respond to exercise However actual athletic performance was not affected in the week trial leading other experts to questions the research The findings were   The team at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo argued vitamin supplements were readily taken and available but were unsure if they affected athletic ability Over the course of an week trial the  participants were given either mg of vitamin C plus mg vitamin E or a sugar pill They trained up to four times per week There was no difference in their performance during a Beep test  running faster and faster between two points m apart However blood samples and tissue biopsies suggested there were differences developing inside the muscle Each muscle cell contains lots of tiny mitochondria which give the muscle cell its energy Those taking the supplements seemed to be producing fewer extra mitochondria to cope with the increasing demands placed on the muscle Dr Goran Paulsen one of the researchers said Our results show that vitamin C and E supplements blunted the endurancetraininginduced increase of mitochondrial proteins which are needed to improve muscular endurance Our results indicate that high dosages of vitamin C and E as commonly found in supplements should be used with caution especially if you are undertaking endurance training However Mike Gleeson a professor of exercise biochemistry at Loughborough University is not convinced He said the biggest factor in performance was how fast the heart and lungs could get oxygen to the muscle not mitochondria Prof Gleeson said the lack of a difference in athletic performance makes it difficult to interpret   He told the BBC The bottom line is studies show changes in the ability to adapt to exercise could be impaired by highdose vitamins but until there are studies showing them affecting athletic performance people shouldnt be worried Dr Emma Derbyshire from the industrybacked Health Supplements Information Service said some studies had shown a benefit In a fourweek randomised controlled trial evaluating vitamin C and E supplementation among female athletes supplementation reduced markers of oxidative stress compared with a placebo tablet and reduced muscle damage markers associated with aerobic exercise This latest study is essentially preliminary and the research findings would need to be reassessed in further work  Eating as healthy a diet as possible is very important for sports people and athletes However if they have a hectic training schedule particularly for those doing endurance training who are not able to eat as well as they should a multivitamin and mineral supplement provides a method of ensuring that the intakes of these essential nutrients including vitamin C and E follow recommended guidelines
