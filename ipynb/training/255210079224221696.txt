With a growing population of baby boomers officials   for a surge in senior drivers   tell us that accidents increase after the age of  and fatal accidents are more likely after the age of  Canada requires   to report any concern about a patients ability to drive and they are being   every time they warn a patient But theres no such requirement here in the US While   opt for public transportation others stick to the roads So often its up to family members to help seniors decide when its time to give up the car keys Some families are already grappling with such decisions Comedian Dan Nainan travels across the country  and the world  telling tales that keep the laughs coming Nainan is a funny guy but there was nothing funny about what happened this year to his dad whos  One day I got a call and he was in a parking lot I guess he had accelerated into a brick wall and totaled his car recalls Nainan Motor vehicle authorities took Dads license away but it wasnt so straightforward with Nainans mother If he hadnt decided to get in the car and see how she was driving he wouldnt have known She was having trouble tracking staying straight But what scared me  she passed our house twice and did not turn in he says She was having trouble staying in her lane Then she tried a Uturn It was a disaster Thats when I decided that if she were to drive shed kill herself or somebody else or both And being a good son I didnt want that to happen he says Nainan succeeded in having his mothers license taken away Hes relieved too that now his parents have a caregiver who drives them around  a social worker at the Los Angelesbased geriatric care service   says this is typically how older drivers decide to give up the car keys Their child or grandchild intervenes I could probably say its  percent not the older adult saying I want to stop driving help me  says Dybnis because giving up driving feels like giving up ones independence Dybnis has seen many very stubborn older drivers which is why its so important for children to be aware and notice changes in driving behavior she says For starters inspect the car You look at the car for dents traffic tickets get a call from the hairdresser that theyve been to every week and all of a sudden they didnt show up and you find out they got lost getting there says Dybnis Minor fender benders traffic citations and forgetting where youre going can all signal cognitive decline Then theres the true test says Dybnis Would you let your parent or grandparent drive you or your children I see older children say My mother drives only to the hairdresser or market and thats fine but I would never let my children drive with her and Im even afraid to drive with her  says Dybnis Gee not willing to risk your own life or your childrens but maybe somebody else and your parents Thats a huge red flag If thats the case it might be time to suggest a driving evaluation by a doctor rehab clinic or geriatric care service Vision and hearing can be examined and they can test reflexes and memory Some problems can be easily remedied like removing cataracts or adding hearing aids But others are more serious and often mean its time to stop driving Some   are attuned to the unfortunate position this puts families and caregivers in Dr Marian Betz an ER doctor at the University of Colorado hospital in Denver has developed a tool she hopes could make the conversation about driving easier an advance driving directive Like an advance health care directive it would designate a trustworthy individual to start the conversation about driving when driving becomes hazardous Lets say Dads memory is going and he probably shouldnt be on the road anymore If he had written down that he trusted his oldest son to help him make the decision it would make it easier for the son to say Dad look you told me to take away the keys  Betz says And when that happens says Dybnis be prepared to replace it with something Offer to do the driving yourself Hire a caregiver or a neighbor who needs a little extra cash The point of course is not to leave your loved one stuck or isolated
