People who had ADHD in childhood are more likely to problems with substance abuse as adults But theres been disagreement about whether treatment of ADHD with stimulant medications like Ritalin reduces that risk or makes future problems with alcohol nicotine and illegal drugs more likely The latest look finds that young adults who took stimulants as kids were no more likely to have substance abuse problems later than those who had ADHD but didnt take stimulant drugs Its the broadest and deepest analysis yet but it still leaves many questions unanswered Researchers at UCLA looked at  studies that followed more than  children with ADHD from about age  to about age  Those studies looked for problems with drugs including nicotine alcohol cocaine and marijuana The researchers found that on average the people who had taken stimulant medications in childhood were not more likely to have substance abuse problems than people who hadnt For any parent the decision to pursue treatment is not a simple one says   a UCLA associate professor of psychology and senior author of the study It was   by   The most realistic way to think about these findings is that its not perfect but its the best evidence we have now he tells Shots Parents are more likely concerned about immediate side effects associated with stimulant medications including lack of appetite sleeping problems and stunted growth Lee says He urges parents to talk about both shortterm and longterm effects of the medications with their childs doctor Earlier reviews came to different conclusions than this one Some found that taking Ritalin reduced future risk while others found increased harm The discrepancies may be due to how old participants were when they were enrolled and how the teenagers or young adults were when they were evaluated for substance abuse problems This study isnt immune to those problems Lee says Age  is when problems with drugs and alcohol are typically just becoming apparent As studies follow young adults past age  he says theyll get a clearer idea of who is at risk and why Lees lab is working on that kind of study He is following  children both with and without ADHD to identify early predictors of alcohol abuse Theyve got a ways to go They started when the children were  to  years old and theyre  to  now Several theories have been put forth as to why people with ADHD are more likely to have substance abuse problems One is that the impulsivity that can characterize the disease leads to poor decisions about risks Another is that taking a stimulant in childhood could somehow lead to changes that make a person more vulnerable to future drug abuse Stimulant drugs work on some of the same   as do drugs of abuse ADHD in childhood may make it more likely that people are   researchers at NYU Langone Medical Center reported last week Its not clear whether that would be caused by neurobiology or behavior
