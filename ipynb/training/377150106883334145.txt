Women should get screened for breast cancer in their s a study concludes because they face a greater risk of death when cancers arent found early Women who were diagnosed with cancer in their s and died of the disease were more likely to have never had a mammogram than were older women according to the study Seventy percent of the women diagnosed with cancer in their s who later died hadnt had a mammogram compared to  percent of women in their s Half of the cancer deaths in the study were in women who had been diagnosed before age  Breast cancer is primarily a disease of older women but younger women tend to have fastergrowing cancer says   a professor of womens health and radiology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis She wasnt involved in the study There are people who feel that screening doesnt reduce death rates that its all in treatment Monsees tells Shots This study corroborates prior studies that screening mammograms save lives Breast cancer is   in younger women and is most often diagnosed when women are over  But in this study the death rate for women diagnosed in their s was almost twice that of women diagnosed in their s The study is sure to add to the ongoing controversy over when and how often women should get mammograms It backs up the American Cancer Societys   that women get mammograms every year starting at age  But in  the US Preventive Services Task Force a federally funded independent panel   that in general women should wait until age  to start getting mammograms and then get screened every two years up until age  That recommendation factored in the fact that younger women are more likely to have false positive mammograms which can lead to unnecessary biopsies and anxiety Overdiagnosis has been completely exaggerated says   director of breast imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital and an author of the paper Well calling people back for additional screening causes anxiety I understand that But it absolutely saves lives You reduce the death rate by   percent if you start screening at age  This study looked at women in the Partners HealthCare system in Boston who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from  to  The researchers then checked the womens medical records to see if and when theyd had mammograms Its a form of study called a failure analysis a whatwentwrong approach similar to that used in investigating airplane crashes   an emeritus professor at Brown Universitys Alpert Medical School and one of the study authors tells Shots that he thinks it better reflects the effect of screening than do populationbased studies because the health system records show which women actually got mammograms rather than say they did Of the  women in the study  had died of breast cancer by  Almost threequarters of the women who died hadnt had a mammogram in the two years before the cancer was found Overall  percent of the women were getting mammograms at least every two years well above the   Some of them still got breast cancer but overall the death rates were higher in women whose tumors werent found until they could be felt While the analysis reveals that regular screening will not prevent all breast cancer deaths Robert Smith director of screening for the American Cancer Society told Shots in an email it also reveals that even with improvements in treatment there is still a significant advantage of detecting breast cancer with mammography before symptoms develop This new study also found no benefit in mammograms for women over age  when it came to reducing cancer death risk The study was  online in the journal
