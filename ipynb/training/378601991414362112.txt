The park was all ours for about two hours Then a young mother pushed her stroller complete with a kicking newborn toward us Dad paused our catch to sip from a nearby water fountain When the mother and child neared he politely leaned into the stroller waved and gave the baby his best smile But because the Bells palsy still lingered his grin looked more like a smirk The mother found his smile condescending She ogled at him for a second or two then rushed her stroller away Dad hid his mouth in his hand and walked to the car He wanted to go home Lets go bud he said Im not feeling well A month earlier Bells palsy had struck Dad paralyzing the right side of his face It drooped his eyelid and left him slurring words He could hardly drink from a cup or bottle without liquid spilling onto his neck and shirt And his smile which once eased the pain of playground cuts and burst at the mention of Mick Jaggers strut Woody Allens films or his very own Yankees was gone As I slumped into the car I began suspecting that our sunrise park visit wasnt about watching daylight lift beneath us Dad had spent weeks lamenting the loss of his smile This was his effort to avoid stares It was a solemn drive home I killed time by curving my caps brim and fidgeting between songs on the radio dial We returned home and he went to bed Lying down but unable to nod off he simply spent a few hours sighing and groaning toward the ceiling After that morning Dad and I didnt visit parks nor did he want to play catch He spent more time indoors He left the shopping driving and Little League games to Mom Since being a freelance editor enabled him to work from home he turned our dining room into his office and buried himself in manuscripts When Dad wasnt at his desk he attended physical therapy He obeyed the doctors orders Now smile as wide as you can  Now lift your right cheek with your hand  Now try to whistle Only the sound of blowing air came out My earliest childhood memories were of Dad whistling to songs on the radio He didnt care if the station was playing Frank Sinatra or Bobby McFerrin He always whistled along He taught me to whistle too Of the roughly  Americans that the National Institutes of Health says are afflicted with Bells palsy each year most recover within several weeks Other cases take a few months to heal But after nine weeks of therapy Dads face hardly improved and the doctor confessed she couldnt do much more to help Ive never seen anything like this she told him after his final session Then she handed him the bill Rather than calling another doctor or physical therapist Dad stuck to humor He occasionally grabbed washable markers and drew an evensided grin across his face Other times he practiced his Elvis Presley impersonation He joked that curled lips had already lent him a handicap thereby giving him more time to perfect his renditions of Hound Dog and Burning Love The effort  a regimen of showertime vocal warmups and leg stretches  paid off He could soon don white jackets and swing his hips as if he lost himself in the King By the time I entered fourth grade that September Dads case of Bells palsy had improved He could blink his right eye and speak clearly again But his smile still hadnt returned I tried convincing myself that it didnt matter and that smiling was overrated So I abstained from making grins of any kind Nothing about fourth grade made my nosmiling vow easy Classmates were both old enough to laugh about pop culture and young enough to appreciate fart jokes burped alphabets and straws in noses Breaking the promise I made myself was tempting but I couldnt let Dad not smile alone I didnt care how hard I needed to bite my lip I had my critics Kids would call me Frowny the Dwarf It didnt help that I was merely foot at age nine Teachers would escort me into hallways wondering what was wrong When I asked my physical education coach Whats so great about smiling he made me do pushups while the rest of the class played wiffle ball Then he called Dad I never learned what Dad discussed with the coach But when I got off the school bus that afternoon and saw him waiting for me holding our mitts and ball it didnt seem to matter He tapped the brims of our matching Yankee caps For the first time in months we got in the family sedan and went to the park for a catch Its been too long he said The park always bustled on Friday afternoons When we arrived young children dashed to the nearby ice cream stand Mothers kissed booboos and gossiped And roughly a halfdozen fathers and sons lined the field with mitted arms in the air Even if Dad couldnt smile as widely as the others he couldnt help but beam neither could I Sundown came quickly The fields white lights glowed and everyone else left the park But Dad and I didnt tire We threw everything from curveballs to folly floaters into the night We had catching up to do
