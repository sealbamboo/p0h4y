SILVER SPRING, Md.—Members of a panel advising the Food and Drug Administration on a medical device that can spread cancer in women on Friday made a variety of suggestions to reduce that risk, from an outright ban to limiting its use among patients.. The positions emerged amid two days of often-emotional testimony about devices called laparoscopic power morcellators. The panel was asked to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of the tool used in roughly 50,000 procedures a year.
