The home care system in England is close to crisis because of the way workers are exploited a report says The review led by former Care Minister Paul Burstow found a combination of inadequate funding and poor working practices was putting people at risk About  older and disabled people rely on home care for daily tasks such as washing and dressing Some pay for it but others get help from councils But the report said zerohours contracts and low pay was harming care The review was set up by the Local Government Information Unit think tank and home care provider Mears after a number of scandals in residential care homes It analysed existing data as well as taking evidence from those in involved in the sector and concluded it was only a matter of time before there was a major scandal in home care If found about  of care workers were employed on zerohours contracts while there were many staff  up to a third  who were effectively not being paid the minimum wage because they are not paid while travelling between clients These practices contributed to a high turnover rate in the sector with over a fifth of staff leaving their jobs each year  twice the national average The lack of stability meant that those receiving care were often faced with short visits and constant changes in staff  there were reports of some people having up to  different carers in a year Mr Burstow said The price of poor care is paid for by the most frail and vulnerable in our community and by the care workers they rely on who get a raw deal LGIU chief executive Jonathan CarrWest said If home care is not in crisis yet it soon will be More people need care and there is less money to pay for it and not enough people willing to do the work The report said care workers should be given keyworker status and paid the living wage which currently stands at  an hour in London and  elsewhere But it said this would require care providers to be paid more by councils for the work they do Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said it was completely unacceptable for staff not to be paid fairly He said providers that broke the minimum wage law would be named and shamed But Colin Angel of the UK Home Care Association which represents providers said they were doing their best but were being squeezed financially Older and disabled people deserve excellent services from a workforce which is suitably trained committed and adequately rewarded for the increasingly complex care required to be delivered at home he added
