Taking aspirin every day can reduce the chance of developing or dying from bowel and stomach cancers a review of all available evidence suggests And scientists predict if everyone aged  and above in the UK took the drug for  years some  deaths could be prevented over two decades  But they warn aspirin can cause internal bleeding and say medical advice must be sought before using it The Queen Mary University of London report is in the Annals of Oncology Scientists examined some  studies investigating the benefits and harms of taking aspirin  an area of continuing medical debate  They found the drug reduced the number of cases and deaths from bowel stomach and oesophageal cancer by some  There was weaker and more variable evidence that the drug reduced deaths from breast prostate and lung cancer too  And the study found people needed to take the drug for at least five years to see any benefits Prof Jack Cuzick  at Queen Mary University of London who led the research urged all healthy people aged  and above to consider taking a small dose mg of the drug every day for a decade  Researchers predicted if  individuals aged  took the drug for  years a further decade later there would be Prof Cuzick who has been taking aspirin for four years said Whilst there are some serious sideeffects that cant be ignored taking aspirin daily looks to be the most important thing we can do to reduce cancer after stopping smoking and reducing obesity and will probably be much easier to implement They found benefits continued even when people stopped taking the drug but say it is unclear exactly how long people should use it for As the risk of internal bleeding rises as an individual gets older they suggest a cutoff point of  years  There is still uncertainty whether other doses of the drug could offer more protection Aspirins well known possible sideeffects include bleeding in the stomach and the brain  And while the study suggests  lives could be saved if everyone in the UK aged  took the drug this is balanced against the estimated  deaths from sideeffects Experts warn anyone at high risk of bleeding including people with blood disorders who take blood thinning medication or are frequent smokers or drinkers are more likely to suffer these sideeffects  They recommend anyone considering daily medication should speak to their doctors to discuss individual risks Dr Julie Sharp at Cancer Research UK said Aspirin is showing promise in preventing certain types of cancer but its vital that we balance this with the complications it can cause Before aspirin can be recommended for cancer prevention some important questions need to be answered and tests need to be developed to predict who is likely to have sideeffects Exactly how aspirin protects against cancer is unknown Scientists suggest it may reduce inflammation or act on blood cells that would otherwise encourage the spread of the disease
