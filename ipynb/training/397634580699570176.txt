The government must do more to stop junior doctors from leaving Northern Ireland to work abroad the British Medical Association BMA has said It said part of the problem is that junior doctors working in the UK are facing increasingly challenging and highly pressured work environments This forces some to move overseas where conditions are more favourable according to the BMA NI chairman Dr Paul Darragh said the drain on local talent is immense Our education and training is among the best in the UK After spending a lot of money training up that pool of talent eventually some leave to work elsewhere he told the BBC  Some of those young people reluctantly leave but conditions here are just too tough While doctors must be prepared to deal with the worst the argument is that if more were employed per shift patients would receive an even higher standard of care and there would be fewer mistakes  Queens University School of Medicine in Belfast is ranked as one of the best in the UK Almost  of the students who graduated from the school in  opted to begin their careers in Northern Ireland Just over  of them took up employment in Great Britain while almost  secured jobs in the Republic of Ireland  However evidence shows that several years after graduation many junior doctors are moving away to work elsewhere for instance emigrating to Australia  Currently there are  medical students preparing to graduate next year from Queens University School of Medicine One of the highlights of the Queens course is the simulator exercise where final year students get to experience life on a virtual ward as actors take on the role of patients  The minute exercise begins with a ward round then the drama unfolds  In one scenario a female patient who is a chronic asthma sufferer goes into cardiac arrest The medical student is required to react as they would in a real life medical emergency Chest compressions begin chest xrays are ordered antibiotics are prescribed and nurses are given instructions Not all necessarily in that particular order  The clinical director of the course is Dr Jim Murray  We make students aware of what is going on around them They shouldnt get too focused on one particular task and miss things in the wider picture he said We teach them to be decisive to prioritise to ask for help to call for help when required  these are all human factors which are far more important in mitigating error or the effects of error Dr Murray added In cubicle three the patient loses consciousness He has been admitted to AE after being hit by a golf ball  A student is tasked to find out what is wrong and to respond Even though it is just a simulation the effect is powerful  Among the students is Adam Gowdy Yes its scary  but its what I want to do he said The whole point of our training is to prepare for this type of scenario  next year it wont be a simulator it will be the real thing  Yes thats scary but we are constantly training and next year will be shadowing junior doctors on the wards for  weeks  The BMA argues that the UK and in particular Northern Ireland trains the best of medical students Therefore changes need to be made if the UK wants to retain them  Speaking recently Dr Mark Porter BMA Chair of Council said Doctors in the NHS face increasingly challenging high pressured and stressful work environments often with limited resources and gruelling workloads Unsurprisingly the result has been more doctors choosing to leave the UK to work abroad In some specialties such as emergency medicine this has contributed to a recruitment crisis and means existing doctors have to work flat out to meet rising demand Dr Porter said To stem this problem we urgently need to address issues around workload pressures resourcing and worklife balance Only by making working practices and environments safe and sustainable will the NHS be able attract and retain the best and brightest  Dr Murray said it is important to remember that the students are humans not robots We are human beings we all make mistakes but this is how we prepare them for the times when they will be stressed and interrupted This is excellent training among the best in the UK  but we must try and hang on to this great pool of talent  Dr Paul Darragh agrees The working conditions must be improved Other countries abroad can do it  so must we
