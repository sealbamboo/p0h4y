Our bodies may help us remember our lives fixing experiences in place By using virtual reality scientists can make people feel like theyre outside their own bodies And when they do the brain struggles to remember what happened The phenomenon is a bit like the disembodied sensation that some people have with posttraumatic stress disorder or schizophrenia according to   a neuroscience researcher at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and lead author of the study You might even compare it to an extreme form of daydreaming Its a new way to assess whats going on between two intermingled systems the body and memory Bergouignan told Shots We did not realize that they were so intermingled To create the outofbody illusion Bergouignan and her colleagues outfitted volunteers with goggles and headphones that let them see and hear through a camera and microphones positioned elsewhere in the room They heightened the illusion by touching the volunteers with a stick while they watched a different stick approach the camera from the same angle The effect is very very strong Bergouignan says who tried it many times You feel outside your body You feel where the camera is Then the student volunteers were grilled by a particularly demanding professor about information they had studied  surely something they could remember Unbeknownst to the students the professor was played by a Swedish actor who used dialogue based on work of the British playwright Harold Pinter When the students location was virtually shifted outside their bodies they had a harder time remembering details of that event a week later compared to when they didnt feel like their location was shifted They did not remember the context Bergouignan says The   were published Monday in the   And it looks like the outofbody students used their brains differently too When participants tried to recall the virtual reality sessions they relied less on the brains hippocampus a region involved in creating memories of events according to MRI scans Somehow it seems the brain relies on the body to help remember events That wasnt the case with the emotional context of the encounter with the eccentric professor or the facts they had to remember Knowing about this connection between the body and memory may help better understand PTSD People who have been traumatized are more apt to have the feeling that they have been disembodied Bergouignan says We know the trauma will change the person But we dont know whats the effect of stress and whats the effect of disassociation Here we show the effect of disassociation alone It has an effect on memory Daydreaming may be a very mild form of this We cant say whats going on when its milder but its giving hints she says We need to be able to experience something to be able to recall it later But Bergouignan says its too much of a leap to say that experiencing an increasingly virtual world as we do through computers phones and cameras may tinker with memory We should not speculate she says
