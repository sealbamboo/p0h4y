 Women with the BRCA gene who are already at greater risk for breast and ovarian cancer may also be at increased risk for early menopause according to a new study Researchers at the University of California San Francisco found   may give women fewer childbearing years and may also increase their risk of infertility And heavy smokers who carry the mutation may go through menopause even earlier than nonsmoking women with the mutation The researchers suggested that women with the BRCA mutation consider having children at a younger age They noted that doctors should encourage their patients who carry this mutation to get   Our findings show that mutation of these genes has been linked to early menopause which may lead to a higher incidence of infertility study senior author Dr Mitchell Rosen director of the UCSF Fertility Preservation said in a university news release This can add to the significant psychological implications of being a BRCA  carrier and will likely have an impact on reproductive decisionmaking In conducting the study which was published online Jan  in the journal   the researchers examined information on  female carriers of mutations in the BRCA gene who lived in northern California Most were white The age at which these women went through menopause was compared to that of nearly  women living in the same area who did not carry a BRCA mutation The study revealed that women with the mutation experienced menopause at age  on average In comparison   began at about  Women who smoked more than  cigarettes daily who carried the mutation went through menopause even earlier with onset at age  on average The researchers pointed out that only  percent of white women living in the region experienced menopause by that age Mutations in either of the genes BRCA  or BRCA  are the most identified inherited cause of breast cancer Women with these mutations are five times more likely to develop breast cancer than those without the mutations according to the US National Cancer Institute The researchers noted that more studies are needed on the link between BRCA mutations and risk for infertility They pointed out that data on the natural age of menopause among women with these mutations is limited since many opt to undergo surgery to remove atrisk tissue including their breasts and ovaries after they have children
