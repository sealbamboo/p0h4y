 Boston Scientific Corp. is boosting staff, opening surgeon-training centers and eyeing acquisitions in China as it aims to offset sluggish medical-device sales back home in the U.S..

"Access is always a challenge," said Warren Wang, vice president and managing director of Boston Scientific's China division, referring to the company's ability to tap new patients.
