In a society where  million people are caring for someone with a chronic or terminal illness there is no shortage of literature on the subject from academic papers to memoirs to practical guides But in this new anthology the first of its kind the literature is really that Living in the Land of Limbo is filled with poems and stories about caregiving from some of the most renowned authors of the past halfcentury Alice Munro W S Merwin James Dickey Robert Pinsky Mary Gordon Rosellen Brown C K Williams and  others How does one review such work The answer is one doesnt  but rather considers what their stories and poems have to offer the rest of us The editor is Carol Levine director of the United Hospital Funds Families and Health Care Project herself the author of many papers about family caregiving for leading medical journals I have interviewed her in my work from time to time She began collecting these pieces almost accidentally during sleepless nights spent caring for her husband Howard who was left a quadriplegic with traumatic   after an automobile accident He lived in that state for  years for solace and meaning Ms Levine turned to reading She organizes the book not by genre but by relationship children of aging parents husbands and wives parents and sick children relatives lovers and friends and paid caregivers This leads to some weak links Finding literature about those for whom caregiving is a  not an act of love or obligation often intertwined was difficult Ms Levine told me Many of the stories and poems are about   beautiful and heartrending but dated by treatment breakthroughs that make them seem like sepiatinted photographs And the section on parents and children  though graced by the magnificent People Like That Are the Only People Here by Lorrie Moore  should have included   The incidence demands it and the literature exists I devoured the rest the world fallen away reading as I remember from childhood heedless of traffic as I crossed the street with my nose in a book What I found were three qualities that are the singular strengths of fiction and poetry First the unsayable can be said without the need to pretty it up or tone it down to spare a loved ones feelings People dont merely soil themselves as howto books would have it Poets and storytellers have the freedom to tell us what they actually do how it smells how it feels Second they give vent to the rage and selfishness that are not just felt but sometimes acted out in silly and spiteful ways  yet are described here without shame I pushed my mothers wheelchair onto the lawn of the nursing home even when she didnt want to go because I couldnt stand another minute indoors and I had all the power Once she even cried to go back inside I pretended not to notice Finally fiction and poetry afford an almost infinite choice of points of view My two favorites  Raymond Carvers poem Where the Groceries Went and Rick Moodys story Whosoever The Language of Mothers and Sons  both alternate between an adult child and a parent Never before had I truly understood not merely empathized with what the other felt The Carver poem recounts the second phone call of the day from a demented mother to her son whose voice shakes with anger after spending hours buying her  worth of food only to hear her say that there is nothing to eat in the house but bologna and cheese The mother replies Im afraid of everything Help me please Then you can go back to whatever it was you were doing Whatever it was that was so important I had to take the trouble To bring you into the world 
 
For me the Moody story rose above the rest probably because the old womans condition paralyzed losing her speech but cognitively intact was virtually the same as my mothers In sentences that span pages without a full stop the son swings from tenderness to fury while bathing and feeding his mother He wipes stalactites of drool from her mouth uses rose bath salts and a violet washcloth while soaping underneath the breasts where he once fed But at the same time he tunes the radio to a raucous station he knows she hates and is impatient to go drink too much at a local bar Then Mr Moody shifts the story to the mother remembering her son and her husband at a Christmas past The men had bought a computer with a voice synthesizer and software that would allow her to build sentences word by laborious word They were so proud they had solved her problem as shed been a talker She wants no part of their loving gift Speech she knows is a thing of the past like perfumed thankyou notes something consigned to the netherworld of orphaned socks and earrings She refuses to cooperate despite their importuning that she mustnt give up Instead inches from her only child she haltingly manages to whisper Oh darling she tells her son Your mother is in some marvelously big trouble I am alone
