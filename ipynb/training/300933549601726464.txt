Each year around the world more than  million people use illegal drugs and marijuana still appears to be the drug of choice researchers found Although illegality makes accurate estimates a challenge data from  suggest that  to  million people around the world used illegal drugs according to Louisa Degenhardt PhD of the University of New South Wales in Sydney and Wayne Hall PhD of the University of Queensland in Australia Pot use with anywhere from  to  million people lighting up annually is the most widely used they said They reported their estimates in a special issue of   that focused on addiction That proportion is far larger than the  to  million estimated to use amphetamines the  to  million estimated to use cocaine and the  to  million estimated to use opioids they found Pot is also the most widely used illegal drug in the US according to the latest data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration SAMHSA In  about  million Americans used illicit drugs with  million of them reporting cannabis use Yet marijuana is the least likely of all illicit   to cause death the researchers said cautioning that its still likely associated with dependence and mental disorders Opioids heroin fentanyl on the other hand are a major cause of death due to overdose and dependence and have also been tied to HIV and hepatitis B and C infection especially among injectiondrug users Preference for drugs varies geographically with pot and cocaine use highest in North America and Europe while more than half of opioid users lived in Asia with the highest levels being along the main drug trafficking routes out of Afghanistan Levels of illicit drug use seem to be highest in highincome countries and in countries near major drug production areas Degenhardt and Hall wrote They noted that their study didnt assess use of hallucinogens inhalants benzodiazepines anabolic steroids or ecstasy methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDMA Initiation and progression of drug use also varies by region with most users in highincome countries starting out with alcohol and tobacco then transitioning to marijuana use and finally into other drugs But that pattern isnt consistent the researchers said In Japan for instance other illicit drug use is more prevalent than cannabis use suggesting that abuse depends on social factors and drug availability Social norms have a very powerful impact on drug use patterns Bruce Goldman director of substance abuse services at North Shore LIJ in Glen Oaks NY told   in an email We need to create norms where substance use and availability especially for young people is not acceptable Although problematic the global burden of disease caused by illicit drug use is far less than that of alcohol and tobacco according to various estimates One from  found drug use to be associated with  to  deaths worldwide  far lower than the estimated  million deaths due to alcohol use and  million deaths with tobacco use Similarly World Health Organization data from  suggested that  deaths worldwide were attributable to drug use compared with  million due to alcohol use and just over five million associated with tobacco they reported Still Degenhardt and Hall called illicit drug use a substantial global cause of premature mortality and morbidity They added that the  to  million people around the world estimated to inject drugs are responsible for the largest burden of disease associated with illegal drugs along with those who are dependent about  to  million people are thought to be in this class of problematic user they reported They said much of this burden can be reduced or prevented through needle exchange programs opioid substitution treatment and antiretroviral therapy Many questions about global drug use remain unanswered they added concluding that until we have better answers to these questions statements about the exact magnitude of the health social and financial burden of illicit drug use cannot be made with accuracy The editors of   noted in an accompanying commentary that policymakers in the US need to pay particular attention to abuse of prescription drugs Prevention and treatment of prescription drug dependency offer challenges that differ from those of addiction to illicit drugs and need innovative solutions they wrote   is a complex disease without a universal policy approach or treatment
