Despite guidelines to treat back pain conservatively the proportion of people prescribed powerful painkillers or referred for surgery and other specialty care has increased in recent years according to a new study This is kind of concerning said Dr Steven Cohen an anesthesiologist and critical care doctor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore who didnt participate in the research  Surgery injections and scans for back pain have all gone up pretty dramatically he told Reuters Health  We have increased utilization yet we dont have better treatment outcomes  The American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society recommend that people with low back pain consider treatment with Tylenol or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs as well as heating pads and exercise  The groups say doctors should only order CT and other scans when they suspect nerve damage Opioids are only recommended for patients with severe disabling pain that doesnt get better with overthecounter medicines  and their risks such as for abuse and addiction should be weighed against potential benefits  For the new study Dr Bruce Landon from the Harvard Medical School in Boston and his colleagues tracked nationallyrepresentative data on outpatient visits for back and neck pain collected between  and   The researchers had information on about  visits which represented a total of  million appointments across the US  During that span they found the proportion of patients prescribed Tylenol and NSAIDs dropped from  percent to  percent At the same time the proportion given narcotics rose from  percent to  percent  About  percent of people with back pain had a CT or MRI scan in  and  compared to seven percent in  and   Finally although the rate of referrals to physical therapy held steady during the study period the proportion of patients referred to another doctor  likely for surgery or other treatments  doubled from seven to  percent the researchers reported Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine  Physicians want to offer patients treatments that are going to work sooner and patients are demanding them and sometimes its just easier to order the MRI or order the referral Landon said  But he added They often lead to things that are unnecessary and expensive and maybe not better in the long run and maybe even worse such as surgery or injections that havent proven to be effective  According to the National Institutes of Health eight out of ten people have back pain at some point in their lives  One of the difficulties of treating back pain Cohen said is that there are so many possible causes  including disc joint and nerve problems  He said the strongest evidence supports treating the pain with exercise including stretching and some aerobic activity  Landon said  percent of patients will recover from back pain with a little bit of time and conservative treatment  They key thing for patients is give it time he told Reuters Health  Patients expect and want it to get better in seconds and thats not always going to happen But if you give it time work on it do stretching and physical therapy exercises thats whats going to make it better in the long run
