Charities trying to fight AIDS overseas dont have to say they oppose prostitution or human trafficking to get federal funds and the federal government has no right to tell them to the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday The court struck down a George W Bushera law that required nonprofit groups to sign on to the antiprostitution policy if they wanted aid money  The antiprostitution pledge was a major barrier for many organizations providing essential health programs and important resources for this population and we hope that this decision will spur real progress toward ending the epidemic said Chris Collins director of public policy for amfAR the Foundation for AIDS Research  The aid groups argued that sex workers were often the very people they needed to target to take on the deadly and incurable virus According to UNAIDS sex workers are roughly eight times more likely to be infected with HIV than other adults amFAR which filed a friendofthecourt brief in the suit says in a statement However targeted efforts to provide HIV prevention services for sex workers have been shown to help bring national epidemics under control For example condom promotion efforts helped reduce HIV prevalence among sex workers in Thailand from  percent in  to five percent in  The Supreme Court voted  against the policy with Chief Justice John Roberts writing the main opinion  The Policy Requirement violates the First Amendment by compelling as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of the Government program Roberts wrote Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented saying the government has every right to set moral and ethical policies  Today the Supreme Court announced a decision that is a victory for human rights and global health said amfAR CEO Kevin Robert Frost Lifting the ban on the antiprostitution pledge will get us closer to controlling the AIDS epidemic by providing better access to prevention and treatment services for an underserved population disproportionately affected by HIVAIDS  Other groups also welcomed the decision Kudos to the Supreme Court for overturning this counterproductive law that required AIDS and health groups to take an antiprostitution pledge as a condition of receiving AIDS funding to provide potentially lifesaving care and services to needy and deserving populations said Michael Weinstein president of AIDS Healthcare Foundation which provides medical care and services to  people in  countries  It is not the job of public health providers like AIDS Healthcare Foundation here or abroad to be judging the people we serve Health service providers should have a singular concentration on protecting the public health
