For at least a decade many have assumed that too many fidgety kids have been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and been medicated for it But its still been hard to get reliable information on just how many kids are getting diagnosed and whether its justified So researchers at Kaiser Permanente in California decided to look at the trend using the best data they could get from kids whod actually seen specialists They found that the number of children being diagnosed with ADHD by doctors in the Kaiser system in Southern California rose  percent over the past decade Thats  percent of children ages  to  diagnosed in  compared to  percent in  Overall almost  percent of the  children studied were being treated for ADHD Thats a big number but its still a lot lower than the  percent of kids receiving the diagnosis as reported by federal studies Thats probably because the federal surveys rely on parent and teacher reports which are less reliable than the medical records of children getting health care at Kaiser The Kaiser researchers also only counted kids who had seen specialists which means their diagnosis is probably more accurate The Kaiser Permanente researchers also used very specific criteria for the diagnosis doctors using the   a diagnostic manual that requires that a child have six or more symptoms for at least six months that arent ageappropriate and are severe enough to cause problems in everyday life Those symptoms include failing to pay close attention to details difficulty sustaining attention difficulty organizing tasks and activities avoiding homework or other tasks that require sustained mental effort fidgeting excessive talking and impulsivity We took a clearer definition of ADHD says   the Kaiser researcher who led the   which was published online in   They found that ADHD is still most commonly diagnosed in white boys from highincome families making more than  a year But the number of black and Hispanic children diagnosed increased the most from  percent to  percent for blacks particularly black girls and  percent to  percent for Hispanics Those increases could be due to better education of parents and better access to health care Getahun says Hispanic children were most likely to be diagnosed later around age  or  Other studies have shown that the earlier children are diagnosed and treated the better they respond It may be that additional education is needed to make parents aware that early diagnoses is very critical Getahun adds The number of Asian children diagnosed with ADHD stayed at a low  percent I dont have an explanation for that Getahun says Other studies have also found that Asian children are less likely to be diagnosed and more likely to stop treatment with prescription drugs like Ritalin and Adderal That tells me theres a cultural issue there Getahun added He plans to explore that in the future Even if the lower numbers from this study hold up ADHD remains among the most common psychiatric problems of childhood Children with ADHD are more likely to have problems in school become injured and struggle with relationships with friends and family In  the annual economic costs attributed to ADHD were estimated at between  and  billion The causes of ADHD arent clear but it can run in families which suggests there may be genetic causes Other potential factors include exposure to environmental toxins including tobacco smoke lead and pesticides a mothers use of antidepressants during pregnancy and low birth weight and prematurity About half of children diagnosed seem to outgrow the symptoms by the time theyre in their s In  researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health reported that that could be because some   tend to mature later than normal Those regions are the ones associated with control of action and attention
