Food companies and restaurants could soon face government pressure to make their foods less salty  a longawaited federal effort to try to prevent thousands of deaths each year from heart disease and stroke The Food and Drug Administration is preparing to issue voluntary guidelines asking the food industry to lower sodium levels FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg told The Associated Press Hamburg said in a recent interview that the sodium is of huge interest and concern and she hopes the guidelines will be issued relatively soon We believe we can make a big impact working with the industry to bring sodium levels down because the current level of consumption really is higher than it should be for health Hamburg said The food industry has already made some reductions and has prepared for government action since a  Institute of Medicine report said companies had not made enough progress on making foods less salty The IOM advised the government to establish maximum sodium levels for different foods though the FDA said then  and maintains now  that it favors a voluntary route Americans eat about  teaspoons of salt daily about a third more than the government recommends for good health and enough to increase the risk of high blood pressure strokes and other problems Most of that sodium is hidden inside common processed foods and restaurant meals In addition to flavor companies use sodium to increase shelf life prevent the growth of bacteria or improve texture and appearance That makes it more difficult to remove from some products Hamburg noted Once the guidelines are issued Americans wont notice an immediate taste difference in highersodium foods like pizza pasta bread and soups The idea would be to encourage gradual change so consumers taste buds can adjust and to give the companies time to develop lowersodium foods
