My mother lives in Scottsdale Ariz so packing for a summer th birthday visit was easy Loose linen clothes a sheet of baking parchment and a threeounce bar of Scharffen Berger bittersweet chocolate because my sister wasnt sure shed bought enough  I was going to bake my mom a birthday cake  the chocolate cake her motherinlaw was known for called bachelor bait cake on the little index card I inherited in a box of family memorabilia I tormented myself a little bit over which cake in my repertoire was the right one I liked this one because it had history My mothers response in the particular dry tone with which she addresses any kind of excess Why would you go to all that trouble Given that the question came after she considered my hair Youre going to do something with it arent you and my dress Youre wearing something else to dinner I had started to wonder too Still I drove my little rental car over to my sisters the day before moms birthday while she was napping to make the chocolate and espresso ganache thats so much nicer than regular buttercream And I was up early on the day itself so I could bake the cake before my mom was ready to go to the beauty salon Working in an unfamiliar kitchen is hard even if it belongs to someone whose first notion of kitchen was the same as mine The oven mitts and measuring spoons and measuring cups arent where I first look the mitts take five tries before I find them My aspirations spike well into the crazy range This cake doesnt just have to be tasty It has to be good enough to retire the question of why Id go to all this trouble It has to be better than storebought  It has to compensate for the fact that as far as my mom is concerned we cant do anything at all not really Oh sure everybody pitches in My sister who lives  minutes from mom does a ton of stuff from the weekly dinner to shopping and the organizing of the closet and calendar and doctors visits along with a daily phone call Since I live farther away I go for phone calls and increasingly frequent visits  But on some level it doesnt matter what we do since theres no fixing this whatever you want to call it Dementia memory loss Alzheimers I find myself increasingly irked in truth by people who devote so much energy to slapping a label on it as though there were a cure attached to picking the right one Its not like we have endless good moments to waste here Might it not be better to live than to debate the exact category into which life now fits  I prefer my moms phrasing as in Im no good with names Or  Im just not myself Or Im never going to be  again with a genuine note of surprise in her voice as though shed just noticed a hole in a new garment and were about to set off to the store to exchange it for a better one  No matter how hard we try theres no way to steer through a typical conversation anymore because we keep getting sidetracked by the same question asked again And again Thats what a chat is now lots of lateral movement and not so much forward motion  It hurts more than I thought it would not to be able to fill her in on my daughter or my work and have it stick Id do anything to make it stick My dear exhausted sister must feel that way tenfold Failing that failing anything that constitutes meaningful caregiving that leads to improvement  tea for a sore throat aloe for a burn  I bake the cake My sister puts it on the kind of nice glass platter my mom was once known for and buys candles There are two presents in gift bags stuffed with too much tissue a compact thats easier to open than moms current model and one of those photo collages you order online set in a frame We cant light the candles were a family of nonsmokers and its an electric range But faced with the cake the presents and two kinds of ice cream my mom suddenly becomes the birthday girl She unwraps the compact with glee holds it up for inspection tries out the easier clasp is delighted She opens the photo collage and studies every one of the nine pictures until she settles on the one bottom left of her and my late father when they were in their thirties Look how young we were she says tracing her finger over that photo letting it rest there when the talk turns to other things not wistful but somehow reassured Its a signpost Its where we used to live What a peaceful little evening and the proof resides in the digital camera We three dont like having our pictures taken  we blink we look down we do all sorts of things that make a good group portrait almost impossible But look at this Shot after shot of three happy smiling women daring that camera to tell us otherwise staring straight into it defiant if only briefly  So I am impotent on the big stuff and a magician with a whisk My sister sails through futility with incomprehensible good cheer We cant do a damn thing about the inevitable but we can all enjoy a good piece of cake As we clear away the plates my otherwise beleaguered mother smiles a smile thats very reminiscent of the one in the photo with my dad Ive been talking about a sour cherry pound cake Id made and out of nowhere she announces Maybe Id like that one next year Happy birthday mom Mattie Anns
