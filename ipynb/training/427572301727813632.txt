Heres a medical mystery that begins with a kindergarten teacher Were not using her full name to protect her medical privacy so well call her M M taught reading to  and yearolds at a school outside Chicago but two years ago something happened to her that changed her life she lost the ability to read Her problems began a few days before Halloween M was helping out at a Halloween party put on by the local park district selling tickets at the front desk Over and over she incorrectly counted the number of people who approached the desk and asked for the wrong amount of money That week she got lost driving in a familiar neighborhood and her mother noticed she was confused about dates and times It was all very uncharacteristic for the independent yearold teacher About a week after it began M was trying to take attendance at school when she realized she couldnt type the numbers and letters of her computer password When she finally got to the hospital she found out she had been experiencing a series of strokes Dr Murray Flaster is one of the doctors who has treated M at Loyola Medical Center in Chicago We believe she had an inflammation of blood vessels in the brain he says And that inflammation led to the cutoff of bloodflow to a few areas in the brain As M recovered her most striking symptom was that she could write but she couldnt read For example Flaster says If you give her a book and ask her to read it she knows its a book she knows there must be letters on the page she knows there are words there but she cannot recognize letters and put letters into words The disorder is called alexia The strokes damaged the connection between the part of Ms brain that takes visual information from her eyes and the part that deciphers words But M can still understand language in other ways She can listen to audiobooks and write stories She still has good reading comprehension even though she cant read I miss the normalcy of it she says I miss functioning in the world There are so many things in the world you take for granted I never thought I would say reading is something I took for granted As M went through rehabilitation she came up with a way to reteach herself how to read Instead of relying on her eyes she used touch to understand words When M sees a jumble of shapes that look like a word she begins by tracing each letter with her finger As she traces each letter she goes through the alphabet in her head or out loud until she knows what letter shes tracing Its a very slow laborious way to read but it works Flaster doesnt know how M came up with this method but he is impressed that she did She discovered that all by herself he says We speculate that the fact that she was an expert in teaching children how to read perhaps made her more likely to discover that than someone else who might be stricken similarly M isnt the first to come up with the tracing method Dr Rhonda Friedman and her team at Georgetown Universitys Center for Aphasia Research and Rehabilitation have taught other patients to use tracing to read after similar brain damage Friedman says one patient made significant gains Over time we saw that he was not only tracing the letters he was actually recognizing them individually without any movement of his fingers or at least that we could see she says Something was becoming automatic but we dont know what it was Because M was just  years old when she developed alexia it is hard to know just how much better her reading might get with hard work but its a long road Two years after her strokes M can decipher about one word every two seconds But shes not letting it slow her down too much She has a new job working at the community gym and she wants to tell her story In her free time M is writing a book typing it wordbyword and getting friends to help her read it
