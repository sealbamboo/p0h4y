Northern Irelands health minister has said he will not implement cuts that would destroy our health service Edwin Poots warned patient safety would be compromised by the cuts proposed and said he was not prepared to do it The DUP MLA said his department faced a m shortfall and he blamed Sinn Fin for not agreeing a welfare reform deal Sinn Fin accused the DUP of supporting Tory cuts and said health had been protected while other NI departments were facing cuts to their budgets Finance Minister Simon Hamilton also warned that further cuts amounting to m would be required if a deal on welfare reform was not agreed Speaking on BBC Radio Ulsters Nolan Show on Thursday Mr Poots said that if the Northern Ireland Executive would not agree to allocate more money to health then they would have to find another minister to introduce the cuts Mr Poots said I am not going to impose cuts which will have such a negative consequence that it will damage the health of the Northern Ireland population Were talking here about cancer services were talking here about cardiac services were talking about care of the elderly were talking about emergency departments were talking about outofhours doctors Edwin Poots wanted m extra for his health department but got just m in a new budget revealed earlier this month He said the planned cuts would be devastating and warned that patients would suffer as a result through longer waiting lists and fewer nurses Mr Poots said he is not prepared to implement the cuts himself and that being sacked by the Executive and his party leader First Minister Peter Robinson was an option but added I hope that it wont come to that He said he believed the DUP supported him When the Finance Minister Simon Hamilton revealed Stormonts departmental budgets he also criticised the way the health budget was being run by Mr Poots who is his party colleague The health minister overspent by m last year The union Unison which represents many NHS staff in Northern Ireland has said it hopes Thursdays developments are not part of an internal DUP power struggle Mr Poots said patient waiting lists would rise and nurses would be run off their feet The minister has warned the Northern Ireland Executive that he cannot deliver m of savings The consequence is they find someone else to do it or they do it themselves or they find the money he said Mr Poots added that he was not refusing outright to make savings to the health budget but said he was not prepared to implement cuts that he believed would put patient safety at risk I will make cuts but there are certain services that I will not make cuts on and the consequence of that is we will break the budget by tens of millions of pounds unless more money is allocated to health he added He said he needed at least m in funding from the Northern Ireland Executive in order to ensure that patients safety would not be compromised Mr Poots criticised Sinn Fins stance on welfare reform and said Stormont should prioritise the funding of lifesaving patient services over welfare However Sinn Fin MLA Mickey Brady said The Tory cuts of billions of pounds for essential services have caused the crisis in the health service and reduced budgets right across departments The DUP has supported these Tory cuts which have been about stripping out the National Health Service The current crisis has nothing at all to do with the issue of welfare cuts which Sinn Fin successfully resisted during the monitoring round Otherwise departments would have faced an additional m of cuts The health budget was protected and an additional m was allocated to health  Mr Brady added Mr Poots also suggested today on air that maybe he is not the man for the health job If this is so then he and his party leader should immediately consider his future
