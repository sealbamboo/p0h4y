The race is on to get the federal insurance website HealthCaregov working smoothly by the end of November And its not just because thats what federal officials have promised December could see a surge in demand for health insurance There is an avalanche coming says Bryce Williams managing director for exchange solutions at the benefits consulting firm   Williams says the firm knows from years of experience with open enrollment for Medicare patients that the Monday after Thanksgiving is always the single busiest day for business People will have been thinking about this over the holidays and talking to family members and they are going to feel an impetus to do something on that Monday and there is going to be a huge crush he said Why December Well it finally represents a deadline Originally you had to sign up by Dec  in order to have your insurance coverage begin Jan  Last week the administration extended the deadline to Dec  Robert Laszewski who runs his own health consulting firm   says there are still two big groups that will try to squeeze through the tight enrollment window One group includes those who have   from their insurance companies and who need insurance that meets the health laws new requirements The other group includes people who have been shut out of coverage until now because of   and who have been waiting for HealthCaregov to get its act together Weve got all these people that have been sitting desperately next to their computers trying to get enrolled in guaranteedissue health insurance that has subsidies for the first time in American history said Laszewski And theyre looking forward to coverage on Jan  The administration says its ready  or will be by its selfimposed   The website should be able to handle  users at the same time by the end of this month HealthCaregov repair czar Jeffrey Zients told reporters in a conference call Friday That would double its current capacity But he said the administration isnt depending on the website alone to handle the traffic surged expected in December Were also beefing up additional paths for enrollment  through the call centers inperson assistance and  direct enrollment with issuers he said When Zients talked about direct enrollment he meant allowing individual insurance companies as well as large Webbased brokers to sign up people so they dont even have to visit the federal website Right now that can happen for people who arent eligible for government subsidies to help them afford coverage But subsidy calculations still have to run through HealthCaregov That frustrates people like Towers Watsons Williams His company is one of five major Web brokers that was supposed to be helping enroll people but it hasnt been able to sign up those eligible for subsidies because the technology to help their websites connect to the federal website is not yet working Its a little like trying to sell someone something without actually showing them the price tag he says Consumers are going to be skeptical until they have the information to be able to understand what is my true net cost Gary Lauer CEO of online insurance giant   is also frustrated at his companys inability to sign up people who are eligible for subsidies We have an agreement with the federal government in the  states where theyre operating an exchange to be able to do that but frankly the technologys not working he said Lauer says fully online companies like his are crucial for getting young people enrolled when the federal site cant accommodate them And getting enough young healthy people to offset the older sicker ones is critical to the success of the entire enterprise Young people have grown up in front of monitors and keyboards and now they communicate through their hands  through smartphone devices through tablets he says They dont want to go to a call center theyre not going to fill out paper applications like its  They want to do this online at  in the morning
