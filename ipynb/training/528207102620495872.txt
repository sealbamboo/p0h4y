Raising vitamin D levels may help control flareups in people with asthma Israeli researchers studied  people whose vitamin D blood levels had been recorded They found no association of low vitamin D with an initial diagnosis of asthma But inadequate levels were significantly associated with the number and severity of attacks in the  people in the group who had had asthma diagnosed Even after controlling for sex age ethnicity smoking and other factors the researchers found that the lower the vitamin D level the greater the incidence of recurrent asthma attacks  Worsening of asthma was indicated by the number of prescriptions for asthma medicine filled and the number of physician visits The researchers found that during the year before their first vitamin D test  percent of people with readings between  and  nanograms per milliliter had at least one flareup But only  percent of those with readings of  to  and  percent of those with readings above  a level generally considered adequate did   I think that if a patient has had good treatment for asthma and is still not controlled maybe he should be checked for his vitamin D levels before adding on more medications said the lead author Dr Ronit ConfinoCohen a senior lecturer at Meir Medical Center in Kfar Saba Israel Maybe supplementation would do the job
