The alternative-medicine guru is among a number of people who are turning to a mind-and-body approach to weight loss. It won't work, he said, to simply count calories and go to the gym. The body, the mind and the heart all must be healthful.. In his new book -- the jacket says it's his 75thbut who's counting?-- he writes: "Because everything is connected, something like getting a good night's sleep was part of my new way of eating." He says he also adopted "awareness eating," meaning no cellphones and instead attention to and enjoyment of the meal.. Chopra writes about some of the many triggers that get people to eat when their bodies are not hungry for food: stress, anger, sadness and others. "Dieters keep doing more of what never worked in the first place," he writes.
