Ebola headlines this past week make the hair stand up on the back of your neck Ebola Epidemic In West Africa Out Of Control  CNN   Monday Doctors Arent Sure How To Stop Africas Deadliest Ebola Outbreak Shots   And its true The outbreak in West Africa is the largest in history Nearly  people have caught the   in Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone The death toll so far is  the World Health Organization   Tuesday So should Europe and the US begin worrying about the virus The chance of Ebola spreading out of West Africa is very very low says infectious disease specialist   with St Michaels Hospital in Toronto But if it did spread Paris is probably the first city on the list Paris Why single out that city To answer that lets back up a bit Khan and his team have spent years figuring out how viruses and bacteria move around the globe We look at many outbreaks and decide what paths theyre going take he tells Shots The big question is whether sick people are going to get on a plane and spread the disease That answer he has found depends largely on two factors How many people are infected and the degree of travel from the outbreak area Take   for example the respiratory virus that can spread through water droplets when a person coughs or sneezes When SARS first appeared in  it was isolated to rural China So it spread slowly After about four months a doctor brought SARS to Hong Kong The outbreak quickly worsened The airport in Hong Kong is a major major international hub Khan says You could see SARS start spreading rapidly around the world from there The virus jumped from Hong Kong to Vietnam and Thailand It crossed the Pacific Ocean to Canada and the US Eventually it reached several countries in Europe More than  people caught the virus But critical differences between SARS and Ebola make the Ebola virus much less threatening Khan says The major city affected by the Ebola outbreak is   Guinea home to about a million people and an   But its not a central hub like Hong Kong International Airport or Chicago OHare The volume of travel in the Conakry airport is low Khan says Most of the flights are local But  percent of the traffic goes to Paris That would make Paris the likeliest place for Ebola to arrive And it is a possibility After a person is infected with Ebola symptoms could appear within two days  or take up to  days Khan says So a person infected in Guinea could hop on a plane and bring Ebola to say France or another international destination Even if that happens the odds of fellow passengers catching the virus are extremely low says   who specializes in aviation medicine at Lahey Medical Center in Peabody Mass Several cases support this claim In  a Gabon man with clear symptoms of Ebola boarded a plane to Johannesburg to seek medical treatment He had a fever above  degrees Fahrenheit and signs of internal bleeding The man eventually made it to a hospital in South Africa He did not infect anyone during his flight or other travels the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control   Why Unlike SARS Ebola doesnt pass easily from person to person Transmission requires very close contact with bodily fluids like blood or mucus Gendreau says You need prolonged contact with somebody Theres another case that argues against Ebola spreading because of airline travel In  a businessman visiting Sierra Leone flew to London and then the US He had a fever diarrhea and back pain When he reached his hometown in New Jersey he went straight to a hospital The diagnosis was Lassa fever  another hemorrhagic virus that like Ebola is transmitted through bodily contact The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracked down  people who had close contact with the man during his travels including  passengers on the flight from London to Newark The CDC   that none of them caught the virus
