Last January Salma Jaffar was shot while she was going door to door in Karachi giving children drops of the polio vaccine Even when they took out the pistol I couldnt understand why he was taking out the gun Jaffar says of the two men who pulled up on a motorcycle and started shooting at the vaccination team But when he opened fire that is when I thought it was the end of the life she says My first thought was that I wont be able to see my children again Jaffar was shot four times twice in her arm and twice in her chest She spent the next three weeks in an intensive care unit Three of her colleagues werent as fortunate and died in the attack They are among the more than  polio workers who have been   since the Pakistani Taliban banned polio immunization in  Today the militant group continues to threaten to kill not only vaccinators but also parents who get their children immunized That threat has had a chilling effect on antipolio efforts nationwide And it completely halted vaccination drives in some Talibancontrolled areas Its in these places that the crippling virus has come    and threatened to stymie global efforts to wipe out polio The worldwide campaign to eradicate polio has been going on for more than two decades It has   more than  billion Now the success of the campaign hinges on whether Pakistan can control the virus At its peak in the s polio paralyzed about  people a year around the world This year so far there have been only  cases   Ninetynine of them have been in Pakistan And the South Asian nation is the only country in the world where the number of polio cases is rising significantly The edict by the Islamic militants to ban immunization was in response to the CIAs setting up a fake hepatitis vaccination campaign in Pakistan The covert operation was part of an attempt by the US spy agency to verify whether Osama bin Laden was holed up in the city of Abbottabad The polio problem in Pakistan right now is a result of the CIAs actions in the country says   a prominent and moderate cleric in Pakistan He personally accepts the polio vaccine He encourages people at his mosque to get their kids vaccinated But there are certain areas in Pakistan where the people resist the polio vaccine because the CIA used the polio campaign for intelligence purposes he says Like many Pakistanis Ur Rehman erroneously says the CIA operation against bin Laden used a polio campaign for cover even though it actually used a fake hepatitis B campaign The one who can use hepatitis for intelligence he says they can use polio for intelligence And the CIAs actions were an insult to Pakistan he says As a result more children are now being paralyzed by polio in Pakistan than anywhere else in the world Before the Taliban prohibited polio vaccinations the country was on the verge of eliminating the disease In  it notched only  cases The whole thing just then got reversed when vaccinators started to be targeted and killed says   who leads the World Health Organizations polio operations in Pakistan The Pakistani government is doing what it can to keep the outbreak from spilling out of the Talibancontrolled area and into the rest of the country Durry says  The Health Ministry runs mass immunization campaigns that involve about  vaccinators trying to reach millions of kids There are polio roadblocks on major highways where vaccinators immunize kids passing through in cars and trucks Vaccinators also ply bus stations railway stops and even airports immunizing any child that appears to be under age  But all this hasnt been enough to wipe out the disease As long as the Taliban blocks vaccinations in the territory it controls Durry says the virus cant be defeated either in Pakistan or the world The immunization ban is in the North and South Waziristan districts along the Afghanistan border Officials think about  kids there are missing their vaccinations In the regions under government control the country is doing all the right things to curb the polio outbreak Durry says But to win the war he warns we have to be able to access children who are currently not available for vaccination And theres no indication when the armed conflict between the Taliban and the government will subside  or when the Taliban will allow vaccinators to reach all the children of Pakistan
