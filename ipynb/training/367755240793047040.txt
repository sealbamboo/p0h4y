Researchers say a cheap generic pill called finasteride prevents almost  percent of lowgrade prostate cancers without increasing the risk of dying from more aggressive tumors New   points to the drug as a potentially safer way to deal with prostate cancers that now get   Many prostate cancers that arent destined to cause men serious health problems are often treated with surgery or radiation The safety of   sold as a prostate cancer prevention pill has been a bone of contention for the past decade after the  million federally sponsored   showed that the drug substantially lowered the overall risk of prostate cancer But there was a big hitch It was immediately apparent that the main reduction was in the lowergrade cancers and there was a slight increase of the highergrade cancers says Dr   of the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in San Antonio who led the project The more serious or highgrade prostate cancers have a socalled   of  and up They grow faster and are more lethal Doctors have debated for years whether finasteride caused highgrade cancers or somehow just made them more likely to be detected Finasteride was sold by Merck under the brandname Proscar for treatment of enlarged prostates and Propecia for baldness Whatever the reason the  finding prevented finasteride and its cousin   from being marketed as prostate cancer prevention pills Both are approved to treat the urinary symptoms of benign prostate enlargement although the drugs can cause sexual side effects They work by blocking the conversion of testosterone into a form that is active in the prostate gland In  the Food and Drug Administration   men taking these drugs about the increased risk of aggressive tumors The   published in this weeks   updates the fates of the nearly  men who enrolled in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Researchers drew on an additional seven years of experience since the study stopped in  Study authors say finasteride which costs about  cents a pill has turned out to be even better at preventing prostate cancer than they originally thought Initially the men who took finasteride had a  percent lower risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis The new analysis shows a  percent overall reduced risk  and an impressive  percent lower risk of getting a lowgrade prostate cancer A  percent reduction is  to  fewer cancers per year if everyone took it Thompson says Like the earlier study the new one also found men who took finasteride had a somewhat higher risk of highgrade cancers   percent higher But importantly the update finds no evidence that men who took finasteride were more likely to die of prostate cancer In fact  years after men began enrolling in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial those who took finasteride and those who got a placebo had exactly the same survival rate Even if there is a higher risk of highgrade cancer it doesnt appear to have an impact on how long a man lives and thats reassuring Thompson says Its not clear why finasterideusers who got highergrade cancers didnt die at higher rates Study authors note that men whose highergrade cancers were discovered through PSA screening tests generally have a good prognosis because their malignancies tend to be found at an earlier stage But even if finasteride doesnt make men live longer preventing them from getting diagnosed with lowgrade nonlethal cancers is still a big deal Thats because the vast majority of men who get a diagnosis of prostate cancer of any kind get treated for it  even if it wasnt destined to kill them Many of the men have surgery Thompson says Many of the men have radiation And those treatments have urinary and sexual sideeffects that are actually far more common than people think So eliminating all those cases would be a profound public health benefit Thompson says the results should revive the idea of finasteride as a prostate cancer prevention pill  chief of urology at the University of Miami agrees Parekh says that many doctors abandoned the notion that finasteride and dutasteride could prevent prostate cancer after the FDA warning in  That was a major major deterrent to use these medications for prostate cancer prevention Parekh tells Shots Now with the most recent results I think this should reopen the doors for a lot of us who believe we can use preventive agents for prostate cancer He thinks the findings could also rejuvenate enthusiasm for the use of PSA to screen men for prostate cancer The big rap on PSA screening is that it reveals many lowgrade cancers that really dont need to be treated But finasteride prevents many of those And because it shrinks the prostate the drug increases doctors ability to find cancers worth worrying about either through   or biopsies That has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about prostate cancer Parekh says But not all are so enthusiastic   of the University of Missouri one of the leaders of the   acknowledges in   accompanying the study that men may make a rational decision to take finasteride to reduce the harm of PSA screening Of course another way to reduce the harm of screening is to choose not to be screened
