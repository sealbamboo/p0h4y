Abnormal lipid levels are associated with an increased risk for recurrence of prostate cancer researchers report There is no evidence for an association of lipid levels with prostate cancer but there is some mixed evidence for their link to aggressive cancers and to the recurrence of cancer The study examined the impact of lipid levels on the risk for recurrence in  men who were not using statins before the surgical removal of their cancerous prostate glands The study   followed the men for an average of about five years after surgery during which  men had a recurrence Total cholesterol   bad cholesterol and   good cholesterol were not associated with recurrence in people with normal cholesterol levels But for each  milligrams per deciliter increase in total cholesterol above  milligrams per deciliter there was a  percent increased risk of recurrence Compared with people with normal triglycerides those with levels above  milligrams per deciliter had a  percent increased risk of recurrence Our findings suggest that controlling abnormal lipid levels might be important not only for cardiovascular disease prevention but also for prostate cancer progression said the lead author Emma H Allott a postdoctoral associate at Duke Normalization or even partial normalization of abnormal serum lipid levels may reduce the risk of prostate cancer recurrence
