We know that you can be fat while still fit but how about skinny and unhealthy This may be the case for many AsianAmericans who look slim but actually face a higher risk of diabetes than people belonging to other ethnic groups As a result AsianAmericans should consider getting tested for diabetes at a lower   than previously recommended according to new guidelines published Tuesday by the American Diabetes Association The old guidelines didnt take race and ethnicity into account suggesting all adults with a body mass index or BMI of  considered overweight be tested for diabetes The new guidelines lower the bar for AsianAmericans saying testing should begin at  Weve never differentiated based on ethnicity because frankly in the past we havent done a good job evaluating different ethnicities says   senior vice president of medical and community affairs at the ADA and one of the authors of the statement We used to think that one size fits all but now we know that thats not true AsianAmericans the fastestgrowing racial or ethnic group in the US are  percent more likely to have   than their nonHispanic white counterparts Even AsianAmericans who arent considered overweight by standard measures a BMI of  to  are still at risk for diabetes AsianAmericans with a BMI of   might have a similar risk as someone who is not AsianAmerican with a BMI around  says   chief scientific officer at the Joslin Diabetes Center who was not a part of the study This is partially because BMI isnt a perfect predictor of diabetes risk The index compares height and weight but   can be more relevant AsianAmericans typically gain their fat around the waist rather than the thighs or other parts of the body And abdominal fat is a known risk factor for diabetes The ADAs recommendations come from a review of five metaanalyses that looked at  studies The studies looked at AsianAmerican populations to consider the effects of an American lifestyle and environment The ADAs Chiang says the new guidelines will help increase early detection of diabetes in AsianAmericans and enable more preventive measures But doctors must beware the trap of treating all AsianAmericans or people of any race or ethnicity the same AsianAmericans are still a very heterogeneous population so each individual needs to be evaluated separately she says A   like this one from the National Institutes of Health is a good place to start figuring diabetes risk Chiang recommends all AsianAmericans calculate their BMI Chiang says AsianAmericans with a BMI around  or  particularly those with a family history of diabetes should ask their doctor about getting tested And dont expect this raceethnicspecific recommendation to be the ADAs last Says Chiang I think this is just the beginning of what we need to do making recommendations for people of different ethnicities
