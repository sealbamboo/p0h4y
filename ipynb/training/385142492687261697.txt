For kids growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area theres a standard introduction to puberty at many schools an educational play called  Its a fictional play and in it character Natalie raps about how quickly her body is growing  and how her classmates call her names I didnt pick how my body would grow and I dont feel normal cause Im not in control In many area schools  is staged starting in the sixth grade but the organization that produces the play Kaiser Permanente Northern California is getting requests to bring the play to audiences as young as those in fifth grade Thats because the changes kids grapple with in the play are beginning earlier than a generation ago Researchers are debating the possible links to environmental chemicals stress and obesity But regardless of cause more and more kids are already well into puberty by the time sex education begins in school While scientists try to find whats causing early puberty schools are left to deal with what looks like a new normal And in the meantime kids are left wondering if they   normal Rachael is  now but one morning when she was  she woke up and noticed something different about herself I actually honestly dont really remember this but what my mom told me is that I woke up and I was like Hey Mom what are these like things on my chest I dont know what theyre doing there And she had to explain it to me When Rachael started puberty she was still playing dress up Fairy princess clothes tend to be kind of not wellmade and revealing and stuff like that so I was playing dress up even though Id already started developing she says So there are some pictures of me in dressup clothes that are revealing or too tight in some areas Rachael stood out at school too Some of my friends had parents who they werent as comfortable talking about this kind of stuff I was the person who answered a lot of other peoples questions Rachael says  a weird position for a kid Some girls show signs of puberty even younger than Rachael did  like Jaidyn who was  when she got underarm hair and started wearing deodorant and about  when I started wearing a bra she says But by fourth grade Jaidyn still hadnt received any puberty education at school  which left the conversation to her mom Marella Honestly it made me feel a little uncomfortable but I did my best Marella says I just brought her home some bras and I said Here And she put them on You know I made it as easy for her as possible But handling these conversations isnt easy for parents or kids Thats partly why schools offer puberty education  to help keep kids from freaking out as their bodies change Anne Peacock who teaches puberty education at Redwood Heights Elementary in Oakland Calif recommends that every fifthgrade girl carry a personal pouch containing pads and a fresh pair of underwear since periods can start at any time for girls this age My personal view is that we should do some form of sexuality education from kindergarten onwards and that they are made to feel comfortable she says Dr Louise Greenspan a pediatric endocrinologist with Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco who is studying the causes and effects of early puberty agrees I really feel like Im on a mission now to make sure that people understand that teaching kids about puberty in fifth grade is way too late she says To be clear Greenspan is   saying little kids should be learning about sex in school Instead she says they should get the message that being physically mature doesnt mean theyre ready for adult relationships Greenspan also notes that kids who start puberty early dont necessarily have a medical problem But is it a disorder as in theres something wrong with our environment or theres something wrong with whats happening in the world Maybe she says Somethings changed So the   dont have a disorder  but maybe our world does Last spring on the playground at San Franciscos Flynn Elementary fifthgrade students Mila and Isabel talked about the puberty class they were about to start I feel like its important to learn but its sort of like an awkward lesson Isabel says So why dont kids want to talk to their parents about periods and the other changes theyre experiencing Its just one of those kinds of things you dont want to talk to your mom about Mila says Its like boyfriends You dont want to talk to your mom about your boyfriend Because then they might be like Oh my God youre growing up  Isabel adds But kids   growing up  often way before they even hear the word puberty in class
