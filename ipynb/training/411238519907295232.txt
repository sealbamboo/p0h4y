Dialysis is difficult for people of any age but especially for frail older adults with multiple chronic conditions such as diabetes heart disease and dementia  the patients least likely to have their lives extended significantly by this treatment Is dialysis worth its drawbacks if an elderly patient is increasingly ill and near the end of life Thats a personal decision but it helps to understand how the therapy can affect patients and caregivers   A patient receiving hemodialysis by far the most common form of this therapy sits at a clinic in a chair for three to four hours as her blood passes through a machine that eliminates waste products Treatment is usually needed three times a week and it can be exhausting and debilitating  As seniors on dialysis endure extended periods of inactivity they experience a slow steady decline of their mobility and vitality said Dr Bjorg Thorsteinsdottir an internist at the Mayo Clinic who studies dialysis outcomes in older adults   Several studies have documented the magnitude of this decline In  researchers at Stanford University and the University of California San Francisco studied more than  elderly nursing home residents who were undergoing dialysis and found that  percent had   Within a year elevated disability rates affected  percent The initiation of dialysis is associated with a substantial and sustained decline in functional status researchers concluded This isnt just a phenomenon in nursing homes  Another report published in  found that nearly onethird of  patients age  and older who were living at home mostly independently   using the toilet bathing dressing eating moving around within six months of starting dialysis and had to rely on a caregiver or transfer to a nursing home Dr Thorsteinsdottir recently presented results from a study of   at the Mayo Clinic A notable finding Only  percent of patients who had lived independently   in the hospital Others died or were discharged to nursing facilities  The results are of concern because many doctors are initiating dialysis earlier in the course of kidney disease in the belief this may improve outcomes said Dr Ann OHare a nephrologist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Washington But research data   and it may contribute to difficulties for patients Older adults on dialysis often   blood clots and infections are hospitalized more often than those who dont pursue this therapy and die more frequently in the hospital than at home About half report being in pain and  percent have symptoms of depression  percent to  percent of those age  and older eventually choose to discontinue treatment   Part of the problem is that doctors frequently dont discuss drawbacks with older patients or their caregivers Typically weve been paternalistic and weve tended to make decisions based on our own sense of when a patient needs dialysis Dr OHare said What weve not been very good about is involving patients or families in that decision  Of course the potential for dialysis to extend life is the strongest argument in its favor  While the scientific evidence isnt definitive  and yearolds on dialysis   than they would without it   Some people do well even when the cards appear stacked against them Mitch Nimons yearold father Melvin Nimon landed in the hospital twice this year  first with a lifethreatening esophageal bleed and then with dehydration  A survivor of gallbladder cancer with shortterm memory problems doctors suspect dementia a history of diabetes and alarmingly low kidney function the elder Mr Nimon began dialysis after his second hospitalization It seemed to me the more seasoned specialists just thought it was a waste of time said Mitch Nimon  who cares for his father at home in Woodinville Wash  But after agonizing over the decision the family elected to give hemodialysis a try Doctors were wrong Its made a huge difference said Mr Nimon who said his father had regained considerable good health Mr Nimon now wants to shift his father to peritoneal dialysis which can be administered at home    What is the best way to inform older adults and their caregivers about the likely outcome of dialysis  Researchers at Baystate Medical Center in Massachusetts and the University of New Mexico recently   over the next three years   Researchers will select older patients on dialysis at the highest risk of dying over the next six months explain their prognosis and examine whether this influences their choice to continue dialysis complete advance directives or seek hospice services     Its a first step to figuring out how we should communicate prognosis said Dr Mark Unruh chief of renal division at the University of New Mexico and a participant in the project
