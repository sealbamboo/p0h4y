In the late th century German scientists discovered that an easytomake acid could rather neatly peel off a layer of skin cells They promptly marketed  it for   Today that compound trichloroacetic acid or TCA is widely used by dermatologists both to brighten up aging faces and to remove damaged skin cells including precancerous ones More than   from dermatologists in  according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons The procedures can be performed with a variety of acids but TCA is especially popular because it can reduce sun damage pigment spots and acne scars TCA is so popular in fact that it is sold in doityourself formulas at pharmacy chains like Walgreens and online retailers like Amazon  But a growing number of studies mostly in laboratory animals have suggested that TCA has troubling more destructive effects Recently the International Agency on Cancer Research   and in July the state of California followed suit announcing   Researchers have been taking a hard look at TCAs safety both for patients and practitioners When theres evidence of carcinogenicity in animals we assume it has the potential to cause harm in humans said Martha Sandy chief of the Reproductive and Hazard Assessment Branch of the California Environmental Protection Agency Even if the evidence is uncertain she said it is important that both consumers and businesses be told of potential risks One of the purposes of putting a compound on the list is to make the public aware of the current state of scientific knowledge Dr Sandy said You dont have to get a chemical peel to be exposed to TCA It is used as an antiseptic a soil sterilizing agent and a reagent in pharmaceutical manufacturing it turns up in drinking water as a byproduct of chlorination and as a metabolite of some industrial solvents and some medications like chloral hydrate a common sedative Research with animals shows that it can be absorbed both in drinking water or through dermal exposure seeping through the skin into the bloodstream Concern about the acid has been growing since the s when early studies began linking it to cancers in animals The California EPA first   but decided the evidence wasnt strong enough to say more  But  scrutiny intensified after a  review by the federal Environmental Protection Agency which cited   one research group called it a complete carcinogen  Although the bulk of the TCA studies involve animals a few human studies also hint at harm A report published this summer in the journal Environmental Science and Pollution Research found evidence of   But such research is rare The federal EPAs analysis emphasized   No human epidemiology or occupational studies of TCA were located  Case reports and accounts of the medical use of TCA for skin treatments demonstrate its potential for skin corrosion and eye irritation  However no information on systemic toxicity following dermal exposure of humans to TCA was identified  So do chemical peels with TCA raise your risk of cancer The short answer is nobody knows said Dr Michael Hadley an associate professor of dermatology at the University of Utah and a coauthor of a chapter on TCA in the Color Atlas of Chemical Peels I can tell you that the link is not proven or shown in any human studies But thats partly because we havent done the long term research that would give us all the answers  Dr William Coleman the editor in chief of the journal Dermatologic Surgery points out that the cancer findings derive from long term exposures in laboratory animals A person receiving a chemical peel on the other hand is exposed to TCA for only a few minutes before the acid is washed off  Further TCA causes a mild coagulation of skin proteins which he said should reduce absorption of the acid into the bloodstream  I continue to use TCA without hesitation he said Even public health advocates admit that its difficult to assess the risk Cancer is complicated exposures are complicated and its ethically difficult to do the kinds of human studies that might tell us what we really want to know said Caroline Cox research director of the Center for Environmental Health an advocacy group in Oakland Calif In the universe of chemical compounds used in commerce there are so few that have been thoroughly tested The greatest concern may be for those who are exposed on a regular basis including practitioners who regularly apply peeling agents and consumers using overthecounter products a bit too enthusiastically   Both Dr Coleman and Dr Hadley noted that TCA sales are poorly regulated and that it is far too easy to purchase it without fully understanding the risks Aside from the toxicity concerns this is a powerful acid and if applied incorrectly it can burn skin severely enough to cause permanent damage Meanwhile were paying attention to the studies that raise concern with long toxicity Dr Hadley said The California EPA plans further analyses during the next year as the agency determines whether warning labels should be required on products containing the acid In the meantime Dr Hadley adds I think theres a certain amount of care that should be used  TCA isnt the only option for those seeking rejuvenated skin there are milder peeling agents such as glycolic acid as well as dermabrasion and laser resurfacing treatments Consult with a clinician before making a choice Dr Cox noted that the reevaluation of TCA by California in particular could bring new and safer products to the market Its often an incentive to innovate she said
