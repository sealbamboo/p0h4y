It was extremely disappointing from both the scientific standpoint  but mainly for the sake of the child who is back on medicine and expected to stay on medicine for a very long time Media outlets around the world covered the Mississippi case when it was   in March  CNN updated its story again in October when researchers announced the toddler was   The child was born to a mother who received no prenatal care and was not diagnosed as HIVpositive herself until just before delivery We didnt have the opportunity to treat the mom during the pregnancy as we would like to be able to do to prevent transmission to the baby Gay said last year Doctors administered high doses of three antiretroviral drugs  hours after the girl was born in case she was infected They hoped to control the virus which was not detectable at the time The child remained on antiretroviral drugs for approximately  months Her mother then stopped administering the drugs for an unknown reason A few months later doctors said the  They announced that the girl was the first child to be functionally cured of HIV A functional cure is when the presence of the virus is so small lifelong treatment is not necessary and standard clinical tests cannot detect the virus in the blood   However during a routine doctor visit early this month tests detected HIV antibodies in the now yearold child Her Tcell count was also low indicating a weakened immune system More than two years after being taken off the medication doctors started her again on antiretroviral therapy  She will need to be on these medications for life  or until scientists find a cure for HIV  Certainly this is a disappointing turn of events for this young child the medical staff involved in the childs care and the HIVAIDS research community NIAID Director Dr Anthony Fauci said in a statement Scientifically this development reminds us that we still have much more to learn about the intricacies of HIV infection and where the virus hides in the body Despite the setback researchers are optimistic about using this early treatment method on infants infected with HIV A clinical trial aimed at studying the effect will be amended to include this new information they said before it begins recruiting participants  Weve always known that the search for an HIV cure wasnt going to be easy Franoise BarreSinoussi president of the International AIDS Society said in a statement Cases like this are hugely important for informing researchers on where to focus their efforts Researchers have long known that treating HIVpositive mothers while they are pregnant is important for the health of the child because they pass antibodies on to their babies that can protect them from disease  All HIVpositive moms will pass on those antibodies but only  will transmit the actual virus said Dr Katherine Luzuriaga an immunologist at the University of Massachusetts who worked closely with Gay And HIVpositive mothers who are given appropriate treatment pass on the virus in less than  of cases So all babies are born antibodypositive but only a fraction of babies born to HIVpositive women will actually get the virus and that fraction depends on whether the mom and baby are getting antiviral prophylaxis preventive treatment or not Newborns are considered highrisk if their mothers HIV infections are not under control or if the mothers are found to be HIVpositive when theyre close to delivering Usually these infants would get antiviral drugs at preventive doses for six weeks to prevent infection then start antiretroviral therapy or ART if HIV is diagnosed ART is a combination of at least three drugs used to suppress the virus and stop the progression of the disease But they do not kill the virus  In March doctors announced that another child born with HIV appeared to be free of the virus after receiving similar treatment to the Mississippi baby The case report was presented at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Boston The girl was delivered at Miller Childrens Hospital in Long Beach California last summer to a mother with HIV who had not received antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy Doctors gave the baby high doses of three drugs  AZT TC and Nevirapine  four hours after birth Eleven days later the virus was undetectable in her body and remained undetectable eight months later Taking kids off antiretroviral therapy intentionally is not standard of care said Dr Deborah Persaud at the time a virologist with Johns Hopkins Childrens Center who has been involved in both cases  On Thursday Persaud said the California baby is still on antiretroviral treatment and doing well said Persaud At this time there is no plan to stop treatment
