Pansy Greene says her secret to maintaining a normal life is to keep active Shes almost never without a book of crossword puzzles she reads her Bible daily babysits her grandkids and goes for walks Shes also become passionate about raising awareness of Alzheimers disease So on a recent morning she and Winston were at the Los Angeles office of the Alzheimers Association Theyre on the planning committee for a forum on the early stages of the illness The committee includes both staff members and people who like Pansy are in the early stages of Alzheimers AfricanAmericans are roughly twice as likely to get the disease as whites so Pansy wanted to make sure the organization was reaching out to her community They dont know where to go They dont have the money to get all that testing and stuff she says Thats in our neighborhood Thats what the black people do They cant afford testing so they just say I cant do it  Winston adds that this may not be just an AfricanAmerican problem Its probably in other ethnic groups also Were just so close to it and see so many in our extended family There are moments when this meeting feels as much like a support group as a planning committee Pansy slides seamlessly from discussions of how to persuade Alzheimers patients around Los Angeles to come to the forum to how to get her own relatives who have the disease to follow her example and take action I gotta reach out more she says Theyre not listening She says they need to know what shes done to keep herself active and take charge of her life Im not letting this other thing take control Im in control Everyone in the room laughs in appreciation of Pansys fierce determination But across the table from Pansy and Winston is living proof of how little control of this disease there is Jonathan Blumberg another member of the committee who has Alzheimers wants to offer his own suggestions on outreach but the words dont come There are long pauses between phrases lots of ums and ahs He apologizes Everyone tells him to just take his time and waits patiently while he completes his thought Thats the thing about Alzheimers Theres nothing that really stops its relentless progression And if youre with a group of fellow sufferers someone will be further down that path Winston sees this at the support groups he attends It gets to him There is still fear he says Not so much denial but fear  Youre with people that are that much advanced and youre thinking oh my gosh this could be our journey Winston and Pansy Greene have been on a journey together for  years She was  when they married he was  They have three daughters seven grandchildren and two greatgrandchildren most of whom live nearby Pansy may be having trouble with shortterm memory but she and Winston have plenty of longterm memories to share  of family and travel and decades when they both worked in the aerospace industry I think its a blessing for me being where I was says Pansy While she was working on the space shuttle she met astronauts and even Queen Elizabeth I got all those wonderful memories God brings those things to me she says So thats why I stay positive I dont like being negative And she thinks Winston is  just a little bit A few months earlier he said he didnt look ahead It would make him crazy Now he says hes gotta be realistic I cant be unrealistic about where this journey goes because theres no cure Winston says How could I be unrealistic to think that tomorrow things are going to change and shes gonna be back like she was before the diagnosis That would be really unrealistic Thats just the way Winston is Pansy says But  Im not giving into it Hes thinking that way Im thinking positive and thats who I am The Greenes have spent  years accepting each other for who they are They have no plans to stop now
