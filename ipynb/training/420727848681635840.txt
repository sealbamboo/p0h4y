Why is winter the commoncold season Its a common perception that when the weather gets colder we tend to get sick more This is why we bundle up in warm clothes before facing the elements We want to protect ourselves against frigid weather because we dont want to catch colds According to SegalMaurer it isnt actually the cold weather that causes the common cold its what we do when it gets cold out  When the weather turns cold she says we all run indoors where air is recycled and were often in close quarters with other people and viruses We all sneeze on top of each other This is why the cold season is the same  though maybe not as severe  in warmer climates like Los Angeles as it is in colder ones like New York or Chicago Dry and cold conditions are probably more highrisk situations for viruses because of dry mucosa adds SegalMaurer The   she says is what lines your trachea the back of your throat and your sinuses Viruses invade the mucosa and start growing causing your cold  And thats viruses  as in plural The common cold isnt just one type of virus When you say Ive got a cold that could mean you have one of many bugs  There are a variety of different cold viruses says Currie  so it makes sense that there is no one therapy to treat a cold The strength of our own immune system also plays a big part in how susceptible we are to colds and how severe they might be  The extremes are the young babies the older adults those with underlying medical conditions explains SegalMaurer But even those who take lowdose steroids  those people dont make as many antibodies and the cells that are supposed to fight infection are not as well equipped to do that So when they do get a cold its more severe Were all susceptible but what may be a hour cold for me may be a week of illness for somebody else
