The woman was sitting on a gurney in the emergency room and I was facing her typing I had just written about her abdominal pain when she posed a question Id never been asked before May I take a look at what youre writing At the time I was a fourthyear medical resident in Boston In our ER doctors routinely typed visit notes placed orders and checked past records while we were in patients rooms To maintain at least some eye contact we faced our patients with the computer between us But there was no reason why we couldnt be on the same side of the computer screen I sat down next to her and showed her what I was typing She began pointing out changes Shed said that her pain had started three weeks ago not last week Her chart mentioned alcohol abuse in the past she admitted that she was under a lot of stress and had returned to heavy drinking a couple of months ago As we talked her diagnosis  inflammation of the pancreas from alcohol use  became clear and I wondered why Id never shown patients their records before In medical school we learn that medical records exist so that doctors can communicate with other doctors No one told us about the benefits they could bring when shared with patients In fact before the   a federal law enacted in  patients generally had to sue to see their records HIPAA as that mouthful is abbreviated affirmed that patients have a right to their medical information But the process for obtaining records was often so cumbersome that few patients tried to access them In  Tom Delbanco an internist and Jan Walker a nurse and researcher started an   called OpenNotes that let patients read what their primary care providers write about them They hypothesized that giving patients access to notes would allow them to become more engaged in their care Many doctors resisted the idea Wouldnt open medical records inhibit what they wrote about sensitive issues such as substance abuse What if patients misunderstood the notes Would that lead to more lawsuits And what would patients do with all the information anyway After the first year    percent of patients who saw their records reported better understanding of their medical condition and said they were in better control of their health Twothirds reported that they were better at sticking with their prescriptions Ninetynine percent of the patients wanted OpenNotes to continue and no doctor withdrew from the pilot Instead they shared anecdotes like mine When patients see their records theres more trust and more accuracy That day in the Boston ER was a turning point for me Since I started sharing notes with my patients they have made dozens of valuable corrections and changes such as adding medication allergies and telling me when a previous medical problem has been resolved We come up with treatment plans together And when patients leave they receive a copy of my detailed instructions The medical record becomes a collaborative tool   patients not just a record of what we doctors do   patients The OpenNotes experiment has become something of a movement spreading to hospitals health systems and doctors offices across the country The Mayo Clinic Geisinger Health System and Veterans Affairs are among the adopters so far The OpenNotes project has received funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation which also provides financial support to NPR But there are new controversies arising Should patients receiving   obtain full access to therapy records or should there be limits to open records What happens if patients want to share their records on social media Will such crowdsourcing harm the doctorpatient relationship What if patients want to develop their own record and   Are doctors obligated to comply Delbanco tells me that he considers OpenNotes to be like a new medication Just like any new treatment it will come with unexpected side effects In the meantime patients and doctors dont need to wait for the formal OpenNotes program to come to town Patients can ask their doctors directly to look at their records Doctors can try sharing them with patients in real time as I do now Its changed my practice and fundamentally transformed my understanding of whom the medical record ultimately belongs to the patient
