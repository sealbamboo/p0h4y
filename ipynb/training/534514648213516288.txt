More than one in  men have paid for sex according to a major study of British sexual habits The majority of the  who had done so had visited sex tourism hotspots such as Bangkok and Amsterdam The report in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections said paying for sex was linked with other hedonistic and risky behaviours including binge drinking and drug use It said that young professionals rather than lonely older men were paying A team at University College London analysed data from the   Their initial study found couples were having    Now their investigations have turned to the practice of paying for sex Just  of the women aged  surveyed had paid for sex but  of the men said they had at some point in their lives Of the  men surveyed  had paid for sex in the past five years and  in the past year  The men who had paid for sex had on average more than double the number of sexual partners   compared with   Lead researcher Dr Cath Mercer told the BBC I think I was most surprised that it is not paid partners making up most of the total but they are having more partners generally These men tend to be highly sexually active But that comes with a price The men who had paid for sex in the past five years were twice as likely to be diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection STI such as HIV syphilis or gonorrhoea  The most likely age group to have recently paid for sex were those in their late s and early s Other characteristics of those likely to pay for sex included being single having a managerial or professional job and drug use Dr Mercer said the findings broke the stereotype of the lonely older man paying for sex Nearly twothirds of them reported paying for sex abroad with Europe and Asia being major destinations It could be down to opportunistic reasons such as a lads weekend away paidfor sex is available its something they wouldnt necessarily do at home but in that situation it happens but there are other reasons as well said Dr Mercer What we do in the UK wont stop men paying for sex we may push them abroad even more She said sexual health clinics needed to see paying for sex as a warning sign of other risky behaviour for spreading infections such as having multiple partners Sexual health charity FPAs director of health and wellbeing Natika Halil said This study shows that men who have paid for sex are disproportionately affected by STIs and its vital we reinforce prevention over cure sexual health messages  We heard from many men over the years that had paid for sex abroad and returned to Britain in a panic because they didnt know if they had an STI  The best way to avoid this is to keep a supply of condoms with you and if you do have sex make sure you use them If you know you have taken a risk its important to get tested as soon as possible
