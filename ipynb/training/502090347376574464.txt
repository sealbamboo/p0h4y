 Drug maker Hospira Inc. took the unusual step of filing a lawsuit to challenge the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval this week of generic copies of the company's best-selling product, the sedative Precedex.. Hospira is trying to preserve its market exclusivity for Precedex, which accounts for about 11% of the company's $4 billion of annual sales. The drug is approved to sedate intubated patients in an intensive-care setting, as well as non-intubated patients before and during surgeries and other procedures.
