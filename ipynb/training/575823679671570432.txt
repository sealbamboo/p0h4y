Yet   from last year found an average weight loss of nearly  pounds for vegetarians  While evidence shows the health benefits of reducing red meat consumption the recent study highlights the differences between even a fully vegetarian diet and a pescetarian diet Within the sample group there was a  drop in the risk of contracting colorectal cancer if you switch from fully vegetarian to eating fish The authors of the study suggest that omega fatty acids may be the key to such a low risk of cancer in the pescetarian group Nutritionist Lisa Drayer agrees In addition to other dietary factors fish may provide added protection from its high content omega fatty acids This is consistent with previous research that has found omegas have anticancer activity and that they may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer Some questions can be raised though from observing the recent studys participants   a group that typically avoids alcohol and tobacco But despite the caveat Drayer is optimistic While the study is observational and cannot prove a causeeffect relationship it is exciting to think that in addition to regular screenings a diet rich in fish and fiberrich foods may play an important role in reducing the risk of colorectal cancer
