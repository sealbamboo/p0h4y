One out of every  children   a food allergy but the affliction still regularly stumps doctors As Kari Nadeau director of the Stanford Alliance for Food Allergy Research   Terry Gross in April on   researchers still dont understand what flips the switch between a food allergen versus a food nutrient in children While the origins of food allergies remain unclear scientists are learning how to treat them An emerging body of research shows that kids may be able to kick a food allergy by regularly consuming  under doctor supervision  a small amount of the food every day for a set amount of time at a dose that increases over time The idea behind oral immunotherapy is that you can teach an allergic childs immune system to ignore the food protein that pushes it into overdrive Its the same principle that has dictated how people with environmental allergies have been treated for decades  they are given shots with small amounts of the allergen Preliminary experiments involving milk peanuts and other allergenic foods   this strategy works The most common problematic foods among kids with allergies are peanuts  percent milk  percent and shellfish  percent More than a third of kids with food allergies are allergic to more than one food  director of the Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at the Johns Hopkins Childrens Center has conducted some of the studies of milk and other allergens He says that the success of the early trials suggested that the benefits of oral immunotherapy would last Not so according to the first longterm study of children allergic to milk who received the treatment Wood and his colleagues tracked  children whod received oral immunotherapy for milk allergy in two separate studies at Johns Hopkins and Duke University Three to five years after the treatment eight children remained symptomfree long term but  other children were once again experiencing frequent symptoms when they consumed milk Six children had serious allergic reactions and three of them reported having to use injectable epinephrine  or an EpiPen  at least once to deal with a lifethreatening allergic reaction The   appear online in the   At the end of our first study we thought the milk allergy might be completely cured Wood tells The Salt But some kids went back to avoiding milk and then had very severe reactions Three to five years after the treatment Wood says it was hard for most of the kids to keep milk in their diet on a regular basis So we think this lack of continuous exposure is the main underlying factor of why people lose protection to the allergen he says So how long might people have to be exposed to oral immunotherapy before kicking a food allergy Researchers are still figuring that out Wood says I would guess that it ranges from six months to life but that a majority of people could get there with five years of consistent intake Wood says He and his colleagues also want to look at whether kids get more lasting protection if in the initial treatment they receive higher doses of the allergen over a longer period of time But Wood stresses that this is definitely not something any child  or parent  should try at home This treatment is not ready for prime time he notes Kids should only receive oral immunotherapy if theyre enrolled in a research trial approved by the Food and Drug Administration If youre curious about food allergies and oral immunotherapy research check out the   on Dr Kari Nadeaus work in
