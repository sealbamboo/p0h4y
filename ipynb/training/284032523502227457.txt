Its been a mixed year for Alzheimers research Some promising drugs failed to stop or even slow the disease But researchers also found reasons to think that treatments can work if they just start sooner Scientists who study Alzheimers say they arent discouraged by the drug failures I actually think it was a phenomenal year for research says   a brain scientist at Georgetown University Rebeck is optimistic because during the year several very different lines of research all began to suggest a new way of thinking about Alzheimers  that it has to be stopped before it damages the brain Once you start to lose a lot of synapses once you start to lose a lot of neurons your brain cant recover from that Rebeck says And so when we start with people who have symptoms of the disease treating them turns out to be unsuccessful That explanation comes in part from studies that used a new research tool   by the Food and Drug Administration in April The tool is a drug called   thats injected into the bloodstream and travels to amyloid plaques in the brain Those are the plaques associated with Alzheimers The dye also called florbetapir lets researchers detect even tiny plaques using a positron emission tomography or PET scanner In the PET scan you can see whether somebody has amyloid in their brainbefore they show symptoms of the disease I think thats huge Rebeck says Researchers have already used the technique to show that amyloid begins to build up decades before people start having problems with memory or thinking Rebeck says it should also provide a much quicker way to gauge whether a new Alzheimers treatment is working Another advance this year was a   showing that the brain begins to function differently long before symptoms of Alzheimers appear Lori BeasonHeld of the National Institute on Aging presented the study at the Society for Neuroscience meeting She says previous research had found brain changes among people in the early stages of Alzheimers Our study has gone back even further and discovered changes in the brain that occur up to  years before any symptoms occur in individuals who eventually become cognitively impaired says   And the changes probably start even earlier she says That might sound discouraging but Rebeck doesnt see it that way What that says is theres an opportunity theres a window when if we could stop that amyloid from accumulating or start to clear it out of the brain then you could prevent those symptoms from actually ever happening he says Another   this year suggests a way to do that Researchers in Iceland discovered that families with a rare gene mutation are much less likely to get Alzheimers The mutation appears to interrupt a key step in the formation of amyloid In order to form amyloid the brain has to first cut up a larger molecule explains   of Northwestern University That step requires an enzyme called betasecretase or BACE  BACE  is like a pair of molecular scissors and what the mutation does is sort of interfere with the way the molecular scissors can cut It sort of like dulls the blades Vassar says Just a few months ago researchers came up with a drug that does the same thing that the gene mutation does naturally says Rebeck This drug though may have to be administered before amyloid has begun to build up Michael Raffi of the University of California San Diego says the new thinking about amyloid and Alzheimers is a bit like the current approach to cholesterol and heart disease Doctors dont wait until someone has a heart attack before putting them on drug that lowers cholesterol Really the ideal situation is to have checked their cholesterol levels  years prior and seen whether it was elevated which would imply that they have an elevated risk of having the heart attack and starting the medication then Raffi says Its still not clear though whether amyloid is the new cholesterol It took a long time for us to make that connection between cholesterol and heart disease says Rebeck Thats been very successful Its been very helpful in so many peoples lives Were just at earlier stages in studying Alzheimers disease
