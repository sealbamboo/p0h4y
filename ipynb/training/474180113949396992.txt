The care of frail elderly patients has become fragmented because of the drive for hospital doctors to specialise the new boss of NHS England says Simon Stevens suggested he wanted to see a European model of generalists adopted to work alongside specialists He told a conference of health managers that the rise in multiple conditions required greater coordination of care The speech builds on comments he made last week about ensuring there was a role for smaller hospitals in the NHS In recent years there has been a focus on creating larger specialist hospitals But Mr Stevens said that while that was desirable in areas such as stroke care smaller hospitals still had an important role to play Mr Stevens said the large expansion in consultant numbers  up by threequarters since   had led to more and more specialisation by consultants He told the NHS Confederations annual conference that while this was desirable it had sometimes fragmented care for older inpatients He said One study has found that using single conditionspecific guidelines a yearold woman with type  diabetes hypertension respiratory problems osteoarthritis and osteoporosis could be prescribed  doses of conflicting and adversely interacting medicines each day Having general physicians  or hospitalists as they are sometimes known  is commonplace in countries such as Sweden and Germany The call for this model of medicine mirrors one that was made last year by the Royal College of Physicians Mr Stevens also set out other steps he wanted to take These included reform of the funding system for hospitals to take more into account the outcomes they achieve for patients At the moment funding is largely based on throughput of patients But he told the conference in Liverpool that it was important that local areas came up with their own solutions rather than relying on a onesizefitsall approach He said the coming years were a defining moment in the history of the NHS I know there are enormous pressures but the NHS is up for change and necessity truly is the mother of invention Mr Stevens replaced Sir David Nicholson as NHS Englands chief executive in April
