Wearable technology  those wristbands watches and belt gadgets that track your every move  hold tremendous promise for improving health and physical performance But as often happens the technology has outstripped the research and scientists are still struggling to understand whether the monitors work as promised how to keep people motivated to use them and exactly what the devices are supposed to accomplish anyway To measure the accuracy of   worn on the wrist or waistband researchers from Arizona State University conducted two studies with equivocal results The research presented last summer at the annual meeting of the   tested the devices against bulkier hightech masks placed over volunteers faces to measure oxygen consumption These are considered the scientific gold standard for determining energy expenditure if not for providing comfort convenience or style After asking participants to engage in activities like   playing games and housework the researchers found that the trackers were able to record some but not all of the subjects movements The devices reliably tracked forward motion they counted how many steps volunteers took while walking or jogging and accurately determined corresponding energy consumption But the trackers were inept at measuring volunteers more subtle movements such as when they stood played Scrabble gently pedaled a stationary bicycle or used a broom to sweep up around the physiology lab Over all the results suggest that consumer activity monitors do not detect lightintensity activities very well said Glenn Gaesser a professor and the director of the   at Arizona State University who oversaw one of the studies The devices rely on mathematical equations that were developed using activities easy to measure such as brisk walking or jogging he said Of course scientists rarely have access to the latest technology They dole out trackers to volunteers calibrate readings write up findings prepare for publication  and by then the models have been updated and improved The algorithms change so fast that those of us in academia cant keep up said Nate Meckes an assistant professor of applied exercise science at Azusa Pacific University in California who led the other study presented last year He wishes the makers of trackers would release their algorithms and software to scientists for review and factchecking To the best of his knowledge he said none do The Food and Drug Administration does not regulate these devices no outside agency or reviewer vets their accuracy But that seeming shortcoming may not matter to casual users Theres a difference between accuracy and precision said Ray Browning an assistant professor of exercise science at Colorado State University who has been studying activity trackers for several years Todays models may not be especially accurate he said their numbers for energy expenditure would not jibe with those from sophisticated laboratory testing Nonetheless the trackers are precise Tomorrow a device will over or undercalculate a persons movement and energy expenditure to the same extent that it did today A user can rely on these monitors to track patterns and watch how they change over time Dr Browning said But activity trackers cant promise to change behavior The motivation piece is the elephant in the room he said Todays monitors often incorporate motivational components including social networking and friendly electronic reminders from an integrated electronic nagger to get up and move But to date no longterm peerreviewed study has shown that people using activity trackers become and remain more active And people can be complex and perverse fitness consumers Suppose youre having a terrible week at work Dr Browning said Youre tired and overwhelmed It may well be that the last thing youd want is a device telegraphing your sloth to a network of social acquaintances For now the longterm effectiveness of todays trackers for increasing movement and improving health is anyones guess Dr Gaesser said Notably the trackers may be quite beneficial for a group of people who wouldnt seem to need them those who are already active and in particular athletes A   published in February in The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research concluded that the use of GPS and heart rate monitors and similar technology by soccer cricket rugby and hockey players could result in significant improvements in the preparation training and recovery aspects of fieldbased team sports Most of these monitors are unobtrusive integrated into watches or athletic clothing including shoes shirts socks and sports bras although we call them vests for the sake of the guys who occasionally must don them said Lynda Ransdell dean of the College of Education Health and Human Development at Montana State University who oversaw the review Using data from these devices she said coaches and athletes can plot precisely where each player is on the field during successful or feeble plays As attractive as individualized monitoring and coaching may be it is not and likely will not become requisite even for serious recreational athletes Dr Gaesser said As it turns out tech nudies  those of us who dont wear any electronic devices  can gauge our workouts effectively without technology Dr Gaesser has shown that simply asking someone how hard they are exercising produces estimates nearly as accurate as measuring it This lowtech approach isnt sexy Dr Gaesser said but its just as good if not better than relying too heavily on a tracker to guide exercise Thats because humans unlike digital devices are able to detect a unique mix of factors including heart rate oxygen consumption muscular effort and mental fatigue that technology cannot yet measure Yet
