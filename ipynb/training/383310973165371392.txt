Sometimes cancer and its treatments make me feel as if I have entered a time machine that accelerates aging   Several months ago I met a friend for a cup of tea and as we were paying I caught sight of a stooped old lady across from me no eyebrows on a pale face framed by thinning hair A heartbeat later the mirror image administered a shock This crone belies my psychic age that is the age matching what I feel to be my authentic core identity The little old lady looked about  whereas my psychic age hovers at a somewhat rebellious  My companion in the cafe who copes with lung cancer counseled me Important never to look in the mirror Dont get me wrong I have always admired the spunky old ladies who teeter along upper Broadway with the aid of a companion or a walker But they had a chance I hope to ease into their decrepitude gradually whereas I seem to have jolted into mine in the prime of life After three abdominal surgeries and three cycles of chemotherapy a deeply cut gulf separates my little old lady self from the active yearold before diagnosis  Regardless of chronology people in cancer treatment even children often look like we evolved from an antique race descended from Yoda balding shrunken slow moving greenish   My little old lady self cannot bounce out of bed to start the day Pills have to be doled out first Instead of quickly throwing on appropriate clothes for the tasks at hand my little old lady self places a comfortable uniform down on the bed  underwear leggings Tshirt sweater socks and thicksoled shoes  so she can sit down between the exertion of putting on each garment The tasks at hand narrow to maintenance  grocery shopping cooking bills  instead of the teaching and mentoring and traveling of the past  Before cancer I felt the way Oliver Wendell Holmes did Old age is  years older than I am   Now though a humbling acknowledgment permeates the atmosphere of littleoldladyland a realization that I cannot do what I used to do a sense of being feeble or vulnerable physically as well as mentally   I must sit by the stove waiting to turn off a boiling pot or else I will forget and its contents will burn away along with the house My computer passwords have to be reset repeatedly Someone needs to drive me since my toes cramp up making walking or accelerating and breaking perilous   At various times I have needed pharmaceutical products that arrived in large boxes Bandages bags adhesives latex gloves syringes surgical tape gauze pads antibiotics salves mouthwashes drops wipes and painkillers pile up in my closet so guests will not see them in the bathroom   What an    the Yiddish phrase for an old complaining person  I have become There is a difference between getting old and feeling old my yearsolder nonYiddish speaking husband staunchly asserts Desire stands him in good stead  Getting old means knowing you cant stay up late at a party or run a mile he says   means you dont  to stay up late at a party or run a mile Were not in an assisted care unit yet he smiles or visited weekly by home health care nurses You got old before you felt old I respond hugging him I felt old before I got old Wanting to do what he cant do oddly cheers him But as the time machine curiously slows me down while it accelerates my aging I try to savor doing what I didnt do when I was an ambitious middleaged professional  These days I can sit still and listennot advise or judge but listen  to my daughters and stepdaughters Im grateful for the opportunity my grandchildren give me to hang out a different pleasure with the yearold we play electronic games the yearold he reads aloud to me and the baby who grins and gurgles while I hug and sing There is another silver lining even for a psychic adolescent As I become my husbands contemporary we remain soul mates even though or maybe because his psychic age is  So occasionally I still get to boss him around  Or is that notion just one of my teen dreams
