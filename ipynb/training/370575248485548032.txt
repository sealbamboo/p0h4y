Its your doctor my wife said as she handed me the phone Never a good sign your doctor calling on a weekend  I had recently seen him for my routine physical where I had been found to have high blood pressure I tried to explain it away blaming the morning traffic as I dropped off my children at camp drinking a tall cup of coffee and running to my appointment But my wise doctor ignored my attempts to minimize it and had referred me for a stress echo an ultrasound of the heart followed by a run on the treadmill followed by another ultrasound of the heart I had completed the test just two days earlier Your resting echo images  the ones before I exercised  showed wall motion abnormalities in the left circumflex distribution he said You need to see a cardiologist Translation Your heart muscle isnt moving in a region fed by one of the three main blood supplies to the heart Youve had a silent heart attack sometime in the past I sat down in the living room the only sounds being those of the wood clock on the mantelpiece and the distant murmur of my wife and children chattering away in the other room Time passing and family Ill email him and copy you right now to get you in my doctor concluded I thanked him my brain too jolted to generate any clarifying questions A heart attack It was official My dad his father and my greatgrandfather did not bother to pass down to me their good looks but they had managed to secure in their patrilineage coronary artery disease All three had died suddenly of cardiac arrest I was on deck True to my doctors word the email came across my iPhone within the hour And then I waited for a reply to all from the cardiologist And waited And checked my email more times than Im comfortable admitting publicly I revisited past illnesses trying to identify the one concealing a heart attack the upper respiratory tract infection that left me short of breath the chest pain a couple of days after a vigorous upper body workout at the gym  That afternoon I called a friend who is a cardiologist and she kindly reviewed my echo report Its probably just an error  this doesnt make any sense at all Dont worry she said That helped for a few hours until it didnt I later talked to a friend who specializes in cardiac imaging who was much more blunt Youre being an idiot he told me This has to be a bad test Why are you letting this bother you Because the men in my family die from heart attacks And while I can modify my lifestyle to avoid eating gribnitz  fried chicken fat  spread on rye bread like my grandfather and can exercise regularly unlike my father I cant escape their genes A couple of days passed without an email from the cardiologist I called his office and left a message My wife noticed I was distracted Youre not letting this bother you are you she asked I told her I was She reminded me that when one of my patients calls concerned that they have leukemia because of a low platelet count that I always reassure them that the test was probably wrong and that they should get it rechecked Youve had two doctors tell you the same thing Why cant you follow your own advice Because this is emotional not logical The next day I called the cardiologists office again and he scheduled a more detailed ultrasound I underwent the test and saw him the following day Your repeat echo was stonecold normal he told me The first one was probably just a technical error involving where the probe was held He brought up the images on the computer to show me the differences and was very apologetic It happens Medicine is not an exact science and even routine tests have variability  That night back home we had a celebratory dinner butter and cheese be damned The phone rang during the meal and I let it go to voice mail I listened to the message as we cleaned up from a distant cousin  I got some news today from my doctor he said sounding nervous I have prostate cancer and Id love to get some advice on what to do next I called him right back I didnt want him to have to wait to hear from me one second longer than necessary
