One night in  after her mother had fallen in a nursing home in Silver Spring Md Ms McAllister looked at her mothers medical chart and saw that someone had checked the box that said No DNR I said Theres a DNR  Ms McAllister recalled The floor nurse said No there isnt  Ms McAllister got testier There is its in the file Ive seen it there They went to the director of nursing who checked the records  and yes there was the DNR form It wasnt the only time Ms McAllister had to intervene to stop aggressive treatments It was a common occurrence she said Theres a lot of bodies and a lot of files and people coming and going Health care professionals ethicists and advocates continually urge older people to document their preferences about endoflife medical decisions and a growing proportion do A recent large national study tracking more than  people over age  who died between  and  found that the proportion with advance directives   But how much does it matter How often are peoples advance directives ignored or overridden Do they really ensure that the elderly get the care they want or ward off procedures they dont That large national study concluded that having advance directives had little effect on whether people were hospitalized and how often or whether they died in hospitals Yet where someone dies has considerable impact on how I dont want to demean advance directives said Susan Tolle director of the Center for Ethics in Health Care at Oregon Health and Science University They lift an emotional burden from family members Appointing a person to make decisions on your behalf really does have benefits But when it comes to endoflife wishes Dr Tolle said citing   patient preferences arent the dominant factor Its your ZIP code  how aggressively most local physicians practice Though many of us have heard stories about a surgeon who insists a patient wont die on his watch I dont think thats the norm said Charlie Sabatino chairman of the American Bar Associations Commission on Law and Aging What happens more often is that these things arent getting where theyre supposed to be Mr Sabatino said Directives remain in safes or drawers and dont reach hospitals the family doctor has a copy but a new specialist doesnt People with complex medical conditions have a physician for every organ Mr Sabatino pointed out Sometimes he added people fill out forms but never have thoughtful conversations with family members or doctors They choose ineffective proxies Family members disagree about treatments Administrative errors  the wrong box checked on a form  interfere Researchers at the University of California Los Angeles surveyed more than  seniors and found that advance directives   who said they had completed and given them to a health care provider  Calling  can cause particular problems Dr Tolle said Emergency medical personnel want orders she said Nothing else has been shown to be effective That means   the exception to this discouraging picture Oregon which pioneered Polst Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment  years ago in  created an electronic Polst registry giving emergency workers and hospitals roundtheclock online access In   the registrys first two years Dr Tolle and her colleagues found that with Polst you are extremely likely to have your wishes respected she said Of those who specified comfort measures only only  percent died in a hospital Because some terminally ill patients cant be kept comfortable at home that percentage will never be zero Those who specified full treatment to prolong life on the other hand were more apt to die in the hospital  percent than those with no Polst in the registry Alas most of us dont live in Oregon or West Virginia which also has a state registry Although more than  other states have some sort of Polst program theyre not nearly as advanced and may not extend to every region or hospital or ambulance squad What do we do then to maximize the chances that our elders wishes  or our own  prevail Eventually electronic health records may help Meanwhile the best advice I can find is that everyone should have an advance directive discuss his or her decisions with doctors and family members and appoint a strong health care proxy Then that person has to physically shove the appropriate forms under peoples noses at every hospitalization every visit to a new physician every transfer to a nursing facilityÂ  This   can help  It requires you to be persistent and give them the advance directive again every single time Mr Sabatino said Even then things can go wrong In upstate New York a nurse   who did not have a DNR order in effect Florida just fined a nursing home whose staff   directive So when people get more sick and frail and have likely reached their final year or two they need Polst forms And we all have to push our states to put in place full coverage and establish state registries At the end Polst seems our best bet
