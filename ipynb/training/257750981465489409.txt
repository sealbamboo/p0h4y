Its Monday after another football weekend in America From the Friday night drama on high school fields to the multibilliondollar juggernaut NFL the game seems as popular as ever But in fact amid the cheering theres concern  a growing anxiety about head injuries in the sport from the NFL all the way down to the peewee leagues Some say kids shouldnt be playing until their teenage years Highprofile NFL players have gone on record saying they dont want their children playing at all because of the concussion risk In Texas the risk is putting players and parents at odds with a sport many consider a religion For many a Texan the football journey to Friday Night Lights starts on Saturday mornings posing for picture day in the park That was the scene recently in the south Texas town of Angleton Seven and yearold members of the Wildcats flashed grins for local photographer Mike Hattaway who clicked away teasing the boys I think your girlfriends going to like that At this age though the photos are more for grandparents dads or moms like Shani Pickett Her son Jordan plays for the team and shes a boisterous Wildcats booster You can easily hear her cries of Cmon Jordan Cmon baby All right Wildcats across the field in Angleton where a day full of games starts to unfold Saturday morning Jordan is playing his first year of tackle football and carrying on a tradition in Angleton population about  Despite its size Angleton has churned out a handful of NFL players including Hall of Fame defensive back Emmitt Thomas Jordan begged his mom to play sooner than this year but she made him wait And she made him agree to a bargain once he started He plays football on Saturday Sunday morning were in church she says because I told him he needs to be able to give thanks And we make sure we read the scripture We pray over him so that God protects him You just have to go with God and let him play Shani Pickett is plenty handson though She has read a lot about the concussion issue and talked to her son about it I make sure hes aware of everything says Pickett adding You know these are the hazards this is what can happen this is what could happen to you  But then he says its what he wants to do when he gets older so  moms not going to stand in the way But shes vigilant Pickett watches her son closely during games and practices She also made sure she had a proxy on the Wildcats coaching staff I threw his dad out there she says motioning to Jordans dad Roy a member of the Wildcats coaching staff Sitting under a sunblocking canopy in the bleachers Wesley Rolan a parttime medic and his wife Tara zero in on their yearold son Bryce as he limps to the sideline during the Wildcats game Whats wrong with him Tara asks Wesley answers He ended up at the bottom of the pile Bryce was fine and ended up returning to the game Bryce is playing his first year of tackle He loves it His dad calls him an intimidator on the field  all  feet  inches  pounds of him Bryces parents enjoy watching him play but Tara admits she worries I dont think his little body is ready for it ready to take those hits she says and the risk of concussion in younger children is a big factor One of the nations foremost head injury experts agrees Dr Robert Cantu is a neurosurgeon and coauthor with Mark Hyman of the new book   Cantu says children are among the most vulnerable to concussion because of weak necks immature musculature and brains that are still developing He advises that kids not play tackle football until age  and play flag or touch football until then The Rolans are letting Bryce play although his dad says if Bryce suffers just one concussion whether in peewee football or high school thats it  no more tackle Like most kids his age Bryce isnt concerned about the possibility of injury Im the person who  gives the hurting away he says in his tiny intimidator voice Because I dont get hurt The other team does A quarterback calls out the signals The play starts and then ends with the crunch of pads and helmets and a gasp from the crowd Its the kind of hit that brings coaches running onto the field The game at Pearland Stadium is  miles north of Angleton between  and yearolds The weight limit for that division is  pounds and the hits are bigger After the collision that causes the crowd to gasp a player stays down on the ground His coach stands over him flashing fingers and asking How many The player finally gets up and walks off but he seems in pain A sideline official shouts up to the stands that all seems well concussionwise I think his helmet twisted and he hurt his face the official says as the child walks off the field and people in the stands applaud As far as football injuries go better the face than the brain A week earlier though Austin Knox wasnt as lucky Austin plays quarterback and handed off the ball to the backup running back his dad and coach Alan Knox says Austin turned to block a blitzing linebacker and had a little headtohead collision with him A parent at the game whos also a doctor talked to Austin and determined he might have a concussion So we took him to the sideline Knox says took his pads off and decided that he wasnt playing the rest of the day A specialist later confirmed Austin had a mild concussion and told coach Knox to keep his son off the football field for two weeks Knox made it three At a time of growing concussion awareness Knox appears to have made the right moves In the past year he has also reduced contact during practices He instructs his players to signal if they dont feel right  either by tapping their helmet of taking a knee This is a very important part of teaching concussion awareness letting players know its their responsibility to acknowledge a problem Historically that hasnt often happened in football where playing with pain and injury is a sign of toughness a badge of honor Knoxs team of  and yearolds is part of the South Texas Youth Football Association This is the first year that STYFA has had a concussion policy featured on the   Lonzie Helms STYFAs safety coordinator helped write up the policy We didnt want to get caught behind the curve if something comes up he says There are people actually talking about not playing football before high school So we wanted to be proactive as possible Still Helms was worried about a possible drop in participation this year During STYFAs signup period there were many media reports about concussions including the story about the suicide of   There was speculation at the time of his death that it was prompted by brain disease from football head injuries But Helms was amazed to see a  percent increase in football signups We had so many kids so early we thought that maybe one of the other leagues had gone away or something We were getting kids so fast he says adding It turns out the other leagues were doing just as well as we were Helms says he has no idea why the surge happened But there is one possible clue Helms says this year  people are expected at Pearland Stadium to watch the peewee championship game between  and yearolds This is Texas Helms says This is what we do We play football On a football field north of Austin referee Mark Lingard brings together the captains of two middleschool teams about to play All right gentlemen Great night for football he says I love this weather Yall gotta love it too right The kids true to their Southern manners respond Yessir Indeed a beautiful night for football But before the game Lingard who started the Central Texas Youth Football League  years ago acknowledges that the sport he loves may be in trouble Until we can find out for sure and keep kids as safe as possible I have no problem with not being in youth football Lingard says As much as I love the game it may have to disappear some day His pessimism comes from some recent numbers Over the past five years the Central Texas Youth Football League has grown by eight or nine teams each year This year there have been two additional teams Lingard believes concussion worries are a big reason for the slowdown Hows little Jimmy not going to get hurt Thats what parents are concerned about Lingard says How does he answer those concerns Its going to make me sound bad but  I say Im not guaranteeing anything Little Jimmy can get hurt playing football Its the greatest game in the world If he wants to play it and you want to let him play it you have to take those risks USA Football estimates almost  million kids ages  to  play organized tackle football That number essentially has stayed the same since  when the organization started keeping track Many still are taking the risk Lingard talks about They do so knowing every child who plays doesnt get a concussion And every kid who does isnt doomed to brain problems like dementia later in life Still there are those pulling away And they are doing so with Dr Cantus mantra ringing in their ears No head trauma is good head trauma
