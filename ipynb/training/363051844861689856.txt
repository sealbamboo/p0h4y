The patient was an elderly woman admitted to our unit just a few hours earlier with a breathing machine keeping her alive We proceeded with the meeting as we were trained to do We kept our elbows off the table maintained eye contact but not too much and gave the family an update of where we stood  A healthy family meeting wed been told involved us speaking for about half the time with the family speaking for the rest  venting questioning grieving and hoping in no particular order This meeting though was dominated by long periods of silence that unearthed the dull lowpitched drone in the background  The son quiet for most of the meeting broke the silence and with a hint of anger and a big dollop of frustration asked the one question I had dreaded being asked the most Doc give it to me straight If this were your mother what would you do   While the patientdoctor interaction varies widely across cultures and continents this question seems to be a universal constant As a medical student in Pakistan I had heard it often and even after hours of preparation never felt prepared to answer As a wobbly newcomer to clinical medicine it left me feeling vulnerable and violated From a patient or family members perspective though this question helps them make sense of the confusion desolation and powerlessness that so often defines the hospital experience which usually involves a fullon assault of numbers jargon and expert opinion They are confronted with difficult choices like whether they want to go ahead with a particular highrisk procedure or wait for the tincture of time to kick in Overwhelmed and confused it makes sense that they would defer the choice to those who appear to know what they are doing And by invoking the physicians parent they hope to humanize the physician and have a conversation with real stakes  Yet I still find this question hard to answer See my mother is the sort of person who spends two hours each day on the treadmill even during vacations so that she can eat to her hearts content Often described as a fighter any additional moment she can spend with her children or future grandchildren would be worth the extra mile My father on the other hand is someone who avoids getting his blood sugar level tested to evade medications and dreams of spending his last days in the quiet serenity of the village he grew up in Thus my answer to the question would be very different as it would be for anyone depending on which parent you asked me about  So I have come to believe that the right answer to the question If this were your mother doctor is Tell me more about your mother  This response gives patients families the chance to think about their loved ones about what they would value and what they would consider a good life what they would think was worth fighting for if they were available to answer the question for themselves  The burden that family members feel when making medical decisions as proxies is immense whether a loved one has dementia or is so sick or confused that she cant participate meaningfully in decision making But this response often helps to diffuse that It takes them away from a place where they feel solely responsible for the trajectory of their relatives life to one where they simply communicate what the patient would want out of her life We as physicians can then weigh in on whether it is reasonable to expect that to happen So I asked the family sitting across the table from me Tell me more about your mother  And then slowly the family started sharing stories of the woman we had met only a few hours before unconscious and intubated She loved being independent would hate for people to open doors for her or hold her hand as she tried to get up they told us She loved the sun the beach She loved walking loved being out and about She would never ever want to go to a nursing home Never ever They pulled out a picture of her lounging on a chair sipping lemonade  We then told them that based on a combination of her vital signs and lab values as well as our clinical judgment that while we could hope for some progress it would likely not be enough to allow her any real shot at experiencing life outside a nursing facility again  The daughters shared another glance with their brother Their shoulders were now less tense their eyes less teary The room seemed to be filled with memories of a woman who had lived life well They turned to us and asked us to make her comfortable and to turn off the breathing machine
