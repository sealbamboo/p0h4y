Thinking about freezing your eggs to buy yourself a few more babymaking years Not so fast says the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  The doctors organization issued a statement Monday warning healthy women not to use egg freezing to pause their biological clocks We dont want to give patients the impression that this technology can guarantee a successful pregnancy explains Samantha Butts MD assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania who was on the committee that issued the statement  We are not endorsing widespread use of egg freezing for women who want to delay motherhood says Butts explaining that it should only be used for women who are facing cancer or other medical treatments that could destroy their fertility We still need to study it more to determine its safety ethics and costeffectiveness The warning comes in the middle of egg freezings cultural moment Last fall the American Society for Reproductive Medicine welcomed the procedure to the mainstream by removing the experimental label and acknowledging freezing techniques that resulted in similar invitro fertilization success rates as fresh eggs A string of celebrities like   boasted of their recent trips to the freezer More than half of fertility clinics now offer the procedure which costs between  and  and doctors are reporting a surge of inquiries Sarah Wickliffe a yearold graphic designer from New York had broached the topic with her obgyn over the past few years but the doctor poohpoohed the idea saying she was too young But then Wickliffe broke up with her boyfriend of three years and was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome a hormone disorder affecting  percent to  percent of women of childbearing age that can cause infertility Scared that shed have trouble getting pregnant by the time she found love Wickliffe asked her doctor again if she should consider freezing her eggs The doctor referred her to a fertility doctor who last summer prescribed Wickliffe two weeks of hormone shots and surgically retrieved  eggs to be used when she was ready to have children I thought that if I had the chance to put away eggs that are healthy now I should do it explains Wickliffe Id have some insurance no matter what happened in my love live My younger eggs would be waiting for me Since egg freezing became available in the US a decade ago many doctors havent felt comfortable recommending it to women who planned to put off starting a family while they searched for romantic partners or waited for a better time in their careers The issue What if women waited until their mids to use them If their eggs didnt work their natural fertility would be gone and theyd be left emptyhanded Since the science is so new its too early to tell how the option to stash away some fertility for later will affect womens life choices Yet a recent   of nearly  women who had frozen their eggs between  and  at New York University Langone Medical Center that was published in   found that  percent of egg freezing patients viewed egg freezing as a backup plan in case natural pregnancy became impossible  percent regarded it as a backup plan and a way to defer conventional reproduction and only  percent thought about it mainly as a way to put off having children After going through a breakup with her boyfriend of two years just before her th birthday Mimi Clarke a horticulturalist from San Francisco froze  eggs at the Pacific Fertility Center in San Francisco in  But she waited only a year before deciding to use them I tried meeting someone else through online dating or hoping I would meet someone walking the dog or at a party but when that didnt happen I realized I didnt want to wait any longer to be a mom she says I decided I would do it on my own  She also wanted to take advantage of her remaining fertility and underwent three rounds of intrauterine insemination in which doctors injected donor sperm directly into her uterus during ovulation When those failed she decided to thaw her eggs Doctors implanted one resulting embryo and froze the other Clarke is scheduled to deliver a baby girl next month Dr Butts hopes this latest round of warnings against socalled social egg freezing will encourage obgyns to initiate discussions with patients about their family plans from a young age and talk about alternatives to egg freezing such as the more reliable method of freezing embryos with donor sperm or simply trying to get pregnant at a younger age without a partner  In the meantime counselors like Izetta Siegal Stern who organizes support groups sponsored by the American Fertility Association for women considering egg freezing urges obgyns to include egg freezing in those discussions so women can make their own informed decisions I understand that these professional associations would like to see more research data on all aspects of elective egg freezing but this will take years and those maybe will be lost years for women who could benefit from egg freezing now she says Wickliffe hopes she wont need to use her eggs Since she froze her eggs shes in another serious relationship and would like to start her family by her mids The doctors told me it wasnt a sure thing she says I dont want to take the risk that it might not work
