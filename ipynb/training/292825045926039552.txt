 Folks genetically predisposed to   can reduce their odds of piling on the pounds by staying   a new study suggests A large international group of researchers found that the socalled fat mass and obesity associated FTO gene which is known to increase the risk of obesity has a  percent weaker effect on physically active adults compared to inactive ones Their conclusion comes from a metaanalysis of  prior studies analyzing data from more than  participants I think it is important to highlight that you dont have to run a marathon or necessarily join the gym but walking the dog cycling to work taking the stairs    about one hour of activity a day five days a week will have the effect we saw in our study said study author Ruth Loos group leader of the Genetic Aetiology of Obesity Programme at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge England We hope that studies like ours convince people that even when genetically susceptible a   will help in the prevention of weight gain The study is published online Nov  in the journal   Twothirds of Americans are either overweight or obese along with nearly onefifth of children up to age  according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Obesity is known to increase the risk for heart disease diabetes stroke and certain forms of cancer Loos said that prior research by her team on  adults also had shown that physical activity reduced the effect of the FTO gene on obesity risk but subsequent studies hadnt always led to consistent results What did surprise us was that the exercise effect was more pronounced in North Americans than in Europeans she said We speculate that this might be due to the fact the Europeans are generally less obese and more physically active than North Americans and that there is a greater range of BMI body mass index and physical activity in North Americans such that the effect can be larger Some of those predisposed to being overweight may feel theres little point in resisting natures pull Loos noted In fact she added a recent study on the effects of genetic testing showed that people who were informed they had a higherthanaverage genetic susceptibility for obesity   their dietary fat intake over the following three months suggesting that the genetic information might have given them a sense of no control But this fatalism is misplaced she said though more research is necessary to understand the impact of genes and environment on weight Dr Robert Berkowitz senior medical director of the Weight and Eating Disorders Program at the University of Pennsylvania said the American obesity epidemic of the last three decades hasnt resulted from changed genes but changed habits Its good to see that physical activity can really help people despite having the obesity gene Berkowitz added It really is a genesenvironment interaction Most of us are faced with   so were not as active as we used to be even  or  years ago I think it all makes it difficult for a person coping with a weight problem
