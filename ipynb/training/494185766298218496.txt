Experts say the worlds first malaria vaccine could be approved for use in  Reporting in PLOS Medicine researchers found that for every  children who received the vaccine an average of  cases of illness could be prevented And in continuing trials it went on to provide protection some  months after the injections were given Manufacturers GSK have now applied for regulatory approval  making this the first vaccine to reach this step Malaria affects millions of people worldwide and results in  deaths each year  the majority in children under five who live in subSaharan Africa  In the most advanced trial to date involving several African countries  infants and children were given the RTSS vaccine Revisiting them  months after the last injection researchers found  that in young children the vaccine almost halved the number of cases of malaria And for infants who were aged six to  weeks at first vaccination the drug reduced episodes of malaria by a quarter   Though the effectiveness of the vaccine was seen to wane over time the report suggests it may have the largest impact in areas with high rates of disease  For example in some Kenyan cities  cases of clinical malaria were prevented for every  children who received the drug people in this area are at risk of repeated infections GlaxoSmithKline has now asked the European Medicines Authority to approve it for global use And the drugmakers say together with other preventative measures such as bed nets and insecticides this could represent a huge step forward in malaria control  Scientists are investigating whether a booster could further improve the chances of success Prof Sanjeev Krishna of St Georges University of London who was not involved in the research but reviewed the paper for the journal said This is a milestone The landscape of malaria vaccine development is littered with carcasses with vaccines dying left right and centre  To get to this stage is very encouraging indeed We eagerly await the next results to see how longlasting protection is and whether a booster adds further potential  We need to keep a watchful eye for adverse events but everything appears on track for the vaccine to be approved as early as next year  Prof Brian Greenwood of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who was involved in the research told the BBC To finally get a malaria vaccine licensed would be a huge leap forward  Though it does not provide  protection for areas where malaria is commonplace this has the potential to have a real impact GlaxoSmithKline GSK is developing RTSS with the nonprofit Path Malaria Vaccine Initiative supported by funding from the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation
