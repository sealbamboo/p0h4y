 Dr Craig Spencer the patient with Ebola currently in isolation at Bellevue Hospital Center went bowling in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn on Wednesday evening According to city health officials he had been taking his temperature twice a day since he left Guinea on Oct   His temperature was normal on Wednesday evening and he did not yet have any other symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea  Ebola experts say the disease cannot be transmitted before the appearance of symptoms  Although the surface of a shared bowling ball is a likely place to find germs  and some people avoid bowling for this very reason  it is extremely unlikely that Ebola could be passed that way There is no evidence that it has been passed as colds or flu sometimes are by touching surfaces that someone else touched after sneezing into their hand  Ebola is normally passed through contact with blood vomit or diarrhea  If someone left blood vomit or feces on a bowling ball and the next person to touch it did not even notice and then put his fingers into his eyes nose or mouth it might be possible But the Ebola virus does not not normally build up to high levels in saliva or mucus until very late in the disease  several days after the initial fever sets in  and it is unlikely that someone that ill would have just gone bowling  Also the Ebola virus is fragile and susceptible to drying out It does not normally survive for more than a few hours on a hard dry surface
