The Royal College of Nursing RCN has questioned the independence of an inquiry commissioned by a hospital into its own cancer waiting times Colchester General Hospital was found by the Care Quality Commission CQC to have inaccuracies in its data An independent inquiry will look at who knew what and what they did the hospital has said But the RCN said the sceptics may be forgiven for doubting this is truly independent The CQCs report which is being looked at by Essex Police found staff were pressured or bullied to change data relating to patients and their treatment to make it seem people were being treated in line with national guidelines The inspector said patients lives may have been put at risk Last week the RCN claimed its concerns about a bullying culture were dismissed as fantasy by the hospital in February  Colchester Hospital said that an internal inquiry at that time didnt go deep enough The new investigation it has commissioned is being led by former deputy chief medical officer of England Prof Pat Troop and exNHS Suffolk chief executive Carole TaylorBrown Ms Brown left the primary care trust in  and now runs her own coaching and development consultancy which has worked with other NHS trusts in Essex  Health regulator Monitor has agreed the terms of the hospitalcommissioned independent investigation the hospital said  The report will be sent to hospital trust chairman Dr Sally Irvine who will then consider what action needs to be taken  Dr Irvine said The investigation has been asked to get to the bottom of who knew what when they knew it and what they did  or did not do  about it This will be a farreaching and detailed investigation but because of the urgency of the situation I have asked for it to be completed as soon as possible The RCN regional director Karen Webb said Its quite right that the trust should hold a thorough and open internal investigation into the failings that have harmed both public confidence and staff morale  The RCN however would question whether this investigation can legitimately be called independent when the inquiry and its joint leads have been commissioned by the board of directors at Colchester  The board has some very serious questions to answer about its corporate and clinical governance and the sceptics may be forgiven for doubting that an investigation commissioned by the Board to look into the Boards conduct is truly independent Essex Police is looking into whether the case warrants a criminal investigation
