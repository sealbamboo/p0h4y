Craig Venter who managed to make science both lucrative and glamorous with his pioneering approach to gene sequencing and synthetic biology is taking on a new venture aging He has joined forces with the founder of the  and an expert in cell therapy to launch on Tuesday a new company called Human Longevity Inc The man who once took off on his personal yacht to sample all the microscopic life in the seas plans to leverage some of the most fashionable new scientific approaches to figure out what makes us sick and old The San Diegobased company will tackle aging using gene sequencing stem cell approaches the collection of bacteria and other life forms that live in and on us called the microbiome and the metabolome which includes the byproducts of life called metabolites Theyll start out with what they are calling the largest human sequencing operation in the world We are building a lab to a scale never attempted before Venter told NBC News Venter first shot to fame when he raced with government scientists to finish the first map of all human DNA called the human genome Venter himself a former government scientist annoyed his former colleagues with a brash new approach to gene sequencing that was much faster but far less accurate in their opinion The two teams joined forces the partnership worked and they finished their first draft in  Venter later parted ways with the company he founded to sequence genes and went on to tackle other challenges including a venture that included weeks on his personal yacht sequencing the DNA of microbial life in the ocean He also took a crack at creating artificial life making a   of sorts and making  with that For the new company Venter is teaming up Dr Robert Hariri who directs cell therapy operations at Celgene a biopharmaceutical company and engineer Dr Peter Diamandis chairman of the X Prize Foundation Karen Nelson who headed the J Craig Venter Institute JCVI will lead the microbiome team Studies  including projects at JCVI  have shown the bacteria fungi and other creatures living in and on the human body affect diseases from cancer to eczema and dandruff Hariri says their byproducts may also affect how well we age If you eliminate these various diseases you eliminate the things contributing to unhealthy aging Hariri said Stem cells the bodys master cells secrete compounds that affect tissues and may be able to turn back the clock on some diseases associated with aging he added Its just a good time to tackle these kinds of projects said Diamandis The science is there for one There is also this explosion of massive computational power said Diamandis whose first X Prize challenge offered  million in  to inspire commercial space ventures Burt Rutan won in  with SpaceShipOne a piloted rocket plane The time for creating extended highperforming humans genetically is now We believe the key to  make  the new  is something well within our grasp The new company doesnt aim to extend human life so much as to help keep people healthy as they get older The challenge is when you live into your s s to  living in a way that is decrepit and old is of zero value Diamandis said So the goal is to battle all the diseases of aging Venter said Is there a magic number I am hoping it is bigger than  joked Venter who is
