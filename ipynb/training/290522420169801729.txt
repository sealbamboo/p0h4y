and Behavior Lying about smoking not only prevents your doctor from recommending a   program that is best for you it also interferes with your treatment When a smoker has bronchitis for instance doctors tend to manage the disease more aggressively because smoking breaks down protective mechanisms that help nonsmokers fight off infections says Michael Guttenberg MD chairman of emergency medicine at the NorthShoreLIJ Health Systems Forest Hills Hospital in New York City Smoking also raises the risk for heart disease stroke lung disease and other health problems that your doctor

your overall longevity Too much alcohol causes weight gain and will cause abnormal liver tests says   medical director at the Joan H Tisch Center for Womens Health at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City The doctor always finds out the truth sooner or later so why waste time lying about it Lying to your doctor about exercise can hurt you the most Just saying you exercise doesnt improve your health Dr Goldberg says You need to actually do the exercise Its not hurting the doctors feelings if you dont take her advice but it can hurt your health   and boosting your longevity If youre avoiding being active because a certain condition keeps you from traditional forms of exercise this is the perfect time for your doctor to help recommend alternatives that you may have never considered and are doable Whether youre   or taking illicit drugs you need to tell your doctor Drugs can pose tremendous risks to your body including elevated blood pressure stroke and heart attack Its understandable that its a hard truth to tell but Dr Guttenberg assures patients that Were not the police Its crucial for your doctor to see the full picture in order to give you the right treatment and avoid dangerous drug interactions And remember Guttenberg says Weve probably heard it all before The common flip side of lying about medication is not being honest about taking the pills your doctor did actually prescribe If you stopped your meds for any reason its important to say so Tell your doctor if you have concerns about the medication you take Goldberg says He needs to know about any   or if you stopped taking it because it is too expensive  he may be able to prescribe a generic Good doctorpatient relationships are partnerships If there is something holding you back from doing whats best for your health youll have the help you need to get through it When you dont eat right you only harm yourself But when you lie about it you make it harder for your doctor to determine whats actually wrong with you If you have a condition such as type  diabetes where certain   you are unnecessarily putting yourself at risk for serious health complications Besides most doctors arent fooled by this fib in the first place The scale in my office  it always tells the truth Goldberg says Your sexuality and the number of partners youve had might be a topic youd rather not discuss with someone in a white coat but there can be serious longterm consequences  for you and your sexual partners  if   arent addressed Theyre absolutely treatable if theyre identified and the information is available to us Guttenberg says Whats more if you have a lower libido than usual or trouble maintaining an erection your doctor is actually the best person to tell After all having sex can be an excellent way to boost your physical and mental health Your physician can help you determine the potential causes of a   or   and prescribe medication or other solutions Patients sometimes exaggerate or downplay symptoms They might consider it a little white lie says   a primary care doctor at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore but not being truthful about your symptoms can result in needless testing or prevent your doctor from getting to a solution quickly and directly It doesnt do anyone any good not to inform the doctor about whats really going on he says This might not be less of a lie and more of something you truly havent thought about but the duration of your symptoms is an important factor in your treatment Something thats been going on for a long time probably isnt as significant as an   and needs to be handled much quickly Dr Leavey says He tells his patients to think about recent events such as birthdays and holidays and ask themselves if they were experiencing the symptoms then Lying or forgetting to disclose your   of a disease is another way to sabotage your health and longevity down the road Often history is destined to repeat itself Guttenberg says Although you cant change your family history your doctors can use that information to keep an eye out for specific symptoms and catch a problem when its more manageable The key to any relationship including one with your physician is honesty Leavey says To hide something from your physician will ultimately cause problems but opening up and telling the whole truth will allow your doctor to give you exactly the help that you need
