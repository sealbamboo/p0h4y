If the National Rifle Associations plan to curb violence was in part arming school employees with guns President Obama wants to arm them with something quite different mental health training The presidents plan centers largely on training teachers and others who work with children teens and young adults to recognize mental illness as its developing I think this is really putting the focus on childrens mental health as child issue says   the presidentelect of the American Academy of Child  Adolescent Psychiatry She notes that about  percent of lifetime mental illness starts before the age of  Joshi says  of  people with mental illness develop their condition  including bipolar disorder depression and schizophrenia  by young adulthood when the intricate structures of the brain are taking shape But fewer than half receive treatment The president has called for a new initiative which would need congressional approval that would provide mental health firstaid training for teachers It would also set up a robust referral system for children with mental health and behavioral problems Mike Fitzpatrick executive director of the   says that training is critical People say Oh we saw the signs but no one knows what the next steps are he says And that includes families and caregivers and teachers and resource officers So to go into the communities and offer training on what to look for how to spot the signs of mental illness and where do you go to get assistance  this in many ways would be a game changer Obamas proposal also points out that a startling number of children have direct experience with gun violence  percent of  to yearolds in the US have witnessed a shooting in their lifetimes and the plan calls on Congress to direct some  million to help traumatized students A separate initiative would bolster support for older teens and young adults  ages  to   in need of help who can get lost in the tumble of college or a first job But mental health specialists say that while its critical to recognize the first signs of mental illness its just as important that children and their families have health insurance that guarantees them coverage for treatment That problem was supposed to be addressed in part in  when thenPresident George W Bush signed the   The law requires employers with more than  workers to offer mental health coverage that is on par with medical benefits But writing the regulations has proved difficult There has been disagreement for example over a lifetime cap on the number of therapy visits for people with depression In the meantime advocates say people with mental illness have languished under temporary rules that have barred patients from a full range of mental health services Thats set to change now One of the executive actions the president signed Wednesday included a vow to issue final rules sometime in February Chuck Ingoglia of the trade group   says the rules will apply to nearly every type of insurance from Medicaid to employer coverage to individual health plans sold under the Affordable Care Act Among the socalled essential benefits will be mental health care Were hoping a final rule on parity will make it very clear about the scope of services that are offered he says The whole intent of the parity law was that if you need mental health and addiction services that it should be available to you Those rules wont require congressional approval but much of the presidents plan to improve mental health services  and his other gunrelated proposals  will hinge on support from House Republicans They have vociferously opposed the administrations health policies especially implementing and funding the  federal health law Still the National Rifle Association and a number of Republicans have said they support addressing the nations fractured mental health system Advocates for the mentally ill say they anticipate far less political resistance And the package of mental health proposals in the presidents plan totals some  million in federal spending    with an M And the modest scale those advocates say might just be something everyone can agree on
