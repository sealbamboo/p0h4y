Most people know that too much sugar can be bad for you But now a dozen scientists at three universities have started a new website called   to educate the public on precisely how too much sugar can make people sick The scientists who started SugarScienceorg say they have reviewed  independent clinical research articles on sugar and its role in metabolic conditions that are some of the leading killers of Americans like heart disease Type  diabetes and liver disease The link between sugar and chronic disease has attracted increasing scientific scrutiny in recent years But many studies have provided conflicting conclusions and experts say part of the reason is that biased studies have clouded the debate In one stark example of this a report   this year scrutinized more than a dozen large studies that asked whether soda intake causes obesity The report found that studies carried out with foodindustry funding came to very different conclusions from those that were carried out by independent scientists One of the creators of the new campaign Dr Robert Lustig a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of California San Francisco who has been   said that the new site would provide the public with objective data The goal of this is to provide just the unbiased science Dr Lustig said in a way that the public can come to its own conclusions In addition to Dr Lustig and his colleagues at UCSF the project was also begun with the help of doctors and scientists at the University of California Davis and the Emory University medical school The project has been in the works for some time But the researchers said they waited to start it until after the midterm elections because there were   in San Francisco and Berkeley Calif Some of the researchers are at public institutions and they did not want to be seen as trying to influence votes The new website contains graphics videos and images that explain how sugar affects the liver and the cardiovascular system and are designed to be printed as fliers or shared through social media The scientists said they see the effects of metabolic disease daily and they are concerned that Americans are unwittingly eating large amounts of added sugars mixed into foods and disguised on nutrition labels with names like dextrose maltose galactose and maltodextrin Groups such as the American Heart Association and the World Health Organization recommend a daily limit of nine teaspoons of added sugar for men or roughly  calories and no more than six teaspoons for women about  calories The heart association notes that one ounce can of regular soda   According to the federal government the average adult eats about  teaspoons of added sugars daily The average American consumes nearly three times the recommended amount of added sugar every day which is taking a tremendous toll on our nations health said Laura Schmidt a professor at the UCSF medical school who is also involved in the project This is the ironclad science that establishes the causative link between sugar and chronic disease across the population The new site offers advice on how people can identify added sugars in food and reduce their intake to less worrisome levels  which is not always easy to do As one of the graphics on the website points out added sugar is hiding in  percent of packaged foods and it is listed under at least  different names on food labels
