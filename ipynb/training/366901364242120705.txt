But the real weight gain began after high school The couple started a longdistance relationship when Mickey went to Lock Haven University in their home state of Pennsylvania and Balajthy attended the University of Maryland It sucked Mickey said I was lonely in college and I missed him So there was a lot of emotional eating Having a college meal plan also didnt help Mickey feasted on buffetstyle meals for breakfast lunch and dinner It was very much a serveyourself pasta bar makeyourown pizza dining hall and breakfasts were always makeyourown waffles topped off with everything terrible At his campus Balajthy also developed bad eating habits such as finishing off a box of Entenmanns pastries in one sitting He periodically ate caloriedense dishes such as his favorite meal pasta with vodka sauce I was on track to some serious health issues Balajthy said First being heavy takes a toll on your body My back always hurt and I couldnt do much because I was always hurting It doesnt take much to get diabetes and heart disease From freshman year to the end of college Mickeys pant size stretched from a size  to  her largest fit  At graduation she weighed  pounds standing at  feet  inches Balajthy was  pounds at  feet  inches  The couple got a place together shortly after graduation They didnt fully acknowledge how big they had gotten but their families started giving them subtle hints to lose weight  Weight is a touchy subject to address Mickey said Jons mom sent him a care package with an exercise ball in it She didnt tell me to lose weight because I am not her daughter but I know she wanted me to be healthy Once Mickey enrolled in nursing school at Marymount University in Arlington Virginia she couldnt ignore their weight any longer especially after learning about diabetes heart disease and obesity the first semester She practiced measuring blood pressure at home and tested Balajthy only to discover he had hypertension Thats when the eating out snack foods and indulgent meals stopped and the couple of eight years seriously looked into getting fit Mickey dumped all the calorierich food in their kitchen in a trash bag I threw out the fullfat ice cream chips cookies just everything in the house Even the old Halloween candy she said Deciding to work out together the two went jogging for one mile around a lake near their home We were so out of shape at first that we usually had to walk around it Mickey recalled But the exhaustion only inspired them to stick with their goals They enrolled at Planet Fitness a gym near home For the first three months all they did was cardio exercising on machines such as the elliptical and treadmill for half an hour They also started calorie counting  In the first month Mickey dropped  pounds  an instant boost of confidence  I never tried to run or go to the gym until we started losing weight together she said Balajthy agreed Its amazing how easy it was after we started I realized I liked going to the gym and there was never a time that I thought Im having a miserable time  Within three months the duo had lost enough weight to make a big impression at a family reunion in Pennsylvania Some relatives hadnt seen them since college graduation  We didnt tell anyone that we started to work out Mickey said So the reactions were intense and funny because we saw our family with  pounds less on us For the first time Mickey dared to wear a bikini Even when I was little I had to wear tankinis she said Now people called her the evershrinking woman After eight months Mickey and Balajthy are down to  and  pounds respectively Their workouts have changed too they do  minutes of cardio and  minutes of weight training four to five times a week Theyre working on toning up and being active which means fitness doesnt stop at the gym Balajthy bikes to the University of Maryland where he is a doctoral candidate in physics The couple take their dog on runs or play tennis in the evenings On the weekends they go on hiking trips excursions Mickey always dreamed of doing when she was heavier Now theyre hiking  miles while carrying pound packs Staying active has been a plus for Balajthy who said hes always been a boredom eater I would watch TV with a bag of chips and finish it off There are no chips at home anymore Besides counting calories the pair started cooking more Their dinners usually consist of skinless chicken breasts or fish with a veggie side such as broccoli or green beans and a salad We even use yogurt dressing and dont have a lot of carbohydrates for dinner Mickey said Jons mother used to serve dinner rolls but we dont eat bread and butter anymore because there are a million little things you can do to keep the weight off They enjoy eating out though and occasionally treat themselves to Thai a favorite for Balajthy  In the end the couple said there were no hidden secrets to losing weight If you just go outside and do little things like exercise and eating healthy it works Mickey said   But they said the key was working out together   Working out with Caroline has kept me on track I wasnt driven to lose weight and didnt think I could Balajthy said Now they are happy with their weight Mickey said she is looking forward to trying on wedding dresses and starting their life together as a married couple
