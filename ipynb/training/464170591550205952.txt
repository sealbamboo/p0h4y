Treating psychiatric illnesses with antipsychotic drugs can greatly reduce the risk that a patient will commit a violent crime researchers reported on Thursday Their study published in the Lancet medical journal adds weight to the argument that severely mentally ill people need to get diagnosed and treated Mental health experts agree that people with psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia are  to become victims of violence than they are to hurt someone else But Dr Thomas Insel director of the National Institute on Mental Health also notes that people with severe mental illness are up to  than the general population to be violent The question has been whether treatment lowers these risks One highprofile case is that of Jared Loughner  who shot and killed six people in Arizona and wounded several more including thencongresswoman Gabrielle Giffords Dr Seena Fazel of Britains Oxford University used a Swedish national database to find out Sweden keeps careful medical records and has similar rates of both mental illness and violence to the United States The only exception is homicide where the US has much higher rates than just about every other country Fazels team looked at the medical records of everyone born in Sweden between  and  We identified  men and  women who were prescribed any antipsychotic or mood stabilizer between Jan   and Dec   they wrote It worked out to about  percent of the population They looked at criminal records and the type of drug given We noted substantially lower rates of violent crime when any of the three classes of medication had been prescribed specifically for antipsychotics and mood stabilizers they wrote In the three years studied  percent  of the men and  percent  of women were convicted of a violent crime Compared with periods when participants were not on medication violent crime fell by  percent in patients receiving antipsychotics and by  percent in patients prescribed mood stabilizers they added Violent crime was defined as murder assault robbery threatening behavior any sexual offense and arson Doubling up on the medications did not seem to help something that may be important in making sure patients get the safest treatments possible they noted They compared the patients against themselves too looking at times when they were on medications compared to times when they went without it Again patients were less likely to be violent when given drugs By comparing the same people when they are on medication compared to when they are not our study provides evidence of potentially substantial reductions in risk of violence and suggests that violence is to a large extent preventable in patients with psychiatric disorders Fazel said in a statement
