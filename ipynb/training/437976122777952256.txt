Toxicologists have long considered   the active ingredient in many antifreeze and engine coolant formulas to be a seductive and uniquely dangerous poison  For one thing its sweet We actually had a mechanic who developed a taste for it recalled Dr Marsha Ford director of the Carolinas Poison Center in Charlotte NC Hed pour himself a little and sip it And he kept doing that until he got sick   And thats the other danger Ethylene glycol is a slowacting poison Even following a high dose symptoms    The countrys poison control centers record more than  ethylene glycol ingestions annually some  cases require medical treatment Most are accidental but ethylene glycol also figures in hundreds of suicide attempts every year  not to mention the occasional murder  Recently an Ohio woman was convicted of killing her fianc   
 The situation for animals has been even more dangerous than for despised spouses According to the Humane Society of the United States as many as  pets and wild animals are poisoned annually   Now the manufacturers of those products have determined to do something about all the carnage They are making antifreeze taste awful  so very bitter that it will be nigh impossible to drink by accident  Seventeen states already require manufacturers to add socalled bittering agents to ethylene glycol products The   which represents the key manufacturers voluntarily   to all consumer products containing the compound sold nationwide The first batches of unpalatable antifreeze started hitting store shelves last year this year customers can buy only the bitter versions The action came about in part because of a surprisingly warm relationship between the Humane Society and the CSPA Both groups had earlier worked together to propose   But after repeated failures they realized that an industry agreement was a more likely resolution   Most people survive because they get treatment a lot faster said Sara Amundson executive director of the   We often dont catch the problem with animals until its too late partly because they often go away to some quiet place when they feel sick  Representatives of the two groups settled on an oldtime compound denatonium benzoate as   The compound discovered in the late s is not considered especially toxic is obnoxiously bitter and has been shown not to damage engines Even at  parts per million studies have found children in laboratory settings promptly    But not everyone is deterred  A  study looking at states where bittering agents are required found that the taste appeared   by drinking antifreeze  Nonetheless researchers tracking both human and animal health are hoping that the new formulation reduces the number of inadvertent poisonings Were watching it said Dr Ford who is also director of the poison control center network which has begun analyzing its  numbers The   operated by the ASPCA so far reports no change The number of alarmed calls about antifreeze poisoning remained above  a year from  to  Of course no one is sure how much sweet antifreeze is still out there For one thing the voluntary agreement doesnt cover professional grades of antifreeze and engine coolant such as those used in car repair shops And people hang onto their home supplies for years  Ive got a container of antifreeze in my garage thats probably more than a year old said Dr Clark Fobian a Missouri veterinarian and president of the    Chemical additives are only part of the safety solution experts note Safe storage and handling are important as are warning labels  large ones preferably  A big part of this is educating people said Dr Fobian He recalled a client who changed his engine coolant in a driveway and left the liquid sitting in a pan A dog belonging to his inlaws drank it and died  Hed just never considered that it might be a risk Dr Fobian said
