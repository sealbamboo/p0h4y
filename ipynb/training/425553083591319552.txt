Want to get away Thinking about a place with warm water and soft sand Sounds nice But think twice before you wade into that inviting surf Chances are there are stingrays in the area Every year these timid shellfisheating cousins of the shark inflict excruciating injuries on thousands of swimmers and surfers from the Bahamas to Bahrain to both coasts of the United States One of last years victims was Eric Stern a doctor from Washington DC who was giving a surfing lesson to his sister in August near Santa Monica Calif He remembers casually hopping off his board into waistdeep water The moment my foot hit sandy bottom just strike Bam he says I mean immediate  knifelike pain Stern wondered at first whether a shark had bitten him The bleeding was so pronounced from what appeared to be a inch to inch gash he says I still wasnt thinking stingray But when lifeguards arrived they told him he was the third stingray victim theyd seen that day And by that time Stern says the injury no longer felt like a bite or a cut The pain had transitioned already to a much deeper darker migrainoustype pain he says Almost like you put your foot or ankle in a vise and twisted it In a marine lab at California State University Long Beach  an hours drive south of where Stern got injured  marine biologist   says the intense pain of a stingray injury comes from a powerful toxin secreted by the animals tail That toxin causes blood vessels to constrict reducing blood flow Lowe says It causes this intense pain sensation  a throbbing kind of aching pain sensation And it literally takes hours to go away But if youve ever been unlucky enough to feel that pain dont blame the stingray Lowe says They only sting in selfdefense And the   that probably got Stern is especially shy he adds In Lowes lab a round stingray hides at the sandy bottom of a tank At first its hard to tell that there is a stingray there because as Lowe says the name of their game is disappearing But eventually you can make out a faint outline in the sand about the size of a dinner plate along with two eyes and two nostrillike openings called spiracles As he scoops the stingray into a net Lowe explains how Eric Sterns foot got filleted He points to the inchlong spine thats almost concealed in a sheath at the end of the animals whiplike tail When you  harass this ray or accidentally step on it Lowe says it has the ability to quickly flick its tail up And that barb comes up like an arrow point Larger stingrays like the   can have spines the size of a steak knife Lowe says It was one of these large rays on Australias Great Barrier Reef that killed   host of   TV show in  Believe it or not Steve Irwin was not the only fatality Lowe says About every five or six years or so somebody is killed by one of those large stingrays Although there are no good statistics on stingray injuries what   there are suggest that thousands of people are stung each year worldwide and that the number may be rising In places like California stingray populations appear to be growing because there are   like sharks seals and sea lions Lowe says Also more and more people around the world are spending time at the beach I get calls from resort owners on the East Coast  and even in the Middle East where they have really highend resorts Lowe says They have stingrays in those areas They have had injuries and they call us up asking us what should they do People have been asking that question for a long time at   which is just a couple of miles from Lowes lab Several years ago a census of rays on this beach found that about  rays live along just a few hundred yards of shoreline And not surprisingly the area reports more stingray injuries than any place on Earth  about  a year Take a stroll down Seal Beach and theres a good chance youll run into Michael Pless an instructor at   Im known as the king of stingray stings he says In the past  years Pless says hes been stung  times He says he gives all of his surfing students a lesson in how to do the   which involves shuffling your feet along the sand so the stingrays know youre coming and you dont step on one Signs in parking lots around Seal Beach warn of stingrays and lifeguards also try to help beachgoers avoid a painful sting But many still learn about the dangers the hard way says Nick Bolin a marine safety officer Usually our tower guards will spot them seconds after theyve been stung because theyll come hopping out of the water he says Well take them back to our lifeguard headquarters where we have a dedicated lifeguard assigned to the stingray shift and we soak the foot in hot water until the pain subsides enough that they can go on their own way When the beach is busy and the tide is low there may be dozens of victims Bolin says Weve had days where our hot water heater actually cant even keep up with the number of stings  in very hot water is critical as the heat neutralizes the stingray toxin The moment you take your foot out of the hot water the pain just shoots back up within five to  seconds says Stern the doctor who got   near Santa Monica Its really quite remarkable Unfortunately for Stern several hours of hot water treatment wasnt the end of his stingray adventure The gash on his foot had to be sewn up at a local emergency room And once the wound healed Stern realized he had another problem I began to notice that I didnt have any sensation in the dorsum  the top  of my foot around the base of my fourth and fifth toes he says The sting had caused nerve damage and Stern eventually needed surgery But hes better now and ready to get back in the California surf This time he says I think Im going to stay on my board until Im out in deep waters
