Ten years ago   got an associate professorship at Baylor College of Medicine and set off to study one of the nations most pressing health problems obesity In particular hes been trying to figure out the biology behind why children born to obese women are more likely to develop the condition themselves Waterland got sustaining funding from the National Institutes of Health and used it to get the project going But after years of success in this line of research hes suddenly in limbo His NIH grant ran out in  and he hasnt been able to get it renewed Were in survival mode right now he says His research cant move forward without funding And he has plenty of company Nationwide about  percent of scientists with sustaining known as R grants in  lost them the following year according to an NPR analysis That left about  scientists nationwide scrambling to find money to keep their labs alive  including  at the Baylor College of Medicine The root cause is plain and its not just about a current shortage in funding The NIH budget shot steadily upward from  to  That spawned great jubilation in biomedicine and a goldrush mentality But it didnt last Since  the NIH budget has decreased by   Thats not counting the hefty twoyear bump the budget got from stimulus funds via the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of  Grants are the lifeblood of university research Scientists rely on that steady stream of cash to hire staff buy equipment and run the experiments Their results help propel innovation medical advances and local economies Academic research is a major reason the United States remains a leader in medicine and biotechnology but the future is uncertain If I dont get another NIH grant say within the next year then I will have to let some people go in my lab And thats a fact Waterland says And there could be a point at which Im not able to keep a lab He notes that the hallway in his laboratorys building is starting to feel like a ghost town as funding for his colleagues dries up He misses the energy of that lost camaraderie The only people who can survive in this environment are people who are absolutely passionate about what theyre doing and have the selfconfidence and competitiveness to just go back again and again and just persistently apply for funding Waterland says He has applied for eight grants and has been rejected time and again Hes still hoping that his grant for the obesity research will get renewed  next year Baylor College of Medicine is suffering more than most Its NIH funding dropped from a peak of  million in  to  million in  But many other schools are in the same fix The University of Virginia for example regarded as one of the top public universities in the nation watched its NIH funding shrink from a peak of  million in  to  million in  Take   a professor of biochemistry and molecular genetics who is one of about  scientists at University of Virginia who lost their sustaining grants between  and  Until that point hed had continuous funding since  to conduct studies about the basic mechanics of DNA He has had to fire his lab staff and is planning to close his lab It seemed like great fortune when the NIH budget soared more than a decade ago Unfortunately a lot of research institutions and medical schools were hogs to the trough Burke says They hired a lot of people and built a lot of buildings with the expectation that that would continue And when that flattened off and started losing money to inflation the institutions were essentially bloated His institution sought to cash in on those boom times University of Virginia doubled the amount of biomedical laboratory space on campus between  and   from  square feet to  square feet Funding for some of that expansion was supposed to come from the grants that its scientists garnered The university touted plans to add  new scientists and support staff to fill these labs Instead last year it eliminated more than  jobs  many held by highly skilled workers  as funding for biomedical research sank New labs built to handle dangerous germs and small animals are now lightly used The UVa swings in overbuilding or unused space for specialized facilities really have been extremely moderate compared to the scaling that occurred either at larger institutions or at some of the large private medical centers   vice president for research at the university told NPR To help close the budget gap the university has raised tuition The commonwealth of Virginia now provides only  percent of its flagship universitys funding Skalak defends using tuition to help pay for new laboratories saying undergraduates can enhance their education by working in a lab The University of Virginias building boom was twice the national average Nationwide National Science Foundation data show that universities have expanded laboratory space by  percent in the past decade expecting a funding boom that turned out to be a bust In absolute terms there is still a lot of money for biomedical research  the NIH budget is about  billion a year But with the doubling and subsequent decline in funding supply and demand are completely out of whack Its an unstable system says   a labor economist at Georgia State University It really depended on funding growing and growing and growing And so we need to find some way for it to reach equilibrium Many scientists hold out hope for a simple solution more money But the current US Congress has no appetite to spend more  even on health research that has broad bipartisan public support So a  s is trying to figure out how to repair the hobbled biomedical enterprise without a cash infusion We have to remember that this is a fragile system says   who was head of the NIH when the funding doubled he now runs the National Cancer Institute  Do no harm the doctors mantra is very applicable here he says The current system for allocating funding has made the United States the leader in biomedical research worldwide Varmus notes And while I dont think weve lost that edge yet we do see a rising tide in lots of places
