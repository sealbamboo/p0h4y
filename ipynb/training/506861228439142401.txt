More than  people have been infected by Ebola in Liberia Guinea Sierra Leone and Nigeria since the first documented cases in December according to the World Health Organization At least  have died Making it worse Frieden said is how other countries have turned their backs on those coming from countries where the outbreak is strongest even if they dont realize it  Measures to restrict flights and border crossings into the countries facing the outbreak were designed to contain the spread but are having a paradoxical effect he explained  This is making it really hard to get help in and to respond effectively to the outbreak he said on CNNs New Day What were seeing is a  hugely fast increase in cases thats harder and harder to manage he said The more we can get in there and tamp that down the fewer cases well have in the weeks and months to come The president of Doctors Without Borders sharply criticized what she called the global coalition of inaction for focusing on insulating their nations instead of helping those in Africa who need it most Dr Joanne Liu said centers run by her group have turned away sick because they are too full as an everincreasing number of people develop symptoms of Ebola States with the required capacity have a political and humanitarian responsibility to come forward and offer a desperately needed concrete response to the disaster unfolding in front of the worlds eyes  rather than limit their response to the potential arrival of an infected patient in their countries Liu said In her CNN interview President Sirleaf of Liberia appealed for other nations to please work as partners with us by offering monetary health care logistical and other assistance yes but also by giving moral and personal support to a problem thats affected millions already Give us hope by joining us in this fight Sirleaf said Dont instill fear We need that hope we need that assistance we need for Liberians to know that this war can be won The US government tried to get frontandcenter on the issue Tuesday led by President Barack Obama Speaking directly to  the people of West Africa in a video message Obama said Americas prayers are with those impacted by the disease and reiterated basic facts to educate locals on how Ebola spreads Stopping this disease wont be easy but we know how to do it Obama said You are not alone Together we can treat those who are sick with respect and dignity we can save lives and our countries can work together to improve public health so this kind of outbreak doesnt happen again Obama insisted his government is working those in Africa to make a difference To this point White House spokesman Josh Earnest said more than  staff members from the CDC  the US health agency focused on infectious diseases including Ebola   are on the case including  of the roughly  US government personnel that are on the ground in hardhit areas These government workers in Guinea Liberia Nigeria and Sierra Leone are doing things like surveillance contact tracing database management and health education Earnest said But they arent the only Americans on the ground putting themselves in harms way to help others Many are there as part of humanitarian groups like two who contracted Ebola earlier this summer They were sent to Atlantas Emory University Hospital where they were treated and later released On Tuesday a group called Serving in Mission announced that another American  a doctor working in Liberias capital  had tested positive for Ebola The doctor whose name was not released was not treating Ebola patients and its not known how he contracted the disease SIM USA said One of the other Americans infected with Ebola Nancy Writebol also was working on a SIM USA mission The unnamed American doctor immediately isolated himself upon the onset of symptoms and is currently in an Ebola isolation unit the group said The doctor is doing well and is in good spirits SIM USA said in a statement  The prognosis for all of West Africa though isnt good Frieden the CDC director says whats happening now is worse that past Ebola outbreaks This is the first epidemic spreading widely through many countries and it is spiraling out of control said Frieden who recently returned from a trip to the region Its bad now much worse than the numbers show Its going to get even worse in the very near future Thats bad news for places like Liberia where President Sirleaf notes primary  hospitals have had to close because they became incubators for the disease and  Ebola has been spreading quite rapidly The crisis is threatening already fragile economies Vincent Martin head of the UNs Food and Agriculture Organizations Dakarbased Resilience Hub noted that some households in affected areas were spending up to  of their income on food before the outbreak  and now prices are rising as people stock up on food fearing it will run out Plus restricted movement between countries has created labor shortages on farms the FAO reports The main harvest season for crops such as rice and maize is weeks away and what was predicted to be a favorable harvest is now at risk the agency said  Then theres the matter of locals who cant work because they or loved ones are infected who arent going out and spending as much due to fears tied to the crisis or whose livelihoods are threatened because economies have become more insulated Sirleaf says the great progress the economy of Liberia at least is now under question because of the Ebola crisis That said she stressed that theres only one path forward  to defeat the disease and return to some semblance of normal Im very hopeful that we will beat this the Liberian President said We have to We have no option but to succeed in this
