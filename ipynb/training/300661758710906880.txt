 People who live  years or longer have as many diseaseassociated genes as those in the general population but they may also be blessed with protective genes that help them live so long researchers report The team of US scientists noted that supercentenarians as they are called are extremely rare with only one per  million people in developed nations There is growing evidence that genetics play a major role in living to such an   In what they describe as a firstofakind study the researchers analyzed the whole genome sequences of a man and a woman who lived past the age of  and found that they had as many diseaseassociated genes as other people For example the man had  genetic mutations associated with increased risk for   In fact he had presented with an obstructing colon cancer earlier in his life that had not metastasized and was cured with surgery He was in phenomenal cognitive and physical shape near the time of his death study senior author Dr Thomas Perls director of the New England Centenarian Study said in a Boston University Medical Center news release The woman had numerous genetic variations associated with agerelated disease such as   cancer and   She did develop   and mild cognitive impairment but these conditions didnt become evident until she was more than  years old The presence of these diseaseassociated variants is consistent with our and other researchers findings that centenarians carry as many diseaseassociated genes as the general population Perls said The difference may be that the centenarians likely have longevityassociated variants that cancel out the disease genes That effect may extend to the point that the diseases dont occur  or if they do are much less pathogenic or markedly delayed towards the end of life in these individuals who are practically living to the limit of the human lifespan The study was published Jan  in the journal   and researchers will be able to access the information at the US National Institutes of Health data repository
