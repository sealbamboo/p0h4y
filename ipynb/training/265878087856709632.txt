When we think of readytoeat meals we usually think of those packets of nutrientdense soldiers rations like   that stays fresh for two years These pouches of food are typically deployed in the field and are consequently designed to withstand the abuses of temperature and time that would destroy fresh fare In the last week a close cousin of these practically indestructible vittles has moved out of Red Cross and Federal Emergency Management Agency warehouses and into the hands of the ordinary citizens of New York and New Jersey hurt by Superstorm Sandys bluster and flooding last week The total number of readytoeat meals distributed in the wake of the storm is a figure thats hard to come by since operations are ongoing New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs spokesperson Kryn Westhoven says National Guard troops have delivered more than  emergency meals to resident of Hoboken alone one of the hardest hit areas in the state in the last six days The Red Cross says it has   more than  readytoeat meals to the  states facing the most storm damage and FEMAs Mary Olsen tells The Salt more than  million liters of water and more than  million meals have been transferred to states to supplement their existing inventory Now to be clear these pouched meals are distinct from the hundreds of thousands of meals made fresh in makeshift kitchens and delivered hot to residents The Red Cross estimates it has already delivered over a million of those meals so far and counting says spokeswoman Anne Marie Borrego But what exactly are people getting in the   little packets Theyre very high in calories  theyre not a light food says Westhoven He admits his standby is beanieweenie a frankfurters and beans type meal because I know I can eat it cold Its kind of like cold pizza he says But the prepackaged meals sent to storm victims go way beyond beanieweenies It might be Chicken Caccitore chili and rice beef stew all kinds says Joice Williams a senior associate at the Red Cross who is helping coordinate efforts in the most affected states And theyre often free of pork these days We try and be cognizant of dietary restrictions for example they are lower in sodium than soldiers MREs and have less calories There are vegetarian and Kosher options FEMAs Olsen says Ally Kist a nurse and EMT who was volunteering at a shelter that lost power in  Teterboro NJ when the storm hit says the best FEMA meal she got was Buffalo chicken It came with Saltine crackers peanut butter spreadable cheese and instant coffee as well as a packet that can heat the food in about  minutes just by adding water Its pretty cool and semibearable she tells The Salt While she says she was grateful for a hot meal she gave the flavors mixed reviews I learned the hard way that the only ones worth eating were the chicken ones and the vegetable ones she tells us Military MRE rations have changed a lot since the US Army   the modern version to troops in  The coffee has improved and theres hot sauce wetpacked fruit and   in some of them according to an unofficial but comprehensive web site featuring current MRE menus reviews and more Now the Red Cross assures us that their MREs are lower in calories than the soldiers but they are still filling Best of all says Williams they now come with their own selfheating device that only requires a little water to activate And as military officials and aid workers know well a hot meal can go a long way to helping someone both physically and mentally So how do our MRE offerings stack up against other countries versions See for yourself Slate posted this comparative   last year
