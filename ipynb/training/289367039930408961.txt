 Despite spending more on healthcare Americans die sooner and experience more illness than people in other highincome countries a study released Wednesday found For example lung disease was more prevalent and associated with higher mortality in the US compared with other countries and American children were less likely to live to age  according to the report Shorter Lives Poorer Health issued by the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine Researchers were surprised by the gravity and pervasiveness of the disparities and couldnt pinpoint a cause to a specific disease said study chair Steven Woolf MD professor of family medicine at the Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond Va Poor health results also cant be blamed on a single racial ethnic or socioeconomic group he added The disparity found between the US and  comparable countries showed itself in all ages from birth to  And while the USs mortality rate has been lagging for some time the report found poor comparable health status cuts across income education levels and health insurance status No single factor but a combination is likely to explain the US health disadvantage Woolf said in a call with reporters Wednesday For the report the blueribbon panel compared health outcomes in the US to  comparable highincome or peer countries It found a consistent pattern of higher mortality and poorer health in the US for every year age group starting from birth Specifically the panel found Americans who do reach age  generally arrive at this age in poorer health than their counterparts in other highincome countries and as older adults they face greater morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases that arise from risk factors that are often established earlier in life the report stated While there are many possible causes one leading factor is American culture which tends to cherish personal autonomy and less government intrusion  attitudes that produce more unsafe and unhealthy behaviors Woolf said Americans also rely on cars for transportation more and eat food generally prepared in a less healthy way And the US has a smaller number of primary care providers than its peer countries and greater problems coordinating care the study found Despite Americas severe disadvantage in health outcomes the research found hospital mortality rates are comparable to other countries Its when people leave the hospital and go out into the community that quality of life drops off Woolf said Americans need to distinguish between the countrys healthcare system  for which people already spend far more per capita than their peers  and their personal health This study would suggest we need to think about the way we spend our money Woolf said In contrast to all other age groups Americans age  and older fare better than their counterparts in peer countries the study found The US also has better cancer screening and survival rates better control of blood pressure and cholesterol levels and lower smoking rates Its suicide rates dont exceed the international average Also the nations recent immigrants are generally in better health than nativeborn Americans the study found Panelists offered a number of policy and research suggestions to move forward The country should ramp up efforts to curb disadvantages they suggested while philanthropy and advocacy groups organize media and outreach campaigns to inform the general public about its findings to encourage national debate New research is needed to uncover the best ways of improving health in the future the report suggested The country should work with international partners to harmonize indicators and data collection and the National Institutes of Health and other research agencies should commit to understanding the factors behind the USs health disadvantage and lessons learned from other countries Source
