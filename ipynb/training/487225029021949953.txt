Rise and shine, everyone, another shiny day is on the way. However, this will be an abbreviated session for yours truly, because we have been tapped to sit in judgment at one of the local courthouses. This could prove quite interesting or terminally dull – one never knows what to expect when staring the justice system in the face. In any event, our appearance may eat up a considerable amount of time, as you can imagine. Just the same, we have assembled your daily menu of tidbits to consume. So dig in. Meanwhile, we hope to see you again very soon. Have a smashing day…
