Essentially the gut is your bodys gatekeeper letting in helpful compounds and evicting harmful ones Its home to  to  of our immune cells When the gut is in good shape our systems run efficiently but when its not we may experience upset stomach be at risk for weight gain or digestive problems like heartburn and constipation or just feel vaguely out of sorts  For many people that rundown feeling has lasted so long that its mistaken for the norm says New York cardiologist Alejandro Junger author of Clean Gut  We could feel so much better  we just dont know it The gut is swarming with about  trillion bacteria or flora which outnumber human cells in our body  to  Bacteria are often considered good or bad  These bacteria and the compounds they excrete can have positive and negative effects on a persons health says Dr Stanley Hazen chair of cellular and molecular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic To have a healthy gut one must avoid eating foods that foster the growth of bacteria that create unhealthy metabolites  Friendly bacteria aid the metabolism of nutrients and help certain compounds get into the bloodstream A diverse population of healthpromoting flora protects the gut from the less helpful strains In contrast an outsize number of lessbeneficial flora  which proliferate with a diet high in sugar fat and processed food  can cause gas discomfort bloating and inflammation The flora can also emit chemicals that compromise the intestinal lining says Lita Proctor of the Human Microbiome Project at the National Institutes of Health This socalled leaky gut allows nonnutritive materials to slip into our bodies and affect how we feel Incredibly some bacteria might even make you fat A recent study of twins published in Nature found that when bacteria from an obese human twin were introduced into the digestive systems of lean mice the mice turned fat when bacteria from the thin sibling were introduced into lean mice the mice stayed lean Studies also suggest that diabetic and obese patients tend to lack a diversity of bacteria and the Cleveland Clinic found that some bacteria metabolize components of egg and meat to produce a compound that aids in the clogging of arteries  This might explain why some unhealthy eaters get heart disease while others dont says Hazen The good news is that you can reset your gut bacteria swapping bad flora for good  Get the right type in your gut and depending on your condition you may begin to see improvements in a matter of days or weeks says Edmond Huang a metabolic biologist at the University of California Berkeley  To cultivate healthful microflora you want to nourish the desirable species while killing off the bad Beware of antibiotics however which decimate the flora keeping our bodies healthy along with those causing illness and infection  Every course of antibiotics has a chance for such complications as yeast infections skin rashes and allergic reactions says Liponis  Use these drugs only when needed and always supplement with probiotics to repopulate the healthful flora Probiotics  the good bacteria in fermented foods and supplements  bolster the number of friendly bacteria in the gut For relatively healthy people its always a good idea to start with real food before taking supplements  Bifidobacteria found in most yogurt release chemicals that create an acidic environment in which many harmful bacteria cant thrive And yogurt with the common strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus may improve your mood A  study published in Gastroenterology found that when healthy women ate  grams of yogurt twice daily for four weeks their brain scans showed a less intense response when exposed to negative images You can nourish healthful flora with prebiotics which contain nondigestible carbohydrates  found in whole grains onions garlic leeks artichokes asparagus and chicory root  Regular intake has been associated with decreases in irritable bowel syndrome and fat storage and may reduce allergic reactions like skin rashes  as well as an increase in an overall feeling of wellbeing according to a  issue of the British Journal of Nutrition According to studies done in mice dietary fats can damage the gut lining thus allowing the undesirable chemicals released by certain bacteria to leak into the bloodstream and inflame the tissues surrounding it  Whats more some fats raise the population of unfriendly bacteria says Rob Knight a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Colorado Boulder Stress may change the makeup of your gut flora A  Brain Behavior and Immunity study reported that stressedout mice which had been left in a cage with aggressive mice experienced a plunge in beneficial bacteria and an increase in inflammatory chemicals in the blood serum  Stress alters the functioning of the immune system  either by suppressing or enhancing its response to foreign invaders says Ohio State University associate professor of oral biology Michael Bailey the papers author  For the good of your gut  and health  figure out why youre anxious and take measures to eliminate those stressors
