For the past few years Brenda Buck has been sampling the dust blowing across southern Nevada Until recently she focused on the risks of airborne elements such as arsenic But then she started noticing an oddity in her samples a sprinkling of tiny hairlike mineral fibers  She found them on herself as well After a ride on horseback down a dirt road  miles south of Las Vegas her clothes and boots were dappled with the fibrous material Dr Buck a professor of geology at the University of Nevada Las Vegas turned to her colleagues to help identify it  Their verdict asbestos And lots of it  In a paper published late last year titled    Dr Buck and her colleagues reported that the fibers were similar to those found at asbestoscontaminated Superfund sites and warned that they could be transported by wind water cars or on clothing after outdoor recreational activities The research raises the possibility that many communities in the region including Las Vegas may face a previously unknown hazard Dr Buck and her coauthor Rodney V Metcalf a fellow UNLV geology professor are now trying to quantify the range and the danger posed by natural asbestosbearing mineral deposits spread across  acres stretching from the southern shore of Lake Mead to the edges of the McCullough Range Nobody wants bad news  were all hoping the health risks will be very low Dr Buck said in an interview But the fact is we dont know that yet  Similar concerns are arising in an unexpectedly wide swath of the United States Naturally occurring asbestos deposits now have been mapped in locations across the country from   to   in California  Elongated asbestos fibers are created by natural mineral formations When they turn up in industrial products it is because people have excavated them and refined them for use  a practice dating back more than  years Ancient Greeks used asbestos    Stories of asbestoslinked illnesses date back almost as long But it was the postWorld War II embrace of these fibers in products ranging from insulating materials to ceiling tiles to roofing shingles that provided undeniable evidence of health effects By the s scientists had demonstrated that a chain of occupational illnesses including   could be directly linked to the presence of such mineral fibers The term asbestos technically refers to a group of six silicatebased fibrous minerals But this definition may underestimate the extent of naturally occurring risks scientists say The mineral erionite for instance also forms needlelike structures which have been linked to startlingly high levels of mesothelioma in Turkey and which have recently been discovered in the oilandgas boom regions of North Dakota The discovery of airborne erionite fibers in North Dakota recently led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to describe it as   Essentially these fibers flow aerodynamically into the deep lung tissue and lodge there said Geoffrey Plumlee a geochemist with the United States Geological Survey in Denver They remain embedded for years like needles in a pincushion spurring the onset of not only mesothelioma but also other lung cancers and diseases of the respiratory system   By the s such health effects were so well documented that the Environmental Protection Agency moved to limit asbestos use and in  the agency   But a recent cascade of research has renewed scientific worries For one thing recent soil studies show that residential developments have spread into mineralrich regions Californias state capital Sacramento for example spilled into neighboring El Dorado County where it turned out whole neighborhoods      And sophisticated epidemiological studies have shown that this was more than an occupational health issue The small mining town of Libby Mont provided   Almost a fifth of the residents have now received   from mesothelioma to severe scarring of lung tissue When these conditions began cropping up across the entire town in the late s investigators assumed that those sickened were all workers at a nearby mine But the illnesses werent appearing only in mine workers Family members were stricken too as were residents of the town who had nothing to do with the mining business  Investigations by alarmed government agencies  including the EPA the Geological Survey and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  established that miners brought asbestos fibers back to town with them on clothes vehicles and other possessions But residents were also exposed to fibers blowing about the surrounding environment  and to the dismay of researchers   than had been thought to cause harm  Libby really started the new focus on the issue said Bradley Van Gosen a research geochemist with the Geological Survey in Denver  Dr Van Gosen has been put in charge of a new USGS mapping project an ambitious effort to trace the minerals not only across Western mining states but also elsewhere from the Upper Midwest to a rambling path up the Eastern Seaboard starting in southern Appalachia and stretching into Maine   Dr Van Gosen said that most of the Eastern deposits were linked to an ancient crustal boundary perhaps a billion years old that underlies mountain ranges like the Appalachians Wherever they are found though minerals in the asbestos family tend to form when magnesium silica and water are transformed by superheated magma from the earths mantle   In Western states such filamented minerals tend to result from volcanic activity In the Midwest where  fibers have recently turned up associated with mining interests in Minnesota and Wisconsin geologists suspect they originated in ancient magnesiumrich seafloors A recent study in Minnesota   contaminated by such deposits It has the potential to be a huge deal said Christopher P Weis toxicology adviser to the director of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences And we want to get the word out because this is something that can be addressed if we tackle it upfront   Dr Bucks discovery of similar hazards in southern Nevada was the first time that naturally occurring asbestos had been reported in the region At this point she and her colleagues are simply trying to figure out the extent of the problem A leading mesothelioma researcher Dr Michele Carbone of the University of Hawaii is analyzing the fibers to help establish the magnitude of any health risk Dr Buck and Dr Metcalf are expanding their sampling deeper into the Nevada desert trying to build a better map of the hazardous regions We live here Our children are here Dr Buck said We want very much to get this right  And they are approaching their discovery with personal caution They now wear protective gear while sampling and Dr Buck has decided against taking her graduate students out for what appears to be risky fieldwork  On a larger scale researchers are investigating alternatives to creating large forbidden zones such as wetting down roads or requiring that people in highexposure areas wear protective masks and gear But even small measures like bathing after exposure and washing contaminated clothing separately may help Dr Weis said  We can be smart and efficient about this both at the government and at the personal level he said
