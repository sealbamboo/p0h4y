Women may be having virgin births every day in the United States according to new research published Tuesday Startled researchers found that about  of one percent of teens and young women interviewed as part of a larger survey reported they had given birth without ever having had sex We thought This cant be right We must have done something incorrectly says Amy Herring a biostatician at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who led the study Her team was looking at data for  women interviewed multiple times over  years from their teen years to adulthood as part of the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health About  consistently stuck to a timeline that showed they had given birth before they ever had sex Herring thought it was an important issue but also thought it might work for the BMJ formerly British Medical Journal Christmas issue which publishes tongueincheek medical studies We also thought it fit nicely with the Christmas theme Herring told NBC News Virgin birth is not unknown in nature Its known as   and its been documented in     and    But science has never demonstrated a human case of parthenogenesis Herring thinks it may all be a mistake Its selfreported pregnancy she says And the survey given by computer so the women and girls would feel free to answer questions honestly didnt follow up and ask them Are you sure if they reported having had a baby yet not ever having had sex Social pressure could have made the women reluctant to admit they had sex before a certain age or it could be they were confused about where babies come from Herring says About a third of the women who reported giving birth before they had sex for the first time said they had signed a virginity pledge compared to  percent of all women who had babies Parents were asked questions about how often they talked with their child about sex Herring adds Those whose daughters reported virgin births were more likely to say sex was a difficult subject for them More of the women who had virgin pregnancies gave birth to boys than girls   percent versus  percent Herring isnt sure what that might mean Could the girls have been mistaken about what counts as sex I think thats possible Herring says I think that lots of people dont know that the withdrawal method is subject to more failures than other birth control methods She points to a Canadian study that showed  percent of those students interviewed did not think that intercourse ending in orgasm counted as sex Then there were the virgin fathers Yes there were a few on the survey Herring isnt quite sure what to say about them
