When word spread through Sierra Leones capital that Dr Martin Salia had died this morning a throng of patients and colleagues rushed to the gate of one of the hospitals where he had worked to find out if it was really true People were crying people were wailing they were shouting Some of the staff who came around were rolling on the ground says Leonard Gbloh administrator of Freetowns Kissy United Methodist Hospital who witnessed the scene Were in a state of shock We are really mourning the death of a great hero In a country with precious few doctors  there were only  physicians to serve a population of  million before Ebola hit and the disease has already claimed five of them  Salias death is being met with dismay and disbelief The shock has been all the greater because of reports that Salia had been in relatively good condition before he left Sierra Leone for the University of Nebraska Medical Center where he arrived on Saturday The doctor was able to walk to the ambulance waiting to take him to the medevac plane says Dr Komba SonguMbriwa lead clinician at the Hastings Ebola Treatment Center in Freetown where Salia was initially cared for He climbed in without assistance and even carried his documentation papers He was pretty stable says SonguMbriwa There was also the perception that Salia who is a legal permanent resident of the US and whose wife and two children live in Maryland was en route to the best possible care When were talking effective treatment medical treatment we think the US comes first said Gbloh Cases that will go to the US we are always pretty sure that the patient is going to make it We thought that he was going to come back But the doctors who cared for Salia in Nebraska said that by the time his plane touched down on US soil after   hours in the air he was critically ill They said he had lost kidney function was working hard to breathe and was unresponsive He was treated with the experimental Ebola drug ZMapp and also received a blood plasma transfusion from an Ebola survivor The impact of Salias illness on Freetowns fragile health system has already been felt Salia was both the medical director of Kissy Hospital and the only fulltime doctor As the only person qualified to perform surgery he worked on cases ranging from appendicitis to difficult births there and at two other hospitals in the city At another of the facilities where Salia worked  Connaught Hospital  he often performed surgery for free Gbloh said it will be hard to replace him After Ebola hit surgery was suspended at Kissy Hospital Since Salias infection the hospital has as a precaution suspended even nonsurgical care for  days the incubation period for the virus Ebola is surging in Freetown and even health workers like Salia who work at regular hospitals rather than at Ebola treatment centers can unwittingly end up treating a patient who has the disease As far as his colleagues are aware he did not come in contact with a patient who had been diagnosed with Ebola yet patients he treated could have been infected That only underscores just how risky it is to practice medicine in Sierra Leone today
