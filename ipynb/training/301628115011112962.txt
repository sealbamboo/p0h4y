 Exercise coupled with healthy eating reduces body fat and preserves muscle better than diet alone, according to a study that used info from .  contestants.. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, analyzed the effects of daily strenuous exercise and a restricted diet by examining data from participants of . .. "By including the show's contestants as voluntary study participants, this research took advantage of a cost-efficient opportunity to study a small group of obese individuals already engaged in an intensive lifestyle intervention," said Kevin Hall, Ph.D., senior investigator . Researchers measured the body fat, total energy expenditure, and resting metabolic rate of each participant at the start of the program, at week 6, and at week 30.  Participants lost an average of 128 pounds, with about 82 percent of that coming from body fat and the rest from lean tissue, like muscle.. Because the TV show doesn’t directly address how exercise and diet separately contributed to the participants’ weight loss, Hall used a computer model of human metabolism to simulate the results of diet alone and exercise alone; he then estimated their relative contributions to overall weight loss.. Hall and his team found that diet alone led to 65 percent of the body-fat weight loss, and 35 percent of lean tissue weight loss. The model showed that exercise alone resulted in participants losing only fat and no muscle. The simulation of exercise alone also estimated a small increase in lean muscle mass despite overall weight loss, according to the release..  study was published online in the journal . .
