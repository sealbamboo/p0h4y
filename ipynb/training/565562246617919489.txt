Youve heard of antiinflammatory medications and antiinflammatory diets but do you really know what inflammation is In short its the bodys response to outside threats like stress infection or toxic chemicals When the immune system senses one of these dangers it responds by activating proteins meant to protect cells and tissues In a healthy situation inflammation serves as a good friend to our body says Mansour Mohamadzadeh PhD director of the Center for Inflammation and Mucosal Immunology at the University of Florida But if immune cells start to overreact that inflammation can be totally directed against us This type of harmful chronic inflammation can have a number of causes including a virus or bacteria an autoimmune disorder   or the way you   Here are a few ways it can affect your health both shortterm and long Inflammation is most visible and most beneficial when its helping to repair a wound or   Youve noticed your bodys inflammatory response if youve ever had a fever or a sore throat with swollen glands says Timothy Denning PhD associate professor and immunology researcher at Georgia State University or an infected cut thats become red and warm to the touch The swelling redness and warmth are signs that your immune system is sending white blood cells immune cellstimulating growth factors and nutrients to the affected areas In this sense inflammation is a healthy and necessary function for healing But this type of helpful inflammation is only temporary when the infection or illness is gone inflammation should go away as well Many of the bodys immune cells cluster around the intestines says Denning Most of the time those immune cells ignore the trillions of healthy bacteria that live in the gut But for some people that tolerance seems to be broken says Denning and their immune cells begin to react to the bacteria creating chronic inflammation

                  When immune cells begin to produce inflammation immune regulation becomes deteriorated and it creates an optimal environment for cancer cells to grow says Mohamadzadeh In a  study from Case Western Reserve University people who reported sleeping more or less than average had   in their blood than those who said they slept about  hours a night This research only established a correlation between the two and not a causeandeffect so the study authors say they cant be sure whether inflammation triggers long and short sleep duration or whether   triggers inflammation Its also possible that a different underlying issue like chronic stress or disease causes both Shift work has also been found to increase inflammation in the body Inflammation can also wreak havoc on your mouth in the form of periodontitis a chronic inflammation of the gums caused by bacteria accumulation This disease causes gums to recede and the skeletal structure around the teeth become weakened or damaged Brushing and flossing regularly can prevent periodontitis and one  Harvard University study found that eating   such as fish or fish oil may also help

                  Depression is a complex illness and we know that it takes more than one biological change to tip someone into an episode said Jeffrey Meyer MD senior author of the  study in a press release But we now believe that inflammation in the brain is one of these changes and thats an important step forward Treating depression with antiinflammatory medication may be one area of future research he added
