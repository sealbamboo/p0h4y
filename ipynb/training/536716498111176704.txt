BOSTON—Doctors at a prominent Boston hospital continued to use a surgical tool during hysterectomies for two years after compiling data in 2011 that questioned the safety of the device and discussing its risks, said hospital officials and doctors.. Brigham and Women’s Hospital curtailed use of the device, the laparoscopic power morcellator, in December 2013, acknowledging it had spread a dangerous cancer in two of its patients, one in 2012 and the other in 2013.
