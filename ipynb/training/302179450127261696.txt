When it comes to treating a lazy eye theres evidence that turning the lights off may help  if youre a kitten A   in the latest issue of   reports that kittens with a type of visual impairment known as   or lazy eye were able to regain normal eyesight after being plunged into total darkness for  days Amblyopia  found in  percent of humans  is a vision problem usually only affecting one eye in which the eye itself works but the connections between the eye and the brain are disrupted These connections fail to develop properly when the eye is deprived of normal visual input during early life For this study  amblyopia was induced in seven kittens by stitching one eyelid shut during a critical period for visual development  around  days after birth After one week the kittens eyes were reopened and as expected the kittens were unable to see out of one eye This technique called monocular deprivation has been used for over  years including for   research and does no lasting harm to the kittens eyes or eyelids Following monocular deprivation the halfblind kittens were then put in complete darkness for  days either immediately after having their eyes reopened or after waiting for five to eight weeks Remarkably after emerging from the darkness all seven kittens gradually regained their eyesight For the kittens that had been immediately plunged into the dark this took seven weeks But for the kittens whose darkness treatment was delayed complete sight was regained in just five to seven days We were just amazed by that Its quite remarkable says   associate professor of psychology at Dalhousie University and coauthor of the study Duffy and his colleague Donald Mitchell think that complete darkness somehow resets the brains visual system to an earlier more adaptable stage of development The researchers arent exactly sure why recovery was so much more rapid in the delayeddarkness group But why does it work at all Some of Duffy and Mitchells earlier research also published in the present paper may hold the answer to that question Long before these scientists started sticking blind kittens into dark rooms they were looking at a type of protein called neurofilaments which provide structural support for cells in the brain For neurons structure   function explains Duffy so neurofilaments are essentially what we need in order to have a functioning brain Duffy and Mitchells hypothesis was that since neurofilaments are known to act as rigid scaffolding in the brain these proteins might play a role in reducing neural plasticity with age And thats exactly what they found Looking at cat brains the researchers found that levels of neurofilaments in the visual cortex were related to age Young kittens whose brains were still in the critical stages of development had very low levels of neurofilaments Older cats had a lot more The difference suggests that neurofilament proteins play a role in reducing the ability of the brain to adapt and change as we get older Duffy and Mitchell then decided to look at the brains of dayold kittens that were kept in darkness for  to  days These kittens emerged from the dark with about half as many neurofilaments in their visual cortex as when they first went into the darkness Based on these findings the researchers reasoned that if exposure to darkness can release the visual system from the rigid structure imposed by neurofilaments then it might help animals with impaired vision recover And so they set out to test this hypothesis with their amblyopic kitten experiment which confirmed that total darkness really can restore vision in as little as a week Weve never seen anything like this says Duffy Were really optimistic that this might eventually end up translating to some human benefit Right now the most common way to treat amblyopia in human children is to patch the dominant eye in order to force the lazy eye to get stronger However patching can have side effects including losing depth perception and causing the previously dominant eye to become weaker Immersion in darkness could prove to be a less complicated alternative to patching Duffy cautions that we shouldnt start throwing children into the dark just yet There are still many issues to iron out before an approach like this could be tried in humans How much darkness is necessary How many days are required for it to be beneficial And how long would it take to recover Clinicians will want to know the answers to these questions before they consider it acknowledges Duffy At this stage I think its really premature
