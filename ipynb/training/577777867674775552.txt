Its become almost hohum to read a menu that lists precisely where the apples were picked or how the cow was raised So whats the next wave in sourcing Its already upon us People are becoming as picky about what goes on their skin as what goes in their bodies and they are looking to the woods or the sea for treatment As recently as four years ago the prevailing attitude was that natural beauty didnt work says Romain Gaillard an owner of the Detox Market an apothecary shop near the Beverly Center Now its a completely different thing What had to happen was that the premium market had to turn natural That whiff of patchouli that many of us associate with all things natural is gone and much of todays packaging evokes luxury The label showing elegant plants and birds on Osmia Organics products for example is not as Gaillard put it anything like the homespun packages of potions and bars that once were found in the back of the healthfood store near the potatoes But its the ingredients that are key M Caf a popular microbiotic dining chain sells its own brand of hand polish made with ingredients that could show up in our food salt and oils from safflower sunflower vitamin E grapefruit and geranium The vegan glutenfree soaps from the Chatsworthbased company Saavy could be used as toothpaste  though owners Hugo and Debra Saavedra admit they might not taste terrific What you put on your skin you should be able to eat Hugo Saavedra said His companys mangopapaya soap for example contains jojoba almond oils and beet powder People want natural and organic They feel like if they can eat it it can be on their skin said Paula WeiserVazquez owner of Beautyhabit a highend apothecary in Westlake Village I think this is the new trend Its not going to be a flash in the pan

Villafranco who spent  years as an emergencyroom doctor before leaving the profession to launch Osmia Organics in  Several entrepreneurs give advice that we often hear about food Beware of a product if the ingredient list includes items you cant pronounce Villafrancos website lists ingredients to avoid and of course theyre not in her products including synthetic fragrances parabens and phthalates because of concerns about potential hormonal or endocrine system side effects and petroleumbased ingredients because they could block pores and because decreasing dependence on the petroleum industry would be good for this planet Consumers seem motivated by a desire to support a farmtoface ethos and by the belief that pure products are more healthful and less likely to cause problems Such natural products accounted for almost  of  billion in prestige skin care sales from department stores and shops like Sephora this year said Karen Grant the global industry analyst for beauty products at the market research firm NPD That doesnt account for products in boutiques drugstores and other outlets Transparency Market Research said the global market for organic personalcare products neared  billion in  and is the fastestgrowing sector of personal care products Theres been a tremendous interest in herbalism at the Echo Park boutique Otherwild says owner Rachel Berks Indeed on one recent

returning to those ideas says Sarah Buscho who with Marina Storm owns the San Francisco skincare company Earth Tu Face and came to LA to teach the class Wed go to friends houses and thered be all this

buckthorn In Fiore a San Francisco company uses certified organic oils and infusions including coldpressed grape seed oil that is verified to contain no genetically modified organisms The products of
