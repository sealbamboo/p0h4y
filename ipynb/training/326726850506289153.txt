Bolstered by a recent study that found doctors performing hysterectomies performed using a pricey robot didnt produce better results for patients than ordinary  and cheaper  procedures the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently threw down a latex gauntlet against the use of robots There is no good data proving that robotic hysterectomy is even as good aslet alone betterthan existing and far less costly minimally invasive alternatives said a   by ACOG President James T Breeden One in nine women will undergo a hysterectomy during her lifetime making it one of the most common surgical procedures for women In recent years more women have opted for a robotassisted procedure rather than surgery through a large abdominal incision or traditional laparoscopic surgery in which a doctor manipulates surgical instruments through small incisions in the abdomen A   in February in   the   and reports of problems have raised questions about robotic surgery The Food and Drug Administration   at the popular DaVinci robot system Health insurers   just as they would any other surgical procedure and for patients outofpocket costs are typically the same as they would be for other options Robotassisted hysterectomy surgery is similar to the conventional laparascopic technique But the procedure is performed by a surgeon sitting at a console some distance from the operating table who uses hand and foot controls to manipulate surgical tools that are attached to a robots arms Proponents of robotassisted surgery say that it can be a good minimally invasive option when surgeries are complex and can result in less blood loss pain and a quicker return to normal life than traditional open surgery But its also more costly The   study of more than  hysterectomy patients found that the median hospital cost for robotassisted surgery was  compared with  for a laparoscopic hysterectomy It also found that although patients who got robotic hysterectomy were less likely than laparoscopic patients to be hospitalized for more than two days there was no significant difference between the two groups on other measures such as complications and blood transfusion rates When hospitals have a robot use of the  millionplus metal assistant tends to rise rapidly The   study found that between  and  robotically assisted hysterectomy grew from  percent to  percent overall But the growth was even faster when looking at numbers from just those hospitals with the robots The researchers said robotic surgeries accounted for  percent of all hysterectomies at those hospitals three years after the robot arrived As a tool robotic surgery helps surgeons overcome the limitations of traditional minimally invasive surgical techniques to provide patients with a less invasive option and prevent the downstream costs and complications of an open procedure says Angela Wonson a spokeswoman for Intuitive Surgical the manufacturer of the da Vinci system Women who have already had multiple abdominal procedures or those with larger uteruses anything that might make the surgery technically difficult may be good candidates for robotic hysterectomies says Jason Wright an assistant professor of womens health at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and the lead author of the study Wright uses a robot to perform some gynecologic procedures But the choice isnt always obvious One of the things we struggle most with is to figure out which patient will benefit most with robotic surgery he says
