When Penelope Chaney met up with her friend Eleanor Marshall she had good news to share  she was pregnant But Eleanor also had good news she was pregnant too And amazingly both had been given the same predicted delivery date   April So what are the chances of both giving birth on the same day In the UK where Chaney and Marshall live a womans estimated date of delivery is first calculated by using the date of her last period and adding  days or  weeks That is followed by an ultrasound scan where another estimate is made based on the size of the foetus If the two due dates differ by a week or more the scan is taken as the more accurate measure Its the same in most developed countries But data from the Perinatal Institute a nonprofit organisation shows that an estimated date of delivery is rarely accurate  in fact a baby is born on its predicted due date just  of the time  The figure is higher when premature births and pregnancies with complications are not included but only marginally  While it may be helpful for parents to get an idea of when their child will arrive the main purpose of the due date is to define a metric for the care of the mother during pregnancy says Prof Jason Gardosi of the Perinatal Institute So for example to interpret early pregnancy blood tests for the risk for example of congenital anomalies its important to know how far gone the pregnancy is The advice to the expectant mother he says is that the baby is likely to come any time between  weeks  days and  weeks  days a period referred to as term when the baby has reached full maturity Gardosi says For women like Penelope and Eleanor whose pregnancies are straightforward and low risk  of babies are born within a week either side of the estimated date of delivery More than  are born two weeks either side of the predicted date But as noted above only  or  ignoring pregnancies with complications etc are born on the predicted date itself  in other words the chance of this happening is less than one in  What then are the chances of Penelopes and Eleanors babies both being born on  April  Only  of  or  Thats a probability of one in   The chance that their children will be born on the same day  any day not necessarily  April  is higher Its about one in  Gardosi says the statistics reveal an important message for pregnant women The phrase due date is misleading That makes it sound too accurate he says  it should really be called an estimated date Many mothers are unnecessarily anxious or impatient if theres too much reliance on the expected date of delivery Gardosi says We really need to explain to them that this is just a date which helps us to determine the other milestones in pregnancy
