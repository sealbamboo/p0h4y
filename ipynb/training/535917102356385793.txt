I stood on the foot platform overlooking the lake of fluorescent green muck  wet tired freezing miserable and scared out of my mind  when I suddenly began a conversation with my yearold self Youre still me Little Roy said Yes you feel and look like an old brokendown middleaged man right now Your body is all cutup and bruised Youre so pathetically cold that youre turning blue  and shaking like a yearold holding a cup of coffee teeth chattering and everything Worst of all youre intimidated  you want to go back down that ladder dont you But remember that time we swung off a rope into a lake on our camping trip in the Sierras with Dad in  How Huckleberry Finn that was Well that adventurous spirit is still in you I am still in you And with that I grabbed the bar and swung out  feet into the middle of that forbidding pond let go arced gracefully in the air splashed down and swam to the shore to the cheers of my teammates mostly a couple of decades my junior I was so relieved and happy and grateful I didnt know at the time that I would feel the effects of this race for several weeks afterward more on this later For the moment Id gotten back in touch with a part of my old  rather young  self Id done a Tough Mudder a couple of years before Its one of the top brands among the immensely popular obstaclemud races sweeping the country A half million people in the US did a Tough Mudder last year they claim paying from  to  for the right to run  miles and conquer a bunch of challenging oddball obstacles along the way But this event held earlier this month on the shores of Vail Lake near Temecula was free  and special It was a beta test About  Mudders from veterans of  or more races to a few firsttimers came to be lab rats for experimental obstacles that management is considering for  such as the aforementioned Swinger When the day was done we became the focus group What new events should make the cut What about Birth Canal crawling  feet under a plastic sheet sagging with the weight of hundreds of pounds of water Claustrophobic nightmare  take it or leave it one person said Three challenges got thumbsup for being good team builders Hold Your Wood teams of  carry foot logs over and through wooden walls the Hangover an inverted foot wooden wall you had to climb over and Pyramid Scheme a slippery steepangled wall that required you to form people into a human ladder and crawl up them Then there was the Ring Thing hanging from an Aframe structure and moving across it by looping gymnastics rings over pegs Great physical challenge  takes more coordination than strength was the consensus There were altered versions of old favorites like Double Arctic Enema in which you must swim underwater not once but twice through a deep bath of icepacked water and Electric Slide which mates a giant slide with the electric wires that deliver unpleasant shocks I hate it  unnecessarily dangerous The verdict Yes to the icewater swim and no to the Slide Interestingly do you know what the group liked most of all Not necessarily the new tricks but the greatly improved camaraderie That might sound strange to the average Tough Mudder People normally do these races with a spouse or a few friends and momentarily team up with strangers when they need help getting over a wall Thats part of the magic says Tough Mudder founder and Chief Executive Will Dean He designed his event in his Harvard Business School thesis to be the antitriathlon  an emotional experience that you share for a lifetime with your closest friends  some of whom you might meet here Thats why Tough Mudders arent timed like the other mudrace behemoths such as Spartan Race and Warrior Dash The longer youre together thinks Dean the better But this day proved something Dean hadnt thought of When it comes to emotional bonding bigger can be better too Heres why For the beta test we were set up in groups of  to  people We all needed one anothers help  me in particular to make it over the slick foot Half Pipe ramp on my exhausting fourth try By the end of the day getting highfives from people Id spent all day with and probably would never see again was pretty special Having a bigger team was the reason why almost all of my teammates said that theyd enjoyed this event more than any other Tough Mudder theyd done For me the team should have been one bigger I looked with envy at Lavar Palmer  a San Diego contractor who did the race with his yearold son Jacob and thought of my own son Joey  my partner in my first Tough Mudder Joey had stayed out late at a Halloween party the night before and refused to get up But that gave me the space to have my epiphany about rediscovering the kid inside Ironically I can do stuff today on a bike in a pool or at the gym that would have blown my yearold mind I work out nearly every day  except for the week after the Tough Mudder Beta Test By the following Tuesday my left leg had swelled up to double its normal size and was turning bright red from knee to ankle and I was sneezing and coughing so much that I could barely type or talk on the phone My doctor was so alarmed by the the nasty bacteria that apparently had entered my bangedup knee that he implored me to go to the emergency room if the redness began spreading toward my crotch Fortunately a pile of antibiotics prevented that It turned out to be  bacteria Be forewarned Crawling through muck is inherently risky and a quick Google search showed dozens of infections after various mudobstacle events Theres always a risk when youre comingling with a lot of people tired and bruised and crawling and running through mud  face it bacteria is everywhere Tough Mudders Dean told me a couple of weeks later But since  million people have done this and only a handful have gotten anything percentagewise the risk is very low If you look at it statistically theres a higher incidence of getting sick from going to a restaurant I will cherish my personalized Tough Mudder beta testers bib the camaraderie and the youthful spirit I rediscovered that day And I definitely have a deeper appreciation for the casual twohour mountain bike rides I do with my middleaged buddies on the weekend
