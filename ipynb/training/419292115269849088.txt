Saturday is World Braille Day commemorating the birth of Frenchman Louis Braille who was blinded in an accident when he was a toddler Undeterred he became a brilliant student but was frustrated that he couldnt read or write In school he learned about a system of dots used by soldiers to communicate at night Braille adapted that system into something that would transform the lives of the blind and visually impaired Almost  years later Braille hasnt changed so much But with the advent of computer screens tablets smartphones and ereaders the way we read things has Judy Dixon with the Library of Congress National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped speaks with NPRs Audie Cornish about the ways technology has changed Braille reading over the past few decades I started reading Braille when I was in the first grade at the school for the blind in Florida When I first started reading Braille all we had was Braille on paper  I read the typical schoolbooks that other kids in the class were reading  The Braille technology really started taking off in the early s with the development of devices that we call refreshable Braille displays and theyre small boxes of different sizes  This device thats in front of me I have connected to an iPhone and I have the app   which is an app that was developed by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped to read our Braille and audio books And these devices have Braille cells  Braille is made of six dots each dot of the Braille cell raises and lowers so that if I wanted to read the letter A which is Dot  the upper left of the Braille cell  the pin for that dot would raise and all the other pins would not raise  I feel now that I can read almost anything thats published in one way or another between my iPhone my Kindle The other kinds of Braille displays also can be connected to computers so any book or document that can be read on a computer can be read with a Braille display The major drawback of refreshable Braille devices is that they are expensive These devices are in the thousands of dollars So a smaller version like this cell unit that I have here would be about  Larger units a cell would be in the neighborhood of  to  and the prices go up So these prices are somewhat prohibitive for many people If a way of making Braille cells can be found that uses a mainstream technology that was in many many devices and was pennies per unit then Braille devices could be made for perhaps a few hundred dollars and could be affordable by all Braille readers Its hard to imagine what will come along that could replace Braille for us Audio is a linear experience  the words come they go But with Braille I can see the word I can see how its spelled I can see how the punctuation is I dont have to wonder if a word has one T or two Ts It just is something I observe when I read a Braille word under my fingers  I personally am kind of a visual learner  I dont take things in well with audio If I see it in Braille I remember it because it goes into my visual memory
