Tim Armstrong has had to   now for his  year saying the company was changing its k retirement plan policy in part because it had some hefty health care claims including two babies costing a million dollars each for care Experts say he may also have something else to apologize for  not knowing what he was talking about No company the size of AOL should be strapped by having to pay for the medical care of two distressed newborns And while it might have once been a problem for smaller employers they say the issue shows how the new health care law might provide some relief going forward We had two AOLers that had distressed babies that were born that we paid a million dollars each to make sure those babies were OK in general And those are the things that add up into our benefits cost Armstrong pictured above said last week The mother of one of the babies Deanna Fei told NBC News that her prematurely born child was one of the costly newborns and said Armstrongs remarks made her feel like she and her family were   of health care benefits Armstrong later  to Fei and he also reversed his controversial decision on the ks Dr Steffie Woolhandler cofounder of Physicians for a National Health Program says it never should have been an issue in the first place A company as big as AOL ought to be able to do this so it is a little confusing why they would be so flummoxed a by a couple of milliondollar babies she said A milliondollar baby is not that unusual added Woolhandler  citing the enormous costs of US health care in general and of keeping a child in a neonatal intensive care unit And several experts pointed out even if AOL is selfinsured and pays its employee health costs directly any sensible company has whats called a stoploss health insurance policy that would pay out once expenses reached a certain point Some workers may worry that they may be targeted by their employers if they start running up health costs But its unlikely for several reasons including two laws that protect workers the Employee Retirement Income Security Act known widely as ERISA and well as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act or HIPAA HIPAA means Armstrong almost certainly did not know the specific details of the two cases says Jennifer Rathburn a health care expert at Quarles and Brady LLP a Milwaukee law firm There is a separation between the health plan and the employer she said Employers who are selfinsured must use a thirdparty administrator usually a major insurance company to handle the details of the coverage and these administrators can pass along only aggregated information on the costs Large employers dont get claims data on a per person basis It is very hard to discriminate against a specific person agreed Paul Fronstin a senior research associate with the Employee Benefit Research Institute This could be different at a small firm where the boss very likely knows all of the workers personally But ERISA makes it illegal to fire someone for making use of their benefits and the National Federation of Independent Business which represents small businesses   against trying it Smaller employers do worry about the possibility of being driven out of business by high employee costs says Alden Bianchi an employee benefits expert at Bostonbased law firm Mintz Levin Every few months you get a call from a selffunded plan asking about an employee with a rare condition Bianchi said The claim poses a threat to the companys existence They might offer the employee a bigger paycheck on the understanding he will refuse the companysponsored insurance and go buy some on the new Obamacare exchanges instead Bianchi said My fear here is that this will happen and the exchanges will become dumping grounds for bad risks Bianchi said The other argument is that the exchanges could be the answer for small employers   theyll be able to send their employees there if they want and the Obama administration argues workers will have better choices there than the one or two policies typically offered by an employer
