Scientists  and anyone who lives with a canine  know that dogs pay close attention to the emotion in our voices They listen for whether our tone is friendly or mean how the pitch goes up or down and even the rhythms in our speech But what about the meaning of the words we say Sure a few studies have reported on supersmart dogs that know   of words Chaser a border collie in South Carolina even learned  nouns and commands to go with them But otherwise theres little evidence that dogs differentiate between speech with meaningful words and sounds that contain only inflections says neurobiologist   at the MTAELTE Comparative Ethology Research Group in Budapest We know quite a bit about how much dogs get about   we say things Andics says but we know quite little about how much dogs get about   we say to them Thats about to change Psychologists   Wednesday in the journal   that dogs do pay attention to the meanings of words And they process that information in a different part of the brain from where they process emotional cues in speech To figure that out graduate student   at the University of Sussex in England set up a clever experiment She brought  dogs into the lab And then for each one Ratcliffe put a speaker on either side of the dogs head Then she played the command to come out of both speakers at the same time At first the command sounded normal It had both meaningful words and emotional cues in it Then Ratcliffe started to manipulate the speech in the command In some instances she removed all of the inflections in the speakers voice In other instances she kept the inflections in the speakers voice but removed the words or replaced the words with gibberish For each command Ratcliffe recorded which way the dogs turned their heads  toward the left speaker or toward the right speaker Even though both speakers were playing the same sounds a clear pattern emerged When the dogs heard commands that still had meaningful words in them about  percent of the animals turned to the right When they heard commands with just emotional cues in them most dogs turned to the left That result sounds simple But Andics who wasnt involved in the study says the findings show something surprising that dogs are able to differentiate between meaningful and meaningless sound sequences The study also suggests that a dogs brain breaks up speech into two parts the emotional cues and the meaning of the words Then it processes these two components on opposite sides of the brain emotional cues on the right meaning of words on the left Yes its opposite to the way the dogs turned Thats a bit similar to how we humans process speech We also break up speech into several parts such as the meaning of the words clues about the speaker and emotional cues But with humans its trickier Andics says We believe the human brain processes various aspects of human speech in different stages and in many different parts of the brain Still though Andics says the new study offers one way that people may be able to communicate better with their best friends Pick the ear you use carefully Tell all the emotional things to the dog in his left ear Andics says For commands that you want a dog to get clearly and precisely tell them in right ear
