This is very bad This is horrible said Dr Buddy Creech a pediatric infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University who was on a telephone briefing with the CDC Thursday morning The complications of measles are not to be toyed with and theyre not altogether rare  According to the CDC one to three out of every  children in the United States who get measles will die from the disease even with the best of care Even if complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis arent deadly they can make children very sick in  nearly  of children under the age of  who got measles had to be treated in the hospital  usually starts with a fever which can get very high followed by a cough runny nose and red eyes Soon a rash of tiny red spots will start at the head and spread to the rest of the body The rash can last a week and coughing can last for up to  days  Creech said hes concerned younger physicians might not be quick to recognize the signs of measles since there have been only pockets of the disease since   Many young pediatricians might not know what measles looks like he said  Among those who have been stricken with measles this year  were not vaccinated or had unknown vaccination status The largest outbreak was in New York where  people contracted measles in a community where many refuse to be vaccinated for religious reasons  Those who choose not to vaccinate put other peoples babies at risk since babies cannot be vaccinated until their first birthday and are therefore vulnerable to the disease  I hope that those who are vaccine hesitant or vaccine avoidant realize there are consequences to their actions Creech said None of us lives in isolation
