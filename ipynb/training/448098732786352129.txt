Sitting at the table that night over a martini my wife and I looked at each other and said Enough said Dr Richter a retired Stanford University professor and a Nobel laureate in physics The Richters moved into Vi at Palo Alto a continuing care retirement community in the summer of  So did Linda Cork who headed the comparative medicine department at Stanford Her mother had died of dementia and as she thought about her own future she wanted to know she had access to lifetime care without burdening her family A continuing care retirement community allows residents to move from independent living to assisted living or a nursing home all on the same campus as they need increasing help Buying into the complex represented a huge financial commitment but I thought Id done my due diligence Dr Cork said She had visited other communities hired a financial planner paid an estate lawyer to review the contract I kept telling my children Im doing this for you They said Thank you Among the  or so such communities across the country    and are rebounding after the recession stalled new construction  this complex is in many ways an outlier Continuing care retirement communities tend to be costly but the Vi at Palo Alto is exceptionally expensive Dr Corks onebedroom cost  and the Richters twobedroom with den  million residents also pay hefty monthly fees And although  percent of such communities are nonprofits often affiliated with religious groups the Palo Alto complex and its nine sister developments are part of a corporation that used to be known as Classic Residence by Hyatt This is different too Six residents including Dr Richter  and Dr Cork  have brought a  in Federal District Court in Northern California accusing Vi management of misrepresenting facts breaching their contracts failing its fiduciary duty and violating state laws and business codes The plaintiffs actually like the convenience and sociability of living at the Vi which has a long waiting list Dr Richter riffing on the wellworn phrase aging in place said he was aging in a better place And they agreed to high entrance fees some such retirement communities use a different model and   because by contract  percent to  percent of that amount would be refunded after they moved out or died and their apartments were resold The refund portion is what people view as their legacy to their children Dr Richter said So the plaintiffs were startled to learn as a tax appeal led them to scrutinize the balance sheets in  that Vi at Palo Alto had no reserve account earmarked for refunds They soon also learned that its parent company in Chicago   to which the Palo Alto complex had sent what the plaintiffs say is  million  assumed no liability for paying refunds to Palo Alto residents They began to question the financial stability of what was to be their final home We were owed all this money and all of a sudden we find out that the provider doesnt have it said Dr Richter chairman of the resident advisory council He was not mollified when management responded that Vi had never defaulted on a refund After the meltdown with the banks were supposed to trust you Dr Richter said After a mediation attempt failed the residents filed suit last month If the court certifies Vi residents as a class it could take two years for the case to reach conclusion said Niall McCarthy the plaintiffs lawyer Though their suit covers several matters concern over eventual refunds is at heart of the battle In their complaint the plaintiffs call the transfer of money from the local provider to its Chicago parent company upstreaming Management calls it standard business practice Entrance fee repayments come not from a reserve but from the eventual resale of an apartment after a resident moves out or dies said Paul Gordon a lawyer for Vi Once I pay someone I cant tell them what to do with it afterwards he said Its their money The payments are going to be made Mr Gordon said The rest is eligible for distribution as a return on investment  ie as profit Thats a different arrangement from what residents believe they signed up for Because the Chicago company has not assumed the debt owed for eventual refunds residents lost all the security and peace of mind they had paid for Mr McCarthy said But most continuing care retirement communities dont have such reserves said Steve Maag director of residential communities for Leading Age the industry group for nonprofit service providers for the elderly Most contracts dont create any right to any specific pot of money or any reserve he said Since most apartments dont turn over as its delicately put every year theres no need to have  percent of the cash needed for refunds on hand he added Should prospective residents worry about their refunds During  and  the recession caused six to eight bankruptcies among continuing care retirement communities and restructuring in others Mr Maag said  When retirees  couldnt sell their homes to finance their entry fees and their retirement accounts shrank the complexes struggled  At a nonprofit complex near Pittsburgh residents filed a class action suit over entrance fee refunds and won a settlement A resident lawsuit against another Vi complex in La Jolla Calif was settled in  and one is pending against a nonprofit in Portland Ore Though Mr Maag pointed out that many retirement communities haveÂ  decadeslong histories of paying refunds new complexes involve some small assumption of risk by the residents he acknowledged The number of communities that have declared bankruptcy or generated lawsuits is indeed quite small But with the financial recovery has come an uptick in development Mr Maag projected  to  new complexes would open annually for the next four to six years A group called the National Continuing Care Residents Association is working on model legislation to protect residents investments and ways to help them evaluate complexes finances Ill say more about its efforts in a future post Meanwhile its wise to remember the title of one Government Accountability Office report in  Continuing Care Retirement Communities Can Provide Benefits but Not Without Some Risk
