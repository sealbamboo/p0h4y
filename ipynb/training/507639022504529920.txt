I can remember the early days of having schizophrenia I was so afraid of the implications of subtle body language like a lingering millisecond of eye contact the way my feet hit the ground when I walked or the way I held my hands to my side It was a struggle to go into a store or really anywhere I was bound to see another living member of the human species With a simple scratch of the head someone could be telling me to go forward or that what I was doing was right or wrong or that they were acknowledging the symbolic crown on my head that made me a king or a prophet Its not hard to imagine that I was having a tough time in the midst of all the anxiety and delusions Several months after my diagnosis I took a job at a small town newspaper as a reporter I sat in on City Council meetings covering issues related to the lowering water table and interviewing local business owners for small blurbs in the local section all the while wondering if I was uncovering some vague connections to an international conspiracy The nights were altogether different Every day I would come home to my apartment and smoke pot then lay on my couch watching television or head out to the bar and get so hammered that I couldnt walk Its hard to admit but the only time I felt relaxed was when I was drunk I eventually lost my newspaper job but that wasnt the catalyst for change It all came to a head one night in July I had been out drinking all night and in a haze I decided it would be a good idea to drive the two miles back to my apartment This is something I had done several times before but it had never dawned on me that it was a serious deal I thought I was doing well not swerving and being only several blocks from my house when I saw flashing lights behind me What started as a trip to the bar to unwind ended with me calling my parents to bail me out of jail at  am The next year of my life would mean change Im not entirely clear on the exact point at which my routine drinking and drug use turned into healthier pursuits Maybe it was the shock of meeting with a DUI lawyer or the point after sentencing when I realized Id be forced to make a daily call first thing in the morning to find out if I would have to pee in a cup that day Maybe it was the fact that Id need someone else mainly my mom to drive me anywhere for the next year Or perhaps it was the consistent Saturday morning drug and alcohol therapy group or Wednesday and Thursday afternoons of community service that kicked me into a groove The groove of it eventually turned into a routine one that wasnt marked by indulgence but instead by forced commitment that eventually I would grow to respect During that time I quit smoking pot I quit drinking and I got some of the best sleep Id gotten since my diagnosis Trips to the bar on Monday afternoons turned into extended hours at coffee shops where I finished my first novel For some reason it gave me joy to recite my routine to whoever asked I would wake up at  get coffee and a bagel with plain cream cheese check Facebook write until I had  words get lunch do errands in the afternoon return home get dinner take my pills with food watch TV and get to bed around  It might all sound tremendously boring But this regimented series of events was always there theyd always carry over And with time it gave me great comfort to not have to deal with the unexpected I had a set plan for most days and there was already too much chaos in my head I found that I never forgot to take my medicine I always had at least eight hours of sleep And I felt much more relaxed and was able to finally wrap my head around my diagnosis I began to see the world as a mostly random series of events rather than an overarching conspiracy plot The healthy routine was integral My story as with so many stories of recovery isnt over The biggest things in my life are now my friends and family my work and my daily routine I take my meds faithfully and although I no longer attend regular therapy sessions I find eight years of living with schizophrenia has made me well equipped to deal with future problems I still get up early do my work for the day hang out with my mom or my friends in the afternoon and then ease into the evening Most important I still get to bed by  every night Im more stable much healthier and Im happy The routine of things set a stable foundation for recovery by providing me with familiarity That familiarity was more than welcome when my mind was unrecognizable Michael Hedrick is a writer in Boulder Colo He blogs at   and his book Connections is available atÂ
