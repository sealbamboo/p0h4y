 Former New York Giants linebacker and NFL Hall of Fame member Harry Carson remembers the dark days of feeling hopeless and even suicidal It was long before   dominated the news  It was before people thought much about how repetitive head injuries would affect the mental health of football players  It was a time when athletes could not admit freely that they did just did not feel right But a study released by the Academy of Neurology confirms that retired football players who have had concussions can be prone to depression Midway through my career with the Giants I realized I would have these dark periods where I would feel a sense of depression envelope me Carson says his tone softspoken and kind a far cry from the aggression he was known for on the field Carsons depression didnt really make sense to him at the time  As the indestructible inside linebacker for the New York Giants he was a star athlete and an iconinthemaking  He served as team captain for  of his  seasons  and helped the Giants defeat the Denver Broncos and win Super Bowl XXI in  Still back then he could not seem to stabilize his mood or feel happy Id be sad for no reason and I couldnt really share it with people If I was to tell someone Im depressed then the next words out of their mouth would be Why would you be depressed Youre a pro football player and youre making gobs of money and got all this fame and what do you have to be depressed about So I kept to myself then I realized there were times where Id get really low Depression got a hold of him so strongly that he thought of driving himself off a bridge  I was driving across the Tappan Zee Bridge every day to practice at Giants Stadium he recalls There were one or two times when I had this thought of accelerating as I got on the bridge and just sort of going through the guard rail Thoughts of his baby daughter kept him from acting on the impulse to harm himself Soon he would find ways to rise above his depression turning to inspirational books and trying to make his life as positive and active as possible By  he had a diagnosis  PostConcussion Syndrome Symptoms include depression as well as anxiety irritability mood swings change in personality anger impulsiveness and loss of judgment Carson says he had all those and more Athletes often refer to their   as dings  Back in Carsons day if you werent knocked out you got up and got back into the game  He estimates he had between  and  dings in his career He has no doubt that his depression and other symptoms are direct damage from playing football  And as a defensive player he reflects I was also the one giving those concussions out Carson has been speaking out publicly on   for many years He considers it his way to bring awareness to what was once a hidden subject and to give other players who are dealing with these challenges a voice He is glad to see the ways in which science is catching up to explain the   The Academy of Neurology study released today confirmed the correlation between concussion and depression in   Headed by researcher Nyaz Didehbani PhD of The Center for Brain Health at the University of Texas at Dallas the sample group included  retired athletes who had experienced between one and  concussions They ranged from  to yearsold the average age being  Together they represented  teams in the NFL The group received standard psychological testing for depression and a full neuropsychological battery Of the  players in the sample group  had mild to moderate symptoms of depression  Didehbani says that many of the participants agreed to partake because they wanted to know what was going on of them The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are  to  million sports injuries each year and it is known that cognitive problems and mood disorders can result from sports concussions and other traumas However according to the American Academy of Neurology there has been very little research into the enduring effects of injuries and depression and other symptoms that may emerge long after a player has hung up his   and shoulder pads Most of these guys did not realize their symptoms were related to depression  loss of energy loss of appetite change in sleep habits Didehbani says They thought it was related to being athletes This group will also be followed longitudinally and they are currently in year two This way the researchers will be able to monitor their progress and their challenges as they age  We are raising the awareness that men do not have to fear the diagnosis says Didehbani Its treatable  if they get help This study and two others from the American Academy of Neurology was released within a week of the findings of the autopsy examination of Junior Seau that determined he suffered from Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy It may seem like a sudden burst of   but Carson says the positive part in all this is that people are beginning to take notice in a different way These stories have been around but had it not been for Junior Seau committing suicide this story would have been hushhush because they just looked at as football players who squandered their money and took their own lives says Carson who was inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame in  This is a subject whose time has come There are probably   and those with other neurological diseases or conditions Nobody really paid attention because once a guy dies hes gone The suicide of Junior a guy who was so youthful and vibrant  with such a great smile  opens the eyes of people and gets people to stop and think of whats really going on
