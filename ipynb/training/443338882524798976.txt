A new study suggests obesity in adolescent girls is associated with lower academic results during their teenage years  Researchers from four universities including Strathclyde and Dundee looked at data from  adolescent girls  They found that those classed as obese at the age of  achieved lower results over the next five years than peers of a healthy weight  The team said more research was needed to establish why this was the case  The joint study said to be the most comprehensive of its kind has been published in the International Journal of Obesity It was carried out by researchers at Strathclyde Dundee Georgia and Bristol universities  The results suggested that girls who were obese as measured by BMI body mass index at age  had lower academic attainment at   and  years when compared to those of a healthy weight  The study took into account possible mediating factors but found that these did not affect the overall results Attainment in the core subjects of English Maths and Science for obese girls was lower by an amount equivalent to a D instead of a C which was the average in the sample  Associations between obesity and academic attainment were less clear in boys John Reilly professor of physical activity and public health science at Strathclyde University and the lead investigator of the study said Further work is needed to understand why obesity is negatively related to academic attainment but it is clear that teenagers parents and policymakers in education and public health should be aware of the lifelong educational and economic impact of obesity Dr Josie Booth of the school of psychology at the University of Dundee said There is a clear pattern which shows that girls who are in the obese range are performing more poorly than their counterparts in the healthy weight range throughout their teenage years
