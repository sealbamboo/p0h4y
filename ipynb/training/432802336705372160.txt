If youve ever tried to drink something through one of those little red coffee stirrers instead of a fullsized straw you know what its like to breathe with asthma Twentyfive million Americans have been diagnosed with   And for  percent of them medications like inhaled corticosteroids and longacting beta agonists arent enough to keep them out of the hospital In  the FDA   bronchial thermoplasty the first nonpharmaceutical treatment for severe asthma People are starting to try it Virginia Rady is one of them Rady has had asthma since she was a toddler She tried to go away for college but after a bad flareup first semester she moved back home Shes now  but her lungs are like those of a yearold If something triggers her airways to twitch and close up it could be deadly That means avoiding everything from cats and dogs to exercise and stress If I were to get really emotional says Rady who lives outside Dallas with her husband I could actually trigger an asthma attack Inhaled drugs and other medications offer temporary relief for most asthma patients Bronchial thermoplasty on the other hand is intended to reduce asthma symptoms permanently So when Rady heard that bronchial thermoplasty that might help her decrease the number of pills she takes she was intrigued The procedure attacks the problem at its very root  the muscles in the lungs airways During an   muscle cells contract and restrict airflow To keep the muscles from constricting a catheter is used to deliver heated zaps of energy that essentially burn off the outer layer of smooth muscle cells That way theres less muscle to contract Studies of the procedure have not shown that it reduces airway hyperresponsiveness or the amount of air a person can exhale But it does seem to improve peoples quality of life One   found that patients who underwent the procedure which requires three sessions saw the number of asthma attacks drop by a third on average and emergency room visits decline by  percent They also lost far fewer days from work and school The study was funded by   the company that created bronchial thermoplasty and sells the machines We go into airways that are  millimeters or bigger says   a pulmonologist at Texas Health Presbyterian And were heating them up It doesnt get that hot  about as hot as a cup of coffee Weinstein has performed bronchial thermoplasty on more than twodozen patients including Rady Studies havent found major safety issues so far But   to figure out which patients might benefit how long the effect lasts and longterm safety The biggest drawback to bronchial thermoplasty seems to be the immediate response to the treatment which can temporarily make symptoms worse Its like shoving a stick at a hornets nest Rady says In the days afterwards youre wheezing Its not pleasant But for Rady and other patients when the symptoms caused by the treatment subside its lifechanging Rady has been waiting to have children until she can taper off her steroids Now that she has decreased her medications and is able to go outside and exercise regularly Rady says shes building up the stamina to be a mother Im up to  minutes on the elliptical and can walk a halfhour after Rady says I can actually do all of that without the inhaler And that to me is the awesome thing  not needing the drug Bronchial thermoplasty isnt a magic wand It doesnt cure severe asthma and it can be costly  treatment can run into the tens of thousands of dollars Many insurers   because they consider it an experimental treatment But in  Medicare agreed to   used in the treatment and other insurers may follow Rady did persuade her health insurance provider to cover the majority of the cost  she paid a total of  out of pocket  but says she was denied coverage at first I would think that anything they could do to keep me out of the hospital is worth it Rady says One of my hospital bills in high school was  So in my opinion if you can get this and avoid just one hospitalization it would more than pay for itself The procedure may be part of a move toward tailoring treatment based on the type of asthma a person has according to   an associate professor at Yale School of Medicine who has been researching bronchial thermoplasty for more than a decade Bronchial thermoplasty certainly has its place Michaud says I think we just need to understand more who it is right for
