I wore a hard plastic brace around my torso from ages  to  to treat   or   Bracing has been standard treatment in children for the past five decades and I wore my brace diligently if awkwardly in the hope that it would contain my Sshaped curvature and stave off the need for   surgery By the time I was  and fullgrown  and no longer considered at high risk for curve progression  my most prominent spinal curve had stabilized at  degrees Id narrowly escaped surgery and the complications that can accompany it My orthopedist told me my treatment was done Ive discovered in the years since that scoliosis is not something you endure and outgrow like   and puberty Significant curves often grow throughout adulthood and can cause deformity   pinched nerves herniated discs muscle spasms and reduced mobility and lung capacity Now at the ripe age of  I find myself with a degree upper curve a degree lower curve consistent pain  and no standard treatment to follow Some orthopedists have recommended surgery others have suggested conventional   None can say whether either protocol will eliminate pain and until recently these were my only options Now there may be another an   regimen called   Developed in the s in Germany by   the technique is a standard treatment for scoliosis in children and adults in several European countries The therapy tailored to each patients curves focuses on halting curve progression reducing pain and improving posture strength and lung function The exercises include stretching strengthening and breathing techniques that counteract the rotation of spinal curvatures Patients are supposed to do them at home and incorporate postural corrections into their daily lives  from abroad have found that the Schroth method and variations of it improved patient outcomes and reduced the need for surgery in people of all ages In one study patients who didnt do Schroth exercises saw their spinal curves   more than those of patients who did practice the exercises In another study  Schroth patients   to expand their chests to breathe by an average of  percent None of these studies were large randomized controlled trials and the   which influences guidelines for care in the United States does not officially recognize physical therapy as a treatment option But the mindset of the American scoliosis practitioner is shifting said Dr Michael Mendelow an orthopedic spinal surgeon at   in Greenville SC Boston Childrens Hospital and Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan are among the healthcare institutions that now have Schroth therapists Insurers are starting to cover the treatment and the braces favored by Schroth experts and certified practices have popped up across the country Teaching centers such as Columbia University and Morgan Stanley Childrens Hospital of NewYorkPresbyterian are sponsoring Schrothrelated conferences If you look critically at the body of literature there is evidence that when properly done in the right situation with the right therapist and the right patient Schroth can change the chance of curve progression said Dr Michael Vitale chief of pediatric orthopedics at Morgan Stanley Childrens Hospital 
 Even the Scoliosis Research Society is taking a second look Were primarily using Schroth on people who are being braced  I think it will make bracing more successful said Dr M Timothy Hresko chairman of the research societys nonoperative committee and associate professor of orthopedic surgery at Harvard At the University of Alberta in Canada researchers recently completed a randomized pilot study of Schroth financed in part by the research society The sixmonth study showed that adolescents with scoliosis who did these exercises   with regard to curve progression pain and selfimage A larger multicenter randomized trial funded by the   and the   is now enrolling adolescents Many scoliosis patients in increasing discomfort arent waiting for new study results At age  Rachel Mulvaney of Mount Sinai NY went to   run by Beth Janssen a Schroth therapist in Stevens Point Wis Her degree curve was progressing and orthopedists had told her she needed surgery Within the first three days there I was out of pain for the first time in five years said Ms Mulvaney now  After eight months of Schroth exercises her curve decreased to  degrees and it has since dropped to  degrees  a reduction extremely rare in patients her age Her orthopedist Dr John J Labiak clinical assistant professor of orthopedic surgery and   at Stony Brook University said he was shocked and happily surprised by her progress He has begun recommending the method to other patients As for adults with scoliosis like me who are beyond bracing yet hoping to avoid surgery Schroth may be the last best chance We cant turn back time and change the progression of our curves but maybe this therapy can make carrying groceries a little less painful or breathing a little easier  for us and those who grow up after us
