A   is all the rage but dont confuse this healthful pattern of eating for what youre likely to be served in popular Italianstyle chains A new   from the Center for Science in the Public Interest finds some astronomical calorie counts at these restaurants Not to mention sodium Take for instance Maggianos calorie shrimp scampi pasta dish How did they get so many calories in there Its portion size and the pasta tossed with butter that explains it To your arteries and waistline this dish looks like three Big Macs the CSPI report says Or consider Olive Gardens calorie lasagna fritta yes that means fried which is served over alfredo sauce which has enough butter cream and Parmesan to supply you with  days of recommended saturated fat intake Meanwhile the center cut filet mignon at Olive Garden has about onethird the  calories in the chicken alfredo The serving size explains the big difference The filet mignon is small weighing in at  ounces But the shrimp scampi pasta dish In addition to the creamy sauce theres a generous heap of pasta And as weve   that many refined carbohydrates isnt doing your body any favors When CSPI first reviewed the menu option at Italianstyle chain restaurants about  years ago it concluded that fettuccine alfredo being served at popular chains was the equivalent of a heart attack on a plate Whats unfortunate in this new analysis of Italian food is that we found the food is getting fattier says Jayne Hurley at CSPI Theyre deep frying their lasagna Hurley says and theyre serving huge portions Now to be fair there are many lowercalorie options available The Olive Garden has a lighter Italian fare menu Our guests have told us theyre looking for more variety and betterforyou options Tara Gray of Olive Garden told us by email She points to an increasing number of options under  calories such as lasagna primavera with grilled chicken and herbgrilled salmon Romanos Macaroni Grill and Carrabbas Italian Grill also have menus that highlight options under  calories As for Maggianos spokeswoman Ashley Johnson says the portions are generous enough to share or to enjoy tomorrow at home In addition she says the chain will introduce  lighter take dishes such as chicken Parmesan which will have at least a third fewer calories Also she says the chain makes miniature versions of all of its classic desserts such as mini tiramisu at  calories and mini apple crostada at  calories Thats a drastic reduction in size and calories from the chains fullsize apple crostada dessert which has  calories and  teaspoons of sugar This largersize crostada is the equivalent to as the CSPI report points out five baked apple pies and a vanilla cone at McDonalds So why is it so easy to eat more than we intend to when we dine out Well until now theres been little transparency If customers wanted calorie information theyd have to look it up online But this is about to change The Affordable Care Act includes a provision that will require chain restaurants to post calories on menus The details are being finalized now by the Obama administration I think we are looking at full implementation of calorie posting on menus by spring  Margo Wootan of the CSPI told us by email Menu labeling is already in some cities including New York and Philadelphia and in California
