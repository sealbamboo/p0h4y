Resilience the subject of   reminds me of what a Supreme Court justice once said of pornography Its hard to define but we know it when we see it Weve all noticed resiliences effects havent we Most older people cope with several chronic diseases and have encountered losses and challenges Some seem to withdraw into isolation and inactivity even when they remain relatively strong Others respond more like the late Evelyn Nade whom I met in a New Jersey nursing home a few years ago She was  then a wheelchair user who couldnt rise from her bed without two aides using a mechanical hoist  yet she was the sunniest person in the place the president of the residents council the founder of a Red Hat Society chapter and a formidable poker player Age health and finances cant fully explain such disparities so social scientists are constantly exploring other factors that might play a role When I spoke with the new studys lead author Lydia Manning a gerontologist at Concordia University Chicago she took a stab at a simple definition of resilience How people manage adversity and hardship over the life course Often she said they talk about learning this trait this sense of themselves as people who can negotiate obstacles from tough experiences earlier in life Scientists have been writing and thinking about resilience for several decades Now in Dr Mannings study of  people average age almost  drawn from three waves of the national Health and Retirement Study were starting to measure it Dr Manning said  as squishy and fuzzy a concept as it is To do that the team devised and validated a simplified scale of  items based on how strongly subjects agreed or disagreed with statements like When I really want to do something I usually find a way to succeed at it and I have a sense of direction and purpose in life Also included were statements like If something can go wrong for me it will and There is really no way I can solve the problems I have Over two years  percent of this sample developed a new chronic condition heart or lung disease stroke psychiatric problems cancer These can be devastating Yet the higher people scored on the resilience scale the less likely this new obstacle was to disable them The researchers looked at their subjects subsequent ability to perform activities of daily living like bathing and dressing and to handle instrumental activities of daily living like using a phone and making meals Dr Manning and her colleagues tried to account for the participants actual health including depression and for sociodemographic differences The researchers found that when a new disease struck the least resilient had on average nearly triple the amount of activities of daily living disabilities compared to the most resilient Resilience provided what researchers called a moderating effect The extent of disability among this relatively young population was already low Among those facing a new illness the least resilient subsequently experienced on average only one ADL disability But the most resilient were on average barely disabled at all by a new illness You throw something at them something bad  a new chronic condition is really hard  and we see this bounceback pretty rapidly said the coauthor Dawn Carr a gerontologist at the Stanford Center on Longevity Theyre able to maintain their function How this works is a question this study cant answer But Dr Manning points out that people often describe resilience as acquired during moments of adversity So perhaps other people can acquire it too even late in life What strategies would help people bolster their resilience she said envisioning resilience interventions in the future I believe that unlike some concepts  where you either have it or you dont youre resilient or youre vulnerable  everybody has the capacity for resilience Confession Im neither a religious nor a spiritual person and much of the positiveattitude talk we constantly hear strikes me as malarkey Sometimes what doesnt kill you makes you weaker And yet  Ive reported here on evidence that a sense of purpose   and that   is linked to improved cognitive function Ive come across a couple of recent studies on the impact of religiosity Even nonorganizational forms appear to   or help people recover from it and   is associated with lower levels of certain physiological problems Selfefficacy mastery gratitude  theyre amorphous concepts but researchers are finding that they can have realworld effects As we all wait to learn more its clear that a healthy old age however defined involves more than excellent blood pressure Something else is going on It is slippery stuff Dr Manning acknowledged I find it fascinating
