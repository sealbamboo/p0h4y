An Afghan girl has been diagnosed with polio in Kabul  the capitals first case since the Talibans fall in   The health ministry ordered a vaccination campaign across the capital after the threeyearold was diagnosed  Polio remains endemic in Afghanistan Pakistan and northern Nigeria but has been almost wiped out around the world  In all three countries Islamic extremists have obstructed health workers preventing polio eradication campaigns from taking place  Since the Afghan Taliban changed their policy allowing vaccination in recent years there has been a decline in cases in Afghanistan  The emergence of a new case in Kabul is worrying health officials  It was discovered in a very poor community of Kuchis formerly nomadic herdsmen now settled on a hillside in the east of the capital  In response health workers have tried to visit every home in the community  There is no running water or electricity and some of the exnomads still live in tents despite the cold of winter in Kabul  Once the workers have put drops into the mouths of infants they find they mark their hands with a blue line and write the date on the wall  It seems rudimentary but tens of thousands of volunteers in campaigns like this across the country have succeeded in almost beating the disease  The girl who contracted the disease Sakina was diagnosed after she became paralysed  Her father is a taxi driver who often goes to the frontier region with Pakistan and has now taken her there for treatment  Her uncle Mohammed Azim said that she complains I cant stand up The other children are playing and I cannot  The polio strain in the two countries is identical and with  million children crossing the frontier every year crossborder transmission is inevitable  Nearly all of the cases in Afghanistan last year were in regions close to the Pakistan border  Afghanistan has health workers at the border crossings attempting to monitor all children who cross and vaccinating those at risk  But many people do not cross at formal customs posts instead using tracks across the mountains and deserts that line the porous frontier   The Taliban in Afghanistan remain a nationalist movement who have been persuaded of the values of modern medicine  But the Pakistani Taliban are a far more ideological group similar to Boko Haram in northern Nigeria who are focused on global jihad and unwilling to believe anything the west tells them  As well as killing health workers the Pakistani Taliban have campaigned against vaccination spreading the malicious rumour that it is a covert policy of sterilisation   Their opposition along with continuing insecurity in some parts of Afghanistan could prevent continuing progress towards global eradication of the disease     Afghan Health Minister Soraya Dalil said the continuing opposition of the Pakistani Taliban was a threat undermining efforts to eradicate polio in Afghanistan  After the initial local vaccination campaign routine campaigns would continue she said to keep up the pressure and ensure that this is an isolated case and not a new outbreak This new case in Kabul tells us that the effort on polio eradication is not over yet and we have to accelerate the effort to make sure that every child no matter where they are receive polio drops
