Now that medical insurers must accept all applicants no matter how sick what will these new customers cost health plans And how will their coverage costs affect insurance prices for  and beyond Few questions about the Affordable Care Act are more important How it all plays out will affect consumer pocketbooks insurance company profits and perhaps the political fortunes of those backing the health law A few Denver actuaries bound to confidentiality will be the first to glimpse the answers Quite a few companies have agreed to give Wakely Consulting Group early information about enrollment and member health in plans for individuals and small businesses sold through the online marketplaces that opened last fall The firm will use the data to give insurers the earliest possible estimates of how much theyll pay or receive through a government program designed to distribute risk more evenly among plans The information will also help insurers set rates for  which are due to regulators relatively soon Its really about how healthy or sick are these people said Ross Winkelman a Wakely actuary whos running the analysis along with colleague Syed Mehmud Thats probably the biggest uncertainty in each plans rate filing Wakely is getting information on enrollees health and demographics far beyond what   The data are totaled Wakely doesnt see member information Since the ACA bars insurers from asking about peoples health until after they sign up each carrier is quickly trying to assess its new membership But plans arent affected just by the health of their own members The new enrollees their competitors sign up can also influence bottom lines Thats because the health laws   are designed to shift money from insurers that potentially signed up much healthier members than average to those that enrolled sicker members than average The program similar to one for Medicare managed care plans is supposed to remove incentives for insurers to enroll only the healthy Properly accounting for risk adjustment could mean as much as  percentage points in costs or revenue for plans accustomed to making  percent profit  a huge swing said Winkelman But to know what theyre getting insurers need to know how their experience compares to that of their competitors in a given state and what the average risk is for the total market That information wont come through normal regulatory channels for many months  long after carriers have to set rates for  and start reporting profits to shareholders Instead and perhaps improbably Wakely has persuaded insurers in more than  states to   gathering detailed information from each company figuring how it fits together and sharing only whats necessary Winkelman declined to identify the insurers or which states theyre in But in some states every health plan in the individual and smallgroup markets agreed to participate he said A Wakely website   that said they intended to participate They include most major insurers In October UnitedHealth Group which owns the nations biggest health insurer said it had signed up for such a study without identifying Wakely We have absolutely participated with a third party to gather industry information and get some feedback on where we sit Dan Schumacher chief financial officer for Uniteds insurer   And based on that information as well as our past experience we feel very comfortable with our ability to estimate the results on the risk adjustment program as we get into  Some Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans are also participating Wakely is still recruiting clients  especially communityrun coop health plans created by the federal health law and others new to the individual and smallgroup business The health plans that are probably least likely to be participating right now are the ones that are new and they are the ones that could really benefit from it Winkelman said Because of insurers concerns about confidentiality Wakely wont be sharing what it learns with the federal government he said Thanks to the health laws new requirements insurers knew they might get a line of sickerthanusual customers They priced this years plans accordingly But it was still largely a guess Whether they have recruited enough healthy members to balance out costs for the sick and keep premiums from rising substantially for  will be something many people in Washington and CEO suites across the country will want to know The folks at Wakely will have a better earlier idea than anybody else But dont expect them to put out any announcements
