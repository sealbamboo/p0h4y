But unlike with drugs or alcohol where an addict can stop the behavior that they are addicted to she knew she couldnt stop eating So she decided instead to stop eating and drinking out of habit She started with small changes   She gave up diet soda first  For her it was a real sacrifice I would drink maybe six to eight Diet Cokes a day I know people think its OK to drink since it doesnt have calories but I realized I never really had it on its own Monifa said I was usually rinsing down a big bag of chips with it   So she gave up chips   After that she stopped eating the MMs their bright colors always taunting her from the bowl at a womans desk outside her office door  At her heaviest Monifa weighed over  pounds She says there was no one moment when she realized she needed to lose weight The knowledge came in small waves  Her daughter complained she walked too slow  She couldnt join her friends on rides at the amusement park because she exceeded the weight limits  When she flew she had to use a seatbelt extender and actually got bumped once from a flight When she got off the plane the gate agent told her he would put it in her profile that she had to buy two seats   Monifa  doesnt know exactly how she put on the weight She just knows she gained about  to  pounds a year after the age of    I dont know at what point I remember thinking Woops Im over  pounds now Monifa said   Subconsciously she may have been avoiding situations where shed have to confront it   I then started telling myself things like Ill never weigh more than  pounds  Then it became Ill never weigh more than  then  then  Then it became  Monifa said  Her mother and then her partner bought her clothes She stopped weighing herself when she got to  pounds She later realized she had even stopped looking in the mirror There was a window on a department store and I remember seeing someone out of the corner of my eye and thinking Who is that big fat person behind me It slowly dawned on me That was me She decided she had to do something drastic She looked into gastric bypass a friend had lost  pounds with the surgery With gastric bypass doctors create a small pouch at the top of your stomach and bypass the rest to send food straight to the small intestine The   can only hold about an ounce of food  Right when I was thinking about it I got a call from a friend who said that woman had passed Monifa said I put the surgery off  I wasnt losing my life over it Three years ago she worked up the nerve to look into it again Her insurance covered a program at Stanford It started on the right note with a lecture from the physician who would do her surgery  He said he had done  surgeries and had no fatalities He was also from Alabama which is where Monifa grew up  I took that as a sign that it was going to be OK she said In August  she had surgery She weighed  pounds   The first two weeks werent bad She didnt mind the liquid highprotein diet She soon graduated to eating small quantities But then she slipped into an old habit    She was running late on the way to the gym She stopped at a drivethru After one bite she threw up   Thats when she gave up fast food for good By the time she went back to work in October she was down to  pounds None of the clothes I had fit so I posted that on Facebook and people started giving me clothes in vast quantities People were so incredibly supportive They were also confused Its funny when people hear that you have had gastric bypass its almost like they think youve had liposuction and had the fat removed but thats not the case Monifa said A lot of what helps you lose weight afterward are all the changes you have to make She eats five or six small meals a day and takes advantage of San Franciscos reputation as an inventive mecca for foodies She now enjoys fresh vegetables from the farmers market or a new take on a classic Asian dish Shell eat anything baked broiled or grilled She eats slowly to enjoy the taste and the smell and the quality  And if she does get a craving shell eat a tiny amount of something rather than the entire container I bought a quart of vanilla ice cream when I moved into my place a year ago and it is still there Monifa said Group therapy helped Setting exercise goals did too Her step counter reminds her to get at least  steps each day And she didnt just join one gym she joined two  A hour facility by her house in Oakland and a gym right down the street from work in San Francisco  Since that one is a lot of money it motivates me to go every day Monifa said And it feels like a treat Its that fancy I feel like a woman of luxury on the scene Socializing now is about activity rather than food She takes walks with friends and plays basketball with her son She plays tennis and swims   When she does dine out she looks at the menu online and decides what healthy option to have ahead of time so shes not tempted She cuts her meal into a smaller portion and takes the leftovers home   The footinch woman is down to  pounds Her goal used to be    I feel good and I feel healthy Monifa said Her sleep apnea equipment and high blood pressure medicine are gone  Her lower back  and joint pain disappeared     And she takes the time to celebrate what she calls the NSVs the little nonscale victories Signing up for a charity walk she relished when the staff insisted she take a medium Tshirt rather than her request for the largest size you have She tucks in her shirt now showing off her waist  She has even started to date And finally after all these years she looks in the mirror   Ive never felt good about myself about my looks Now I feel like I could attract someone My friend from college jokes that it is time I should be in a lesbian power couple but really now I just want someone who can hold their own with me in this world  I finally see that Im worth it
