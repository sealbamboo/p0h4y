Holidays are typically a festive time with breaks from the routine meals with loved ones maybe even some gifts But for many families across the US the season comes with intense stress Roughly  in  families with children are not getting enough food For some free or reducedprice school meals have become a major source of basic nutrition When schools close for the holidays many of those families struggle to fill the gap Rachel Price works fulltime for minimum wage at a day care center in Birmingham Ala As a single mother she worries about keeping food on the table for her own children and grandchildren That hurts as a mother trying to tell your child they cant go into the kitchen and get something Price says Its definitely a struggle you know I have a lot of sleepless nights I cry a lot Thats because of practical details that some people never have to worry about But for Price and others those little things like her kids doctor visits or trips to the supermarket can get big quickly A lot of times you sit and you wonder Am I going to have enough Do I go with cheap  you know do I go with noodles and sandwiches  or do I go with healthy meals  Price says Sometimes her childrens iron levels have been low she says because she chose the noodle route Price has a somewhat easier time during the academic year when her kids get free breakfast and lunch at school But when school is on break a lot of children do go hungry says Karen Kapp director of Better Basics a childrens literacy and enrichment program near Birmingham And as kids brains mature Kapp says the ones who dont get enough food fall further behind their betterfed peers Linda Godfrey who advises school districts on their meal operations has also run summerschool feeding programs Sometimes she says children would have their faces to the door as early as  am And as soon as the doors would open at  oclock they would already be lined up and they were extremely hungry Especially on Monday Even with school meals food stamps and food banks some kids just arent getting enough to eat A recent   from the antihunger organization Share Our Strength found more than half of teachers have used their own money to buy food for hungry students They know hunger increases the chances of academic failure which can push people toward unemployment or even crime School systems and communities do have programs to get food to needy kids during breaks but often funding is short And there are other problems too Summer programs in particular tend to rely on centralized feeding sites but some families dont have cars There are psychological obstacles for some parents as well says Ward Williams founder of Vineyard Family Services a small nonprofit tucked in the back of a church in Shelby County Ala Theres been a lot of people who had never gotten help from any kind of agency before Williams says Theyre too proud to ever ask for help so the kids were struggling Williams together with Stephanie Grissom runs Backpack Buddies one approach being tried across the country to fight weekend hunger The program also sidesteps the stigma of accepting help We make sure we have two lunches and we have two breakfasts Grissom says packing up food for childrens meals And then it all goes in a bag And  we want it to be discreet Its not labeled and they cant see through it Grissom and Williams drive the bags to elementary and middle schools some as far as an hour away They unload the meals for school counselors like Valley Elementarys Kay McCrae who get them to needy kids to take home on Fridays Theyll wink at me in the hall or give me a thumbsup McCrae says And sometimes they even come up and give me a hug and whisper in my ear Are you bringing my bag today It almost brings tears to my eyes The program also strengthens the counselorstudent relationship and school staffers say the program is boosting grades But McCrae and foodservice expert Linda Godfrey understand the big picture  and the problems are bigger than backpacks I had children that would come up to me and say I really dont want to be out of school for Christmas because we know were not going to get much to eat  Godfrey says We can say over and over and over Its a parents responsibility to feed their children But the bottom line is they dont The reasons for that are complex as are the solutions But for many families  especially the kids  holidays arent all parties and lights theyre about hunger too
