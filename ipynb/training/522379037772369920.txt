Top of the morning to you. Clouds may be hovering over the Pharmalot campus, but as always, our spirits remain sunny. And why not? Every so often we like to pass along  a reminder from the former Morning Mayor, who would say that ‘every brand new day should be unwrapped like a precious gift.’ So while you tug on the proverbial ribbon, we will let the official mascots back into the castle and brew another cup of stimulation. Meanwhile, here are some tidbits. Have a great day, everyone, and do stay in touch…. AbbVie is re-evaluating plans to buy Shire in light of new U.S. rules making it harder for American companies to lower taxes through overseas dealmaking; a Chinese drug maker with close military ties is seeking fast-track approval for a drug that it says can cure Ebola; and the U.S. Supreme Court today will wade into Teva Pharmaceutical’s fight over patent protections for Copaxone, its top-selling multiple sclerosis drug.
