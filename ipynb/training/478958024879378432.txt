Dr Mehmet Oz a celebrity doctor who frequently extols weightloss products on his syndicated television show got a harsh scolding from several senators on Tuesday at a hearing about bogus diet product ads Oz was held up as the power driving many of the fraudulent ads even as he argued he was himself the victim of the scammers The hearing is a followup to the Federal Trade Commissions   against fake diet products I dont get why you need to say this stuff because you know its not true Missouri Sen Claire McCaskill a Democrat who chairs a Senate subcommittee on consumer protection said at the hearing So why when you have this amazing megaphonewhy would you cheapen your show by saying things like that Oz plays a role in perpetuating scams McCaskill said When you feature a product on your show it creates what has become known as the Dr Oz Effect  dramatically boosting sales and driving scam artists to pop up overnight using false and deceptive ads to sell questionable products she said While I understand that your message is occasionally focused on basics like healthy eating and exercise I am concerned that you are melding medical advice news and entertainment in a way that harms consumers Oz a frequent guest on NBCs TODAY show admitted he uses flowery language on his shows and said he realizes that the moment he recommends a product the scammers use his words to sell spurious products I concede to my colleagues at the FTC that I am making their job more difficult he said But he said he has to be passionate to engage his audience When we write a script we need to generate enthusiasm and engage the viewer Oz said I actually do personally believe in the items I talk about on the show he added I recognize that oftentimes they dont have the scientific muster to pass as fact I have given my family these products Oz said the products give people hope to keep trying to lose weight  something almost all experts agree is a very difficult thing to do Twothirds of Americans are overweight or obese The FTC says its been struggling since  to battle fake diet claims But the Internet has made things worse than ever and its often near impossible to track down fraudsters who hide behind shell companies and post office box addresses And celebrity endorsements havent helped said the FTCs Mary Koelbel Engle For instance within weeks of an April  Dr Oz Show touting green coffeebean extract as a miracle fat burning pill that works for everyone the marketers of the Pure Green Coffee dietary supplement took to the Internet making overblown claims  like lose  pounds in four weeks and lose  pounds and two to four inches of belly fat in two to three months  for their dietary supplement she said In the past  years the Commission has brought  law enforcement actions challenging false or unsubstantiated claims about the efficacy of a wide variety of weightloss products and services Oz who has sued some of the companies using his image said he never sells any products and says the scammers will misuse his image no matter what he says You know  the biggest disservice I have done for my audience he asked Its that I never told then where to go to buy the products He said he did that for ethical reasons but it backfired by opening up a market for fake stuff real stuff it doesnt frankly matter and start to use my name to start to sell McCaskill asked why Oz didnt use his show to promote what actually has been proven to help people lose weight  careful eating and exercise I want to see all that floweriness all that passion about the beauty of a walk at sunset she said The scientific community is almost monolithic against you in terms of the efficacy of a few products that you have called miracles she added I just dont understand why you need to go there  You are being made an example of today because of the power you have in this space McCaskill also rebuked media companies that run the ads I find it troubling that broadcast and satellite radio witnesses who were asked to be here today were unwilling to appear To me this indicates that either there is something to hide or they dont have a good story to tell she said The Advertising SelfRegulatory Council the Council for Responsible Nutrition which represents supplement makers and other groups said they supported selfregulation They also support the  that the agency says people should use as a guide in assessing ads for products that look too good to be true Take a hard look FTC advises if the ad claims the product
