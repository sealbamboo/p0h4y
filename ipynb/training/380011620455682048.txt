When teenagers drink its all too often all out downing five or more beers in a session But some teenagers are drinking even more a study finds boosting the upper limits of binge drinking to  drinks or more In a poll of high school seniors  percent said theyd had five or more drinks in a row in the past two weeks Thats what health officials consider binge drinking But  percent said theyd had  or more drinks at a time and  percent said theyd had  or more drinks Drinking at that level would produce blood alcohol levels four to five times the legal limit for an adult The risks of serious injury through driving or other accidents or death due to alcohol poisoning are dramatically higher Earlier national surveys havent asked about extreme binge drinking says   a research assistant professor at the University of Michigan and lead author of the study Weve had these high rates of emergency room use from underage alcohol use Patrick told Shots This helps explain it In  questions about drinking more than five drinks in a row were added to the   study a federal survey of adolescent behavior Now theres enough data to say that the numbers are reliable Patrick says Though the study notes that at these extremely high levels of alcohol consumption drinkers memories may be a bit impaired Fifteen drinks in a row is a lot for anyone Patrick says Remember were talking about yearolds Its very serious The survey data   online in   ran from  to  and involved more than  high school seniors Young men were more apt to say they binge drink than young women and white students were more likely binge drinkers than ethnic minorities at the lower levels  but once it got up to  drinks or more all ethnic groups were equally susceptible Students with more educated parents were more likely to binge at the  and drink levels but not at plus Students in rural areas were more likely to indulge in extreme binge drinking In   percent of thgraders said they had had a drink at least once in their lives and  percent said they had gotten drunk Those rates are similar to or less than those in other Western countries the researchers say Teen drinking rates have declined since the s but the rates of extreme binge drinking have remained stubbornly high Prevention efforts have been focused on binge drinking at the drink level an accompanying   notes not at the extreme levels reported here Researchers need to start asking about extreme drinking routinely the editorial says so that scientists can figure out what kinds of interventions will help reduce this highrisk form of alcohol use And thats not to say that downing five drinks a night is OK because so many teenagers are often drinking to that level the risk of harm from light binge drinking is major too
