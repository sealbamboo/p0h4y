METAIRIE, La.—William LaCorte keeps a half-dozen marble paperweights at his medical practice in this New Orleans suburb, engraved with images of checks from a lucrative sideline: suing companies for alleged health-care fraud.. Over two decades, the 65-year-old internist has filed 12 lawsuits accusing health-care companies of defrauding taxpayer-funded programs such as Medicare. Five of his suits have together led the government to recover hundreds of millions of dollars.
