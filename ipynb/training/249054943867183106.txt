A Swedish medical team has   from two women in their s to their daughters Meanwhile Shots has learned that an Indiana group is recruiting women willing to undergo womb transplants in this country We could go ahead tomorrow if we found the perfect candidate Dr   told Shots Del Priore says he has already interviewed a number of women and has the approval of the ethics committee at Indiana University in Indianapolis While the Swedes did mothertodaughter transplants the Indiana group plans to rely on cadaver donors Del Priore says he believes there would be an ample supply of suitable uteruses from current multiorgan cadaver donors He says tens of thousands of American women are potential candidates for uterine transplants They include young women who have had hysterectomies for     and uterine trauma Another group is women born without a uterus Other medical centers in the US and Britain also hope to begin offering uterine transplants after a decade or so of animal research Its the latest frontier in a medical field launched almost six decades ago with the  Uterine transplants have one unique feature Theyll be temporary Once a transplant recipient has achieved a successful pregnancy  or two in the Swedish protocol  she will undergo a hysterectomy to remove the foreign uterus That way she wont be exposed to a lifetime of   with their risks of increased infection and other disorders A person team at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden did the first mothertodaughter uterine transplants last weekend One of the recipients lost her uterus to cervical cancer The other was born without a uterus Theyre doing fine both the donors and the recipients transplant surgeon   told Shots All four women are doing fine But Olausson acknowledges that the success of the experiment is far from assured The recipients will be monitored for a year to see if the transplants settle in and behave like normal uteruses  cycling through menstrual periods avoiding signs of rejection Then the doctors will implant previously frozen embryos from these women and hope all goes well By that schedule the outcome of the experiment will be known sometime in mid Olausson says hes confident the transplanted uteruses can withstand the mechanical stresses of pregnancy as well as undergo the growth and complicated remodeling necessary to carry and sustain a fetus A long series of experiments with mice rats sheep pigs and baboons showed that these animals could accept uterine transplants and give birth to healthy offspring So we dont think there will be a problem he says One of the women who donated her uterus to her daughter is past menopause It does not really matter if they are menopausal or not because the uterus can be sort of refurbished with hormones Olausson says So thats not a problem in itself Some experts are concerned about the risks of antirejection drugs during pregnancy  not only because of possible infection but also because of other problems such as high blood pressure and premature delivery But Olausson points out that as many as  women have had successful pregnancies after undergoing other organ transplants The Swedish uterine transplants are not the first In  a Saudi Arabian group transplanted a uterus from a live donor But within three months it developed blood clotting problems and had to be removed Last year   but experts in the field dont believe that has resulted in a pregnancy yet One leading US obstetriciangynecologist Dr   of Massachusetts General Hospital cautioned against premature enthusiasm about uterine transplants Dont get too excited quite yet he told Shots Its too soon to make a judgment Green questions whether this kind of transplant is really necessary When doctors began transplanting organs in the s s and s they started with organs essential for life  kidneys hearts and livers Lately theyve been doing what Green calls optional transplants  of limbs voice boxes even faces Nobody needs a uterus to live OK Green says Nobody needs a hand or a face to live in fairness Its a qualityoflife issue This is in that same category So weve opened the door Weve stepped through it And this is one of the next logical things that people might do He wonders whether health care dollars should be spent on uterine transplants when a woman who lacks a uterus can turn to a surrogate mother to provide her with a child  if she can afford it that is But Dr   of New York University Medical School says he hopes the Swedish experiment and other such efforts succeed Grifo has done his own research on uterine transplants but abandoned that work to pursue other priorities He said in an interview that he was uncomfortable with the possible risks But he sympathizes with women who might want a uterine transplant I dont think its a simple discussion by any stretch Grifo told Shots You know when youre the patient then you fully understand the issues When youre just theoretically discussing these things unless it actually hits home I think you dont really fully understand it The Swedes plan to do  more uterine transplants The next two could be in a matter of weeks
