Statins may have a beneficial side effect reducing gum inflammation or periodontitis Almost half of adults in the United States have periodontitis and it is a known risk factor for atherosclerosis the buildup of plaque in the arteries In a randomized trial researchers assigned  people with heart disease or at high risk for heart disease to take a daily dose of either  milligrams or  milligrams of atorvastatin both Lipitor and generics for  weeks Doctors used CT and PET scans to evaluate them for periodontal disease and arterial inflammation at the start of the study and again at the end There was a significant reduction in gum inflammation in the group that took the milligram dose compared with those who took the lower dose The differences were greatest in those with the most severe gum disease at the start of the study and the changes correlated with changes in artery inflammation Its surprising a newly recognized effect said the senior author Dr Ahmed Tawakol codirector of the cardiac MRPETCT program at Harvard Still he does not recommend treating gum disease with statins We have to perform large randomized trials first to look for clinical efficacy and then to look for cost efficacy This is a proof of principle study The   in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology
