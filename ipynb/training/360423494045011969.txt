Maybe weve been going about this all wrong In the continuing campaign to get people particularly the old and sick to discuss their preferences for endoflife care weve been pushing for them to have intimate conversations with family members Web sites like   and   campaigns like   in April   here  all reflect the idea that Americans can overcome their apparent aversion to acknowledging mortality if their children will just talk to them Progress on this front has been slow however Pew Research surveys found in  that  percent of Americans had a living will a figure that rose to just  percent by  So on a nearly daily basis the palliative care specialist Dr Joshua Lakin told me in an interview Id see someone whod had lung cancer for several years whod been in and out of the hospital had seen  doctors and still hadnt thought about the future and his priorities It kind of blindsided me So Dr Lakin who just completed a fellowship at the University of California San Francisco and some colleagues took an entirely different approach to what is called advance care planning They experimented with brib    er incentivizing doctors And whaddya know it worked As the team   last week the UCSF Medical Center has an incentive program to improve quality each year its doctorsintraining pick one area to focus on For the  academic year the internal medicine department decided to concentrate on documenting patients advance care decisions The researchers came up with a standard form which was inserted in patients electronic health records It asked just a few questions Does the patient have any expressed wishes about how much care he wants or doesnt Where are those preferences recorded  in a living will a durable power of attorney   which would be scanned into the record Or are they expressed orally The researchers form requests a brief summary He doesnt want to be resuscitated or intubated She wants a feeding tube but not a ventilator Or she wants all available care Does he have a designated decision maker What is that persons name and phone number and what language does he or she speak IfÂ residents recorded this information for at least  percent of discharged patients for three of the four quarters in the academic year they each got a  bonus If not they didnt The hospital not the researchers established that sum but it was enough to get people motivated Dr Lakin noted Residents around the country earn between  and  a year plus housing stipends An additional  dollars isnt lifechanging but its not pin money either And the researchers sent out bar graphs via email to point out if teams were hitting the goal or endangering everyones bonus Marketing  Dr Lakin called it  The experiment followed nearly  patients more than half the adults of all ages seen by the hospitals medical department that year In July the first month only about  percent had their preferences documented roughly the same proportion as before the incentives began So the template itself wasnt enough Dr Lakin said But by October following Marketing    and stayed there By contrast a separate team of attending physicians who didnt participate in the incentive program averaged less than  percent for the year So maybe we dont have to keep nudzhing our parents bracing for uncomfortable discussions Maybe a doctor at a hospital or not can do this in  minutes without angst Of course the study doesnt answer some major questions We dont know how much of an incentive if any would motivate practicing physicians who are paid more than residents We also dont know whether simply having a standard form in your medical records means that you will actually have your wishes respected  that youll be put on a ventilator if you said youd want that but not if you said you didnt But we do have some idea of the scenario that ensues when people have never discussed their wishes The medical conveyor belt cranks up Theres a set of default choices in the hospital system which does things unless told not to Dr Lakin said Id still rather have the family conversation But so often it never takes place Stricken families sometimes bitterly at odds wonder what Mom would want if she could speak Maybe nobody really knows Maybe for a paltry sum compared with the cost of a single day in intensive care her doctor could have found out
