I walk in and my only rule is to keep moving for a pump and cardio at the same time Rest as little as possible After an hour you will feel fantastic and your muscles wont know what hit them The actor trains every day for at least an hour to be in shape for movies like   which releases in theaters tonight  A Reddit user posted a link to the Instagram video   and Schwarzenegger a   jumped on to offer some more advice  The point isnt the machines or the exercises he wrote The point is that you can create a workout for your goals anywhere Even if you just use a chair for dips a table for rows and the floor for pushups Schwarzenegger said he enjoys working out in unfamiliar gyms even if sometimes hed prefer to be at home I like shocking my system he wrote so I look at the bright side  You have to wonder if the bodybuilderturned actorturned governorturnedactor ever gets interrupted during his workout Occasionally he said but mostly people keep to themselves Fair warning to fans in New Orleans where Schwarzenegger is filming Maggie The actor said he welcomes people who want to say hello to him while hes resting between sets but dont slow me down while Im working  Maybe its just us but we would never bother someone   midgrunt  Of course staring at him oddly isnt a good idea either  Based on the looks Ive been getting in the hotel gym people think something is seriously wrong with donkey raises Schwarzenegger  earlier this month referring to   that involve bending forward and lifting and lowering your heels I cant recommend them enough though
