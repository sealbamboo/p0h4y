Back when I first went skiing in college taking a lesson seemed unnecessary Just channel JeanClaude Killy the Olympic champion who was on TV all the time when I was a kid That worked out fine for the  times Ive skied since  until last weekend when I heard Ho Ming Lu  of San Diego shout out loud This is great For the first time I feel under control like I actually know how to ski At that moment doing a remarkably stable turn called a corkscrew I realized he had just spoken my thoughts  and probably everyones in the class on the slopes of Big Bears Snow Summit mountain In two hours I heard the words under control more confident and exhilarating uttered again and again by seven novice skiers ages  to  with experience levels of two days to four decades The bottom line I love you JeanClaude but its really fun and much safer to suddenly be a lot better at something Snow Summit Snow Sports School  Summit Blvd Big Bear Lake  Ski School and Snowboard School has twohour beginner and intermediate classes that can be taken consecutively Skiing can be scary for beginners and novices Thats why each class is tested subdivided into small groups by ability and given its own instructor Ours was Alan Dosa  a calm friendly Chatsworth hospital laboratory manager who teaches skiing on weekends We followed him to the lift and assembled at the top of the easy Summit Run No sweat Skiing is all about letting gravity do the work not muscling it said Dosa The closer you followed his instructions the more effortless it felt His strategy which taught us how to stop and stay balanced and in control before going fast built confidence and safety Hed explain a maneuver for three or four minutes then ski down  yards and have us do it one by one so he could provide individual feedback A quick overview Turn safer and faster by squatting low and leaning forward with body and hands  even on the supersteeps  Heading to the steeper slopes we put it together in the final minutes of the lesson Putting hands wide in front standing tall to gain speed corkscrewing into the turn keeping momentum and repeating For yearold Michael Truong of Palos Verdes High skiing suddenly felt as natural as mountain biking his sport maybe he could keep up with his dad on the slopes now For me having gotten by for decades on a gonzo attitude and no skills it was like upgrading from a jalopy to a BMW The rest of the day I felt safer faster and  dare I say it  JeanClaudeier  Adults  and  for a two or fourhour lesson with lift ticket Kids including equipment pay  and
