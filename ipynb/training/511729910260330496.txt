WASHINGTON—Tens of thousands of people are likely to lose their health insurance at the end of this month because they missed a deadline to confirm they are legally residing in the U.S., the Obama administration said Monday.. In all, 115,000 people whose citizenship or immigration status wasn't verified by HealthCare.gov hadn't contacted the federal government by a Sept. 5 deadline to send additional documents, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said.
