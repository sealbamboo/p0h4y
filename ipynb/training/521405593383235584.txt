In West Africa one of the simplest ways to slow the Ebola outbreak is to educate people about how to keep from getting infected with the virus Now there are some signs that Ebola awareness is indeed driving down the number of cases in parts of Liberia  and Liberian musicians and DJs may deserve some of the credit The airwaves in Liberia are saturated with songs about this disease Early on in the epidemic the government and aid agencies commissioned public awareness songs but they actually ended up terrifying people The message Theres no cure Dont touch anybody Stop eating bush meat It used to be a death sentence to people so it scared people away says Elliott Adekoya a yearold musician and disc jockey who works at one of Monrovias most popular pop stations Sky FM Thats how people started running away from one community to another And people saw it worse like a curse Adekoya says people started to see that you can survive the disease and that listeners dont want to hear those despondent messages all the time on the radio The Ebola scenario is something that people dont want to listen to anymore because theyre so fed up so sick of it he says If youre making a song  an Ebola song that people gonna listen to now  it has to be danceable Adekoya also known as The Milkman says one of the most popular songs right now is by FA and Soul Fresh called   It tells people to protect themselves from getting infected He says two of the most powerful phrases are The thing Ebola now come and The thing now show face The thing now come the thing now show face Thats the thing that the children enjoy he says People go around people be like No shaking hands my man In the Liberian way when they say The thing now come it means the thing is here Now we know its here and it has shown its face So we all understand thats in our midst now we gotta be careful Radio remains an incredibly powerful medium in West Africa It blasts from shops and young men crank it up in rustbucket taxis You hear it playing from simple shacks and tidy stucco homes In addition to the Ebola songs announcers are regularly talking about the disease They urge people to stay away from dead bodies regularly wash your hands and get to a treatment center right away if you have symptoms Some of the most popular Ebola songs get played repeatedly The chorus of Ebola is Real wafts all over the city But its not just pop music that has taken on the epidemic There are RB songs slow jams and Afropop tunes as well Adekoya at SkyFM says music is having an impact He says it is a way to express frustration and let off steam and a way to remind people to protect themselves from the disease Its a way for Liberians to come together in the face of a terrifying illness Adekoya is particularly excited about a project called Save Liberia Its sort of a Liberian version of We Are the World and it brings together  of the countrys most famous musicians The Save Liberia project is the main thing Im looking forward to and I just want to see how its going to turn things around he says And Adekoya believes it will have an impact on Ebola because he has faith in the power of music
