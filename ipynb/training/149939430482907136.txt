About  of people in the United States are overweight and in a cruel catch many of the drugs used to treat obesitylinked conditions such as diabetes high blood pressure and depression can themselves cause weight gain Patients and doctors need to be more aware of thisits an underrecognized driver of our obesity problem says Lawrence Cheskin MD director of the Johns Hopkins Weight Management Center in Baltimore Here are  drugs that could cause you to gain weight But dont stop taking your possibly lifesaving medicine There are strategies for keeping off the pounds Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs generally dont cause weight gain because the antidepressants boost serotonin which helps you feel full Paxil is an exception Paxil is one of the best anxiety treatments but if you gain weight while using it you could talk with a doctor about switching to a more weightneutral SSRI such as Prozac or Zoloft says Louis Aronne MD director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Program at New YorkPresbyterianWeill Cornell Medical Center in New York City Dr Aronne is a consultant for the maker of Paxil Depakote is used to treat bipolar disorder and seizures and prevent migraines A  study of epilepsy patients found that  of women and  of men gained  pounds or more while taking Depakote for about a year The drug affects proteins involved in appetite and metabolism although its not clear why it appears to affect women more than men Lithium another mood stabilizer for treating bipolar disorder is also associated with weight gain albeit less than Depakote Although Prozac an SSRI is generally associated with weight loss it can have the opposite effect in the long term A week study found that although patients on Prozac shed more than the placebo group up to  pounds in the first six months they started to regain the weight about halfway through the study Dr Cheskin says the reason could be that patients develop tolerance to the satiety effect If someone is trying to lose weight and is on an SSRI for depression I will often switch to Wellbutrin bupropion which is associated with weight loss he says Remeron is an antidepressant that enhances serotonin and norepinephrine which are linked to weight loss Yet the antihistamine activity of this drug may tip the scales toward weight gain This side effect can be a good thing however Remeron is sometimes given to elderly people who are underweight to improve their appetite Roerig says Atypical antipsychotics such as Zyprexa and Clozaril clozapine can   A  study found that  of people on Zyprexa gained  or more of their body weight within  months These drugs used for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have potent antihistamine activity and inhibit serotonin which may trigger weight gain The diabetes drug metformin may help keep weight off as can switching to weightneutral antipsychotics like Geodon ziprasidone and Abilify aripiprazole Oral corticosteroids such as Deltasone are more potent than inhaled forms and carry a higher risk of weight gain particularly with longterm use A  survey of longterm oralcorticosteroid users suggested  to  had gained weight Higher doses such as those for   and   are more likely to have this effect than lower doses such as those for   It can be hard to counteract the side effects of longterm steroid use but exercise diet and in some cases taking metformin can help Dr Aronne says When the firstgeneration antipsychotic Thorazine entered the market in  it was clear that it could cause weight gain Thorazine along with Mellaril thioridazine has antihistamine activity which increases your appetite and is sedating says James Roerig associate professor of clinical neuroscience at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Fargo These drugs may cause less weight gain than Zyprexa and Clozaril Still they arent as effective at treating schizophrenia and may have other side effects such as motor problems says Roerig Roerig gets research funding from Eli Lilly the maker of Zyprexa Tricyclic antidepressants TCAs such as amitriptyline are linked to weight gain more than other antidepressants or migraine meds TCAs affect neurotransmitters involved in energy and appetite such as serotonin dopamine and acetylcholine but their antihistamine activity is probably the reason for weight changes Roerig says These drugs are given less often for depression because an overdose can damage the heart Lower doses can prevent migraines but a  study found that  of people taking amitriptyline for migraines gained more than  of their body weight in  weeks The antihistamine activity in psychiatric drugs often is what causes weight gain but it turns out that this property is not important for these drugs to be effective Roerig says Antihistamine activity however is crucial for the effectiveness of allergy drugs A  study found that people taking prescription antihistamines such as Allegra and Zyrtec were  more likely to be overweight than those not taking the drugs Blocking histamine can disrupt an enzyme in the brain that helps regulate food consumption Some type  diabetes drugs cause weight loss Others have the opposite effect Sulfonylurea drugs such as Diabinese and Insulaseand others such as Actos and Prandinstimulate insulin production or activity which lowers blood sugar and may increase appetite Metformin Byetta and Januvia are more likely to cause weight loss Dr Aronne says Dr Aronne receives research support from and consults for the companies that make Byetta and other drugs Insulin tends to promote weight gain But certain types such as the longacting insulin Levemir have less extreme effects One study found that people gained nearly  pounds on average during their first three years taking insulin About half of the weight gain is thought to occur in the first three months Dr Cheskin calls the weightpromoting effect of insulin paradoxical The things that we use to treat some conditions that are the result of obesity like type  diabetes are prone to make you more obese he says Betablockers are among the goto drugs for high blood pressure but the older ones such as Tenormin Lopressor metoprolol and Inderal propranolol can expand the waistline One study found that people taking Tenormin gained about  more pounds than the placebo group and research suggests that most of the weight is gained in the first few months These drugs can slow calorie burning and cause fatigue Newer betablockers calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors are less likely to cause weight gain Dr Cheskin says Birthcontrol pills are often blamed for weight gain but it is largely unwarranted Dr Cheskin says In fact only the longacting progestinonly injectable called depot medroxyprogesterone acetate DMPA has been consistently linked with weight gain Research suggests that young women who were obese to begin with are most prone to weight gain on DMPA
