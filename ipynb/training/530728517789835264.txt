From a medical perspective a vasectomy is a simple procedure that takes about  minutes The doctor severs the vas deferens and then seals up both ends thus preventing sperm from reaching your semen It has a less than  failure rate compared with   making it an important option for men whose families are complete  And yet even though modern techniques require neither needle nor scalpel and for the vast majority of men it takes only a few days to recover its still a tough sell Yes there are places like New Zealand where  of men choose vasectomies but there are countries where the rate is   But if ease and effectiveness dont convince a man of the benefits of vasectomy there are many compelling sociological and health reasons as well For example   in the United States are unintended and these pregnancies come with   such as delayed prenatal care and an increased risk of premature birth   are also correlated with double the incidence of poverty in ninemember households than in fourmember households  And with all the controversy surrounding abortion theres no better way to avoid one than a vasectomy Sadly while men waffle on the sidelines more than  million women have had tubal ligations    having vasectomies even though tubal ligations are more invasive costly and risky While both procedures are almost equally effective tubal failures can result in ectopic pregnancies a   With all these reasons youd think for men who no longer wish to have children choosing a family planning option that is permanent safe and secure would be a nobrainer But if logic guilt or fairness did the trick wed be living on a planet much further away than Mars  The Swahili language uses the same word for vasectomy and castration and that sums up what so many men believe And its not just men  Many women would agree with a friend of mine who once suggested vasectomies change a mans status from alpha male to alphalite   Fear and good information might get a man to wear a condom but World Vasectomy Day needed compelling stories and there was no shortage of them There were men who traveled hundreds of miles to have the procedure for their wives and those who did it to help their children emerge from poverty These men who rise up and shoulder responsibility for family planning  although still the minority  serve as our inspiration    In my travels I met men in their s who know they dont want children and men in their s who do There was an Iraq War veteran who asked Why am I considered old enough to die or kill for my country but not old enough to decide about children These are tough questions Stein suggested he preserve some sperm  On World Vasectomy Day we dont decide who should or should not get a vasectomy but we do insist that it be voluntary We acknowledge there is a small chance that a vasectomy can cause long lasting pain and we certainly have great sympathy for these men A   also suggests a possible link between prostate cancer and vasectomies Its important to note that there are many other studies that    The bottom line is that all methods of birth control come with some element of risk The unfair part is that its women who take it on almost exclusively for one third of their lives  For all our efforts to inspire men it wasnt until we empowered the urologists and vasectomists who perform these procedures that our movement took off Providing vasectomies is not easy or always accepted but on Friday there will be approximately  skilled doctors from  countries participating in what will be the largest maleoriented family planning event in history   What we learned in creating World Vasectomy Day bodes well for our future Men reveal the best of who we are when we work together to serve a greater purpose one that honors ourselves our families and our future
