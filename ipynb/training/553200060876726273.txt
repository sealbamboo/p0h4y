Violence isnt the only problem with violent movies aimed at younger audiences  they also tend to glamorize risky activities you might not want to encourage among kids according to a new study We know some teenagers imitate what they see onscreen study leader   a research scientist at the University of Pennsylvanias Annenberg Public Policy Center explained in a statement What concerns us is that movies aimed at younger viewers are making a connection between violence and a variety of risky behaviors  sex drinking and smoking Lets start with the violence Bleakley and her colleagues at Penn analyzed  topgrossing movies released from  to  and found that  of them contained at least one instance of a main character committing an act of violence In these cases the aggressor makes or attempts to make some physical contact that has potential to inflict injury or harm according to their study which was published online Monday in the journal   You might expect movies with violent scenes to crop up more frequently in films that earned an R rating from the Motion Picture Assn of America than in movies geared toward schoolage kids but you would be wrong Among the  films with a G or PG rating included in the analysis  featured a main character who behaved violently the Penn group reported That was only slightly below the  rate for movies that got a PG label and the  rate for movies rated R None of the differences were large enough to be deemed statistically significant But that wasnt their only cause for concern Among the  of movies that portrayed violence  showed a main character engaging in another type of risky behavior immediately before during or after committing a violent act according to the study The most common example was pairing violence with sex a label that included nudity kissing on the lips sexual behavior and actual sex either explicit or implied This was seen in  of Rrated movies and  of movies rated PG Thats right  there was more sex and violence in movies with the lessrestrictive rating In case you were wondering violence was paired with sex in  of the G and PG movies too Just as frequent was the combination of violence and drinking which occurred in  of Rrated movies  of PGrated movies and  of PG and Grated movies Theres kind of a James Bond effect in which violence is glamorized in combination with other behaviors we otherwise try to discourage in youth study coauthor   director of the Adolescent Communication Institute at the Annenberg center said in the statement Indeed the researchers noted that the Bond films Quantum of Solace and Casino Royale were two of the PG movies examined in the study All of this is troubling because many studies have made a connection between watching movies TV shows and video games that feature violence drinking and other risky behaviors and trying those behaviors the authors write Research also shows that sensationseeking teens who are biologically predisposed to be attracted to novel and intense experiences prefer to watch higharousal movies which tend to be violent The  movies used in the study were picked from among the  topgrossing films according to the trade magazine Variety in the  years after the PG rating went into effect There were a couple of bright spots Smoking and other tobacco use declined from  of movies in  to only  in  Drinking declined too from  to  over the same period Depictions of explicit sex were much less common in PG movies than in Rrated ones though it did crop up in  of the PG movies analyzed But for the most part the researchers seemed disturbed by the pervasiveness of violence and other activities that arent appropriate for kids On average violent content accounted for almost  of films segments they wrote in the study Of the segments with violence  featured violence cooccurring with another risk behavior The researchers also lamented the phenomenon of ratings creep which they described as finding more explicit content in movies with lower ratings ie PG over time Their discovery that PG movies had essentially the same amount of violence drinking and sex as Rrated movies is consistent with research on the questionable effectiveness of the ratings system as a tool to shield youth from inappropriate content they wrote  Kate Bedingfield a spokeswoman for the Motion Picture Assn of America defended the ratings system as one designed to reflect the standards of American parents not set them The rating board tries to rate a film the way they believe a majority of American parents would rate it she said Societal standards change over time and the rating system is built to change with them Bedingfield also noted that a PG is a strong warning to parents about the content of a film and it is accompanied by a descriptor that gives parents specific detail about which elements of the film warranted the rating The findings come on the heels of another study by researchers at the Annenberg Public Policy Center that called the MPAAs movie ratings system into question It found that movies aimed at teenagers contain   than films made for adults That study was published last month and appeared in Pediatrics as
