There are two ways to look at results of a recent investigation of nursing homes by the US Department of Health and Human Services Both are pretty disturbing The investigation conducted by the HHS   looked at the cases of    who were disciplined for abuse neglect and theft at nursing homes in  All told  percent of the aides had prior criminal convictions that would have popped up on a background check On the one hand its troubling that a simple background check could have flagged aides with records that raised questions about their suitability for work taking care of vulnerable elderly people On the other hand it seems just as troubling that background checks wouldnt have given any clue about the other  percent of the disciplined nursing aides Nursing professor   at the University of California San Francisco said shes most disturbed by the fact that nursing homes had hired some aides whod been convicted of serious crimes such as assault battery and rape The first line of defense is to not put someone on the job whos been convicted of some awful crime she said The inspector general found that the majority of disciplined nurse aides with prior records had been convicted of burglary larceny or other crimes against property Only a tiny fraction had convictions for crimes against people However the investigation also found that before their respective nursing homes disciplined them three nurse aides had registered as sex offenders Harrington says nurse aides not to be confused with   often operate with little supervision are paid minimum wage and receive only a few weeks training They seem replaceable she said Most nursing homes are poorly staffed They dont have enough registered nurses Many of them only have one RN whos the director of nursing and theyre only on the day shift The Inspector Generals report  which can be read    was mandated by the   One of the laws  gave grants to states to support nursing homes background checks of employees This report is an evaluation of those grants
