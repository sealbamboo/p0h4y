You really want to know what itll take to work off Thanksgiving dinner Lets just say youd better cancel your plans to watch football after dinner or to go shopping on Friday unless you plan to make it an aerobic affair It could take you into the weekend to work off all that turkey stuffing gravy mashed potatoes and pie In a bid to focus Americans on controlling their weight the Food and Drug Administration has issued new standardized national rules on how calorie counts must be reported to consumers and by whom Public health advocates meanwhile have embraced offering all manner of helpful and eyecatching logos to draw consumers attention to betterforyou choices But theres mounting evidence that no form of consumer information conveys the potential effect of a food choice on ones weight quite as powerfully as do sweat equivalents Sweat equivalents leave little room for selfdelusion They dont require a hungry teenager at the corner grocery store to know how many calories a day she should be taking in or what percentage of that total a bag of potato chips represents They simply say If you eat this this is how long youd have to jog or swim or jump rope or play basketball to work it off Simple is good And in experiments posting sweat equivalents powerfully steered consumers toward water over sugarsweetened soda pretzels over chips salads over cheeseburgers In that vein   a service that connects athletes intent on stepping up their game with private coaches last year shared a handy graphic showing the sweat equivalents of a typical American Thanksgiving dinner I thought this year Id share it with you again The average American takes in  calories on Thanksgiving That is a lot of turkey stuffing gravy cranberry sauce creamed onions candied yams and pumpkin pie  actually about seven Big Macs worth of calories And here culled from reputable sources on the energy expenditure of various activities are a few of the activities you will have to engage in to work off the average American intake on Thanksgiving  Run or play basketball or football for  hours  Cycle for  hours  Row or hike for  hours  Swim for  hours or bowl for almost twice that long   hours Look you may be looking forward to spending hours on the elliptical machine this weekend or have plans anyway to run a marathon  or two But if you want to limit Thanksgivings damage you might try to alter what scientists call the energy balance equation calories taken in versus calories expended in activity a little on both sides Dont go back for thirds on Thanksgiving Day   plan a long hike or an epic game of flag football after the meal and run the next day Happy Thanksgiving
