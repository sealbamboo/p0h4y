Someone can train for a marathon and simultaneously qualify as a couch potato recent research shows raising provocative questions about how sedentary most of us really are The amount of time that most of us spend sitting has increased substantially in recent decades especially as computers and deskbound activities have come to dominate the workplace According to   the average American sits for at least eight hours a day Such prolonged sedentariness may have health consequences additional research shows A    older adults published in August for instance found that those who spent the most hours seated every day had a greater risk of high blood pressure elevated blood sugar a poor cholesterol profile and bodywide inflammation than those who sat the least no matter how much either group exercised which generally was not much So too a stark   of lifestyle health and death statistics from a large group of Australian adults concluded that every hour that someone spent watching television  a widely accepted marker of sitting time  after the age of  reduced his or her life span by almost  minutes More broadly in this analysis watching television for six hours or more per day shaved almost five years from a typical adults life span compared with someone who did not watch TV Life span was shortened even if someone met the standard medical recommendation of exercising moderately for  minutes or so on most days of the week But many highly active people including those completing their preparations for Sundays upcoming New York City Marathon probably feel immune from such concerns After all it seems reasonable enough to assume that multiple hours spent training must lessen the number of hours spent plopped in a chair Until recently however no studies had specifically examined whether people who are extremely active are on the whole also truly not sedentary  So scientists affiliated with the School of Public Health at the University of Texas at Austin recently   They began by contacting runners who had signed up for the local Austin marathon or halfmarathon More than  of the race entrants male and female agreed to participate The Texas researchers asked these volunteers to complete a questionnaire that precisely parsed how they spent their time each day We didnt want to look only at certain measures of sitting time such as television viewing said Geoffrey Whitfield who devised the study as a doctoral student at the University of Texas Instead the questionnaire asked about work commuting and telephone habits as well as time spent watching television or playing computer games It also asked the volunteers to enumerate how many hours they spent training each day and their anticipated race pace As expected the runners training as they were for a marathon or halfmarathon reported spending considerable time sweating On average they exercised vigorously for nearly seven hours per week which far exceeds the standard exercise recommendation said Dr Whitfield who is now an Epidemiological Intelligence Service Officer at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta But those hours of exercise do not seem to have reduced sedentary time On an average workday the runners reported sitting for more than  hours at the office and at home easily topping the national average Almost all of the participants were employed a few were students On nonworkdays the runners spent about eight hours inactive The researchers found no correlation between running pace or training volume and sedentary time fast runners and slow runners both sat equally often as did those who were putting in the most or the fewest hours each week training In effect the data showed that time spent exercising does not supplant time spent sitting said Harold Kohl a professor of epidemiology and kinesiology at the University of Texas and senior author of the study It seems that people can be simultaneously very active and very sedentary The study does not necessarily intimate however that being a marathon runner and couch potato is in any particular way harmful Dr Kohl pointed out He and his colleagues did not measure the runners health he said only their lifestyle It is impossible to say based on their data whether heavy training would ameliorate any undesirable effects of sitting or whether such effects even would occur in the supremely fit Still the findings are a cautionary reminder that many of us including the most physically active may be more sedentary than we imagine The fact is that exercise even at very high doses does not occupy much time in most peoples days said Dr Whitfield who himself used to train for triathlons And while the science about the health impacts of prolonged sitting may still be incomplete he said its pretty safe to say that it would a good idea for most of us to spend more of our time up and moving
