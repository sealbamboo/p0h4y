On bad nights I jolt awake at  am and settle in for what will be two hours of tossing and turning as I ponder the mundane did I remember to pack a belt for the meeting Im flying to in the morning the profound will my children grow to be happy and contributing adults and the prophetic On this night I thought about the patient I had been treating for three years for leukemia I would be seeing her in clinic in a few hours and I had a bad feeling about her disease She was in her s and even in the first few days after her diagnosis had an ability to cope that could best be described as fragile She cried easily at any mention of leukemia or the side effects to therapy flatly refusing tests or medications or procedures seemingly randomly and leaned heavily on her partner who often put his arm around her and encouraged her erratic decisionmaking  In full disclosure I suspect that were I to develop a serious illness I would behave no better and probably much worse  More important I never blame a patient for his or her conduct Rather it is my shortcoming if I cant figure out some clever way to adapt treatment plans to that behavior And in this respect I had failed her Its probably time we start those chemotherapy pills now I said to her two years earlier when she was still in a remission I dont think Im ready yet she replied as her partner rubbed her arm Lets wait until Im stronger I told her I was worried  the leukemia could come back if we waited too long I tried to be encouraging but also hoped the specter of relapse would trump her medication aversion Those pills are so big Ill never be able to swallow them she answered Her partner nodded in agreement You can cut them in half I offered She shook her head This really wasnt about the size of the pills Can I ask what are you afraid of  She started crying I dont want to die She cried louder as her partner wrapped his arm around her shoulders and whispered Its OK Its OK It didnt make sense of course If she didnt want to die she should be more open to treatment But she didnt take the pills and the leukemia came back It probably would have anyway but it was hard to watch someone not do everything to stop the cancer from recurring We treated her again and she went back into remission But then she would relapse again Each time the leukemia returned  she accepted therapy even demanding it Then she would refuse any more treatment once she was back in remission  I checked her labs on the computer before walking into the examination room to see her As I feared her white blood cell count had jumped to   times normal She had been through this so many times I had run out of treatment options  She looked tiny almost swaddled in the warm blankets the rooming nurse had given her as she sat in her wheelchair her partner by her side After greeting them both I started talking Your white blood cell count is high again Im afraid the leukemia is back again Im sorry She took a deep breath So whats next I walked them both through all the chemotherapy she had received over the years and all the times her leukemia like some unwelcome guest would come and go  Im afraid we dont have any chemotherapy left that will work I said as gently as I could Its probably time to talk about hospice I braced myself for her reaction but she was quiet Her partner who had become quite savvy about chemotherapy tried to negotiate some type of treatment for her but I held firm Finally she put her hand up to stop him Its OK she said quietly Lets go home I hugged them both goodbye  That night I awoke again at  am Most of my patients eventually have the same outcome as her with a refractory leukemia and no effective drugs And I knew going into this specialty that I would be unsuccessful at curing my patients the majority of the time   But I felt like I failed her because for all the time I knew her I never could figure out her wishes her goals to determine if the treatment I was prescribing was what she really wanted Did I give her time on this earth she wouldnt have had otherwise Or heedlessly administer chemotherapy when all she wanted was to just let go I guess Ill never know
