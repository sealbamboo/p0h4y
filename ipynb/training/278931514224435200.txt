One of the few times we hear about autopsies these days is when a celebrity dies But postmortem investigations do more than satisfy our curiosity about Whitney Houston or   Autopsies tell communities why people are dying Take for example West Nile Virus When eight New Yorkers died of brain infections in  most everyone assumed they had a common virus But New York Citys medical examiners insisted on autopsies And what do you know they discovered the   of West Nile Virus In many places around the world though there arent enough doctors available to perform routine autopsies So its tough to figure out whats hurting people and where money should be spent to improve health Thats where something called a verbal autopsy might help says Swedish epidemiologist   Byass and his team at Umea University have been working on the technique for about a decade Their latest version combines a simple interview with hightech   to deduce a cause of death Most people who live in rural areas of the world die in their homes and havent seen a doctor Byass says So after a death a community nurse or field worker goes to the familys home and asks some questions What happened before the death Was the person bitten by insects or snakes Did she have a rash Swollen feet The answers are fed into a computer model which then churns out a list of what likely killed the person Its not that different from what a physician does in his head when hes filling out a death certificate Byass says Its the mathematical equivalent of that process For some diseases like the measles and malnutrition the algorithms are almost as good as a trained doctor at pinpointing the cause of death Byass and his team recently tested how good their technique is at picking out deaths from AIDS Although the results arent finalized yet he says it looks like the algorithm can accurately say if a person dies of AIDS about  percent of the time AIDS deaths are complicated Byass says This isnt easy And for other diseases with similar symptoms like malaria and pneumonia verbal autopsies have led to   These mistakes have made some clinicians skeptical about the technique Verbal autopsies give you a broad picture of whats happening in a community   of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine tells Shots When you get specific details then people are probably overusing the tool Even a trained doctors conclusions about death often dont match up with that of a real physical autopsy Greenwood says Unless you do a very careful postmortem examination  chop them up and do pathology  its really hard to tell cause of death Still though some information is better than none Byass says In the US and Europe we take for granted why people die but  percent of deaths around the world arent recorded Knowing how someone dies is indispensible information for a community when its deciding how to allocate precious healthcare resources Byass says What diseases should you target for vaccines Where should you be spending money Without the data youre guessing really So far the use of verbal autopsies has been limited to small research projects But the World Health Organization is now pushing to make it   in places where deaths arent recorded Byass says his group is even getting ready to release a smartphone app that deduces cause of death
