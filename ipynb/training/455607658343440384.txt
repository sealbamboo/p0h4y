It was late almost  at night when Justin Holden pulled the icy pizza box from the refrigerator at the Brookville Supermarket in Washington DC He stood in front of the open door scanning the nutrition facts label A close relative had recently had a heart attack and in the back of his mind there was this idea stalking him If he put too much salt in his body it would eventually kill him For this reason the information in the label wasnt exactly soothing  milligrams of sodium seemed like a lot But there was even worsesounding stuff at the bottom of the label Words like diglyceride with a string of letters that clearly had no business sitting next to each other It suggested that something deeply unnatural was sitting inside the box Obviously its not good for me the ish Holden said But hopefully I can let it slide in He tucked the pizza under his arm and headed one aisle over for a sports drink Who among us has not had a moment like this That intimate teteatete with the nutrition label searching out salt sugar fat trying to discern How will you affect me Are you good Or are you bad Heres the thing you probably havent stopped to consider how the label  is affecting you Labels are not just labels they evoke a set of beliefs says   a clinical psychologist who does research at the Columbia Business School in New York A couple of years ago Crum found herself considering what seems like a pretty strange question She wanted to know whether the information conveyed by a nutritional label could physically change what happens to you  whether these labels get under the skin literally she says and actually affect the bodys physiological processing of the nutrients that are consumed As a student Crum had spent years studying the placebo effect  how a sugar pill can physically alter a body if the person taking the pill believes it will She figured food labels might work the same way So she came up with an experiment Crum created a huge batch of French vanilla milkshake then divided it into two batches that were labeled in two very different ways Half the stuff was put into bottles labeled as a lowcalorie drink called Sensishake  advertised as having zero percent fat zero added sugar and only  calories The other half was put into bottles that were labeled as containing an incredibly rich treat called Indulgence According to the label Indulgence had all kinds of things that wouldnt benefit your upper thighs  including enough sugar and fat to account for  calories In truth the shakes had  calories each Both before and after the people in the study drank their shakes nurses measured their levels of a hormone called   Ghrelin is a hormone secreted in the gut People in the medical profession call it the hunger hormone When ghrelin levels in the stomach rise that signals the brain that its time to seek out food It also slows metabolism Crum says just in case you might not find that food But after your ghrelin rises and you have a big meal say a cheeseburger and a side of fries then your ghrelin levels drop That signals the mind Crum says that youve had enough here and Im going to start revving up the metabolism so we can burn the calories weve just ingested On the other hand if you only have a small salad your ghrelin levels dont drop that much and metabolism doesnt get triggered in the same way For a long time scientists thought ghrelin levels fluctuated in response to nutrients that the ghrelin met in the stomach So put in a big meal ghrelin responds one way put in a small snack and it responds another way But thats not what Crum found in her   If you believed you were drinking the indulgent shake she says your body responded as if you had consumed much more The ghrelin levels dropped about three times more when people were consuming the indulgent shake or thought they were consuming the indulgent shake she says compared to the people who drank the sensible shake or thought thats what they were drinking Does that mean the facts dont matter that its what we  of the facts that matters I dont think I would go that far yet Crum says More tests need to be done she says to figure out exactly how much influence comes from food and mindset But she does think the usual metabolic model  calories in and calories out  might need some rethinking because it doesnt account in any way for our beliefs about our food Our beliefs matter in virtually every domain in everything we do Crum says How much is a mystery but I dont think weve given enough credit to the role of our beliefs in determining our physiology our reality We have this very simple metabolic science calories in calories out People dont want to think that our beliefs have influence too she says But they do As for Holden after he retrieved his sports drink he picked up a salad then carried his items to the cashier and put them down on the conveyor belt The liquid of his sports drink almost glowed under the lights of the store as the cashier rang him up Holden told the man he didnt want a bag He carried his pizza out into the night Within an hour the pizza and drink would be in his stomach mingling there with a set of beliefs that he got from the back of a box
