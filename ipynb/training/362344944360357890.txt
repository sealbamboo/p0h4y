Before Rep Jaime Herrera Beutlers baby was even born the odds seemed against her surviving She hadnt developed kidneys which meant she didnt produce urine which is the main ingredient of amniotic fluid Without amniotic fluid a babys lungs cant develop properly But today little Abigail Rose who was born  weeks early on July  is surprising her doctors She may be the very first baby with Potters Syndrome to survive says Dr Steven Alexander one of Abigails physicians and a professor of pediatrics at Stanford school of medicine and chief of the division of pediatric nephrology and director of nephrology at the Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital at Stanford Shes certainly one of a kind he says About one in every  fetuses has Potters syndrome Alexander says Until Abigail none have survived to his knowledge Doctors dont know why some babies such as Abigail dont develop kidneys Without amniotic fluid to fill up the sac babies are literally squashed by the uterine walls Alexander explains adding that these babies generally end up with distorted skulls and club feet  The lethal part though is that they cant develop lungs without fetal urine which makes up twothirds of the amniotic fluid Alexander says Not only does the amniotic fluid keep the lungs from being compressed but it is also necessary for normal lung development The baby inhales the fluid which expands the lungs like a water balloon When Abigails parents heard the heartbreaking diagnosis they werent ready to give up They sought a second and then a third opinion  this one at Johns Hopkins Medical Center To confirm the babys diagnosis by ultrasound perinatologist Dr Jessica Bienstock had to inject fluid into the amniotic sac according to a statement released by Hopkins On the ultrasound Bienstock saw the same thing the earlier doctors had seen a baby without kidneys who had a deformed chest and head due to the lack of amniotic fluid Bienstock asked the congresswoman to return for a second ultrasound a week later That ultrasound showed that some of the fluid from the infusion still remained in the sac and amazingly the baby seemed to have taken a turn for the better Her head and chest seemed to be developing normally and she was moving around actively Herrera Beutler asked for another infusion After informing the congresswoman of all the risks  not to mention the overwhelming likelihood that the baby would die  Bienstock agreed to a second infusion in hopes that this would allow the babys lungs to develop The treatment worked and Bienstock repeated it several times This case is unprecedented Bienstock a professor of maternalfetal medicine in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said in the statement It would be premature to say that fetuses that dont have kidneys should always be treated using serial amnioinfusion but this suggest it can be part of the conversation when that is the diagnosis Those treatments are what gave little Abigail a fighting chance Alexander says The down side to the treatments was that Abigail was born premature The remarkable thing about this baby is that her lungs are completely normal at this stage Alexander says Because Abigail has functioning lungs she can get dialysis  and eventually maybe even a kidney transplant Thats the treatment that is currently being offered to babies born with damaged kidneys that work well enough to at least allow their lungs to develop Alexander says I wouldnt call it standard of care but it is available in major childrens hospitals here and in Canada and Europe he adds While that might mean a long wait for a donor organ its possible that someone in Abigails family will be the right match for her and then there can be a living kidney donation The advantage to that is that you can then schedule the transplant Alexander says If a living donation is not in the cards then shell have to be matched with a deceased donor
