
 For almost two decades Lisha Hancock smoked between one and two packs of cigarettes a day Her husband often urged her to quit but neither his pleading nor the fact that several of her relatives died from smokingrelated complications could persuade Ms Hancock to stop The smoke she inhaled constantly bothered her throat and clogged her sinuses Rather than give up smoking though Ms Hancock started taking an antihistamine so she could ease the irritation in her throat and continue lighting up Then she saw   featuring a former smoker Terri Hall who developed head and neck cancer The widely seen advertisement shows Ms Hall inserting a set of false teeth and placing a small speaker inside a hole in her neck It scared me because I had always had problems with my throat said Ms Hancock  who lives in Kentucky When I saw that it made me realize that there are other types of cancer besides lung cancer and that really hit home for me The ad prompted her to give up smoking about eight months ago using a combination of an exercise and healthful eating regimen along with nicotine lozenges and she has not had a cigarette since But Ms Hancock may be just one of thousands of Americans who quit smoking after seeing the commercial featuring Ms Hall which was part of a series of antismoking ads put out by the federal government last year The campaign called   was notable both for its raw images and because it marked the first time that the government directly attacked the tobacco industry in paid nationwide advertisements According to   published on Monday in The Lancet the ads may have prompted more than  Americans to give up smoking for good The study led by a team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed  Americans before and after the campaign including  smokers The paid ads ran for three months beginning in March just after the New Year resolution season when the percentage of smokers trying to quit is typically on the decline The researchers found that over all four of five of smokers had seen the commercials and the percentage who reported trying to quit rose by  percent Of those who tried to quit about  percent remained abstinent after the campaign had ended Using census data the researchers estimated that as many as  million smokers nationwide attempted to quit as a result of the ad campaign Most smokers require several attempts before they give up cigarettes for good so only a fraction of those who were motivated by the campaign would have succeeded The ads were expected to spur about  smokers to quit permanently but the Lancet study estimated that twice that number were successful We had very ambitious goals for this program said Dr Thomas Frieden the director of the CDC and it succeeded beyond our highest hopes Historically about half of the nations  million smokers try to quit every year and yet cessation rates hover around  percent annually Public health officials have long been telling smokers that cigarettes shave years off your life contributing to more than  deaths every year The new campaign went in a different direction focusing not on death but on quality of life The creators of the campaign used focus groups and feedback from smokers to develop sobering ads showing real smokers with amputations paralysis and disfigurement from heart and lung surgeries I think the fact that you may die is not highly motivating to people Dr Frieden said The fact that the remainder of your life may be very unpleasant is and thats what the data shows Not only do smokers die about ten years younger than most people but they feel about ten years older than their age The campaign last year cost about  million and was paid for by the Affordable Care Act Another series of ads ran earlier this year at a cost of roughly  million and according to the CDC the ads will be returning next year as well Dr Frieden said the money which is only a fraction of the  billion the tobacco industry spends on marketing and promotion every year was well spent This is a campaign that has literally saved tens of thousands of lives he said We would like to be able to have hardhitting campaigns like this on the air year round The tobacco industry spends what we spent on this campaign in three days In   in March Ms Hall said she is often approached by former smokers who recognize her from the commercials and thank her for prompting them to quit One more person who would like to shake her hand is Ms Hancock I would say to her thank you for putting yourself out there and being so brave when I know shes so vulnerable because it changed my life she said When I saw her commercial I could see the regret and disappointment in her eyes As a smoker I could feel it because thats exactly how I felt every time I picked up a pack of cigarettes
