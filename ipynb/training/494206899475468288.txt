 Sarepta Therapeutics Inc., which is seeking U.S. regulatory approval for a drug to treat a rare childhood disease, recently moved to limit Chief Executive Chris Garabedian's broad sway over operations, especially his role in discussions with the Food and Drug Administration.. The step was taken in response to the concerns of some company executives who worried Mr. Garabedian's involvement in the regulatory discussions was counterproductive, according to people familiar with the matter.
