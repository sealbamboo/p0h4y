Mid State Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Center is hard to miss The   new squarefoot building is marked with an enormous sign along one of the main roads in Alexandria a central Louisiana city of about  people In the elegant highceilinged interior the medical practices  doctors see about  patients daily to bring in  million in revenue each year Its a highly successful operation But when practice administrator Spencer Michael started here two years ago the business was struggling with a common problem collecting payments from patients The recent economic downturn and the increasing use of highdeductible insurance plans has driven patients to want to put off paying their bills Michael explains Whether its for a hip replacement or a broken bone he frequently sees patients on the hook for a  to  deductible We have to be able to be the creditor says Michael Were essentially a bank at that point Between  and  multispecialty practices saw their bad debt go up  percent according to a survey by the   a trade organization for doctor practices Thats money that practices were owed but couldnt collect Some of them have begun to change their billing strategies to combat those debts says   a principal consultant with the MGMA Health Care Consulting Group In the past someone at the front desk would say Would you like to pay today Because the simple answer to that is Well no If I can walk out without paying Im walking out without paying  Hertz says Today its more of Mr Smith you have an outstanding balance How would you like to pay for that  One option for the doctors is to send patients who dont pay their bills to collection agencies faster In the past doctors tended to wait a full  days before taking action But that could mean that patients who were well past the treatments didnt feel the import of settling the debt according to Hertz Thats six months Im feeling a lot better Six months Beat me up try to collect from me says Hertz He is encouraging practices to send patients to collections after six to eight weeks instead Another option is to collect the payments before a procedure even happens  an approach that Hertz says has proved particularly effective at   On a recent morning Gayle JacksonPryce  who pays her bills on time stopped by the practice as a patient  to have her shoulder checked I was on a business trip and I picked up my luggage and immediately thought Ooh did I tear something  she recalls Dr Michael Leddy tells her she needs surgery on her shoulder As she leaves the exam room she passes the billing desk where she pays her  copay for the office visit Then as she heads out of the building she passes a second payment desk where Deanna Tharp sits  one of two employees at Mid State Orthopaedic whose sole job is to collect payments from patients often even before they have surgery Tharp has an incentive to do it well the more she collects the bigger her bonus will be Tharp starts with the practices electronic record system This is the rotary cuff repair code this is the price for it this is Dr Leddys price she explains to JacksonPryce The system can access a patients insurance details to find out exactly how much shell owe The total for the orthopedists portion of JacksonPryces surgery comes to  Once the insurance companys portion is deducted JacksonPryce will owe the doctor a total of  JacksonPryce says shell be able to pay the total amount upfront although the practice recommended she wait a few days so they could doublecheck her deductible For those who cant pay upfront Tharp can help them set up a payment plan Patients who still cant make it work are advised to seek treatment instead at the local safetynet hospital Hospitals usually offer some sort of charity program to help lowincome patients  for care but thats not the case for most private physicians practices The doctors at Mid State do offer some free care when they can says practice administrator Michael but at the end of the day this is still a business and we do have to keep the lights on Soon patients will be offered an even faster payment option In the waiting room theyll be handed a tablet computer thats attached to a device that takes credit cards and be given the option to store their payment information for future bills The upfront payment model is working well for the medical practice bad debt at Mid State Orthopaedic has gone down by  percent over the past two years But when patients hand over that kind of cash Michael says they expect to get what they paid for  like the fancy new building which he acknowledges drives up the cost of care But thats the expectation of patients these days And if we cant make that happen theyre going to go where they can get that he says JacksonPryce says its the quality of the doctors she cares about not the amenities Im old dont you know that Old people dont get concerned about buildings We figure were paying for it Oh boy I gotta pay more cause the building is nice she says with a laugh After nine surgeries across the course of her life she says shes used to paying a portion of her medical bills So she always sets  aside for unexpected expenses But she says that kind of money can cramp your style I never thought I would look forward to Medicare but I do she says Yes I do
