Twentyfive years ago minister Edwina Currie sparked a scare over salmonella in eggs and had to resign amid outrage from farmers and plummeting sales The panic has shaped the way we think about food safety  There are foods that people instinctively associate with the risk of poisoning  raw chicken raw egg shellfish  At the time of Edwina Curries remarks  which were perceived to have dramatically exaggerated the prevalence of the disease in eggs in the UK  there were  cases of the salmonella PT strand most commonly found in poultry It dropped by  in the three years following the introduction of the British Lion scheme in  which saw hens vaccinated against salmonella and last year there were just  reported cases But people are still mistrustful  Pregnant women the elderly and young children are warned against eating a runny yolk and forums on parenting websites contain discussion threads on the perils of raw cake mix The saying was that salmonella and eggs go together like a horse and carriage says Sarah OBrien professor of Infection Epidemiology and Zoonoses at the University of Liverpool But thats not the case Improved testing methods and improved treatment mean foods that used to be unusual causes of outbreaks have become the usual suspects Its impossible to precisely tally the number of cases caused by each type of food but from what is known there are some lessexpected culprits    and   are believed to have been behind some of the most high profile outbreaks of food poisoning recently People have died after eating contaminated     and    One of the more unusual outbreaks of food poisoning happened in  in the French town of PontSaintEsprit Five people died and many suffered hallucinations after eating rye bread contaminated by ergot a poisonous fungus Ergot poisoning is thankfully easily avoided  Any food can be poisonous if it is not prepared or stored correctly says Dr Haruna Musa Moda of the Food Research Centre at Manchester Metropolitan University Chicken eggs and shellfish are classed as high risk but so are rice pasta couscous  starchy foods that have high moisture content Ready meals and cooked meats are also on the high risk list but people dont tend to think about them so much Many people are completely unaware of the dangers of eating reheated rice or pasta Our perception of the risks is shaped by highprofile incidents Curries remark that most of the egg production in this country sadly is now affected with salmonella caused a  drop in egg sales and she was forced to resign The loss of revenue meant four million hens were slaughtered But while the industry recovered the eggs reputation for potential menace was longer lasting Salmonella in UK eggs is now very rare but the official line that raw egg should be avoided will remain It is about knowing that the risk exists even if it is small says Bob Martin of the Food Standards Agency  Despite episodes like the Sainsburys watercress recall it is hard for people to understand that nonanimal products can be a risk  Beansprouts  including aduki alfalfa lentils and mung beans  have been associated with   including an outbreak of salmonella in the UK in  Salad leaves and green leafy vegetables can become contaminated with bugs like salmonella and Ecoli O from the soil adds OBrien Bagged salad in particular can have bugs that stick to the cut edge of the leaf  that is where the nutrients are and the bugs can be quite hard to get rid of by washing There are around one million cases of food poisoning each year according to the Food Standards Agency The majority are caused by the bug Campylobacter  commonly found in uncooked poultry it is thought to be present in the vast majority of chickens But rice is also a common cause It can contain Bacillus cereus which is resistant to heat Its one that a lot of people dont know about but you do have to be very careful with rice says Martin Its not that rice itself is dangerous but after its been cooked there are spores of bacteria that can germinate The advice is to cool it quickly if it is likely to be eaten later Take the worst of the heat out but then put it in the fridge it doesnt need to be room temperature any more  fridges have improved adds Martin He also advises spreading it in shallow dishes to speed up cooling or more simply just cook the amount you want to eat Its a very bad idea to eat rice thats been sitting in a buffet at room temperature after being cooked Any reheating at home should be thorough but is only safe   There is also official advice on the preparation on greens and salad Wash vegetables under water rather than under a tap so germs are not sprayed around the kitchen Vegetables should also be washed before they are peeled Bear in mind that vegetables come from the soil which is a living thing In some farms they are grown in soil with animal manure adds Martin   The basic message is that all food should be treated with respect dont abuse it dont expect too much from it
