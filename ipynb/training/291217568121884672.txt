Is it OK for your doctor to tweet a drunken photo What if the photo shows the doctor drinking say at a staff holiday party but not noticeably under the influence Or what if the festive physician is wearing scrubs in the photo which might imply he was drinking on the job The answers to those questions according to the people responsible for disciplining doctors definitely not probably and maybe To help medical professionals navigate online dos and donts a group of researchers sent surveys to the directors of state medical licensing boards across the country The surveys contained hypothetical examples of social media activity including tweets and posts to Facebook and blogs The researchers asked the directors to say whether these social media activities would prompt board investigations The fictional social media concocted by the researchers ranged from the innocuous to the ridiculous In addition to the doconabender photo shown at the top of this story the researchers included a doctor using a dating site to ask a patient out and a photo posted to a doctors website of a patient in stirrups delivering a baby These fictional examples were based on things medical boards told us they were concerned about says   an assistant professor at the University of California San Francisco who designed the survey Its not hard to find images just like the ones we used with just some limited searching In the past year or two various medical associations have issued social media   for doctors But they were very vague It was like use your common sense  says   who worked with Greysen on the survey A lot of people wanted to know more specifics The results of this survey   in the latest issue of   make it clear that some things posted online will almost always get doctors in trouble More than  percent of the boards that responded said a doctor posting a clearly misleading claim on his website  something like I can cure your cancer  guaranteed  would be cause for an investigation Its not  percent which gives you some pause says   an internist at the University of Chicago Medical Center whos active on social media What triggers an investigation in those states If this doesnt do it what does Arora says she was more interested in the areas where medical boards hadnt reached a consensus For example slightly less than half of the boards said they would investigate a doctor for posting disrespectful language toward his or her patients on a blog Ultimately Arora says this survey and others like it will be helpful for doctors who want to start using social media but are worried about jeopardizing their careers I feel like some of the mistakes we see are rookie mistakes she says Thats when youre still navigating the appropriateness of social media People who have been using social media for a long time dont usually get caught up in this kind of issue
