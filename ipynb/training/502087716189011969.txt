Good morning. While Mr. Pharmalot, Ed Silverman, is away, we have brewed our own morning blend of news. Here’s what caught our eye:. Genzyme, a Sanofi unit, has been selling Cerezyme for the rare disease, but Cerezyme must be infused. Cerdelga will be priced on par with Cerezyme’s $300,000 a year pricetag.. Meantime, Mylan, which got FDA approval to sell is generic, filed a motion to intervene in the case, attacking Hospira’s tactics.
