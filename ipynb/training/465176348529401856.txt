If you ask me to boil down the modern doctorpatient relationship to its most basic elements cholesterol pretty much sums it up No single concept has permeated American medical culture to the extent of our anxiety about cholesterol It doesnt matter if youre old or young male or female rich or poor educated or not Whether you love Americanstyle hightech medical care or forswear it for an Easternoriented herbal approach patients from all perspectives come to me and fret about their cholesterol Take Mimi a yearold mother of two She works out regularly and is in great shape I call her a percenter She exercises doesnt smoke and controls her weight Her health is better than  percent of my patients Still she wants a physical just to make sure things are OK When I ask her to describe what it means to be OK she tells me she wants the results of a cholesterol test Ray a yearold retired foreman comes in every few months for help with diabetes and an enlarged prostate Hes already on a cholesterollowering   and his numbers have been in the normal range for years Even so he asks me to check his cholesterol at every visit I dont He craves the reassurance Ruth is a frail something She has fallen numerous times and has fractured vertebrae because of her thin brittle bones At a recent appointment her daughter asked me to check Moms cholesterol When I gently ask what difference itll make she answers So we can do something about it Clearly patients and caregivers alike have bought into the cholesterol hypothesis This is the theory that a high level of cholesterol in the blood increases ones risk of atherosclerosis and in turn heart disease This idea has been around for decades Its something we can readily   and it has an appealing logic to it Theres strong   in favor of the theory including several studies that show people that have existing cardiovascular disease can lower their risk of heart attack and death by taking cholesterollowering drugs And one thing is indisputable heart disease is still the   in America So perhaps its not surprising then that Get your cholesterol checked has become close to a collective medical mantra Patients line up to get tested and we doctors are happy to oblige them A cholesterol test has become a marker of medical virtue For patients like Mimi Ray and Ruth for whom checking cholesterol isnt appropriate the test often becomes a proxy for other health concerns As a mentor of mine used to quip It gets them in the door and at least starts the discussion  even if it moves in a totally different direction But cholesterol isnt a disease Its what we euphemistically label as a    one of the types we can control as opposed to for example the genetic traits we inherit from our parents And though strong medical evidence compels us to treat certain patients for high cholesterol its much less clear what to do with those of us who have higher cholesterol in the absence of additional risk factors such as heart disease diabetes obesity smoking or high blood pressure To make matters more complicated the latest   about who should get treated  and how aggressively  are mired in controversy as is frequently   when scientific dogma is called into question Like a lot of my    and patients  Im struggling with the cholesterol guidelines released last November Do I really need to be treating so many   with statins And what about the idea advanced by the guideline that we no longer need to follow the numbers quite as slavishly as the old advice suggested Under the previous recommendations we evaluated the patient checked the cholesterol and then decided whether it was necessary to prescribe pills or not Checking the numbers again in three months gave us all the facile satisfaction of seeing improvement We were   Now without our trusty lab numbers as signposts were struggling to find our balance If as the new guidelines suggest we treat more patients with statins we can expect to reduce the number of heart attacks But inevitably we will also cause harm because statins paradoxically raise the risk of developing diabetes And Ive seen many patients on statins with beautifully normal lab results also have unexplained muscular pain that only gets better when we discontinue the drug All of which is to say that the longer I practice medicine the more convinced Im becoming that less is often more
