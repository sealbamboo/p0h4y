In a highly unusual step the Food and Drug Administration has released a   it conduct this month of the Massachusetts pharmacy at the center of a national outbreak of fungal infections FDA officials say the   own environmental monitoring showed multiple instances of bacterial and fungal contamination of two clean rooms going back nearly nine months before an outbreak of meningitis linked to one the companys drugs The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention    people in  states have suffered fungal infections linked to the companys drugs Most were cases of meningitis and stroke but five have been infections of knees elbows or other joints Twentyfive people have died The investigators  observed that no documented corrective actions were taken when the firms own environmental monitoring showed microbial contamination above its action limit Steven Lynn of the FDA told reporters on a conference call Friday afternoon An action limit is a threshold measurement of contamination above what would typically be seen in a controlled sterile environment Lynn says He is the FDAs director of manufacturing and product quality In some instances the petri dishes used to grow microbes present in environmental samples  taken from window sills equipment furniture floors and other surfaces  were overflowing with bacteria or fungi in sheets very visible to the naked eye Lynn says Yet FDA inspectors say the company didnt even bother to investigate what the microbes were Attempts to contact the companys attorney were not successful The companys foreknowledge of contamination problems and its failure to act are probably the most damning findings to come out of federal and state investigations of the Massachusetts company a socalled compounding pharmacy FDA officials repeatedly refused to answer reporters many questions about the implications of their findings saying they dont want to compromise an ongoing investigation Boston US Attorney Carmen Ortiz has already opened a   of the New England Compounding Center And Massachusetts Gov Deval Patrick   the company misled state officials by manufacturing drugs in bulk and shipping them nationally without a valid prescription for each patient receiving the drug as it is required to do under its license as a compounding pharmacy Drug manufacturers are supposed to be licensed by the FDA and are subject to far more stringent standards called Good Manufacturing Practice and regular inspections Earlier this week Massachusetts officials   of their own investigation of the New England Compounding Center conducted jointly with the FDA But the newly released federal inspection report known as a Form  contains considerably more detail about conditions at the Framingham Mass plant  and the extent of contamination in vials of the steroid methylprednisolone acetate the drug involved in most of the fungal infections For instance The inspectors also noted that the air conditioning units serving the clean rooms where drugs are formulated were customarily turned off overnight Lynn says this is not typical practice for a clean room since temperatures need to be kept constant to retard microbial growth The FDA also noted that the pharmacy is abutted to the rear and along the left parking area by a recycling facility that handles such materials as mattresses and plastics Rooftop airhandling units for the pharmacy were located about  feet from the dusty recycling facility Inspectors said an autoclave  used to sterilize equipment used in manufacturing  had puddles of water in the base of its chamber a possible source of microbial growth The report cites many instances of greenish yellow yellowish greenish and dark residues on equipment and surfaces A boiler  feet from the entrance to a prep room was leaking water and wet floor surfaces around the boiler appeared to be soiled with thick white debris and thick black granular material the report said FDA officials refused to characterize the seriousness of what they found although Paul Teitell the agencys acting director of operations for its Office of Medical Products and Tobacco said Manufacturers and compounding firms have the responsibility to manufacture quality drugs and ensure there is no breakdown in supplies or processes that would cause contamination
