The fight against Ebola in West Africa suffered a setback Wednesday Dr Sheik Umar Khan one of the top doctors treating patients caught the virus even though he was wearing protective gear Even with the full protective clothing you put on Khan has said you are at risk That statement made us wonder about those yellow and white suits you see in photos Just how good are they at protecting health workers from the bodily fluids that can transmit the virus  vomit blood sweat mucus To learn more about the gear known as PPE Personal Protective Equipment we spoke with   the medical adviser to   for hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola The yellow suit that MSF Medecins Sans Frontieres uses is made of a woven plastic fiber And they throw a laminate on it Its very fluid impervious But to work it has to be used in conjunction with a set of behaviors and procedures Where we see health care worker infections when the PPE is in place the worker did something to override the PPE They didnt wear it appropriately or contaminated their hands in the process of getting the suit off The presumed way you get sick is virus gets into a mucus membrane inside your mouth nose or eyes If you were very very good about keeping your hands off your face you could probably get away with more exposed skin above the neck But we like to cover health workers from the neck up So when the hand goes to the face in an unconscious movement it doesnt touch anything Yes You can stick yourself with a needle you can use your gear improperly or you can undress improperly Lets say youre wearing some sort of material that covers you from the neck down  something thats permeable  and somebody vomited on your sleeve and fluid got through and got on your arm Honestly you should be OK It wont get on you in a large volume The vomit dries out and the virus becomes inactive Ebola doesnt last very long on a clean dry surface But if youre caring for somebody and have virus on your hands getting it into your nose eyes or mouth is fairly common So we wear the DuPont products that are fairly fluid resistant It doesnt weigh all that much  a few ounces really Its just that theyre suffocating If you wear something very fluidresistant its also very airresistant Its hotter than hell Youre unable to wear the PPE for more than  or  minutes in tropical heat The ideal suit would offer enough protection to keep filoviruses such as Ebola out but let in a certain amount of air flow Some newer suits are more impermeable up in the front more breathable in the back I havent had the chance to look at them Its shaking things up A lot of people know Dr Khan He is a fun guy He is fascinated by Ebola He wasnt mailing it in He wasnt doing his job just to get through the day Youd go visit him in Kenema where he worked in the hospital hed be like Hey take a look at this And with his digital camera hed show you a rash he saw on a patient Hed say I just saw that patient an hour ago Im going to write this one up He took great pleasure in his work and brought an infectious enthusiasm Hes a pleasant person to talk to He wasnt one of these people who put on airs Youre familiar with all of the character failings of doctors and the stereotypes  he didnt fit into any of those Cross my fingers
