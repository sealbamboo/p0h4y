Too few toddlers are having the seasonal flu vaccine warns the chief medical officer for England  show fewer than one third of two to fouryearolds are getting the nasal spray The uptake is down on the same point last year the first time children were routinely immunised against flu  Public Health England said that young children were superspreaders and stopping flu in children would protect their parents and grandparents Last winter was a relatively mild flu season and health agencies have already warned of complacency when it comes to getting immunised  More than two million toddlers are being targeted in vaccination campaigns But immunisation rate data up to  November shows Figures also released by Public Health Wales show   there  Part of the problem is awareness Two and threeyearolds were vaccinated for the first time last winter and the programme has been extended to fouryearolds this year  But Prof Dame Sally Davies the chief medical officer for England said half of mums were unaware that the vaccine existed or that children needed vaccinating every year She said Flu can be really nasty for toddlers leading to time off nursery which has a big impact on mums and dads and sometimes even a stay in hospital   They also spread the virus easily and often pass flu to grandparents and other relatives who can become very ill fast Giving two three and four year olds the free nasal spray really is in everyones interests if you want to help avoid a miserable winter for all the family Children get a different vaccine from that given to other atrisk groups such as elderly people pregnant women and those with other conditions that affect their health  The vaccine for children contains a weakened form of the live flu virus which is sprayed up the nose whereas the traditional flu jab contains dead virus and is injected in the arm  The ambition is to gradually extend vaccination to all two to yearolds On average every person with flu passes on the infection to two people every two days  And children are more likely than most to spread flu The vaccination programme is aimed at reducing flu in children and in turn cutting cases in atrisk groups Prof Nick Phin from Public Health England told the BBC This is a new programme last year was the first year and the figure was just over  which for the first year of a new programme is really good We use the term superspreaders theyre very effective at spreading flu The amount of virus you get from a child is much higher than an adult and they shed the virus for much longer Children are very effective at spreading flu You just need to look at a child with a cold  the dripping nose they wipe their hand across their face and then touch something Symptoms of flu include fever sore throat aching muscles and extreme tiredness
