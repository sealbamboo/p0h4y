The stars may have been shining in Berkeley that late summers night but I couldnt see them I was doubled over in my backyard puking with the gutsearing spasms of a chemo patient  This was not how my life was supposed to be Only six months earlier I had been following a wellordered routine as a history grad student up every day at  am to walk the exact same route from my apartment on the Southside to the Universitys outdoor pool By  Id be slicing through the crisp water with an even crisper stroke From there Id head over to Doe Library arriving precisely at  Afternoons were spent teaching undergrads and more nights than most I fell asleep in my boyfriend Noahs arms  My routine gave me structure and comfort  the way I imagine a strait jacket might feel to someone who is not struggling to get out  The first hint that my tidy life was in danger had come earlier that year when on my nightly route home from the library a man had stuck a pistol into my ribs demanding my nearempty wallet I was only a grad student and my cheap watch ditto He nuzzled the gun deeper into my side roughly pushing me in the direction of Peoples Park a dark hole known for drug trafficking and violent crime  No good can come of this I realized as I quickly assessed the situation A moment later I saw a car approaching and ran toward it screaming for help Stop or Ill shoot I heard the gunman shout as I rolled over the car hood and landed on the pavement more disoriented than hurt as the sedan sped away When I looked back to where the gunman had stood  no one Into the park disappeared For a few days after this bungled assault sat with me as just another pedestrian example of urban crime Lucky for me it hadnt ended badly and I returned to my regularly scheduled program As it turned out however that wasnt the last of it  Unconsciously at first then deliberately I started taking different routes to and from campus randomly making my way to the pool to class to the library It was as if my wellordered life with its promise of comfort predictability even safety was now in jeopardy A month later came the testicular cancer diagnosis  and with it the required removal of the offending malignancy With no routine to fall back on the morning of my surgery proved to be a complete improvisation Up before dawn I lingered in the shower holding both testicles for the last time It felt like I was saying goodbye to a lover who had betrayed me but whom I still loved  Once dry I freaked  not about the diagnosis not about the surgery but about getting dressed I put on sweatpants and a sweatshirt no too casual then dress khakis and a buttondown shirt too schoolboy then jeans and a pullover that wasnt right either Mastery of my domain had been reduced to the sartorial and ridiculous choice of what to wear to the hospital  Ninety minutes later my sense of being dragged into a vortex deepened as I pulled up to the UCSF Medical Center high on Parnassus Heights enveloped in a swirling fog By noon it was all over the procedure anyway and I was in my room when suddenly Noah was standing above me with a spray of lilacs Instead of being overjoyed to see him all I could think was Here I am lying in a hospital bed with a fake testicle and a catheter unable to even lift myself out of bed with the pull bar hanging above me Obsessively trying to connect the dots of causation I suddenly understood that my socalled wellordered life had been an illusion  I had read The Maltese Falcon earlier that year drawn to its story But now Dashiell Hammetts words about how capricious life may be took on new meaning The life Flitcraft knew was a clean orderly sane responsible affair Now a falling beam had shown him that life was fundamentally none of these things He the good citizenhusbandfather could be wiped out between office and restaurant by the accident of a falling beam He knew then that men died at haphazard like that and lived only while blind chance spared them I started to more fully grasp the lesson that had begun with the foiled mugging Like Flitcraft I was witnessing my own falling beam Id had no control over the gunman but at least I had been able to choose flight Facing a cancer diagnosis my control had been reduced to jeans versus khakis What might blind chance deliver next  I was only too soon to find out  Once home I was determined to live my daily life as I had once known it resuming my routines as best I could A month later I was back doing morning laps hibernating in the library and spending time with Noah From the outside it was as though nothing had happened Then my earlystage disease was reclassified as Stage  and with the new diagnosis came weekly chemotherapy which threw my routine completely out of whack As my schedule fell apart I felt myself spiraling into chaos and I tried to take control wherever I could Like an anorexic I felt I could regain my sense of power and mastery by deciding what went in my mouth embarking on a highfiber lowcalorie sugarfree nearly organic lean protein diet that I thought might improve my odds but left me starving  By week four of chemo even though I hadnt yet lost a strand of hair I went to my hair cutter and had her shave it all off Then I dumped Noah in the most perfunctory of breakups If there were a chance that Noah would leave me I decided to be sure to do it first  And thats how I came to be puking in my backyard completely adrift and alone  I didnt have to be a member of Alcoholics Anonymous to know its first principle Admit you are powerless And thats just what I did that night The journey that had started with a gun in my ribs was ending with nothing less than a new understanding of the world On that dark night I came to see that I could not master the world about me that it was time for a new way of thinking What that was I wasnt sure But in that moment under the starry sky I finally understood that in order to hold on I would have to let go  Steven
