More should be done to make sure the NHS provides the same service at weekends as it does during the week according to Scotlands health secretary Increasing evidence suggests hospital death rates are higher at the weekends than on weekdays  Speaking at a conference in Edinburgh Alex Neil said five health boards would pilot new approaches in a m trial Mr Neil has also committed to having consultants in wards seven days a week He said a taskforce of senior NHS and Scottish government officials would be set up to oversee the changes aimed at addressing the variations in care at weekends Five health boards will adopt different systems to improve the flow of patients through the entire health system from the very first contact they make with the NHS The results of the m initiative  carried out in NHS Borders NHS Forth Valley NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Tayside  will be used to make improvements across the health service in Scotland Speaking at the International Society for Quality in Health Care ISQua  conference Mr Neil said the health service already offered roundtheclock care The key principles of safety will always be at the heart of what we do in the NHS he said However care will be delivered differently at am in the morning compared to pm in the afternoon It will be different on a Thursday compared to a Sunday  While the quality and safety doesnt vary the NHS must be a genuinely sevenday service where it needs to be That is my vision and I am determined to make it happen He added It should mean that pharmacists physiotherapists porters  all the services you need to help patients move through and be discharged from hospital  are on hand every day of the week  Changes towards  care are already happening in some areas and patients across Scotland already have access at any time of the day to see a GP or another member of the Primary Services Medical Team But we need to accelerate the pace of change and make it happen everywhere Dr Iain Wallace of the Association of Medical Directors said it was recognised that the NHS in Scotland needed to move towards a position where care could be provided at a consistent level over seven days  We welcome additional investment to test different approaches to achieving this challenging goal he added
