LONDON  Doctors could save  million more lives worldwide by  if they offer AIDS drugs to people with HIV much sooner after they test positive for the virus the World Health Organization said on Sunday While better access to cheap generic AIDS drugs means many more people are now getting treatment health workers particularly in poor countries with limited health budgets currently tend to wait until the infection has progressed  But in new guidelines aimed at controlling and eventually reducing the global AIDS epidemic the UN health agency said some  million HIVpositive people  or around  percent of all those with the virus  should be getting drug treatment  The guidelines which set a global standard for when people with human immunodeficiency virus HIV should start antiretroviral treatment were drawn up after numerous studies found that treating HIV patients earlier can keep them healthy for many years and also lowers the amount of virus in the blood significantly cutting their risk of infecting someone else  We are raising the bar to  million people said Gottfried Hirnschall the WHOs HIVAIDS department director  And this is not only about keeping people healthy and alive but also about blocking further transmission of HIV  Some  million people worldwide have the HIV virus that causes AIDS and the vast majority of them live in poor and developing countries SubSaharan Africa is by far the worst affected region  But the epidemic  which has killed  million people in the  years since HIV was first discovered  is showing some signs of being turned around The United Nations AIDS program UNAIDS says deaths from the disease fell to  million in  down from a peak of  million in  and from  million in   Swift progress has also been made in getting more HIV patients into treatment with  million people getting lifesaving AIDS drugs in  up from just  people a decade earlier according to latest WHO data also published on Sunday  Indian generics companies are leading suppliers of HIV drugs to Africa and to many other poor countries Major Western HIV drugmakers include Gilead Sciences Johnson  Johnson and ViiV Healthcare which is majorityowned by GlaxoSmithKline  Margaret Chan the WHOs director general said the dramatic improvement in access to HIV treatment raised the prospect of the world one day being able to beat the disease  With nearly  million people now on antiretroviral therapy we see that such prospects  unthinkable just a few years ago  can now fuel the momentum needed to push the HIV epidemic into irreversible decline she said in a statement  The WHOs guidelines encourage health authorities worldwide to start treatment in adults with HIV as soon as a key test known as a CD cell count falls to a measure of  cells per cubic millimeter or less  The previous WHO standard was to offer treatment at a CD count of  or less in other words when the virus has already started to damage the patients immune system  The guidelines also say all pregnant or breastfeeding women and all children under five with HIV should start treatment immediately whatever their CD count and that all HIV patients should be regularly monitored to assess their viral load  This allows health workers to check whether the medicines are reducing the amount of virus in the blood It also encourages patients to keep taking their medicine because they can see it having positive results  Theres no greater motivating factor for people to stick to their HIV treatment than knowing the virus is undetectable in their blood said Gilles van Cutsem the medical coordinator in South Africa for the international medical humanitarian organisation Mdecins Sans Frontires MSF  MSF welcomed the new guidelines but cautioned that the money and the political will to implement them was also needed  Now is not the time to be daunted but to push forward MSF president Unni Karunakara said in a statement So its critical to mobilize international support including funding for HIV treatment programs from donor governments  The WHOs Hirnschall said getting AIDS drugs to the extra patients brought in by the new guidelines would require another  percent on top of the  billion a year currently needed to fund the global fight against HIV and AIDS
