When high school Spanish teacher Joyce Botti started complaining about memory problems a few years ago doctors dismissed her concerns as normal signs of aging  But new research being presented Wednesday at an international Alzheimers conference suggests that Bottis worries  like those of others suffering socalled senior moments  could be the earliest indicators of devastating brain disease  Botti now  was forgetting little things  her keys coffee at the drivethrough scheduled meetings  but she was also making mistakes when writing on the blackboard or trying to recall certain words in class  Then one day the Bournedale Mass woman turned off the water in the shower at home and couldnt remember how to get out All these things that we try to explain away I knew there were too many things coming together said Botti who demanded to see a neurologist and was diagnosed last year with earlyonset Alzheimers  She said she wishes that doctors would have paid closer attention to her initial concerns a theme echoed this week by a raft of new research at the Alzheimers Association International Conference in Boston that shows the memory and thinking lapses people notice themselves could be early markers of risk for Alzheimers disease Not to scare anyone  especially the   according to a recent report  but patients own concerns may predate clinical changes in the brain and in cognitive functions that may indicate disease the findings suggest In other words people who think they have Alzheimers disease just might be right Years before a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimers disease the individual may be the best judge that his or her memory isnt what it used to be said Rebecca Amariglio a researcher in the neurology department at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston Amariglio along with other researchers in the US France and elsewhere studied volunteers in their s or s  and found links between selfreported memory concerns and potential indicators of cognitive impairment or actual disease In several separate studies their work detected associations between memory complaints and levels of a brain protein known as betaamyloid links with genetic markers for Alzheimers disease and predictors of diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment MCI or dementia Its just now getting appreciated by researchers in the field that we shouldnt ignore these subjective memory concerns Amariglio told NBC News Early awareness of socalled subjective cognitive decline or SCD could bolster research that will one day lead to screening treatment and even prevention of the disease that affects more than  million Americans and has no cure noted Heather Snyder director of medical and scientific operations at the Alzheimers AssociationWhat weve called Alzheimers disease is actually the later stages of the disease she said You can go back potentially further and identify biological changes a decade or more earlier In a study of nearly  cognitively normal people Amariglio and her colleagues queried the participants about their memory concerns  and then used PET scans to measure the buildup in their brains of betaamyloid a protein that is a known risk factor for Alzheimers disease  They found that the people with the greatest concerns about their memory problems also had the highest levels of betaamyloid in their brains  Whats more the link between memory concerns and higher betaamyloid levels was greater in participants who had higher levels of education and work status  If there are any detriments theyre more apt to notice that theyre not able to keep up at this very high pace Amariglio explained  In another study presented Wednesday researchers tracking nearly  elderly nurses found that early concerns about memory problems were linked to later declines on tests particularly in people with the apolipoprotein E gene known as ApoE the strongest known marker of Alzheimers disease  Cecilia Samieri of Research Center Inserm U in Bordeaux France worked with colleagues at Brigham and Womens to study some  nurses enrolled in the Nurses Health Study who had been been evaluated for the ApoE gene The participants were asked about seven specific memory symptoms and then given a battery of objective memory tests four times over the next six years from  to  In carriers of the ApoE gene those worried about even a single memory problem showed signs of decline in verbal memory over the six years reported Samieri In carriers without the gene concerns about three or more memory symptoms predicted memory decline the researchers found Yet another study released Wednesday followed more than  volunteers aged  or older at the University of Kentucky for an average of  years Researchers found that older people who reported changes in their memory were almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or MCI or with dementia years later said Richard J Kryscio director of the schools SandersBrown Center on Aging  We simply asked them since the last time you came in have you noticed any change in your memory recalled Kryscio Half the subjects said yes In the volunteers who are part of the schools Biologically Resilient Adults in Neurological Studies project the initial memory complaints occurred an average of six years before a diagnosis of dementia and nine years before a diagnosis of MCI noted Kryscio  But he and other researchers took pains to emphasize that their work shouldnt necessarily worry everyone whos ever had a memory glitch In a sense you have to separate them from the ordinary person who is getting older said Kryscio noting that research subjects are particularly attentive to their memory skills because they know theyre going to be tested  Its important to distinguish between normal memory lapses and significant memory problems which usually change over time and affect multiple aspects of daily life noted Snyder of the Alzheimers Association  If you forget your keys thats one thing she said If you forget what your key is for thats another thing For people who are concerned Snyder recommends taking the   about the top  signs and symptoms of the disease Patients who experience significant changes in memory or thinking should monitor their cognitive function the same way they monitor their heart health she noted If youre concerned about problems tell your family and see your health provider she suggested  Thats just what Joyce Botti did when she noticed that a lot of little memory lapses were adding up and that the trouble was escalating  In January it was happening once a week but by spring it was happening every day maybe three or four times a day Botti said  Though some people might not have wanted to hear such a difficult diagnosis Botti said it was more important for her to know If there is a cure try me first she said  She realizes that many memory complaints are indeed simple signs of aging But others she warned are not  When you find yourself forgetting to get out of the shower you should probably make a phone call Botti said
