The Commonwealth Fund has been publishing surveys comparing health care in industrialized countries since  a continuing report card in which the United States has usually fared poorly because of its high proportion of uninsured people But its latest report  an early anniversary tribute to Medicare    focuses on those over  the one segment of the American population with nearly universal coverage and access to care So we should look better this time right  Our seniors health care will make the honor roll    Well no Its definitely a better picture than when we look at the US population generally thats a pat on the back for Medicare said Robin Osborn director of the funds International Health Policy and Practice Innovations program and lead author of the study Previous research has shown that Medicare is more protective than all the different insurance plans people have under age  she said But as the survey of  respondents    reveals we still have mortifying lapses and problems despite spending more on health care than any other country in the world Yet we do better than these  other countries on some measures sometimes surprisingly You can read the funds summaries   and   The bad news first  Our older population is sicker We lead the list in the proportion of people over  who have two or more chronic diseases  percent report hypertension heart disease diabetes cancer etc and who take four or more prescription drugs  percent  Only a third of seniors in the United Kingdom have multiple chronic conditions The survey didnt include residents of nursing homes or other care facilities One thing we know contributes to this is not having an ongoing stable source of health insurance throughout your life Ms Osborn said Before they became Medicareeligible American seniors may have forgone preventive treatments or let conditions worsen because they couldnt afford care  Older Americans still struggle to pay for health care Nineteen percent said that in the past year cost was a barrier that prevented their seeing a doctor undergoing a recommended test or treatment or filling a prescription In only one other surveyed nation New Zealand at  percent did that proportion reach double digits   Among American seniors  percent had outofpocket medical expenses that topped  and  percent had problems paying their medical bills In Norway and Sweden  percent had problems paying in Germany  percent As good as Medicare is  it provides excellent coverage over all  it still isnt as protective as the coverage people get in other countries Ms Osborn said Its deductibles and costsharing requirements still leave many Americans scrambling to afford drugs and doctors  which also cost more here  The other countries in the survey note represent a variety of health care approaches including singlepayer national systems and subsidized private insurance coverage Their structures involve many different benefits thresholds and exemptions   What they share aside from doing a better job for their elders than the United States at lower cost is that their systems cover all ages Their elders are less likely to arrive at  trying to catch up after years without adequate medical care  American seniors fall near the bottom in their ability to get sameday or nextday appointments when they are sick  percent compared with more than  percent in France Germany and New Zealand they also rank low in accessing afterhours care Unsurprisingly then they are near the top in emergency room use  percent within the past two years But give older Americans this They rarely wait more than a month to see a specialist possibly because we have more specialists On the brighter side  American seniors say their doctors spend enough time with them  percent and encourage questions  percent And the United States ranks highest in having health care professionals talk to seniors about healthy eating and exercise  percent Americans are also more likely than seniors in most of these countries to say they are receiving good guidance in managing their chronic illnesses  This ones startling We do better than almost anyone else in the survey on advance care planning Americans over  are the most likely to say they have discussed having a health care proxy  percent and to have actually named one  percent and rank second in having a written plan describing their endoflife wishes  percent The US is really ahead on these conversations Ms Osborn said citing the federal Patient SelfDetermination Act of  highprofile cases Quinlan Cruzan Schiavo that dismayed everyone and efforts like  Maybe they are finally paying off Mixed grades  All  countries share some problems fragmented uncoordinated care gaps in hospital discharge plans conflicting information from doctors And all have considerable proportions of older adults serving as caregivers to other elderly or disabled people with the attendant worries and problems Over all Im not sure what grade we deserve on senior health We dont flunk but I cant see better than a Cminus can you Supposedly we made a national commitment  years ago Yet compared to  other industrial nations all with older populations and lower per capita expenditures our seniors are more vulnerable Ms Osborn said
