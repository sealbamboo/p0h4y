Left untreated a serious tooth abscess can eventually kill  In  Deamonte Driver a yearold boy in Maryland died after bacteria from an abscessed tooth spread to his brain The case drew   and his is the cautionary tale cited whenever politicians and advocates   But a new study suggests that   and that the number of Americans hospitalized with them may be on the rise Studies have shown that dental problems account for   The new analysis published in the September issue of the Journal of Endodontics focused on patients who had to be hospitalized because of an infection of the tip of the tooths root called a periapical abscess It is a common consequence of untreated tooth decay and it can be dangerous if it spreads After reviewing national patient data from  to  researchers in Boston found that the people hospitalized for dental abscesses increased by more than  percent to  in  from  in  Some  patients died after they were hospitalized according to the new analysis We have not had verification before of the number of deaths said Dr Frank Catalanotto chairman of the department of community dentistry and behavioral science at the University of Florida College of Dentistry who was not involved in the report The seriousness of dental infections that go untreated or are treated too late is a bigger problem than we had estimated When money and access are not problems an abscessed tooth can easily be treated with a root canal or an extraction But increasingly Americans rely on hospital emergency rooms for dental care instead of regular dentist visits  a trend exacerbated by a lack of insurance coverage and trouble paying out of pocket Last year a Pew Charitable Trusts report estimated that preventable dental conditions including abscessed teeth were    a  percent increase from  Until now it has been unclear just how many patients end up hospitalized specifically for abscessed teeth or how much they cost the health care system According to the new analysis that figure was  million after adjustment for inflation from  to  Thats what we are paying instead of paying up front and its such a waste one with a high human cost said Shelly Gehshan the director of the Pew Childrens Dental Campaign Dental insurance is eroding little by little and affordability of dental care is something the industry has not addressed A periapical abscess is a rare event and to have significant morbidity is even rarer said Dr Bruce Dye a dental epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Still the number of patients hospitalized for them is creeping up But Dr Dye cautioned that the analysis did not address whether patients were able to afford dental care some may have ended up at the emergency room for a complication after receiving a root canal from a dentist You cant make the statement that this is a sign of increased problem of access to care he said Medicaid coverage for routine dental services for adults varies widely by state Medicare does not cover routine dental care The programs do pay for hospital stays however and the new study found that Medicare paid for roughly  percent of hospitalizations for dental abscesses while Medicaid shouldered  percent and private insurance plans paid for  percent In recent years Dr Samuel Dorn a chairman of endodontics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston said he had seen an increase in hospitalizations for dental abscesses People put it off until they find their face all swollen or they cant breathe and they run to the hospital he said And thats when we have these emergent conditions His colleague Dr Mark Wong the chairman of oral surgery at the university said residents logs showed that in   incision and drainage procedures because of abscessed teeth were done in local hospitals Last year the number was   patients were hospitalized To call this an epidemic of dental infections we are seeing in major hospital environments and in our emergency rooms  its not an overstatement Dr Wong said An acute abscess of an upper tooth can cause cheek swelling and untreated lead to a brain abscess or a sinus infection If bacteria spread from an abscess in a lower tooth the swelling can constrict the airway Some patients underestimate how serious the condition can be Its better to have it treated when its treatable than to wait until it gets out of hand and is possibly lifethreatening said Dr Gary R Hartwell the president of the American Association of Endodontists The increase in hospitalizations is part of a sea change in dental care he said Now its reached a point unless somethings bothering them or theyve got pain people say Im just not going to go to the dentist
