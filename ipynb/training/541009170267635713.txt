Parents welcoming a new baby into their family are no longer content to count fingers and toes to assess their infants state of health In a survey released Thursday nearly half said they would be very or extremely interested in having their newborns genome sequenced and fully a third more pronounced themselves somewhat interested Within  hours of a childs birth at Bostons Brigham and Womens Hospital researchers gave  parents a brief orientation on the genome and its relevance for human health They then asked how interested a parent would be in having his or her newborns genome scanned and analyzed Interest was spread roughly evenly among parents regardless of their age gender race ethnicity level of education or family history of genetic disease Whether a child was the firstborn in a family did not seem to influence a parents propensity toward genetic sequencing But married parents and parents who had experienced health concerns about their baby were slightly less inclined to express interest in genomic sequencing for the child Where there were two parents available they were surveyed separately about their interest In  out of  such unions parents were in agreement on their interest in genomic sequencing The study published Thursday in the journal Genetics in Medicine is the first to explore the attitudes of newborns parents toward comprehensive genome testing If it were a marketresearch tool however the studys findings would be good news for an initiative expected to be launched soon in Boston Lead author Dr Robert C Green a geneticist at Brigham and Womens Hospital and Alan Beggs of Boston Childrens Hospital codirect the BabySeq Project which in  is expected to offer several hundred parents of both sick and healthy newborns the opportunity to have their childs genome sequenced As genomic analysis has become cheaper faster and increasingly revealing in terms of disease risk the question of how routinely such scans should be conducted  and who should have access to the results  has been widely debated In March  the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics issued guidelines recommending that labs performing genome analysis for a specific health purpose search for a welter of readilydiscernible genetic variations related to serious health problems and report any such findings to the physician who ordered the test Whether or not the patient wants or has asked for the unsought genomic findings the group argued that physicians should pass any significant findings on to patients For children however genomic sequencing and all of its potential findings pose a dilemma Younger minors are rarely thought capable of giving informed consent to receiving health information that may or may not turn out to be important Notwithstanding such ethical qualms the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said that worrisome genetic findings should also be reported when they are found in children However in conducting routine genetic testing on newborns who in most states are routinely screened for about  genetic disorders the group did not call on genetics labs to look beyond those tests for other genetic clues to health Green said genomic sequencing could be of greatest value in the care and treatment of a baby if performed in the childs earliest infancy
