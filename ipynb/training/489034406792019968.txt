A sweeping effort by Merck & Co. to revive a livestock drug it pulled from the U.S. market last year is stalling amid resistance from the nation's largest beef processors.. Merck for months has been preparing to conduct a large-scale study this summer to demonstrate the safety of its Zilmax product. The feed additive was widely used to promote weight gain in U.S. cattle before Merck suspended sales in August 2013 because of concerns in the beef industry that the drug made it difficult for some animals to walk.
