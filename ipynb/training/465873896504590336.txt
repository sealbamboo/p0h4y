I was born with a disability called   AMC and it left my arms weak shorter than average and stiff This makes the most mundane tasks quite difficult sometimes but Im so grateful that AMC also left my hands hooked under  its with these hooks I am able to carry my children at least for a few seconds here and there As I watch my little boy flit from one obstacle to another I remember the summer before I started kindergarten I was playing at the park while my own mother watched from the shade  I didnt dare tackle the very tall slide as ladders always scared me I couldnt properly grip the rungs and even at that young age I understood that I had limits  Instead I climbed the wide steps of the elephantshaped slide which was probably intended for children much younger than me I reached the top and shoved off From the first moment of my descent I began to lose control My body had turned sideways by the time I reached the bottom and I fell onto the concrete landing left arm first  The thing about arms affected by AMC is that they dont bend They just break My mom rushed me to the hospital for this the first of the seven arm breaks of my childhood Naturally even now as an adult I find it difficult to watch my son take physical risks without feeling a surge of panic Without remembering the crunch of snapping bone  He however seems to live for anything that would terrify me Often I force myself to turn away so he can earn his boyhood scrapes without this nervous mom swooping in  For many things I have to use my feet I have to admit that toes are poor substitutes for fingers and for every obstacle Ive overcome there are  that I havent Despite that I drive a car I change diapers Ive published a book and am a freelance journalist  every word typed by toe I travel all over the country to speak to schools womens groups churches  But the truth is as my son laid on my chest moments after birth I didnt know how I would manage to hold him I didnt know how Id work a car seat Id changed exactly one diaper years before and Id never held an infant I was in over my head But my son and I adapted to each other quickly so that within two weeks my husband went back to work and I was able to care for my new baby  not without difficulty but without help Luckily newborns are extremely patient read they cant move so I was able to work on those things that were difficult and take my time until it became a little more natural for me  But really most of what I do throughout the day is struggle I am in such awe as I watch how easily other moms pick up their toddlers How easily someone turns the page of a book How quickly other writers can type Wow What would that be like  Struggle has been the great theme of my  years And for most of those years I hated it I would have given anything to be normal  to be anyone other than me I wanted to blend in Who doesnt  I cant tell you the number of times I thought whispered growled under my breath WHY does everything have to be so freaking difficult for me After attempting to open a window To button my pants To strain pasta  But as Ive become an adult as I worked through so much pain in writing my memoir I began to see that Struggle is not my enemy In fact I can thank Struggle for developing in me many of the traits I like most about myself And Struggle in my life gives me the ability to teach my kids resilience Empathy Determination Hope So many intangibles that a perfect mom would not be able to model for her children Because Im flawed I can perfectly prepare my kids to deal with the imperfect boss the imperfect spouse the imperfect child Because I am weak my children can see how little weakness can do to hold us back from living a life filled with purpose  Because I struggle in front of them daily my children will inherently know not to run from the difficult things in life because they see Struggle create in me such gratitude and joy over even the smallest blessings My children have been dealt an awesome hand Its Mothers Day and you might be an imperfect mom Dont be afraid Dont wish you were someone else Youre the mom your kids need most Youre the ideal person to prepare your children to thrive in this often lessthanideal world  Ive heard it said that your greatest strength is also your greatest weakness But it could be that your greatest weakness is your greatest strength  as a parent as a person Love an imperfect mom today especially if that mom is you
