One of the nations largest and oldest childrens hospitals is cracking down on parents who bring their kids herbs extracts or other dietary supplements In what it describes as a break from other hospitals the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia or CHOP last month removed most dietary supplements from its list of approved medicines and established new policies for administering them  chief of infectious diseases at CHOP tells The Salt the move comes after a growing level of frustration over the years Offit who chairs the board which approved the new policy says supplements often arent what they claim to be The Food and Drug Administration or FDA treats them as food not pharmaceuticals The problem has been that we cant even get from most companies that certificate of analysis that shows the product was independently tested and whats on the label is in the bottle Offit says pointing to a recent problems like in Hawaii where a fatburning supplement   to liver failure Under CHOPs old policy dietary supplements were treated as home medications If a family brought them in an attending doctor or nurse was obliged to evaluate them as best they could and administer them along with hospitalsanctioned meds during the patients admission If the supplements ran out the provider would order more through the hospital pharmacy Now families are entirely responsible  they have to obtain and administer the unapproved supplements themselves notify a doctor when that happens and sign a   The hospital is also distributing additional   to families Not so surprisingly CHOPs move has drawn criticism from a leading dietary supplement trade group the Natural Products Association which described the decision as unfortunate and misguided In a   to the hospital NPA director John Shaw said that companies must adhere to strict manufacturing practices and that the FDA has been ramping up its inspections of them Dietary supplements are generally defined as vitamins minerals herbs and extracts that may come in tablets capsules or powders Theyre regulated as a unique category of food by the FDA While Offits aim is to discourage families from using most supplements the hospital isnt banning all of them Its developing a list of about three dozen exceptions which must be verified by the   and confirmed through the hospitals own lab work Offit views the move as finally trying to do something that the FDA should have done long ago CHOPs list of exceptions provides comfort to doctors like   director of Thomas Jefferson Universitys Myrna Brind Center of Integrative Medicine Monti doesnt think CHOP is being overly restrictive so much as safe for children All hospitals have formularies with some restrictions he explains though CHOP is being as conservative as you can get In that regard he hopes CHOPs policy doesnt limit options for care or potentially beneficial treatments A   of  childrens hospitals found that hospitals rarely include herbs and supplements on its formulary But less than half had any written policies while seventy percent directed health professionals to store and administer as patients home supply John Neely a professor of pediatrics at Penn States College of Medicine and director an integrative medicine program at the Milton S Hershey Medical Center wonders whether CHOPs stricter policy could backfire leading families to hide important health information about supplement use from doctors What I find is patients are acutely aware if physicians are really opposed to herbal medicines and supplements Neely tells The Salt When I start to negatively ask patients about them people just dont divulge they are so afraid physicians will be angry with them Offit with CHOP stresses the intent is to improve dialogue with families and have a better way to track everything patients are taking and how its affecting them I think frankly for the first time we can understand the level of usage in our hospital he says
