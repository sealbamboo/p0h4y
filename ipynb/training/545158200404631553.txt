Sandra Lopez and her Chihuahua Coco were inseparable He followed her everywhere and kept Lopezs mood up when she was in pain  which was often On Oct   Lopez died at age  of melanoma that had slowly spread throughout her body over the course of two years Lopez was in and out of the hospital in  but during the months she was home a hospice nurse from the Metropolitan Jewish Health System visited once a week to help manage the pain backed up by a hour nursestaffed phone line that Lopez called often Some days the pain is so excruciating Lopez told me in August from the couch in her Brooklyn apartment that the pain overrides the medication But despite   that hospices can greatly relieve discomfort extend life and save money and despite a generous hospice benefit available through both Medicare and Medicaid relatively few people in New York take advantage of it compared with elsewhere in the country The reasons for this local gap are complicated but Jeanne Dennis senior vice president of hospice and palliative care at the Visiting Nurse Service of New York says one place to start is with patients fears If youre referred to hospice it means no one expects you to get better Dennis says And that is in my mind a threshold thats difficult for people to step over Experts also focus on what they call medical culture which can vary dramatically from region to region According to this theory physicians in the metropolitan area are specialists and subspecialists and institutions put a premium on treatments and tests Even more than in other places the goal in New York City is to cure patients rather than simply care for them Treating and testing is just what they do  letting go isnt says Dennis Physicians put off the conversation she says with rationalizations like  Its a little too soon Its a little too early I dont have enough time today Im not sure theyre ready for it  New York has  out of the  hospitals in the country with the fewest hospice referrals Local academic medical centers  national leaders in research  do better but still lag behind the rest of the country in their referral rates Its a big contrast to some hospitals around the country particularly several in Arizona Utah and Florida where more than  percent of dying patients take advantage of Medicares hospice benefit Further most hospice referrals in New York are for brief stays  a week or less   times shorter than the national average Szoa Geng a health care consultant from the firm   says when hospitals move people to hospice with just a few days left to live the patients dont get the full hospice experience Theyre not getting the psychosocial support and their families are not Geng says It can be a time of closure and coming to peace with a lot of things in your life and none of that can happen if you come onto hospice with a day left Hospice care mostly takes place at home but it can also occur in freestanding hospices nursing homes or designated areas of hospitals To receive the care a doctor must predict a patient is in the last six months of life without hope of improving Theres no penalty for outliving that prediction some patients stabilize and go off hospice care then return later when they start declining again About  percent of people in the New York metropolitan area use hospice care in their last six months of life compared with close to  percent nationally Statewide the rate is closer to  percent But that still makes New York th out of  states and the District of Columbia according to the   the most recent statistics available Sandra Lopez said that before her oncologist told her about hospice care she frequently called  to request an ambulance to take her to the hospital where she would be admitted and spend days at a time That happened dozens and dozens of times in a year Lopez said At around  a day Lopezs hospice care cost Medicaid tens of thousands of dollars  probably less than her revolvingdoor trips to the hospital with all their multinight stays but still a lot of money For Lopez hospice helped her get ready to walk down the final road I stopped worrying  like the worry box I used to be she told me in August I just live my life normally like everybody else because worrying will just probably get me more sick Lopez knew that at some point her body would start shutting down but she would never say how much time her doctors estimated she had remaining because she didnt dwell on that she said She was at peace as she faced death and knew she could stay that way  as long as someone was with her at home at her bedside helping to subdue her pain
