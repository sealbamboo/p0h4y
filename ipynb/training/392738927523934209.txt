Should older adults take statins if they have elevated cholesterol but no evidence of heart disease  Its a surprisingly controversial question given the number of seniors taking statins   Recently AMDA a professional group representing physicians working in nursing homes highlighted the issue in a list of five questionable medical tests and treatments The list was drawn up as part of the national Choosing Wisely campaign which alerts consumers to   an effort that caregivers would do well to follow   The   on the AMDA list Dont routinely prescribe lipidlowering medications in individuals with a limited life expectancy That means anyone older than  according to the medical society Dr Hosam Kamel an Arkansas geriatrician who is vice chair of AMDAs clinical practice committee said that there is scarce scientific evidence supporting the use of statins by  or yearolds without preexisting cardiovascular disease  Only a handful of studies have focused on outcomes heart attacks strokes premature death in this older population   Most of the data on the benefits of statin use come from larger studies that looked at adults of varying ages The results dont conclusively establish the benefits of using statins for seniors with healthy hearts Dr Kamel said   There is evidence of harm linked to statin use in seniors he added including muscle aches liver toxicity and gastrointestinal distress growing  evidence of impaired memory and a heightened  risk of diabetes and some evidence of an increased risk of cancer The Food and Drug Administration required   along with other possible complications on statin labels for the first time in  Our recommendation is that physicians weigh the potential risks and benefits and not automatically prescribe these medications Dr Kamel said  That advice applies only to seniors who havent been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease A significant body of evidence does support the benefits of statins in older adults who have already had a heart attack or stroke Several leading cardiologists support AMDAs emphasis on individualized decisionmaking but take issue with this assessment of statins efficacy in older adults The evidence is weaker for older patients  practically none at that age  but it is not unreasonable to expect similar effects as in younger patients Dr Harlan Krumholz a cardiologist at Yale School of Medicine said in an email I believe that this is a decision that ought to be personalized for each individual Dr Krumholz added  What are their risks What do they value What is the presumed benefit   Dr Steven Nissen chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic recalled an yearold patient with high blood pressure high cholesterol elevated levels of Creactive protein a marker for inflammation  but no known history of heart disease  After calculating that the mans risk of having a heart attack in the next  years was  percent Dr Nissen prescribed statins Today the man is still alive at the age of  and doing well in assisted living Dr Nissen said I dont think its about age Its about the persons life expectancy and the likelihood of achieving a true benefit with this therapy Dr Nissen said The message here has to be that if youre dying of some other disease  say cancer or kidney failure  there isnt much benefit in giving a statin  But if youre a healthy yearold with a Framingham Risk Score of  percent or greater then I would tend to treat You can calculate your own Framingham Risk Score which assesses your year risk of a heart attack    Dr William Zoghbi immediate past president of the American College of Cardiology advised seniors with high cholesterol to first try changing their diets and getting more exercise  If these fail to lower cholesterol levels he said then statins are a reasonable option Recent data has shown that shown that in older adults primary prevention for people who have high cholesterol but no overt evidence of cardiovascular disease is beneficial said Dr Zoghbi director of the Cardiovascular Imaging Institute at the Methodist Hospital in Houston He was referring to a recent paper in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology about statins and older adults  It is an analysis of eight randomized trials involving nearly  people aged  or older that analyzed outcomes for seniors without preexisting heart disease who took these medications   Seniors who took the medications   a  percent reduction and strokes a  percent reduction than those who did not but they didnt live longer Yet the absolute risk of these events was small In the control group  percent of seniors suffered heart attacks over the course of threeandahalf years that declined to  percent in the group taking statins  Similarly  percent of seniors in the control group suffered strokes compared with  percent of statin users Taking statins may not prolong life in older adults but it may certainly improve the quality of life for people who might otherwise become disabled by heart attacks of strokes said Dr Antonio Gotto Jr one of the authors of the analysis and dean emeritus of Weill Cornell Medical College    As in many studies of this kind the incidence of side effects associated with statin use was not reported This data is very well guarded and without it the clinical picture is incomplete said Dr Rita Redberg a cardiologist at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center and editorinchief of JAMA Internal Medicine I see elderly patients every week who tell me they couldnt get out of bed they had terrible diarrhea they were walking around in a fog after they started taking statins and when they stopped the medications those feelings went away Dr Redberg said According to her summary of the evidence for using statins to prevent heart disease heart attacks will be prevented in only one or two of every  healthy people with high cholesterol who take the medications for up to five years while one person will develop diabetes  Meanwhile it is worth noting that older people are much more vulnerable to the side effects of medications she said and theres some evidence that low cholesterol seems to be associated with higher mortality at an older age Experts agree that more high quality evidence is needed about statin use in seniors without existing heart disease  Pending that it seems this debate isnt going to be resolved any time soon As ever consult with a doctor before starting or discontinuing any medication
