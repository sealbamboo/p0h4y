In the past few years a wisp of a trend has emerged suggesting that the huge rise in obesity among children and teenagers may have peaked Heres one more bit of evidence Teenagers are cutting back on sugary drinks getting more exercise and watching less TV But overall theyre still pretty awesomely bad when it comes to healthful behaviors a study finds To find out researchers at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development polled more than  children in grades  to  in three different groups   and  The kids were asked if they were physically active for  minutes or more a day and how much TV they watched Researchers also asked what the children were eating Overall the kids logged less than five days a week of significant physical activity the kind that makes you break a sweat But that number did crawl up from about  hours a week to  hours over that nineyear span Daily TV watching dropped from three hours a day to   inching their way towards the American Academy of Pediatrics   of no more than two hours a day of screen time The survey didnt start asking about computer and video game use until  They each took up about an hour of a teenagers day and the numbers didnt change over time Public health types have pushed hard to have children cut back on sedentary activities like TV figuring that those are hours when they could be out running and jumping Theyve also pushed hard to get teenagers eating more fruit and vegetables and cutting back on sugary drinks and sweets The good news here is that teenagers seem to be getting that message at least a tiny bit In  the teens said they were eating a fruit or a vegetable four days out of seven They didnt break through to five days a week but they got closer Consumption of sodas and candy declined from almost five days a week to four Its sad to see how the researchers had to squinch their vertical axis on the graph to make these meager improvements show up The teenagers didnt report a drop in BMI it went from  in  to  in  both in the overweight range which peaks at  But the increase came all before  That supports the maybe the obesity crisis has peaked theory But theres also notsogreat news in this survey Older teenagers did worse than their younger peers  they were less likely to eat breakfast exercised less and eat fewer fruits and veggies and logged ore computer time This could be because theyre more in charge of their eating and behavior than are younger children But the researchers say that since habits of diet and exercise are established in childhood this is not a good thing The survey indicates there is considerable need for improvement the researchers write The study was published online in the journal   Though it may be that the many efforts to get children to exercise more and eat more healthfully may be responsible for the changes seen the authors conclude this study cant prove thats the case
