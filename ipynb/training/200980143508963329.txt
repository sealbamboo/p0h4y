If you use a powdered brand, and stick to the recommended 1 1/3 tablespoons of powder for every 8-ounce glass, it delivers 70 calories (again, check the brand's label). If you use more powder though, you'll get more calories..

                  A few tasty combinations: cheddar or Gruyere and apples (sprinkle with lemon or lime juice to avoid browning); watermelon and feta; ripe figs and blue cheese; tomatoes and mozzarella; or ricotta and grapes.. 
                  . 
                  Pack fruit and cheese separately to keep the flavors fresh..
