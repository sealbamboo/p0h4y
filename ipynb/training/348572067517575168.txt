Working its way through the Ohio Legislature is a state budget bill that has major implications for the way familyplanning services are provided The Ohio budget contains language that puts familyplanning clinics at the bottom of the list to receive funding Family Planning Association of Northeast Ohio operates several independent familyplanning clinics They do not provide abortions and have no affiliation with Planned Parenthood but the clinics are still at the end of the line under a new tiered system because they give referrals Ahead of the facilities are local health departments places like emergency rooms and free clinics Family Plannings executive director Mary WynnePeaspanen says if theres any money left over  which she says is not likely  then they could consider applications from independent specialty clinics like my organization and like Planned Parenthood The budget bill from the Republicancontrolled Legislature could well put the nonprofit out of business Since  it has served primarily lowincome women but its facing an anticipated  percent hit to its funding Theyve been very clear about the fact  at the General Assembly  that their target is Planned Parenthood But that doesnt change the fact that there are other organizations that will be impacted by this funding WynnePeaspanen tells Jacki Lyden host of weekends on   In Ohio and elsewhere familyplanning clinics typically provide a range of womens health services like cancer screenings blood pressure tests and contraceptive services Judy Waxman vice president for health and reproductive rights at the National Womens Law Center says the vast majority of women who are sexually active have used contraception at some point in their lives So on one level we as a nation have recognized that contraceptives are not only what everybody uses but they also are very important for womens health she says There is however a minority of politicians who try to use any issue related to sex to make some kind of political hay out of it Waxman says a handful of states are looking at centers that receive Medicaid or state funding for familyplanning services  and some are cutting the budgets Those states include Indiana Arizona   and now Ohio Michael Gonidakis is the president of Ohio Right to Life one of the groups that lobbied hard for the current legislative approach He admits the ultimate objective is a straightforward one Our goal is to find a way to end abortion Not make it illegal but to end it he says Were big proponents of adoption reform foster care reform and we want to find ways to continue to help women who find themselves in unintended pregnancy to realize that they can have their baby that theres support services there for them to keep their child He doesnt expect that women will have less access to family planning not even those who are lowincome Theres nowhere  and I repeat nowhere  in the state of Ohio where there wont be other options in a very close walking proximity to  a clinic that may go out of business he says Were doing some good things here in Ohio and theres access to these types of services and care for lowincome women across the state But it still worries Jess Locher a yearold uninsured cosmetologist in Chardon She went to the local branch of the Family Planning Association as a teenager Ten years later the mother of two still goes to the same clinic because she cant afford anything else If they took family planning away I wouldnt be getting the female care that I need because my job doesnt offer me insurance so I couldnt afford to go to a gynecologist Locher says Ohio is on the verge of making decisions that would alter the way family planning is funded Texas started down this road two years ago When the Tea Party wave came through Texas in  there was a big movement to oust Planned Parenthood from all of the state health programs says journalist Becca Aaronson Aaronson who covers health care for the   says state lawmakers took a threepronged approach to cutting familyplanning funds They cut familyplanning funding then set up a tiered financing system prioritizing comprehensive health clinics Third they prohibited any group affiliated with a provider that performed abortions from participating in the Medicaid womens health program More than  clinics throughout Texas closed their doors As the dust settled the consequences of this policy started to become apparent Aaronson says The state estimates that roughly  babies are going to be born as a result of these changes and thats because women dont have as much access to birth control she says The spike caused enough of a stir in Texas for state legislators to restore some of the funding to family planning They decided to put an extra  million toward primary care for womens health so that many uninsured women of all ages could get cancer screenings diabetes treatment and familyplanning access Aaronson says Waxman of the National Womens Law Center considers the Texas legislation a failure for women in the state Its possible in some circumstances that women could go somewhere else but many other health centers dont provide familyplanning services because they know Planned Parenthood is available to do that she says Waxman says the issue is an ideological one I can only hope that those people that are really outliers on this issue not continue to erode and really hurt the women in their states she says Whos hurt and whos helped by laws on access to familyplanning services is in part of course a matter of deeply held opinion and even religious faith In Ohio WynnePeaspanen at the Family Planning Association is bracing herself Ive been with the agency for  years And funding cuts happen and you know funding increases happen But this is  the most serious she says Gonidakis from Ohio Right to Life says hes confident things will be just fine I do not foresee any situation whatsoever where a womans going to be denied services because of the availability of so many other clinics in the state of Ohio he says
