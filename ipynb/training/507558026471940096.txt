For more than an hour the Liberian government official took questions from NPR Despite the tense times in his Ebolastricken country Lewis Brown minister of information cultural affairs and tourism was welcoming and animated His mood was upbeat although not overly optimistic He spoke with NPRs team in his office furnished with black patent leather sofas He was late for his next meeting because of the long interview but graciously dismissed any concerns we expressed about running late People tend to forget weve had two waves of the Ebola outbreak The first in the rural community in the border town of Lofa late in March We survived the first  days with no new cases reported We survived a second day period making it a total of  with no new cases reported Quite frankly many of our partners folded tent and were leaving the country The only advice was that we do not announce that we were Ebolafree because there were still new cases being reported in neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea The second wave  that occurred in Monrovia the capital in which around a third of our population currently resides Not only was it now unprecedented  this was one of the first times in the history of the virus that it was breaking out in a capital city in an urban center instead of a rural setting Another difficulty was that we started experiencing the outbreak in health care centers hospitals clinics and many of these were forced to shut down as health care workers  including doctors  were stricken by the virus And so not only was it difficult and unprecedented and would have challenged any public health service let alone ours which is recovering from  years of war but the extent of the spread in an urban area  where the population moves more frequently and faster than  in a rural area  made the second wave of our outbreak more difficult and even more challenging than the first We have had to adapt as we moved along Dont forget  this is the first time that were confronting such a virus It comes with the fact that our people think that there is a sense of deception here around this virus Around this time of the year during the rainy season its quite common to have higher incidence in malaria typhoid and other illnesses common to the tropics So the same symptoms are associated with Ebola And here we are telling our people to abandon their cultural practices their religious practices funeral and burial rituals  essentially their way of life handed down to them over centuries from their greatgreatgrandparents throughout the ages if you will  for something that looks like malaria that theyre used to So there were initial doubts here and there about whether the virus existed People had never heard about Ebola I would argue that the denial we have today is not the same we had before And this is across the three countries Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone And its not as people have made it out to be necessarily because of the government saying so So the truth of the matter is  when you ask people to alter the way theyve always lived you are met with initial doubt and resistance Today what we have more than doubt is fear  as people have seen loved ones die have seen relatives die as people demystify this virus people have been encapsulated by fear I was building a perspective of West Point so you understand So what happened was we have had to adapt to new measures This began with a public health emergency announced by the president And weve had to graduate it upward Knowing the possibility of spread in the capital and also knowing the mentality of our people too often the two get mixed up Often weve heard criticism associated with quarantine Oh no its a medieval tactic that doesnt work and It will not help to contain the outbreak But what gets lost in that argument is the mentality of Liberians We may not be experts in fighting the virus lets make no pretense about it but no one can pretend to know our people better than we do Absolutely not And that is again part of the commentary we have to try to deal with and put into proper perspective Let me zero in on West Point The potential for an explosive outbreak was extremely high So what was done was to quarantine the area as a containment measure The fact that a few were jubilating and saying Yes we were right theres no Ebola here was not the basis for the lifting of the quarantine Show me one place where a quarantine is announced before its imposed  you must always have the element of surprise Can you imagine saying to West Point Tomorrow at midnight were imposing a quarantine that youd find anybody there Obviously not Obviously not So the truth of the matter is  did all West Pointers like it No definitely not Would you like it If your days rely on your movement around the community its not something youre going to like Is it something the government liked Obviously not No we did not But what today is the outcome of those actions Lets be judged by the outcomes I went with the president back into West Point What I saw actually impressed me I saw a community now literally rallied against Ebola I saw a community where  I was talking to a group of ladies and one was leaning on the other And one lady rebuked the other saying No no please Dont touch me Today notwithstanding the criticisms  the people did not like the quarantine right  to lead is not a popularity contest especially to make these kinds of difficult decisions about your own people Its not a popularity contest You wouldnt do right But it must be all the time what is right And what was right was to contain that possibility of an outbreak Imagine what would have happened after the violation of that holding center Imagine if the community did not have a sense of ownership as they do now Imagine if they were not in a position to identify the at least four people who looted the health facility who were taken for treatment The four would have become eight in no time The eight would have become  The  would have become  Can you imagine given your knowledge of West Point can you imagine the possibility of a spread in West Point That is the size of disaster we were looking at And we had to make a very difficult decision It was not a cheerleading decision it was not a decision we liked It was a decision we felt compelled to make to put in the kind of system that is today yielding the results that we have So there will be some who will quarterback this for as long as we probably will live But the truth of the matter is we believe West Point is today best positioned to fight the Ebola outbreak than other communities So again my answer is if you give notice about quarantine youll find nobody there You must give the security forces the element of surprise And  the quarantine was not contrary to what anyone may say intended to hurt our own people It was to help them Today we believe West Point is more organized better positioned to fight any outbreak Theyve taken on the ownership  to the point that they are themselves involved in contact tracing Im sure youre aware of that They are themselves involved in the distribution of their own food If food went into West Point today its West Pointers who would distribute it Previously you probably would have had to put an army in there to distribute the food But such is the change in the circumstances that I believe weve made progress Now did the quarantine do it Well never know But certainly we are convinced as a government that it catalyzed it Yeah yeah Quite frankly we think sometimes we could have done better  much quicker  to improve the response time In our initial approach to this and what our people see more than anything else is not all the behindthescenes maneuvers discussions etc People see how fast are they picking up bodies from communities how fast are we picking up sick people If a body will lie in a community for two three days then the government is doing nothing Everything else pales in comparison to that  especially when our people now know that to touch a dead body is to contract the virus So we could have a lot better with that  the collection of bodies Another area I think is mobilizing international support We could have done a lot more with that because we launched a  million medical response effort Our national plan is around  million US from the Ministry of Health I think we could have spent some time mobilizing engaging the international community  fighting wherever with the World Health Organization and strategic partners to get that money in country We put up  million US under our difficult circumstances You know our budget still has not passed We were just renewing the budget when all of this went down So it was a rather difficult legislating progress But I believe if we had gone out  when we produced our national plan  if we had gone gungho with them  and found the resources to support that national plan immediately perhaps a lot could have been done But again as we have moved along we have increased international support that has come in Youve heard about the African Development Community giving a  million US grant to the three countries Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea through the World Health Organization You heard about the Centers for Disease Control working with us in a strategic partnership One thing is we are beginning to see a higher appreciation of the sense of urgency about this Were keeping all of our options open If theres one big lesson from this Ebola fight its never close the door on any option So were keeping all of the options open But even as we do we dont begin  knowing our people  we dont want to emphasize curative over preventive I tell you when the ZMapp experimental drugs were brought in  if you went back to our daily situation reports  we had a spike in people turning themselves in at the hospitals Suddenly the impression was a cure had been found Knowing our people when that message gets out  people abandon prevention because dont forget most of the preventive methods that we are informing about are actually against how people have always lived So as soon as you tell them it works there is now a cure suddenly people go back to old habits and old practices And we dont want that so much as were keeping the options open not just for ZMapp but for other drugs were insisting on prevention Were insisting on public awareness Were insisting on community ownership Because again if our people soon hear Oh there is now a cure suddenly folks start burying their bodies again folks start returning to the rituals and we cant cut the transmission So were keeping all our options open Weve done the best we can continuing behindthescenes discussions with drugmakers the Food and Drug Administration of the United States and many other countries One thing we want to do is to put prevention at the front end  because we still know that prevention is better than cure And let me just close on this note Our country Liberia has come a long way in its development in its progress Over the last  years since the civil war ended weve covered a lot of ground  but we would be the first to admit that were not where we thought we could be So our hope is that as this virus has rightly so exposed many of the weaknesses of our country that it does not end up hurting the country and undermining its stability I say that because often if things dont get put into context then we lose the full picture And as you will find its so easy And we will continue to encourage at home and abroad discordant voices to be heard in our mind not because theyre right but because they have a right to say it And in exercising that right especially at this point were hoping that we can focus not just on saving lives but giving people a way of sustaining their livelihood That is the challenge we face today And for us theres nothing bigger than this Because we know we will win this fight against Ebola we must win this fight or else all of us get consumed by it We must  theres no choice here But do we want to limp across the finish line Do we want to roll back all of the progress since the civil war years or do we want to keep moving forward Building the kind of society that permits us in being more responsive to people that permits us to provide more opportunity to people to live to their fullest potential that is the challenge we must face every day and these are the decisions we must make every day Some we dont like but again theyre decisions we must make  with an eye  toward the long term and toward the future
