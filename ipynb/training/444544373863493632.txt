
 I had already decided that this week I would play around with breakfast grains when I noticed that food manufacturers are also coming up with new ideas I rarely look at the breakfast cereals on the shelves in the supermarket or at Trader Joes as its easier and cheaper for me to put together my own combos But this week as I reached for a container of steelcut oats I noticed several prepared mixes of grains and seeds like oats quinoa and flax mostly for hot cereal that I hadnt seen before I wanted to use up some of the ancient grains and seeds I have on hand  amaranth teff and chia seeds I tried making a porridge with teff alone and I wasnt crazy about the flavor so I combined these tiny seeds with oatmeal I did the same thing with oats amaranth and chia seeds The combinations were pleasing with the little seeds contributing texture to the porridges as well as bumping up the nutritional value considerably  When Im planning on porridge for breakfast on a weekday morning I begin the process the night before I pour boiling water over the grains and cover the bowl with a plate The next morning all I need to do is heat the mixture in the microwave for two  to four minutes I might also grate in some apple but basically hot cereal made this way requires no more fuss than a bowl of cold cereal with milk Two of the weeks breakfast Recipes for Health required longer cooking so theyre more suitable for a leisurely weekend morning One is a gritsmillet combo that I bake in the oven like polenta Its not cheese grits this one is sweet topped with maple syrup and toasted pecans The other is a hearty bowl of wheat berries such as farro spelt or wheat berries cooked with dried fruit and sweetened and spiced with cinnamon anise and rose water These I cook for an hour the night before then let sit overnight off the heat and if necessary simmer for a while again the next morning until they are tender and splayed My favorite way to serve the wheat berries is stirred into a bowl of yogurt along with some of the sweet broth left in the pot  This sweet and grainy polenta makes a delicious brunch dish  Amaranth and apple contribute texture and sweetness to this morning bowl  Amaranth and chia seeds pump up the nutritional content of this sweet and hearty morning bowl  Cinnamon and dried fruit sweeten this oatmealteff mix  These fragrant Middle Eastern wheat berries can be stirred into yogurt or eaten on their own
