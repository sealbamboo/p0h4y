The Justice Department has dropped a case against a Tennessee couple convicted of using misbranded drugs in their cancer clinics, a rare move that could signal unease in Washington with such prosecutions..  Dr. Anindya Kumar Sen and his wife, Patricia Posey Sen, had appealed their jury convictions to the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, using a high-powered legal team that included former federal prosecutor Alex Little and former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement.
