For decades surgeons have traveled to faroff hospitals to remove organs from braindead donors and then rushed back to transplant them Now an experiment in the Midwest suggests there may be a better way Bring the donors to the doctors instead A study out Tuesday reports on liver transplants from the nations first freestanding organ retrieval center Nearly all organ donors now are transported to MidAmerica Transplant Services in St Louis from a region including parts of Missouri Illinois and Arkansas Removing organs at this central location near the four hospitals that do transplants saves money the study found The livers spent less time outside the donors body which at least in theory improves the odds of success Doctors also think they are getting more usable organs from each donor though this study only looked at livers Transplant experts say this could become a new standard and groups in Philadelphia Pittsburgh Denver Chicago and Ann Arbor Mich have started or are exploring similar ventures Its kind of a foreign concept so its taken some time for this to catch on but I think it will It makes so much sense said Dr William Chapman a transplant surgeon at Washington University in St Louis which uses the MidAmerica center About  transplants were done in the United States in  more than  people are on the waiting list now Donor families have not balked at sending their loved ones bodies out of town to MidAmerica the regions organ procurement organization At first it bothered us said Stacey Smith whose yearold son Cameron Greenwood became an organ donor in  after dying of complications from diabetes But she said MidAmericas staff explained why it was best to move him from the small hospital in Branson Mo to St Louis a fourhour drive away These people sat down and prayed with us they cried with us they treated us like he was their own child and that just made a huge difference Smith said They called to say his heart and both kidneys had gone to three different recipients plus tissue and bones to help  others It really made us realize how much organ donors are heroes We had no clue how many lives one person could save and change
