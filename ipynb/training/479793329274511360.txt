 WebMD Health Corp. said it is suing Everyday Health Inc. for trademark infringement, false advertising and unfair competition.. The complaint, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, alleges Everyday Health has used WebMD's trademark on its Web pages, website addresses and search advertising campaigns "to deceive and mislead" consumers and advertisers into believing they are on a WebMD's trusted health and wellness site, the company said.
