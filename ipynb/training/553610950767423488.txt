here could scarcely have been a more explosive start to  for the NHS with all media outlets leading on the flurry of major incidents declared at hospitals nationwide Politicians responded accordingly  David Cameron downplayed it as shortterm pressures while   for an allparty emergency summit But what exactly is going on Are we talking about a handful of rotten apples or is there a systemic problem Part of the answer can be found in the number of declarations that steadily grew from two or three to about  within a few days Even this will be an underestimate as other hospitals will surely have been facing similar problems but decided against the reputational damage of a formal declaration With waiting times at AE lengthening and knockon effects to the week wait target for hospital treatment kicking in it seems reasonable to suggest there is a systemic problem But what is it Most of the analysis has focused upon factors external to hospitals  problems at the back door rather than the front door Hospitals have significantly reduced the time needed to recover from clinical interventions but then find hospital flow is blocked by limited discharge options  families unable or unwilling to cope access to social care support collapsing under the weight of public spending cuts and third sector organisations struggling to survive All of this was entirely foreseeable Less clear is the factors behind some of the surge in demand The larger population and its ageing cohort are important but over the last decade or so there have been  more hospital admissions than would have been expected as a result of these changes Some have pointed to the emergence of a right now attitude among younger people who are bigger proportionate users of AE than older people The algorithm staffers at NHS  are said to be sending around a fifth more people to AE than the former   Direct and quick GP appointments in some areas are still a collectors item And all of this is happening before any of the traditional winter illnesses are taking effect This surge in demand from patients has coincided with a diminished supply of staff to treat them GPs are retiring or leaving the NHS to work overseas district nurse numbers have dwindled to the point of extinction doctors and nurses are shunning a career in AE Under the cosh of the Francis report hospitals have increased nursing numbers but only by taking on expensive agency staff or scouring other countries and poaching their staff This additional recruitment is unfunded leaving hospitals to choose between quality of care or financial insolvency Although much of the debate has rightly focused on the absence of community support for people ready for discharge from hospital less attention has been given to the ways in which hospitals themselves have been financially compromised Many are struggling to cope with the longterm legacy of extortionate private finance initiative schemes On top of this all are subject to penalties for the use of AE facilities above target level and for readmissions within  days even though payment for all AE cases is fixed at only  for activity increases higher than the level seen in  In effect hospitals are being compelled to pay the price of wider weaknesses in the local health economy over which they have little or no control Meanwhile cashstrapped clinical commissioning groups demand more for less from their local providers and Monitor imposes punishing and unachievable efficiency tariffs The upshot of all of this is widespread financial unsustainability across foundation trusts and NHS trusts About  of NHS trusts are thought to have been in deficit in  compared with  in  as are  of foundation trusts compared with  in  Others will be eating into their rapidly diminishing reserves We can expect even worse figures for  when they are published at which point quality of care will be comprehensively trumped by financial insolvency Where do we go from here The current strategy is hasty preelection bungs to forestall the worst events Hunt has also pointed to the introduction of named GPs little more than a gimmick and the creation of the Better Care Fund robbing Peter to pay Paul All political parties are offering postelection spending increases for the NHS but none are even reaching the minimum bn figure proposed by Simon Stevens in his recent   This leaves us with a partiallyfunded remodelling of the NHS along the ambitious lines proposed by Stevens  variations of whole system working without the help of a transformation fund and still set in the marketbased ethos of the  act  the competition watchdog is already making worrying noises about the need for competing integrated care providers The Stevens bandwagon will roll on  vanguard sites have until the end of this month to get their bids into NHS England  but only optimists will feel a surge of confidence about the future The issues are so deeprooted complex and interlinked that tinkering will do little to help Some hospitals are more robust than others but sacrificing a few rotten apples isnt the problem The whole barrel needs to be changed otherwise major incident will be the new normal
