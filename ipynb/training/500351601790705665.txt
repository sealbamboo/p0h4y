Scientists say disrupting the bacterial makeup of the gastrointestinal tract could affect the way the bodys metabolism works A slow metabolic rate could lead to obesity because the body doesnt burn calories as quickly We found that when you perturb gut microbes early in life among mice and then stop the antibiotics the microbes normalize but the effects on host metabolism are permanent says senior author Dr Martin Blaser director of the NYU Human Microbiome Program and professor of microbiology at NYU School of Medicine This supports the idea of a developmental window in which microbes participate Its a novel concept and were providing direct evidence for it The study authors stress that more evidence is needed to determine whether antibiotics could lead to obesity in humans and that the study results should not keep doctors from prescribing antibiotics to small children when necessary Journal  In one of the largest studies to date on the connection between cancer and obesity researchers have found a link between a higher body mass index and  common types of cancer  The study authors analyzed data from more than  million people over the age of  who were originally cancerfree and then followed for an average of  years Every pound increase in weight was roughly associated with a higher risk of uterine cancer gallbladder kidney cervix and thyroid cancers and leukemia BMI was also positively associated with liver colon ovarian and postmenopausal breast cancers according to the study The number of people who are overweight or obese is rapidly increasing both in the UK and worldwide  from the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine It is wellrecognized that this is likely to cause more diabetes and cardiovascular disease Our results show that if these trends continue we can also expect to see substantially more cancers as a result Journal  After a heart attack doctors generally encourage patients to get fit in hopes of reversing the damage caused by cardiovascular disease But some survivors may overdo it in trying to prevent a relapse  Researchers at Mayo Clinic followed more than  heart attack survivors for an average of  years Survivors who did the exercise equivalent of  kilometer  mile of walking or running a day reduced their risk of dying from cardiovascular disease by  compared with the group that exercised the least Survivors who did the equivalent of  to  kilometers  to  miles a day reduced their risk by  But survivors who did more than  kilometers  miles a day only reduced their risk by   The results suggest that running or walking more than around  miles a week doesnt have an added benefit the study authors say  Dr Carl Lavie a cardiologist at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in New Orleans came to this conclusion As Hippocrates said more than  years ago If we could give every individual the right amount of nourishment and exercise not too little and not too much we would have found the safest way to health  Journal  After analyzing survey and study data from  countries around the world researchers know one thing for sure Sodium overconsumption is a global problem  About  million cardiovascular deaths in  were caused by consuming too much sodium the authors of a study published Thursday conclude Thats nearly  of all the deaths linked to cardiovascular disease  In fact researchers say an estimated  adults have an average daily sodium intake that exceeds the World Health Organizations recommendation of  grams per day Globally the average daily consumption is  grams per day  close to double whats recommended  Too much salt can increase your blood pressure leading to an increased risk of heart and stroke For tips on reducing your sodium intake check out the    Journal  Scientists know that young children from urban areas are more at risk for asthma and environmental allergies But a new study from Johns Hopkins Childrens Center suggests theyre also more at risk for food allergies than their peers  Researchers followed more than  innercity kids living in Baltimore Boston New York and St Louis from birth through age  They found one in  of the children were allergic to peanuts eggs andor milk Thats   whereas scientists believe about  of children overall in the United States have a food allergy The children with food allergies were also more likely to have another type of allergy Our findings are a wakeup call signaling an urgent need to unravel the causes contributors and mechanisms that drive the high prevalence of food allergies among an already vulnerable group says senior author Dr Robert Wood director of pediatric allergy and immunology at Johns Hopkins
