Blueeyed people have been living in Europe for at least  years scientists have discovered A man who lived on the Iberian peninsula before Europeans became farmers probably had blue eyes but dark hair and skin according to scientists who have sequenced his DNA This surprising combination of eye hair and skin coloring may have not have been unusual during his lifetime but it is no longer seen among modern Europeans   Sunday in the journal Nature To see how scientists figured out what he might have looked like click through the photo gallery above The man a Neolithic huntergatherer known to scientists as La Braa  is of great interest to scientists because he offers a snapshot of what was in Europeans DNA before agriculture spread through the continent Experts have theorized that certain genetic traits spread quickly among humans after they adopted the farming lifestyle La Braa  shows that at least some of their predictions were correct The mans skeleton along with that of a male companion was discovered in  in a cave in what is now northeastern Spain The site known as La BraaArintero sits about  feet above sea level and the cave provided a cold refrigeratorlike environment that preserved his DNA In the lab scientists were able to extract enough DNA from a single tooth to reconstruct La Braa s entire genome They compared it to the DNA of other ancient Europeans including   the yearold mummy found in a Alpine glacier and determined that he was a closer match with huntergatherers than with farmers Two specific genes  one for digesting lactose the sugar found in milk and another for digesting starch  offered further evidence that La Braa  was not a farmer New versions of both of these genes spread rapidly among Europeans after agriculture took hold and people began milking their livestock and growing crops And in both cases La Braa  had an older version of these genes Scientists also believe that many of the immune system genes that are common today arose after the rise of agriculture prompted people to live in larger communities making it easier for diseases to spread But La Braa  already had the modern version of some of these genes even though farming was still a ways off the team reported When it came to genes that would influence La Braa s appearance the researchers found that their yearold subject had versions of two skin pigment genes that are either very rare or nonexistent among Europeans today Then they looked at other places in the genome that influence pigmentation and found a mix of ancient and modern gene variants Taken together La Braa s DNA is likely to have resulted in dark skin pigmentation and dark or brown hair they wrote However his DNA indicates that his eyes were most likely blue the scientists found This suggests that gene variants for lightcolored eyes and skin did not spread together they wrote adding that La Braa s combination of dark skin and nonbrown eyes is unique and no longer present in contemporary European populations Today a blueeyed person would typically have fair skin To get some idea of whether La Braa s coloring was unusual for his day the researchers will try to sequence the DNA of his companion who has been dubbed La Braa     and like   on Facebook
