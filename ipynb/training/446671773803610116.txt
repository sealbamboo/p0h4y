We swat flies on our windowsills Watch ants scramble for the crumbs on our kitchen counters Bathe our pets to rid them of fleas And all of us have crossed paths with the nasty cockroach 
 
But what most of us dont know is that our homes are filled with a profusion of insects and their relatives collectively called arthropods most of which we never see  In the summer and fall of  I embarked on a postdoctoral study with a team of fellow entomologists from the   and   to discover what arthropods can be found in our homes It was the first comprehensive study of its kind with the aim to uncover what people could expect to find and why they might be there From the attic to the basement ceiling to floor we collected over  specimens  dead or alive  in  houses volunteered by the public within  miles of downtown Raleigh NC Homeowners were surveyed and extensive notes were taken at each location  Our team led by   from the Museum of Natural Sciences and   and   from North Carolina State organized sorted and identified the collected specimens to the family taxonomic level or further when possible at the museums   Processing was timeconsuming and intricate often requiring the identification of a piece of leg or broken wing  Our initial results were surprising as many as  or more different species of arthropods were often found in a single house  As entomologists we reveled in cataloging this relatively unexplored frontier of urban biodiversity Within the phylum Arthropoda most of our specimens belonged to class Insecta But there were also arachnids spiders and their relatives myriapods centipedes and millipedes and crustaceans generally consisting of isopods also known as pill bugs or rolypolies  indeed nearly  families and an estimated  species  Over all arthropod groups with the most diversity in houses were flies and beetles with over  different families collected followed by ants and wasps spiders stink bugs and relatives book lice moths isopods millipedes springtails silverfish and cockroaches Many arthropod families were collected as singletons  one species of a family collected one time in one room in one house Several families were found in more than  percent of homes gall midges Cecidomyiidae ants Formicidae and carpet beetles Dermestidae along with cobweb spiders Theridiidae darkwinged fungus gnats Sciaridae cellar spiders Pholcidae scuttle flies Phoridae and book lice Liposcelididae Most houses also had dust mites Pyroglyphidae  The good news is that most of these species are harmless living with us in harmony or at least unnoticed Many are even doing our dirty work Carpet beetle larvae are busy eating dead insects spilled dog food even our nail clippings while dust mites are like tiny vacuum cleaners eating the dead skin cells on our floors and in our beds  Some curious discoveries included spitting spiders Scytodidae found in  percent of homes which spit a venomous silk on prey up to two centimeters away and antloving crickets Myrmecophilidae only a few millimeters in size found in five different kitchens that also had ant infestations We also observed nature in action a parasitic wasp hatching out of true bugs egg a leaffooted bug with a fly egg glued to its head that if allowed to hatch would have eaten its host alive and flesh flies Sarcophagidae emerging from a cats recent rodent kill  As much as we were surprised by what we did find we were also surprised by what we didnt find or found in very small numbers no bedbugs only a few German cockroaches and just one black widow residing in a basement  An unexpected finding from our study is that book lice lived in just about every house Recent molecular analyses including research by   at the   have shown that book lice and head lice are more closely related to each other than previously thought Together with bark lice they are now joined in a single order Psocodea Our findings suggest that different lice are likely here to stay whether parasitically living on our scalps in the perfect itchy storm or benignly eating mildew from our old books As a parent who has experienced the head lice battle Ive come to the realization that I just have to accept there is no escaping these arthropods
