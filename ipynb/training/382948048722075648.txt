The yearold Ms Ellison found herself on the receiving end of a firestorm of criticism after pictures of her doing a heavy weightlifting routine two weeks before her due date appeared on Facebook The photos quickly went viral showing Ms Ellison a stayathome mother from California doing kettlebell swings pullups and Olympicstyle barbell lifts like squats and overhead presses Ms Ellison is a follower of CrossFit the popular strength and conditioning program that uses grueling highintensity workouts The caption on one of her photos reads in part One   in midlift hoisting a barbell over her head It was shared almost  times on Facebook and drew nearly  comments Many notes applauded Ms Ellison and celebrated her devotion to stay fit and active through pregnancy Some were from other mothers who spoke of their own training regimens through their pregnancies One woman Carol Metzger Bollonger wrote But there was also a barrage of criticism with many people calling Ms Ellison irresponsible and the photos shocking One woman asked Ms Ellison why she would risk hurting your baby just to stay in shape In response to her critics Ms Ellison   Web site Parentdish that she had previously had two healthy drugfree births and was planning a water birth at home for her baby She said the weights she was using in the photos that went viral were lighter than what she would typically lift because I dont go all out anymore But she also defended her weightlifting routine saying it has helped her avoid many of the ailments that pregnant women often experience Generally women are advised to take on an exercise program during pregnancy so long as they are not at high risk of premature labor or certain chronic conditions like high blood pressure or heart or lung disease Walking jogging swimming and light weight lifting are some of the activities doctors typically encourage But Dr Daniel Roshan an assistant professor at New York University Medical School and a maternal fetal medicine specialist said pregnant women should be careful not to push their heart rates above  beats per minute or raise their body temperatures above  degrees Fahrenheit The goal is to avoid exercising to exhaustion Dr Roshan said that heavy weight lifting during pregnancy is generally discouraged because it could put pressure on the abdomen uterus and cervix which could increase the likelihood of premature labor But he also pointed out that a woman who lifts regularly uses good technique and is well conditioned might be an exception This woman obviously has been lifting for a long time he said Normally we tell patients not to do this But this woman is probably putting less pressure on her belly and more on her arms With somebody who is trained and has strong arms their arms will carry more weight than regular people So they can get away with it without complications But for a regular person its not advisable Dr Roshan said that pregnant women should exercise for their own health and the health of their babies But long hours and strenuous activity could create complications  He said that nurses for example who work hour shifts while pregnant spending most of their days on their feet are more prone to delivering smaller babies than those who work eighthour shifts This is because the blood gets shifted from the womb and goes toward the arms and legs he said Thats another reason we say dont do strenuous activity in pregnancy But at the same time staying moderately active and following a healthy diet low in sugar can help control blood sugar during pregnancy reducing the likelihood of delivering a heavy baby Dr Roshan said It helps the baby not get too big he said The more sugar there is in your circulation the more sugar goes to the baby And the bigger the baby gets the more chances of complications like the shoulders getting stuck on the way out tears and lacerations and Csections In general we prefer to deliver seven pound babies as opposed to  or  pound babies The exercise recommendations for healthy pregnant women are essentially the same for most adults  three to five hours a week  with the caveat that they should take it a little easier A moderate exercise routine during pregnancy not only lowers the rate of complications it can make for a smoother recovery Dr Roshan said Somebody who is athletic and active always has a better and easier recovery after any procedure he said In general the healthier you are the easier the recovery
