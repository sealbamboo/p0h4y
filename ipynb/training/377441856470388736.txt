One of the most farreaching provisions of the federal health overhaul prohibits insurers from refusing to cover people who are sick or charging them more for policies Still for people with serious medical conditions the online health insurance marketplaces present new wrinkles that could have significant financial impact Obviously premium costs will be an important consideration for consumers But just as important will be a realistic assessment of what kinds of outofpocket costs they could expect with different types of policies and what subsidies they will be eligible for The law requires new individual and small group plans sold on the online marketplaces also called exchanges and on the private market to cover a comprehensive set of  essential health benefits including prescription drugs hospitalization and doctor visits The benefits covered will be similar in all plans but the proportion of the costs that a consumer pays will vary There will be four different levels of plan coverage Platinum plans will pay  percent of covered expenses on average gold plans will pay  percent silver plans  percent and bronze plans  percent Tax credits to help cover the   for plans sold on the exchanges will be available to people with incomes up to  percent of the federal poverty level  for an individual in  and   will reduce outofpocket costs for people with incomes up to  percent of poverty  for an individual in  The maximum amount that consumers will owe out of pocket for innetwork medical claims will generally be capped at about  for individuals and  for families in  Those figures dont include money spent on premiums How all those variables come together can have a big effect on people with high medical expenses For example even though the premium for a platinum plan will generally be higher the outofpocket spending cap may be significantly lower than other coverage levels since platinum plans must cover  percent of expenses In California for example the   on a platinum plan is  compared with  for other plans For people who expect to hit their spending cap buying a pricier platinum plan may actually result in lower total spending says Marc Boutin executive vice president and chief operating officer at the   a patient advocacy organization Its counterintuitive he says
