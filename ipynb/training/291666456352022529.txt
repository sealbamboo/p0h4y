States arent likely to prevent many shootings by requiring mental health professionals to report potentially violent patients psychiatrists and psychologists say The approach is part of a   in response to the Newtown Conn shooting a month ago But its unlikely to work because assessing the risk of violent behavior is difficult errorprone and not something most mental health professionals are trained to do it say specialists who deal with violence among the mentally ill Were not likely to catch very many potentially violent people with laws like the one in New York says   a professor of psychology at Fordham University in The Bronx The New York law says mental health professionals must report people they consider likely to do harm It also gives law enforcement officials the power to take guns from these people Such laws cast a very large net that will probably restrict a lot of peoples behavior unnecessarily Rosenfeld says Maybe well prevent an incident or two he says But there are other ways that would be more productive Better alternatives include reducing the total number of guns and improving access to mental health care Rosenfeld says One of the biggest problems with laws like the one in New York is that it asks all mental health professionals to make assessments that are difficult for even those with years of special training says Rosenfeld Rosenfeld says when he is called in to assess a persons risk of violence I typically have the benefit of a lengthy facetoface interview records on their criminal and mental health history a tremendous amount of information at my disposal that the typical mental health professional on the fly simply doesnt have And even highly trained professionals with lots of information often get it wrong research shows A   at a major urban psychiatric facility found that they were wrong about which patients would become violent about  percent of the time Thats a much higher error rate than with most medical tests says   a psychiatrist at the University of Michigan and an author of the study One reason even experienced psychiatrists are often wrong is that there are only a few clear signs that a person with a mental illness is likely to act violently says   a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University These include a history of violence and a current threat to commit violence Without either of these Hoge says an accurate assessment of the likelihood of future violence is virtually impossible The biggest risk for gun violence is possession of a gun says Hoge And theres no evidence that the mentally ill possess guns or commit gun violence at any greater rate than the normal population
