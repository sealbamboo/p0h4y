Summer vacation is over Not great news if youre a kid But some of you parents may feel more than ready to send your charges back to school But are you Are you really Here are a few things to consider What to do Make sure your children have the shots they need Why Its the best way to keep them from getting sick unnecessarily Also its the law See httpezizorgassetsdocsIMMpdf Details Children can be exempted for medical reasons if their parents  after being informed by a healthcare professional about the benefits and risks of the vaccinations  dont want the children to have them or if vaccinations would go against their parents religious beliefs When parents decide not to vaccinate their children its often because they fear that vaccines cause autism Reliable scientific research has not found any such link according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Institute of Medicine httpwwwcdcgovvaccinesafetyConcernsAutismIndexhtml httpwwwcdcgovvaccinesafetyConcernsAutismantigenshtml Most members of the medical community strongly encourage vaccinations The more children who are vaccinated the smaller the chance that any children will get sick To be really effective vaccination needs to be widespread What to do Make sure your kids get plenty of sleep Why A good nights sleep improves their chances of having a good day at school  not to mention a good diet Details Maybe they burn the midnight oil studying or maybe playing computer games But whatever the reason theres a good chance your children dont get enough sleep Not everyone needs the same amount but guidelines from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute set the goal for schoolaged children at  hours or more every night and for teens nine to  hours Unfortunately at least one poll of parents found that on average their schoolaged children fell short of the desired quota of zzzs by about an hour And an hour can make a big difference Research published in  in the Journal of Pediatric Psychology found that  to yearolds fared significantly worse during the day  both cognitively and emotionally  when they averaged about eight hours of shuteye as opposed to about nine Research has also found a link between sleeping too little and eating too much While this link has been seen at all ages it seems especially strong in children according to the CDC perhaps because sleep is especially important for brain development during childhood and adolescence In particular too little sleep may be bad news for the hypothalamus a region of the brain that affects a persons appetite What to do Make sure your children eat a good breakfast Why Theyre likely to be healthier behave better in class and get better grades  even have a higher IQ Details They may oversleep They may say theyre not hungry But no excuse is a good excuse for your kids to skip breakfast A  article in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience reviewed research conducted from  to  and found that breakfast is generally associated with better behavior and better academic performance And what kind of breakfast kids get seems to matter Breakfasts with higher nutritional quality have been associated with bigger boosts to brainpower and comportment In addition one  study not included in the review found regular breakfasteaters had higher IQ scores than frequent breakfastskippers In that study researchers reported it didnt matter what the children ate just as long as they ate So breakfast is important Dont let your kids leave home without it  unless theyre going to get one at school Research shows that compared with children who eat breakfast at home or dont eat it at all children who eat breakfast at school have better nutrition consume a wider variety of foods including more fruits and milk are less likely to weigh too much and even perform better on standardized tests perhaps because they fuel up closer to testtaking time What to do Watch for signs that your children are being bullied or are being bullies themselves Why Bullying is a serious problem especially in middle school but theres a good chance your children wont voluntarily talk to you about it Details In a large study of children in grades  through  nearly  reported that they had been bullied at school by other students at least once during the previous month about  reported that they themselves had bullied other students that month and about  said they had seen bullying going on in their schools  where most bullying happens Although cyberbullying is frequently in the news it actually happens much less often Parents may be blissfully unaware of the scope of the bullying problem because only about a third of bullying victims report it to adults according to statistics from the  School Crime Supplement published by the US Department of Education And it seems safe to assume that the ones who do the bullying are even less eager to tell on themselves But if your children are being bullied you may see some of these signs They come home with injuries they cant explain their possessions keep going missing they have an unusual number of real or imagined physical complaints they start skipping meals or bingeeating or coming home hungry because they didnt eat lunch they cant sleep well and have nightmares when they do their grades drop and they become schoolaversive their social life goes into a steep decline they feel helpless and inadequate they talk about  or actually engage in  selfdestructive behaviors And if your children are doing some bullying of their own you may notice some of these They get into fights physical or verbal they have friends who are bullies they act more and more aggressively they get into trouble at school they show up with money or new possessions from unnamed sources they blame others for anything that goes wrong theyre competitive and hyperconcerned about their popularity Scientists are working to understand bullying and how to prevent it but they dont have all the answers Still experts encourage parents to talk with their children about bullying if they see any signs of trouble  and even if they dont Studies have shown it can help What to do Learn about concussions and how they should be handled and how to avoid them if you can Why A brain is a terrible thing to damage Details Playing sports is good for kids  except when its not One problem Kids are especially vulnerable to injury In particular evidence suggests that blows to the face or head  which unfortunately are not unheard of in many sports  are more apt to result in concussions for children than for adults and children may take longer to recover Scariest of all if not handled properly concussions can interfere with childrens longterm cognitive development A concussion is a brain injury and it doesnt take much to cause one A seemingly small bump can sometimes be enough Common signs of a concussion include headache confusion and not remembering what happened But the signs are not always obvious they dont always show up immediately and children who want to get back in the game are not always eager to mention them Any child suspected of getting a concussion in a game should be taken out right away and not allowed to go back without clearance from a physician  no matter how much the child may protest A child who has been diagnosed with a concussion needs rest both physical and mental Note that playing video games and watching TV count as mental activities For more information you can

the flu Why Studies have shown that when children understand a few basic scientific principles they are more likely to behave in ways that reduce their chances of getting sick Details If your childrens first day of school is just around the corner can their first sick days of the year be far behind Maybe not But you can increase your chances of keeping them well  not so much by nagging them about sweaters and raincoats and galoshes but by teaching them about the viruses that actually cause colds and the flu In a  study in Cognitive Psychology researchers taught fourthgraders in Hong Kong this basic science  Coldflu viruses are living things too tiny for the naked eye to see  Once they get inside a person these viruses are very happy campers but they can survive outside too  for several hours when its cool and humid not so long when its hot and dry And theyre toast if they get boiled or cooked or attacked by disinfectants such as alcohol or bleach  Dead viruses cant hurt anybody But if they get inside someone while theyre alive they can make the person sick  And because theyre so little its easy for the viruses to sneak inside a person through the eyes nose or mouth The researchers taught another group of fourthgraders basic information about colds and the flu including some dos and donts but not including the above hows and whys And they offered both groups of children tips about washing their hands and not touching their faces etc Before these lessons researchers tested whether the children would spontaneously clean their hands before handling some crackers After the lessons they tested whether they would spontaneously clean their hands before touching some paper napkins to be used in a tea party Among the children who learned the hows and whys of viruses  cleaned their hands in the first test while  did so in the second Among the children who didnt learn the hows and whys the percentage was  on both tests
