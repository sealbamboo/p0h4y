      My issue was to see what we must preserve in this planet Any photo I can take to convince the authorities to convince the companies to convince anyone this is the minimum I can do In this sense I hope that these pictures that this show shows a kind of state of humanity of the planet that we cannot destroy more than we already have I was working in West Papua Indonesia with tribes that are living in the Stone Age When I say that I mean all of the instruments of their work anything they have are made from stone Now their forest is getting destroyed by man For me that is the point We are going too fast here We must start to rebuild what we have destroyed We are doing this in Brazil In part of the show we are showing a rain forest that we planted in Brazil We created an institution called   We planted now more than  million trees of more than  different species all local species We must replant I just worked now in March and April with a tribe in Brazil that suffered a lot from big diseases because gold diggers bring a lot of diseases that they the indigenous groups do not have Gold diggers use a lot of mercury The fish eat the mercury The people eat the fish they become very sick This is a big problem We are seeing this happening in larger scale inside the Amazon The   fights to take the gold diggers out but the region is so huge that it is difficult to take control We need much more participation We have a conscience And we must stop these things When you go to see this population this isolated population they are as smart as you and me They are humans like we are They are interested in my camera but they are a hundred times more interested in my knife because this is something that they can use My camera does not mean a thing to them They know what I am doing because each one has a sense of his own image They know when you are coming that you are doing something positive for them or something negative for them if you are stealing something from them or if you are giving something back to them Its like anyone else If someone comes to your community here in New York you know the way that he comes if he is sincere or not I come I live months with these communities I do not just come take your pictures and go Im working with the Indian movement in Brazil They are in big danger with the advance of largescale agriculture and they are fighting very hard for their land They have a sense of what happened to the Indians here in the United States and to the Indians in Canada the way they live now in kind of refugee camps They dont want to lose their soil I hope these pictures can go into the secondary school the university to see if the next generation can come to power in Brazil with respect for the Indians and culture and territory Because in Brazil  percent of the territory is Indian territory And Indian territory is green territory By protecting this culture we are protecting what is green I have several All from Siberia I spent  days without showering All the water materialized into ice But the people are so nice So that became my motivation
