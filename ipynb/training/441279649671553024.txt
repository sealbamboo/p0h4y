For the first time in more than four decades the drug lysergic acid diethylamide  better known as LSD  has been the experimental adjunct to psychotherapy in a controlled clinical trial approved by the US Food and Drug Administration And a newly published study on that trial reports that the medications antianxiety effects on patients facing lifethreatening illnesses were sizable sustained  and free of worrisome side effects In short everything was groovy In a pilot study conducted in Switzerland  patients suffering deep anxiety due to serious illnesses participated in several drugfree psychotherapy sessions and then joined a pair of therapists for two fullday psychotherapy sessions separated by two to three weeks under the influence of LSD After tapering off any antianxiety or antidepressant medications and avoiding alcohol for at least a day subjects in the trial were given either a microgram dose of LSD or an active placebo of  micrograms of the drug While the placebo dose was expected to produce shortlived and detectable LSD effects it was not expected to improve the psychotherapeutic process The larger dose was expected to produce the full spectrum of a typical LSD experience without fully dissolving normal ego structures the researchers wrote Patients who got the higher dose of LSD for the two sessions reported less anxiety after their LSD trips whereas anxiety built among the four subjects who did not get the full dose More important subjects who got the full dose experienced measurable and lasting improvements in their state and trait anxiety scores which reflect anxiety levels that are buffeted by changing circumstances state and those that are stable aspects of personality trait Eight weeks after the intervention those who got full doses of LSD had declines in both state and trait anxiety By contrast trait anxiety increased for all four of those who got the placebo dose and state anxiety rose in two of the four  The   led by a privatepractice psychiatrist in Switzerland was published online this week in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease It was sponsored by the Multidisciplinary Assn for Psychedelic Studies or MAPS a nonprofit group based in Santa Cruz that encourages research on legitimate therapeutic uses for hallucinogens In recent years medical and public attention to patients endoflife and palliative care has been on the rise Against that backdrop the US government has begun to ease its longstanding resistance to the exploration of drugs such as LSD as a means to ease what some have called existential anxiety Research on the therapeutic potential of other drugs known for their popularity on the street  including the psychoactive agent in psilocybin mushrooms and MDMA or Ecstasy  also is getting the federal governments goahead In addition to several studies using MDMA along with psychotherapy for treatment of endoflife anxiety the drug is under study  and has shown promise  as a treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder No flashbacks or other prolonged effects were observed and only six adverse events  including illusions emotional distress and feeling cold or abnormal  were reported by subjects during their experience but those were resolved quickly as the drugs effects wore off In a way the pilot trial was a return of LSD to its homeland Discovered in  in Basel by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann of Sandoz Laboratories LSDs psychoactive effects were quickly put to use by psychiatrists treating alcohol dependence psychosomatic disorders and neurosis This time the capsules containing the experimental medication were made up at Bichsel Labs in Interlaken Switzerland LSDassisted psychotherapy was practiced widely and openly in the United States until   and much later outside the US But as the psychedelic street drug became the beloved object of increased nonmedical use it was made illegal in  ending all US research on its potential therapeutic benefits  An earlier version of this post incorrectly spelled the name of the Swiss firm that made the LSD used in the study as Bischel Labs It should have said Bichsel Labs
