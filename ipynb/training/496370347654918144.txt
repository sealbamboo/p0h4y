Are we really seeing a return to The Waltons Family members sharing the old farmhouse with Grandma and Grandpa helping to raise the young uns and then when they get too frail to bake pies or go fishing being cared for by their adult children Recent years have brought a spate of studies showing an increase in multigenerational households The Census Bureau for example has reported that the proportion of   has crept upward to  percent in  from  percent in  And Pew Research which uses a broader definition  two or more generations in which the children are over age  plus skipped generation households of grandparents and grandchildren  recently published a report showing that the number of   Im not going to argue with those numbers But looking at them more closely suggests that this trendlet already slowing may ebb further and that were unlikely to see a return to such arrangements as a major way to care for a growing senior population I understand the nostalgia My highly nonscientific hypothesis is that the   that s TV drama with a rosy view of rural Depressionera life and now feel guilty if they shudder at the prospect of moving their elderly parents into their homes when they need help In fact as Ive pointed out before the proportion of older adults living with their children has plummeted since  primarily because the advent of monthly Social Security checks has allowed older people to live on their own   and theyve been voting with their feet  for independent living  ever since So whats this more recent uptick Pews data shows that since  the lowwater mark the percentage of the total population living multigenerationally has grown to  percent from about  percent for a  percent increase But as Richard Fry a Pew senior economist explained in an interview the change isnt being driven by older people moving in with their kids Its the other way around It used to be that the nations oldest adults were most likely to live in a multigenerational household he said They no longer have that distinction In  the proportion of  to yearolds living multigenerationally  percent was higher than for those over age   percent A weak job market has made it harder for young adults to maintain their own households so theyre moving in with their parents Among older Americans the increase in multigenerational households grew much more moderately for  to yearolds and the proportion of those over age  sharing family households has actually dropped since  Whats afoot here to a large extent is economic necessity not personal choice Were still seeing the effects of the Great Recession when multigenerational living spiked among nearly all age groups It has grown much more slowly since the recession officially ended in  and could decline further with a strengthening recovery Multigenerational households tend to be a lifeline a private safety net Dr Fry said Poor and unemployed individuals are more likely to gravitate to it  The movement in the other direction is much smaller Over  years the nations seniors have become more affluent Their poverty rate has fallen Dr Fry said They dont need the safety net as much Most  to yearolds sharing homes were heads of households the Pew researchers found Only among the oldest the plus group were a majority the parent of the householder And the proportion of the very old who lived with three or more generations has dropped since  Most who share a household now live with just one other generation  another way that life is not The Waltons The other factor propelling the growth of multigenerational households is immigration NonHispanic whites are the least likely ethnic group to share households  percent and AsianAmericans the most likely  percent Blacks and Hispanics and foreignborn Americans are all more likely to live multigenerationally and as the nation grows more diverse that trend will probably continue Even if multigenerational homes fade among subsequent generations new immigrant families will arrive And yet the   and the   show that with globalization and industrialization elder care evolves in other cultures too Lots of readers here have grown up or now live in multigenerational households we would like to hear about them and have cherished them or sometimes   Personal factors and family dynamics not just economic trends and immigration patterns come into play But I dont see a replay of The Waltons for American seniors anytime soon What do you think
