Every   which starts in October and peaks in January and February in the US as many as   with a virus that can cause serious even lethal complications not to mention the general awfulness of a fever chills congestion and body aches So how come there are still so many myths and rumors about the flu While officials arent predicting whether this years influenza will be better or worse than in years past its smart to make sure you know the truth about this dreaded virus and what you can do to reduce your risk of catching it No you cant   This longstanding rumor just wont die no matter how often experts debunk it The flu vaccine is made with dead viral particles and since the virus is not living it cant infect you explains Holly Phillips MD a New York City internist and WCBS News medical contributor The nasalspray version of the vaccine called the FluMist which is FDAapproved for kids and adults between ages two and  who are healthy and not pregnant does contain a crippled version of live flu virus However it still cant make you sick says Dr Phillips This misconception may stem from the fact that it takes   to the vaccine and fully protect you So if you pick up a cold or the flu before or just after rolling up your sleeve dont blame your runny nose and sore throat on the shot While its true that influenza is most threatening to the very young the elderly and people with underlying illnesses it can still cause severe symptoms in otherwise healthy people says Dr Phillips Thats why the CDC recommends that everyone get the shot preferably early in flu season Even if youre not in a highrisk group getting the shot can stop you from transmitting the virus to more vulnerable people The more people who get the shot the more we cut down on the amount of influenza circulating in the population which can protect your grandmother or child says Dr Phillips Even if you dont regularly interact with kids or seniors take a few minutes and get the shotat your doctors office local pharmacy or community health center You cant pass on a virus you never got in the first place As miserable as symptoms of the flu are digestive distress is rarely one of them Whats politely called the   is a colloquial term that refers to a group of viruses that primarily cause vomiting and diarrhea says Dr Phillips These viruses are not influenza she says Thats not to say that the flu doesnt occasionally lead to some gastrointestinal issues some sufferers do experience nausea and even vomiting But if you develop these symptoms without any of the classic flu tipoffs youre probably dealing with an entirely different germ On the contrary all pregnant women should get the jab as soon as possible The flu shot is very safe for pregnant women and getting it can even protect the baby for the first few months of life when he or she is not old enough to get the flu shot yet but is very vulnerable to illness says Dr Phillips Babies at least six months old are eligible for the vaccine Antibodies that form in response to the shot will not only protect you from the flu they will protect your baby after birth and be delivered via breast milk according to the CDC Pregnancy causes immune heart and lung changes that can increase your risk for a bad case of flu which can affect your pregnancy High fevers and severe infections can lead to serious pregnancy complications and even premature labor says Dr Phillips Dont get us wrong were all for washing your hands with soap and water But its not enough to stop the flu Influenza is spread through the air via droplets of saliva from a person who is contagious which starts a day before symptoms show and up to seven days after The droplets can land on you and get into your nose mouth and eyes You can also pick up the flu by touching contaminated surfaces the flu can live up to eight hours on surfaces according to the CDC then touching your hand to your face So wash your hands with soap and water and avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth This slashes your risk somewhat Dr Leavey says Its also important to stand at least six feet from anyone with the flu the airborne droplets cant travel farther than that Disinfect common areas in your home or workplace if someone with the flu spent time there And above all get vaccinated Its true that the flu vaccine doesnt offer  protection Usually the flu shot is only about  to  effective Thats because multiple strains circulate every year and its difficult for scientists to predict perfectly which strains will be dominant If you do get the flu after going for the shot it just means that you contracted a different strain that wasnt included in the vaccine says Dr Phillips If this happens there is an upside your symptoms will likely be less severe since the shot will probably be at least somewhat effective against the strain you have she adds And keep in mind that to the CDC a flu shot is a success if it prevents hospitalizations and deaths not if you sail through the season without a sniffle Theres no point in bugging your doctorantibiotics dont work on viruses That said there are Rx antiviral meds that might help Tamiflu is the best known this drug has been shown to cut the course of the disease by  days if you take it within  hours of the first sign of flu symptoms These are generally recommended only for those at   The effects are relatively modest says Dr Phillips Once you have the flu youre going to be miserable regardless Prevention with the flu shot is a better approach Other meds that can offer some relief include   such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen as well as congestion fighters Best bet Stay home get some rest drink lots of fluids and wait it out but be on your guard for serious complications Bells palsy is a condition that causes weakness or paralysis on one side of the face Its usually temporary clearing up after several weeks and its typically thought to be triggered by a viral infection such as herpes simplex the virus responsible for cold sores or EpsteinBarr which leads to mononucleosis How did the flu get into the mix Decades ago a few isolated cases of people developing Bells palsy after getting a flu vaccine were reported Yet no link was ever established showing that one caused the other says Dr Phillips The overwhelming consensus is that the two have nothing to do with each other adds Dr Leavey The flu shot doesnt cause any illness or condition and that includes   says Dr Leavey Alzheimers is a type of dementia that leads to memory loss and other cognitive changes Why some people develop Alzheimers is not fully understood and that opens the door to lots of speculationwhich seems to be how the rumor linking the flu jab to Alzheimers got its start The connection also has to do with the fact that senior citizens are strongly advised to get a flu shot every year so people associate old age with flu shots the way they associate old age with Alzheimers he says Or an elderly person who had a flu shot begins showing signs of memory loss months later The two are unrelated yet people conclude that the vaccine had something to do with it
