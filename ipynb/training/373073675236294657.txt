An ethical review board gave the two of them specifically  and no one else  permission to try it out Stocco said So far we are the only human beings whose brains are being connected said Stocco a research assistant professor at the universitys Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences  They have now done several trials of this brain communication in their unpublished   and hope to expand it  Rao wore a cap with electrodes that were connected to an electroencephalography machine a contraption that reads electrical activity from the brain Rao played a video game without using his hands just using his mind By imagining moving his right hand he could move a cursor on the computer screen to click fire in order to fire a cannon at a target The goal of the game is to hit rockets fired by pirate ships and avoid hitting supply planes   Meanwhile in Stoccos lab across campus Stocco wore a purple swim cap A transcranial magnetic stimulation coil was placed over his left motor cortex the part of the brain that controls hand movement  was read by the electroencephalography machine which then sent signals over the Internet to Stoccos brain by way of the transcranial magnetic stimulation coil The signal activated the neurons that prompted Stoccos right hand to move  Because of this connection Raos thinking about moving the cursor almost simultaneously caused Stocco to press the space bar of his own keyboard with his right index finger  The first time says Stocco I didnt know precisely if my hand moved because actually I got the signal from the machine or if I was twitching  I never twitch so I was pretty sure that it was the signal so I felt happy This all sounds futuristic and spacey But wait  this isnt published in a peerreviewed journal which is the gold standard for scientific results says Dr Miguel Nicolelis professor of neuroscience at Duke University who has pioneered braincomputer and brainbrain interface techniques Stocco said he and Rao plan on submitting their results to journals but wanted to get the word out quickly after they had evidence of their success  Whats more Nicolelis says Stocco was not consciously interpreting the signal from Rao Instead the brain signal caused Stoccos finger to move involuntarily  The absence of choice in this situation makes it less impressive from a scientific standpoint Nicolelis said The same effect could have been achieved by a cell phone or a computer triggering the involuntarily movement Its like a technical trick but it doesnt cross the threshold of braintobrain communication he said  Harvard University researchers have   that a human could move a rats tail with their minds translating the persons neural signals to excite the motor area of a rat that had a motor sensor on it This study was published in the journal PLOS One earlier this year  A true braintobrain interface would involve the ability for choice and for feedback Nicolelis said In other words the receiver would have the ability to send signals back to the sender  Nicolelis own research has shown this more complicated technique is possible at least in rodents In an experiment described in a study in the journal   two rats were placed in separate chambers with several levers The brains of these rats were connected through arrays of tiny electrodes One rat got a visual cue about which lever would lead to a reward of a drink of water When this rat pressed the correct lever the second rat received brain activity from the first rat corresponding to that decision  The researchers believe that the receiving rats were actively using and interpreting this information not just pressing a lever involuntarily because the receiving rat pressed the correct lever about  of the time That is still fairly high but not  Heres the more impressive part The rats appeared to demonstrate twoway collaboration in their brain network  the rat sending the signal changed its brain function and behavior when the receiving rat did not press the correct lever The researchers incentivized this by not giving a full reward to the sending rat if the receiving rat messed up  This kind of twoway brain communication between humans has yet to be demonstrated But that doesnt mean it isnt possible  For now the University of Washington scientists can show off their technique using simple brain signals but their technology doesnt allow people to read each others thoughts And dont worry  it was done in a laboratory setting in accordance with a strict humantesting protocol so it would not be used to control peoples behavior without their consent they say  The technology is still in its early stages but Stocco imagines many practical applications For instance a senior surgeon could control the hands of another surgeon in training during an operation Stocco also told the   that a person with disabilities could signal that he or she would like food or water or a pilot who becomes incapacitated could be assisted from the ground It was both exciting and eerie to watch an imagined action from my brain get translated into actual action by another brain Rao told the University of Washingtons news office This was basically a oneway flow of information from my brain to his The next step is having a more equitable twoway conversation directly between the two brains The researchers said they intend to conduct another experiment involving more complex information from one brain to another They will try the technique on more people if that is successful and if approved by the ethics board  If they can pump up the technology to do what Nicolelis has demonstrated in rats this would be quite literally a meeting of minds
