Whos going to be more successful at selling health insurance to young men this fall NBA MVP LeBron James NFL rookie of the year Robert Griffin III or Mom If officials at the Department of Health and Human Services get their way all may be drafted Were having discussions active discussions with a variety of sports affiliates Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius confirmed at a meeting with reporters this morning to relaunch the departments website for consumers   We know the   in Massachusetts when they rolled out their marketplace Sebelius said referring to that states successful effort to market to young men when it was implementing its insurance mandate in  So its a logical place to go Last week there were unconfirmed news reports of   whose season runs pretty much concurrently with the sixmonth signup period for the health law But its football season that will be in full swing when open enrollment for coverage through the Affordable Care Act   Sebelius hinted today that the National Football League may be more than willing to take on the task The NFL she said in the conversations Ive had has been very actively and enthusiastically engaged because they see health promotion as one of the things thats good for them and good for the country Getting young people particularly young men to sign up for coverage under the health care law is not just something thats good for them however Its critical to the entire success of the new insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act If only the older and sicker sign up premiums will quickly become unaffordable Yet getting those young people to sign up is a challenge said Sebelius since they may not get up every morning thinking about health insurance Enter Mom It turns out that mothers even more than sports stars or celebrities have a profound influence on what even their grown sons do Remember all those   It turns out says Sebelius that those ads have something of a ring of truth She said she was recently talking with an NFL player representative and he told her that when it comes to the health insurance offered by the NFL the most influential person is the mother of the player who can often get the player to do things that a wife a spouse a girlfriend or the player himself doesnt do Added Sebelius herself the mother of two sons It kind of confirmed my basic bias that moms still have a lotta influence
