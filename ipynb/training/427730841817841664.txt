Go into almost any hospital these days and youll hear a constant stream of beeps and boops To most people it sounds like medical Muzak But to doctors and nurses its not just sonic wallpaper Those incessant beeps contain important coded messages The threeburst is a crisis alarm systems engineer James Piepenbrink of Boston Medical Center explains on a tour of  North the hospitals cardiac care unit That might signal that a patients heart has gone into a potentially fatal   or even stopped altogether Two tones is a warning he says That can mean something ominous  or nothing worth worrying about Alarms are good and necessary things in hospital care except when there are so many of them that caregivers cant keep track of the ones that signal a crisis that requires immediate attention Then it may be that less technology can actually be more effective In the case of Boston Medical Center an analysis found that  North was experiencing  alarms a day  on average That kind of cacophony was producing a growing problem known as   Alarm fatigue is when there are so many noises on the unit that it actually desensitizes the staff says Deborah Whalen a clinical nurse manager at the Boston hospital If you have multiple multiple alarms going off with varying frequencies you just dont hear them That can be dangerous Patients can die when an important alarm is missed or an electrode on a patients chest comes unstuck or a monitors battery goes dead Boston Medical Center hasnt recorded any patient deaths because of alarm failure but Whalen says we were lucky A     in  found more than  deaths nationally related to alarm problems Last year the Joint Commission a national qualitycontrol group   of  alarmrelated instances of patient harm including  deaths and  cases of permanent disability The known alarmrelated problems are just the tip of an iceberg according to   the Joint Commissions chief medical officer because such cases are seriously underreported It is pervasive in almost any accident that occurs in a hospital McKee says If you look carefully you will most likely find that there was an alarm as a contributing factor Thats why the Joint Commission has   at the top of its current list of issues that hospitals are expected to tackle McKee says technology has gotten out of control We have devices that beep when they are working normally she says We have devices that beep when theyre not working Boston Medical Center is attracting national attention as a hospital that apparently has conquered alarm fatigue Its analysis showed the vast majority of socalled warning alarms indicating potential problems with such things as low heart rate dont need an audible signal The hospital decided it was safe to switch them off The hospital also upgraded some lowlevel warning alarms to a higher level signifying crisis  for instance a pause in heart rhythm And nurses were given authority to change alarm settings to account for patients differences Once that happened nurse Deborah Whalen says many many many alarms disappeared And instead of  alarms a week we dropped to  alarms a week Thats on  North alone The hospitals success in reducing alarm fatigue is   in the   Whalen says its a clear case of less is more I think less  better Whalen says If you have more and more data more and more alarms more and more technology  its bad data in bad decisions made These days you can easily hear how quiet  North and all of the adult medicalsurgical units at Boston Medical Center have become Instead of a steady stream of beeps minutes can pass without an alarm So when a crisis alarm sounds the staff can easily hear and respond Its a lot more manageable says staff nurse Amanda Gerety Its a lot more pleasant being at work And when she sleeps she says with a laugh I dont hear alarms in my dreams anymore The hospital says patients like it better too For one thing when they press the nursecall button the nurses are more likely to hear it
