Richard Van As was working in his home near Johannesburg South Africa in May of  when he lost control of his table saw Its a possibility that it was a lack of concentration he says Its just that the inevitable happened The carpenter lost two fingers and mangled two more on his right hand While still in the hospital he was determined to find a way to get back to work Eventually solving his own problem led him to work with a stranger on the other side of the world to create a mechanical hand using   Other prosthetics including a lower jaw have been made with the technology before but making a hand is particularly tricky As soon as he got out of the hospital Van As began researching prosthetics online They cost thousands of dollars  money he didnt have So in the meantime he rigged up an artificial index finger for his right hand with materials from his shop But he kept looking for help or a collaborator  someone who could help him fix his hand In time Van As   from Ivan Owen In the video Owen a special effects artist and puppeteer in Bellingham Wash was demonstrating one of his creations a big puppet hand that relies on thin steel cables to act like tendons allowing the metal digits to bend The complexity of the human hand has always fascinated me and really captured my imagination Owen says The two began working together long distance  Skyping sharing ideas even sending parts back and forth Finally Owen flew to South Africa to finish the work in person with Van As And today Van As has a working mechanical finger to assist him with his work But something else happened on Owens visit to South Africa While he was there Van As received a call from a woman seeking help for her yearold son Liam Dippenaar who was born without fingers on his right hand The cause was a rare congenital condition called amniotic band syndrome In ABS fibrous bands can wrap around a hand or a foot in utero and cut off circulation Van As says he and Owen looked at each other and were of one mind  Yeah easy no problem  Within days they developed a   for Liam with five aluminum fingers that opened and closed with the up and down movement of Liams wrist Owen still remembers the yearolds reaction when they rigged up the device for the first time He bent his wrist and made the fingers curl Owen says You could see the light bulbs go off and he looked up and said It copies me It was really an incredible moment When Owen flew back to the United States he wondered if the device could be turned into printable parts So he emailed   a firm that makes D printing equipment to see if the company would help out It did offering both Owen and Van As a free D printer Then there was no stopping us Van As says What had previously taken the pair a weeks time or more  milling finger pieces adjusting and tweaking parts  now took  minutes to redesign print and test Eventually Liams crude hand was replaced with the   which Van As and Owen call Robohand After practicing with it for a little while Liam was able to pick up a coin grab objects of different shapes and sizes Owen says Hes a really determined little guy They   for Robohand on Thingiverse a website for sharing digital designs Anyone can download the plans and  with a D printer and about  in parts  make a hand Videographer Paul McCarthy and his yearold son Leon live in Marblehead Mass They discovered Robohand on the Web and decided to make one for Leon who was born with no fingers on his left hand Printing the parts using a friends borrowed D printer was easy the two say But it took them a month to figure out how to string screw and bolt together what they describe as the Frankenstein version Its still a work in progress they say but several weeks ago Leon wore it to school for a tryout Im able to hold a pencil and piece of paper Leon says Ive done a lot more than I ever thought I could so its opened up a lot of new doors in my life Paul McCarthy says there were few options for his son The doctors advice when Leon was very young was to get used to using his hand without prosthetics and try to acquire a full range of abilities and motion Leon should first learn to navigate the world relying on his one fully functioning hand and the partial dexterity of his other hand the doctor advised So the last time we went to visit his hand doctor he recommended maybe we could start looking for prosthetics Paul McCarthy says And thats when father and son found the YouTube videos of little Liam in South Africa So far in addition to his work as a carpenter Van As has fitted more than  children with Robohands He doesnt charge anything  not even for the parts  but he does want to train others to learn how to assemble the devices and properly fit kids with them To do that hes   and with more people helping more people will get hands he says Like Leon McCarthy Leon came bouncing out of school with this biggest smile Paul McCarthy remembers He remembers Leon saying Look its working the Frankenstein hand is functioning I am holding my lunch bag But getting the fit just right was hard for McCarthy and his son and experts in prosthetics say users are bound to have these kind of challenges Matthew Garibaldi director of orthotics and prosthetics in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of California San Francisco says that making sure a prosthetic device fits is essential for it to work well And there are limited options for pediatric prosthetics Garibaldi says because there arent many kids with upperextremity amputations Thats one reason a device like Robohand is so appealing he says Its primary function is to decrease manufacturing costs and increase productivity The timeliness of this technology couldnt be better Garibaldi says And the world of D printing is moving quickly A   is now available  its designed to snap together like Legos Materials for this version will cost just
