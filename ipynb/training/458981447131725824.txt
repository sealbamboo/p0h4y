During the 2014 awards season Nyong'o was often hailed for being one of the most fashionable on the red carpet. She made headlines in February for a moving speech she gave while accepting the best breakthrough performance award at the 7th annual Black Women in Hollywood luncheon., "I remember a time when I too felt unbeautiful," ,  "I put on the TV and only saw pale skin. I got teased and taunted about my night-shaded skin.",  that she was moved by People naming her the most beautiful., "I'm flattered, but flattered sounds like such a flighty word, you know? I'm flattered with, like, gravitas under it," she said., This year's most beautiful cover issue is the 25th annual for People magazine. The first honor went to actress Michelle Pfeiffer in 1990, and last year's most beautiful person was Gwyneth Paltrow.
