
 Once summer tomatoes are flourishing in my garden and at farmers markets capturing their bounty for the rest of the year becomes a weekly ritual This mostly involves the making of marinara sauce I try to have enough of it in the freezer to last me through a winters worth of impromptu pasta dinners  This week though I also made a condiment that is for now in a jar in my refrigerator It wont last long Its a ketchup of sorts that is concentrated sweet pungent and spicy It was inspired by a recipe for tomato jam from one of my favorite chefs Matthew Kenney and Ive been slathering it on sandwiches and grilled vegetables I reserve my paste tomatoes the oblong varieties like romas and San Marzanos for marinara sauce and use the sweet juicy ones for salsas and uncooked tomato sauces that I serve with everything from pasta to grains to fish to cooked vegetables to eggs this week I topped wilted chard with a tomato concass and poached eggs with a blended tomato mint sauce  An irresistible destination for my tomatoes this week and Ill now be making this every week during the summer is a focaccia topped with heirloom tomatoes and fontina cheese The tomatoes sweetened even more during their short stay in the oven and the focaccia was still good a couple of days after I made it though it was hard for my son and I not to polish the whole thing off right away Stay tuned for salsa and other focaccia recipes on Recipes for Health   Sweet juicy heirloom tomatoes can be made into a concass that works as well with vegetables as it does with pasta or grains  This dish turns summer tomatoes into a salsa cruda that can also work well with most any kind of fish  Focaccia a little crisp on the bottom but soft on the top and inside can take on many toppings besides tomatoes  This sauce is a tomato jam that tastes more like a richly spiced ketchup A long simmer is important  This colorful risotto serves as a luxurious showcase for summers bounty of tomatoes and corn
