Giving up alcohol for a month can change peoples drinking in the long term meaning they drink less and get drunk less often according to a study Researchers from the University of Sussex followed up nearly  participants in Alcohol Concerns Dry January campaign Six months on  had kept harmful drinking episodes down and  were still not drinking Participants were more likely to refuse alcohol in social situations too Dr Richard De Visser senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Sussex who led the research said Whats really interesting to see is that these changes in alcohol consumption were also seen in the participants who didnt complete the whole month alcoholfree  Even if participants took part but didnt successfully complete the  days it generally led to a significant decrease across all the measures of alcohol intake Dry January is a campaign by Alcohol Concern aimed at social drinkers encouraging them to give up alcohol for a month after the excesses of Christmas It had been suggested that a boozefree month could cause people to bingedrink the next month But the charity said there was no evidence of this The research showed that committing to a month off alcohol was more likely to lead to people moderating their drinking it said They were also more likely to say no to a drink on social occasions or when feeling upset or anxious For the research around  people completed a questionnaire before they gave up alcohol in January  and more than  completed a followup questionnaire in February Nearly  people completed another followup questionnaire in August six months later After going  days without alcohol people taking part said they experienced a number of positive sideeffects such as sleeping better losing weight and feeling more energetic More than threequarters of people said they had saved money and felt a sense of achievement Prof Kevin Fenton national director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England said the research showed that a month of abstinence can help people reset their relationship with alcohol Overconsumption of alcohol is a causal factor in more than  medical conditions including cancer depression and dementia and yet more than half of adults who drink do so at a level above the recommended guidance  Dry January has proved to be successful in helping people moderate their drinking and benefit from a healthier lifestyle which is why Public Health England is supporting the initiative    Commenting on the research Prof Paul Wallace chief medical adviser to alcohol education charity Drinkaware said people should not be complacent Its important not to assume that having a break from alcohol for a while means its OK to drink to excess the rest of the year  Its also important to recognise that just because you can stop drinking alcohol for a period of time it doesnt mean you dont need to continue to moderate your drinking in the long term
