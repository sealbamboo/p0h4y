If youre the parent of a teenager this may sound familiar Leave me alone Get out of my face Maybe youve had a door slammed on you And maybe you feel like all of your interactions are arguments Kim Abraham a therapist in private practice in Michigan specializes in helping teens and parents cope with anger She also contributes regularly to the online newsletter   Abraham says for starters dont take it personally Teens just cant explode at their teachers or with friends but parents are safe And safe harbors are crucial for teenagers during these years For them everything is different than it was in childhood Academics are tough Friends behave differently Expectations are high Their brains   and their hormones are raging According to Abraham anxiety from all of these stresses often comes out as anger Theres always another emotion that precedes anger like hurt disappointment embarrassment So its important she says to help your kids learn how to uncover what that trigger feeling is You can help them learn how to move through that feeling and then move into resolution Take latenight texting for example the root of many arguments for Brad McDonald and his yearold daughter Madalyn Madalyn feels its important to stay socially connected with her friends even if that means texting late at night on a school day Her dad thinks otherwise He says On one level I dont want it to become an addiction and she does need her sleep And I want her to learn to communicate without texting  I think thats important Not long ago the argument got so heated Brad felt he had to physically grab the phone from his daughter He wasnt happy about doing it but he felt he had no choice According to Abraham parents should try to resist getting physical with their teens by grabbing the phone or unplugging the Xbox for example Yelling back doesnt help either she says If youre getting in your childs face thats a confrontation and anger plus anger equals what Bigger anger What you should do says Abraham is take a breath Walk away Let your child know there will be consequences later  and stick to them Equally important she adds Always remember theres a reason for the anger In the case of Madalyns texting she didnt want to disappoint her friends Another typical argument for parents and teens music and movies Recently Madalyn and her friends wanted to watch   But its rated R and Dad said no Madalyn was embarrassed because my friends parents let them watch those types of movies In this case Abraham suggests Brad can say OK I understand you get embarrassed How can you move through that Youre still not going to watch it So where can you find resolution Then Madalyn can problemsolve A solution could be that Madalyn doesnt even ask to watch movies when her friends come over because the answer might be no Or Abraham says she could ask Dad ahead of time to list the  movies hes OK with so she doesnt get embarrassed in front of her friends In the case of texting the resolution was a minute warning Now says Brad theres no more excuses no more pushing boundaries   pm is the time and shes much better at it now The key in all these disputes says Abraham is not to argue with your teen about   angry Help them understand   theyre angry Thats something parents can remind themselves about when they see their children struggling with these things The teenagers are building problemsolving skills and coping skills that they can rely on for a lifetime she says Theyre becoming stronger people
