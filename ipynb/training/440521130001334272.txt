Into every life a little pain must fall My friends and I all well into our Medicare years often joke that if nothing hurts you must be dead In truth pain is not a normal part of aging experts note and should not be ignored Yet studies have found that elderly patients are less likely than younger adults to report pain to their doctors Instead many suffer in silence at considerable cost to the quality of their lives The good news is that older people cope better with pain but the bad news is that they cope by decreasing function and accepting pain as a consequence of aging wrote Dr Bruce A Ferrell a geriatrician at the University of California Los Angeles and his coauthors   a website for primary care doctors Unfortunately this may lead to a vicious cycle of declining functional status worsening overall health and neglect of remedial and treatable conditions and ultimately resulting in needless suffering they added Untreated or inadequately treated pain is disabling and can hasten the death of an older adult by interfering with the ability to exercise eat properly or maintain social contacts Persistent pain can lead to immobility depression sleep problems loss of appetite and isolation all of which may increase the need for expensive medical care As many as  percent of elderly people living at home experience considerable pain as do up to  percent of those in nursing homes In a study by a nursing team of  older people most between the ages of  and  living at home in North Carolina  Causes range from arthritic joints to chronic disease Yet the underlying disorder may be correctable or if not treated to significantly relieve the pain it causes There are nearly always safe and effective treatments to reduce pain A few weeks before Christmas said Dale Bell an active yearold in Santa Monica Calif his shoulder and hip began to hurt I took ibuprofen got a massage and eased off on my workout in the gym he said When selftreatment failed he saw a doctor who suggested physical therapy But before Mr Bell could begin he and his family made a holiday trip to New York during which the pain intensified spreading from his shoulders to his knees It was almost impossible to get out of bed and dressed in the morning he said Given a diagnosis of   in January he was prescribed a steroid a muscle relaxant and a longacting pain reliever along with physical therapy Mr Bell is now back in the gym gradually increasing the intensity of his workouts He said he had been able to reduce his dependence on medication and felt he had gained the upper hand on his condition A mistaken belief that pain is inevitable is just one of many barriers to proper care for the elderly Others include a reluctance to bother the doctor or be viewed as a complainer concern about the need for additional tests and fear that treatment will require surgery or medication that could lead to addiction Older patients with dementia may be unable to report or accurately describe their pain and a failure to relieve their discomfort can result in aggression or other undesirable behaviors Once pain is recognized in an older person the next challenge is treating it properly Just as children medically speaking are not miniature adults the elderly are not simply wrinkled versions of those much younger Changes in body composition organ function and metabolism affect how an older person responds to medication Kidney and liver function naturally decline with age so avoiding toxic side effects may require using lower doses of pain relievers Potent painkillers like opioids given at standard doses can build up in the blood of an elderly person causing confusion and dementialike symptoms Taking drugs orally may be difficult if saliva flow has slowed if a person has trouble swallowing or if a decline in stomach acid impairs absorption An appropriate drug must be chosen in view of its possible side effects interactions with other medications and its effects on a pain sufferers other health problems Experts say that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs popularly known as Nsaids must be used cautiously in the elderly because of an increased risk of gastrointestinal upset bleeding and kidney damage Too often elderly patients sabotage effective treatment by waiting too long to take a prescribed drug  pain is best headed off at the pass before it becomes severe  or by stopping the medication abruptly when they feel better Pain medication is best taken on a consistent schedule especially if the pain is chronic Although drugs are often essential there are other effective ways to treat pain Often helpful either alone or with medication are physical therapy massage strength training relaxation exercises yoga acupuncture water aerobics alternating applications of heat and cold meditation selfhypnosis and even listening to music and playing with a pet or children Arthritic pain is the most common complaint among the elderly who live at home The typical response is inactivity which the nursing teams report described as an illadvised response because the consequences of inactivity can result in additional problems for the elderly In addition to seeking proper pain management the authors wrote older people should try to maintain activities of daily living in the midst of discomfort to avoid perhaps even greater problems associated with immobility If you are elderly or taking care of an older person be sure that at every medical visit the doctor asks about pain  its frequency duration and intensity  and then addresses the problem As the nurses put it Every person regardless of age has the right to be as free from pain as possible
