The Center for Science in the Public Interest has named the worst restaurant meal in America  they say its Long John Silvers Big Catch a  plate featuring a   hush puppies and the choice of a side The version CSPI tested had onion rings as the side The meal is so big that Long John Silvers encourages patrons to  showing the empty Big Catch container to prove they finished it The CSPIs lab tests showed  grams of trans fat in the Big Catch meal which they say all comes from the restaurants use of partially hydrogenated frying oil The tests also showed  grams of saturated fat and  milligrams of sodium and  calories in the fast food fish meal   doesnt include nutritional information for the fried haddock in the Big Catch meal But according to the company an order of battered onion rings contains seven grams of trans fat five grams of saturated fat and  milligrams of sodium a twopiece order of hushpuppies packs three grams of trans fat two grams of saturated fat and  milligrams of sodium The health group says that the company understates the trans fat saturated fat and sodium found in the hush puppies and onion rings For example the CSPI says its lab tests showed  grams of trans fat in the onion rings The CSPI visited three restaurants in the DC area and purchased  samples of the fried haddock seven orders of French fries five orders of onion rings and  orders of hush puppies The samples were sent for laboratory testing to Eurofins a commercial bioanalytical testing company executive director Michael Jacobson told TODAYcom  On Tuesday afternoon Long John Silvers owned by LJS Partners issued a statement   Long John Silvers offers a variety of meal choices including baked fish and shrimp that can satisfy almost every diners dietary choices We stand behind our published food data and will review any requests from CSPI that raise questions about our data Jacobson says the nutrition advocacy group will consider suing the restaurant chain if it continues to use partially hydrogenated oil in its deepfryers and if it continues to misrepresent the nutritional information in the side items  For people eating  calories a day the American Heart Association recommends consuming less than two grams of trans fat  grams of saturated fat and  milligrams of sodium per day Artificial trans fats used in frying oils and processed foods have been banned because of their link to heart disease Partially hydrogenated oil is a major source of trans fat explains Madelyn Fernstrom NBC News diet and health editor It both raises LDL or bad cholesterol and lowers HDL or good cholesterol This was the opposite of when it was discovered decades ago when it was thought that chemically modifying vegetable fats to seem more like butter and other animal fats was a good thing Fernstrom said via email Science has shown it to be worse than animal fats on cholesterol measures Many restaurants have gotten rid of this kind of cooking oil for this reason Fernstrom calls the Big Catch a triple whammy  three fried foods on one plate each packed with unhealthy arteryclogging fat  You dont need CSPI to tell you this meal is a nutritional nightmare and a horrible choice under any circumstances she said  But if you do end up at a fast food restaurant this holiday weekend Fernstrom has some advice on making the best possible choices First always downsize to the smallest serving size and whenever you can choose baked or grilled over fried options At Long John Silvers for example an order of Hold the Batter Cod or Hold the Batter Shrimp each have zero grams of trans fat and saturated fat and both items are closer to  calories according to the nutritional information posted to the chains   And the menu does offer nonfried side items like seasoned green beans rice or a baked potato all of which have zero grams trans fat and low to no grams of saturated fat  Dont be fooled by healthfood impostors like batterfried fish Fernstrom advises The batter and oil are health negatives and if you want fish choose baked or grilled Most menus have baked options  or you can simply ask for it If you like a fried option when out in a restaurant as a treat pick   option Fried fish Get a salad and baked potato Want hush puppies Double up on the veggies and a choose a baked fish fillet
