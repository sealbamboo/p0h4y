The Central Asian nation of   has huge rivers They begin atop some of the worlds highest mountains and then flow west through the countrys lush green valleys Yet for many Tajik families getting enough water each day is still a struggle A study by the United Nations last year   that most Tajiks lack access to safe clean water Many people rely on rivers and open ditches for drinking water which are often fouled by animals agricultural runoff and even human sewage The situation has gotten steadily worse as infrastructure built by the Soviets has decayed and failed In Soviet times there were water stands for every  or  houses in a village It was better says yearold Nazarali Murodov as he waits for water from an open rusted pipe in the village of Navbahor Murodov has brought his donkey cart to the pipe The animal is loaded with yellow plastic jugs and large metal milk cans Getting water is one of his familys most crucial daily chores he says If someone is free he goes to fetch water and spends two to three hours to do this Murodov can haul about  gallons of water on each trip with his donkey His family of  uses one load each day just for drinking cooking and cleaning If he has time Murodov tries to make a second daily trip to the well so he can irrigate the family garden The area around the village water pipe is busy with activity Two young men are loading jerrycans into the trunk of a rusted Lada sedan Some kids have come with jugs tied on their bicycles Several girls are scrubbing carpets in the gravellined puddle below the spilling pipe Theres no spigot or shutoff valve The water just pours out of the broken corroded pipe Ten or  years ago there was a pump here and a nice water stand But its all gone Murodov says No one cares about this now During the Soviet times there were functioning water systems throughout most of Tajikistan says Davide Costa of the nonprofit   But that infrastructure went in to decline toward the end of the communist period and hasnt been maintained since Now just about  percent of the population in rural Tajikistan has safe water he says which is nothing Access to adequate sewage facilities is also dismal in much of the country and has led to repeated outbreaks of typhoid and other waterborne diseases Easy access to water can transform lives and some parts of Tajikistan are getting the help they need In the neighboring village of Delolo the local government finished a new gravityfed system to help ease the water shortage The project funded by the Swiss governments international development agency and the nonprofit Oxfam brought a tap into each familys yard Before the system started working Rahmonova Parvina  says she would spend half of each day trekking up and down a hill to get water I dont have a donkey she says I went to fetch water two or three times a day From the early morning to the afternoon I only fetch water And then for the half day I did some housework or supervised my kids if I have a spare minute Tajikistan is squeezed between Afghanistan Uzbekistan Kyrgyzstan and China Roughly  million of the countrys  million people work abroad as migrant laborers Women like Parvina are often left to run the households which includes making sure theres enough water Parvina says having a tap in her yard has changed everything Now she has more time for her kids She can irrigate her vegetable garden Parvinas husband works in Russia and sends money home to support the family  covering most of their expenses But Parvina says she now also has the time to sew traditional Tajik dresses and earn her own money Oxfam has built three such village water systems in Tajikistan and plans to build  more owned and run by locals Villagers still have to pay for the clean water they use Costa says but thats a good thing It encourages conservation and provides funding to maintain the systems for future generations
