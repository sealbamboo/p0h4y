A baby has become the youngest in the UK to have cochlear implants  at the age of three months and three days Evie Smith had the first device implanted in her right ear and then the second one seven weeks later Evie is now aged six months  and returned to St Thomas NHS Hospital in London last week to have the devices activated Staff there have emphasised her case is exceptional Evie became profoundly deaf after contracting pneumococcal meningitis when she was just three days old She spent six weeks in intensive care and needed to be on a ventilator for a fortnight  She was given cochlear implants at an exceptionally young age because the meningitis led to bony growth  or ossification  in her inner ear  The damage to Evies ears was getting worse which meant that waiting for implants at a later stage was not an option Cochlear implants cannot cure deafness  but they help Evie and children like her experience sound Audiological specialists fitted external processors to the outside of Evies ears  these pick up sound and connect with the internal implants which help send electrical signals to the brain The staff at St Thomas banged a drum to monitor Evies responses as they programmed the processor Watching her stir as she absorbed the sound meant the world to her parents  Her mother Jenny Harvey  from Kent told me When we found out she was deaf what affected me most was the thought of her speech being impaired But hopefully her speech should be very good  with input from the speech and language therapists  Were looking forward to hearing her say mummy and daddy We didnt think wed get to this stage The outlook wasnt very good for Evie when she was very ill Its such a relief that shes responding to the implants It feels as though were getting some good news now Many hospital appointments still lie ahead for Evie  but activating the implants has been a milestone for her parents  Her father Barrie Smith  said Were hoping that Evie will go to a mainstream school  There are some things we still dont know about Evies longerterm development  she will tell us as she grows older Evie is now among around  children in the UK who have cochlear implants  Some deaf people are opposed to implants and believe that deaf children should instead learn to sign and become members of the deaf community Katherine Wilson the principal audiological scientist at St Thomas Hospital stressed that Evie had the implants at an exceptionally young age because of the aftereffects of her meningitis She said We had to move very quickly to treat her The bony growth in the inner ears that she had after meningitis meant we wouldnt have been able to get the implants in later It just wouldnt have been a possibility The activation process went fabulously well We never know how young children will react but Evie showed typical behaviours youd expect from a baby of her age This will be a long and slow process with her coming back to hospital many times to have the devices reprogrammed  Were not trying to cure deafness  this is a way of managing and treating it  Implants give these children a different dimension to their life  something they wouldnt otherwise have When Evie has the implants on shell be able to pick up on sound and speech and hear her mum and dad calling her When the implants are off shes still a deaf child But because of her young age she has every chance to develop her speech and language to be able to communicate with hearing people and to hear the rich sounds of the world
