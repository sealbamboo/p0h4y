Brain scans show a complex string of numbers and letters in mathematical formulae can evoke the same sense of beauty as artistic masterpieces and music from the greatest composers Mathematicians were shown ugly and beautiful equations while in a brain scanner at University College London The same emotional brain centres used to appreciate art were being activated by beautiful maths The researchers suggest there may be a neurobiological basis to beauty The likes of Eulers identity or the Pythagorean identity are rarely mentioned in the same breath as the best of Mozart Shakespeare and Van Gogh The study   gave  mathematicians  formula to rate One of the researchers Prof Semir Zeki told the BBC A large number of areas of the brain are involved when viewing equations but when one looks at a formula rated as beautiful it activates the emotional brain  the medial orbitofrontal cortex  like looking at a great painting or listening to a piece of music The more beautiful they rated the formula the greater the surge in activity detected during the fMRI functional magnetic resonance imaging scans  Neuroscience cant tell you what beauty is but if you find it beautiful the medial orbitofrontal cortex is likely to be involved you can find beauty in anything he said To the untrained eye there may not be much beauty in Eulers identity but in the study it was the formula of choice for mathematicians  It is a personal favourite of Prof David Percy from the   He told the BBC It is a real classic and you can do no better than that  It is simple to look at and yet incredibly profound it comprises the five most important mathematical constants  zero additive identity one multiplicative identity e and pi the two most common transcendental numbers and i fundamental imaginary number  It also comprises the three most basic arithmetic operations  addition multiplication and exponentiation  Given that e pi and i are incredibly complicated and seemingly unrelated numbers it is amazing that they are linked by this concise formula At first you dont realise the implications its a gradual impact perhaps as you would with a piece of music and then suddenly it becomes amazing as you realise its full potential He said beauty was a source of inspiration and gives you the enthusiasm to find out about things Mathematician and professor for the public understanding of science Marcus du Sautoy said he absolutely found beauty in maths and it motivates every mathematician He said he loved a small thing mathematician Pierre de Fermat did He showed that any prime number that could be divided by four with a remainder of one was also the sum of two square numbers So  is a prime can be divided by four with one left over and is  five squared plus  four squared So if it has remainder one it can always be written as two square numbers  theres something beautiful about that Its unexpected why should the two things primes and squares have anything to do with each other but as the proof develops you start to see the two ideas become interwoven like in a piece of music and you start to see they come together  He said it was the journey not the final proof that was exciting like in a piece of music its not enough to play the final chord He said this beauty of maths was missing from schools and yet amazing things could be shown with even primary school mathematical ability In the study mathematicians rated Srinivasa Ramanujans infinite series and Riemanns functional equation as the ugliest of the formulae
