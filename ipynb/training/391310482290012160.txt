Mrs Feld you were confused  Loudly theatrically  and for the umpteenth time  my mother mimics the doctors accusation   Ive already heard the story My mother awoke at  am asking for coffee which no one would bring How hard could it be to bring her some decaf the nurses aide says to me shaking her head My mother apparently was awake for a quite while fussing repeatedly requesting coffee   Then on morning rounds the phalanx of doctors trooped in and told her shed been confused during the night  They come in early waking patients up towering over them with a million questions and they wonder why patients are confused the aide says My mother undoubtedly was confused  Admitted two days earlier with pneumonia and brain masses which would turn out to be the result of metastatic lung cancer it was only her second night in the hospital and her first there alone  Id flown up and slept in her hospital room that first night  But the following evening she had seemed stable so Id left to shower and sleep at her house Oh Ma what a terrible night I say Im so sorry I left you    As my parents aged I often thought that the main reason I went to medical school was to help them negotiate the health care morass  To explain translate and advise  But most importantly to protect  While I could not shield them from disease or eventual death I could protect them from abuse from overzealousness from drowning in a sea of invasive procedures and brusque pushy strangers Having just failed miserably at that task I seek out my mothers nurse I tell her I want to be called if ever my mom has a problem or feels confused  My cellphone is always on I say and I dont mind being woken up  Together we make a sign that we post above my mothers bed   My phone number is in oversized numerals   Ma I say if anything like that happens again or if you just want to talk to me you ask them to call me  OK  Any time   OK she nods obediently Im surprised she has not uttered a single fourletter word  She normally peppers her speech liberally with profanity so liberally that I used to wish I had earmuffs for my children The tumors have swallowed so much of her characteristic cantankerousness that shes sometimes hard to recognize    Two days later leaving for the airport I initiate the callandresponse verse weve rehearsed repeatedly  What are you going to remember Ma  She takes a moment to retrieve the information from rocky unfamiliar mental terrain That I should ask someone to call you if Im confused Right Or if you just want to talk to me We finish together For any reason any time  From that moment on my phone lives in my pocket by day and at my bedside charging by night  Its volume up high it beeps me awake every midnight to tell me its charged  I do not turn it off  Ever   My mother spends her last weeks at a hospice near my home in Philadelphia  My cellphone number adorns her wall alongside a painting by her favorite cousin  She calls only once during those weeks  I fish the buzzing phone out of my pocket as I drive my daughter home from school   I did a bad thing her almost unrecognizably meek voice says I think theyre upset with me What happened Ma I went to the bathroom by myself Her intracranial Stonehenge has taken not only her cantankerousness but also her strength and balance  Ever fearful of falls the hospice staff has insisted she call for help whenever she wants to get up   By yourself I ask Without falling  Yes I smile delighted at the glimpse of her old independent self wandering among the boulders Were on our way over I say  When we arrive the nurse describes my mothers joyride to the bathroom  I try not to smile The last thing we want is for her to fall she says turning toward my mother Right My mother nods contritely After the nurse leaves I sit down next to her  Ma I had no idea you could make it to the bathroom on your own  Way to go  I lift my hand  As she highfives me I catch in her eyes a final militant glimmer   During the following week her last she does not get up again  Nor does she call me But I keep my phone on that week and for at least a dozen more unwilling to turn it off  The same irrationality keeps me still from deleting her number from my contacts list The night I finally decide to spare myself the midnight beeps I press the off button  The little sailboat disappears and a company logo floats across the screen  Then the phone blinks Goodbye and goes black
