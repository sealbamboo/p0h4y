Parents should get their kids  and themselves  vaccinated against flu as soon as possible pediatricians advised on Monday There are some new vaccines on the market and while some of the newer ones might appear better its not worth waiting for one the American Academy of Pediatrics said in an advisory With the exception of children less than  months of age everybody should go out and get their influenza vaccine as soon as the influenza vaccines are available Dr Michael Brady of Nationwide Childrens Hospital and chairman of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the Academy told NBC News Parents should not delay vaccinating their children to obtain a specific vaccine added pediatrician Dr Henry Bernstein of the Hofstra North Shore  Long Island Jewish Health System in New York who led the team writing the recommendations Influenza virus is unpredictable and whats most important is that people receive the vaccine soon so that they will be protected when the virus begins circulating          The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that anywhere between  to  people a year die from flu in the United States and up to  are sick enough to be hospitalized A lot depends on the strains circulating During last years flu season  children died from flu This year some companies are making new vaccines that protect against four strains of influenza Normally there are three strains in the influenza vaccines Brady said Normally the vaccine would have two influenza A strains an HN and an HN strain and one B strain Some of the new vaccines will protect against two different B strains of flu Doctors are a little worried that people will hear there is a new and possibly better flu vaccine and will hold out to get it the group says in a statement published in the journal Pediatrics Theoretically four strains sounds better than three strains We just dont have data to support that thats actually the case Brady said The AAP is not going to recommend a preference but that doesnt mean that parents dont have a preference One popular vaccine the needlefree FluMist version will be a fourstrain vaccine Some parents would prefer that their child didnt need to have an injection So the mist has an advantage from that point of view Brady noted But most doctors office may offer two or more different vaccine types The companies cant make enough fourstrain vaccines to meet all the demands so for the  influenza season providers are going to have a mixture of the different vaccines Brady said  Hopefully by  season all of the vaccines will be four strains The AAP also points out theres a new vaccine on the market this year  The new Flublok vaccine is made with cell technology which is used for other kinds of vaccines It was licensed in January to Protein Sciences Corp For newborns and young infants the best protection is for their  while pregnant Pregnant women are advised to get flu shots to protect themselves also Pregnancy affects the immune system and expectant women have more than the usual risk for getting severely sick from influenza and other infections But despite this advice during the  US flu season only about half of pregnant women reported getting a flu vaccine Flu vaccine is a  for most groups About  million people or about  percent of the US population got immunized against influenza in the  flu season Because flu viruses constantly mutate and evolve people must get vaccinated with a fresh formula every year to be fully protected The best vaccination rates are among babies aged up to  with nearly  percent vaccinated Thats because babies make regular visits to pediatricians and vaccinations are a routine part of those visits And more than  percent of  to yearolds were vaccinated in  Part of the problem is that people dont see flu as a serious health threat And rumors abound that the flu vaccine can make you sick One of the problems that we see with giving millions and millions of doses of vaccines is that people will get other illnesses that arent influenza near the time that they receive the influenza vaccine and because its temporally related they have a tendency to believe the vaccine was responsible Brady said But its usually something else unrelated to the vaccine and unrelated to influenza It also takes a week or so for the flu vaccine to take effect and provide full protection Most time flu in the US peaks in January February sometimes into March Brady said If people go get their vaccines as soon as their provider has them available they should feel comfortable that theyll have protection for the whole flu season Related story
