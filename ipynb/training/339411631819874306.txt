When it comes to inherited genetic mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer BRCA and BRCA get nearly all the attention Inherited mutations in these genes   of breast cancers as well as up to  percent of ovarian cancers according to the National Cancer Institute There are other rarer genetic mutations that also predispose women to breast cancer Health insurers that cover BRCArelated testing and treatment without a hitch sometimes balk at providing coverage in these other instances The predictive value of some of those variations isnt always as strong or clearcut When Angelie Jolie   that shed tested positive for the BRCA mutation and had a double mastectomy to substantially reduce her risk of getting breast cancer she didnt mention her insurance coverage But many health insurance plans   genetic counseling and testing if a woman has a family history of breast or ovarian cancer This is particularly true when theres a pattern of early breast cancer with diagnoses of family members in their s long before the mids when most women develop the disease Under the Affordable Care Act health plans that werent grandfathered   in such women without requiring them to pay anything out of pocket for it Counseling can cost several hundred dollars and the genetic test costs roughly  But BRCA and BRCA arent the only genetic mutations that predispose a woman to breast cancer Even though women may test negative for those mutations some womens history clearly indicates a familial link These women come from families where breast cancer has been marching through the family in young women with women in their s being diagnosed with breast cancer says Stephen Edge the medical director of the breast center at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo NY These women may well have inherited other genetic mutations probably related to complex interactions with other genes that havent yet been identified says Edge In such cases even without a positive genetic test insurers generally dont quibble about covering treatment such as a prophylactic double mastectomy if thats what the woman decides she wants to do he says But sometimes a womans family history will indicate the possibility that she has a different rarer inherited mutation that increases the likelihood of developing breast and other cancers For example   caused by a mutation on the TP gene is often associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and sarcomas cancers of the bones or connective tissues says Mary Daly chair of the department of clinical genetics at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia Likewise Cowden syndrome associated with a mutation on the PTEN gene increases the risk of breast and thyroid tumors Even though genetic tests are available for these rarer breast cancer syndromes they often arent covered by insurance she says
