Of the  million Americans with failing hearts about half of them will die within five years of getting diagnosed Given the odds it seems that people with   should start thinking about how they want to die But doctors dont routinely talk to those patients about endoflife planning When researchers asked  doctors and  nurse practitioners and physician assistants how often they discuss preparing for death with their heart failure patients A third of the providers said they lacked confidence in talking about endoflife care Only  percent said they have routine yearly discussions about the end of life The common reasons are that theyre uncomfortable they may not have enough time or they sense that the patient or the family is not ready to have those discussions says   a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn who led the study The findings were presented Wednesday at the Quality of Care and Outcomes Research  in Baltimore The abstract was peerreviewed but the results have not yet been published The doctors and nurses were from three Mayo clinics and practices affiliated with the Mayo Clinic Health System which is known for being ahead of the game in basing medical care on current best practices When we asked providers if they were asking those questions most of them said they do when the situation declines or when theyre discussing a new intervention says Dunlay But its hard to predict when a patient might decline There are people I think are going to do well and then they dont says   a cardiologist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Center in Denver who researches endoflife expectations and care On the flip side there are people with lots of risk factors If I tell them they might not do well and then they do it can create unnecessary anxiety and diminish trust Endoflife conversations are a routine part of Allens job They involve asking tough questions like Would you want a feeding tube or CPR If you cant breathe would you want a tube placed down your throat to help you breathe Are you trying to live as long as possible or is your goal to maximize your quality of life Do you want to die in your sleep Allen says that often patients with a mechanical heart pump or an   which delivers electric shocks to a languishing heart might not have decided at what point they want the device turned off When people are dying of progressive heart failure  dying of an arrhythmia may not necessarily be a bad thing at that point Allen who was not involved in the study told Shots When people are potentially dying you dont want to be giving them electric shocks on top of that One of the top reasons doctors cited for their reluctance in asking those questions was destroying a patients sense of hope in surviving But actually Dunlay says patients who talk about those things tend to feel better about their condition One solution Allen   could be to encourage healthcare providers to have those conversations annually with patients no matter what condition the patient is in at the moment Thats particularly important because a patients attitude toward handling death   and because heart failure patients   how long theyll live Dunlay agrees saying its better to do so on a regular basis rather than putting it off until its too late Providers arent being taught how to broach tough subjects Dunlay adds but most of the survey participants were interested in further training
