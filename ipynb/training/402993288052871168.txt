Jonny Benjamin is only  but has been coping with mental illness since childhood Now he video blogs about it and has recently received an award for his work If youre prone to extreme anxiety or get obsessive thoughts its perhaps not surprising that a film like Jim Carreys The Truman Show might stick in your mind and get you thinking And thinking And thinking  In the film Truman  played by Carrey  lives his entire life onscreen for the pleasure of TV viewers around the world Nothing in Trumans life is real says Benjamin who lives in Manchester and works for a media production company Everyones an actor and every scenario is fabricated by a director  and hes the only one that doesnt know it  The film caught the imagination of cinemagoers in  and was nominated for    Benjamin recalls watching the film at the cinema with a friend who said Maybe that could be you but you wouldnt know it  Speaking on Novembers disability talk show Benjamin says that he started dwelling on this idea and for the next  years he believed he was being watched by cameras like Truman and that nothing was real  It wasnt until he was finally hospitalised at the age of  that a psychiatrist explained it was all in his head He says That was a major awakening for me and I realised I had been in a delusion  Jonny Benjamin has so far posted about  videos to his site which has been viewed by thousands of people In the videos he speaks openly about hearing voices the employment difficulties he faces and many other personal insights On  November he received the   presented by the mental illness charity Rethink  for his work battling stigma and raising awareness of schizophrenia and mental illness Benjamins videos are very honest and some might think that disclosing a mental illness online could harm his future in the same way indiscreet photos posted to Facebook have reportedly affected peoples job chances  Benjamin dismisses this It doesnt concern me too much Id rather be open about my mental health than hide it away I suffered so much growing up because I kept everything silent I could never go through that again I feel like I have to be open and honest now just for my own health  Though his Truman Show delusions have passed Benjamin says its amazing to think there are people out there who could think theyre part of a reality show  though admits amazing isnt quite the right word  He says that entertainment programmes on the small screen have the potential to act as negative triggers too I need to limit how much I watch something like X Factor says Benjamin It can make me delusional and make me think that I could be a singer or I could get a record deal  I need to be careful Everyone with schizophrenia needs to be careful about how much they watch these things  Benjamin says he knows lots of people with schizophrenia who believe theyre getting messages from their TV in particular from reality shows  which promise so much  I see a lot of young people especially on Twitter and social media who are really buying into the idea of instant fame I see a lot of them being quite delusional  and thats quite worrying
