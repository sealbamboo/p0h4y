If everything goes as planned in her life yearold Brittany Maynards death will occur on Saturday Nov   in her bed on an upper floor of her Portland Oregon home with cherished music filling the room Lately though nothing in Maynards life has flowed like she once dreamed  no children with her newlywed husband no more time She has brain cancer grade  glioblastoma In April a doctor told her she had six months to live Now Maynard has embarked on a rare farewell bathed in politics and poignancy  all painstakingly organized and openly shared she said in a bid to help to change laws for dying Americans who feel they are forced to endure the full gruesome descent of a terminal illness Maynard made three choices that are elevating her final days to viral immortality She moved with her husband Dan from San Francisco to Oregon  one of five states where doctors can legally prescribe lifeending drugs to the dying She obtained the two bottles of lethal pills and selected the precise moment place guests and soundtrack for her last breaths And she posted the reasons for all this   that as of Thursday night had received more than  million views I dont want to die But I am dying Death with dignity is the phrase Im comfortable using I am choosing to go in a way that is with less suffering and less pain Maynard told NBC News Thursday night speaking from the Columbia River Gorge  minutes east of Portland She was on a getaway with her husband She had endured an awful night and morning  due to the tumor her brain is swelling pressing against her skull causing excruciating pain and robbing her of sleep Medications are not working as well lately to ease the swelling or mask the pain she said When people use the word suicide its just highly inflammatory and just incorrect because I am already dying from cancer And people who commit suicide are typically people who want to die and are killing themselves Im not killing myself Cancer is killing me She knows her story has fueled a global dialogue about her choice and about the issue She knows some people do not support her selected path She is using her precious remaining days to keep that conversation alive What does seem necessary is to get people educated about this topic to have discussions be based on facts not fear and really have it be a healthcare choice which is what makes it a freedom Maynard said Not everybody has to agree that its the right thing  because they dont have to do it Its an option And its an option that for me has provided a lot of relief because the way that my brain cancer would take me organically is very terrible Its a horrible way to die The thought that I can spare myself the physical and emotional lengthy pain of that as well as my family is a huge relief She chose Nov  because it falls just after her husbands birthday  a moment she hopes to enjoy  and because it gives her family and closest friends a date for which they can prepare Thats what Im planning for unless a cure is miraculously discovered in the next couple of weeks in which case I will certainly avail myself to that Maynard said The beauty of death with dignity as a patient healthcare choice is the patient maintains autonomy and can always change their mind So if I have a really terrible grand mal seizure next week and my symptoms get much worse I may choose to move up my date Or if Im feeling really wonderful on November  and I have reason to continue to live longer I will But for me there is an end date and its relatively soon in sight and thats the nature of my terminal illness I have a very large brain tumor and its killing me Advocates in the deathwithdignity cause  a decadeslong push to give more Americans access to legal endoflife options  view Maynards crusade as a tipping point They assert she seems to be engaging scores of younger people who likely never mulled this tortuous issue typically faced by older folks This movement is gaining traction by the hour said Barbara Coombs Lee president of Compassion  Choices a national nonprofit dedicated to expanding the rights of the terminally ill You have had   saying I want this option and   saying he is devoting the last years to death with dignity Then suddenly heres this thing with Brittany and you say Its really happening The tide has turned Maynard and her friends approached   asking if the Denverbased organization would like to be part of our plan Coombs Lee said The group responded Yes we would be honored but Coombs Lee emphasized This is her campaign She resonates because we were all once  A lot of us remember when we were starting our families And a lot of us have lost a loved one to a brutal disease Coombs said She is aware of the injustice that she had to uproot herself her family her home and establish a new home as a legitimate Oregon resident in order to qualify to get the fastacting drugs that when swallowed will caused her to fall asleep depress her breathing and end her life An attorney and former ER and ICU nurse Coombs Lee coauthored Oregons Death with Dignity Act on the books since  In the ensuing years more than  Oregon residents have obtained endoflife prescriptions under the law and more than  people have used them according to   Four other states  Washington Montana Vermont and New Mexico  have aidindying laws But Oregon ranks among the states with the highest suicide rates said Jennifer Popik legislative counsel for the National Right to Life Committee which calls each of those deaths a preventable tragedy While the case of Brittany Maynard is tragic the fact of the matter is that in the states where doctorprescribed suicide is legal and records are kept most people seek suicide not because they are experiencing pain from illness but because they feel like they are becoming a burden or losing autonomy Popik said States that have laws legalizing doctorprescribed suicide are turning their backs on vulnerable populations of people who are either depressed or worried about what their future holds she added  These laws do not offer a patient dignity but only abandonment from health care workers and family who are supposed to care for patients and loved ones in these dire times In the days that remain for her Maynard hopes to spend as many hours outdoors as her body and energy will allow Seizures and fatigue have set in But with an exit plan in place she knows she has some control over the inevitable decline the tumor will cause Her final moment has been mapped And it does not sound scary I plan to be surrounded by my immediate family which is my husband and my mother and my stepfather and my best friend who is also a physician she says in the video I will die upstairs in my bedroom that I share with my husband with my mother and my husband by my side and pass peacefully with some music I like in the background
