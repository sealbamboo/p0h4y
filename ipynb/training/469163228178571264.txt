Subway creepers may have met their match in artist Kathleen McDermotts new frock a   The DIY dress designed to slowly expand when it detects someone getting too close is actually part of a clothing series or better yet clothing devices developed by artists and designers for Urban Armor a project focused on what it calls    playful electronic wearables for women which investigate the ways women experience public space Indeed no one really wants to be crowded   on the subway even if a little bit of   The personal space dress may be an extreme example of reclaiming of our protective space bubble but most of us just stick in our ear buds or stare at our phones or both and hope for the best After all personal space is sacrosanct  Step into an elevator and youll probably stand as far away from another person as possible  and you hope another boarding passenger wont stand too close to you  Personal space is something that a person looks at as a kind of bubble that is theirs explains Dr Jeff Janata division chief of psychology at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland Ohio If that space is invaded by someone who is not close to the person like a family member or friend there will be a sense of anxiety and more than likely youll step away    Anthropologist Edward T Hall helped define the distance between noses that most of us find comfortable If youre intimate with someone and whispering to them youre probably standing about  to  inches away but if youre with an acquaintance you might be anywhere from  to  feet But remember that personal bubble varies among cultures says Dr Niranjan Karnik a psychiatrist at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago Most of my family comes from the subcontinent India we dont have the luxury of space so what you find in European cultures in terms of comfort and personal space is going to be very different from other parts of the world Karnik who also has trained as a sociologist finds our use of technology to help distance ourselves quite interesting  Before there were iPods and iPhones there were newspapers that acted as a barrier in a crowded space so our technologies are just the next permutation to help us keep our bubbles he says But what he finds really fascinating is that despite our need to distance ourselves humans still have that biological and social urge to connect All you have to do is look around the next time you are on a bus or train people may have their earbuds in but chances are good theyre on Facebook or Twitter connecting with their social circle he says And as to that dress  Using gizmos called proximity sensors the hem of the dress swells when fellow passengers get tooupcloseandpersonal creating a barrier for the wearer   The devices are not actually viable solutions for societal problems artist McDermott says But they are intended to provoke conversations not only about social issues but about the future of technology in our everyday lives  Even if we wont be seeing the techgarment the  for making your own on the streets Karnik thinks its an interesting idea  Humans really do need their personal space he says
