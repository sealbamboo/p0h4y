The yearold man hadnt bathed in more than six months His hair was long and matted Instead of using the bathroom he would urinate in a bucket and throw it out the window   From his standpoint nothing was wrong he was living the way he liked But his neighbors in Houston thought his neglectful habits and filthy house were a health hazard They called the local adult protective services agency which investigated and brought in a geriatric team from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston for a consultation Sabrina Pickens a nurse went to the mans home located in a fairly wealthy neighborhood It reeked of human waste Ms Pickens recalled one of the worst examples of selfneglect she had seen  and she has examined hundreds of people with this condition  It is a surprisingly common problem in older adults selfneglect is believed to account for nearly  percent of all cases of abuse and neglect in the elderly Youve read about extreme examples the elderly Arizona woman   or the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis who resided at Grey Gardens a oncegrand East Hampton mansion with no running water and piles of garbage Once elderly adults of this sort were considered eccentric or alarmingly idiosyncratic Today researchers believe they have    depression dementia and delirium top the list  that compromise their ability to function and care for themselves according to a recent panel sponsored by the Institute of Medicine  It isnt easy to help this hidden difficulttoreach population But recent research not yet published suggests that connecting elderly people who cannot care for themselves with a team of multidisciplinary specialists and with physical therapy can have an impact said Jason Burnett associate director of clinical and behavioral research at   Mostly these older adults live alone shunning contact with family or friends Relatives become frustrated when their efforts to offer assistance are rejected they frequently drop out of the picture Authorities become aware of these cases mostly when temporary caregivers neighbors or others report them to adult protective services agencies Six years ago Texas researchers studied  elderly people suffering from selfneglect and published results in the American Journal of Public Health Sixty percent had   More than threequarters showed deficits in their ability to perform instrumental daily activities like paying bills shopping for groceries cooking meals Sixteen percent had depressive symptoms  percent reported moderate to poor social support How do experts recognize selfneglect People stop bathing eating cleaning their homes taking their medications managing their financial affairs disposing of garbage going to the doctor and more  Youll see an older man with physical disabilities who hoards and who persistently falls at home because of the environmental hazards said Dr XinQi Dong associate director of Rush University Medical Centers Institute for Healthy Aging in Chicago  Or a patient with diabetes and congestive heart disease reliant on an oxygen tank who smokes two packs a day refuses to take her insulin and is unclean to a degree that endangers her health He and other experts consider selfneglect a geriatric syndrome like frailty delirium or falls associated with the deterioration of multiple physical functions as people age In Houston the unkempt older man Ms Pickens visited had lost more than  pounds since his mother who had lived with him died the year before Depressed and stubborn he had declined help from a concerned stepdaughter the only family member with whom he had any contact  One of the cardinal features of selfneglect is the refusal of any type of assistance Ms Pickens said adding that the man told her he didnt think anything was wrong with his situation  During a physical examination the nurse discovered two alarmingly large growths in his mouth throat cancer Within a few months he was dead Dr Dong and colleagues have studied thousands of older adults in three Chicago neighborhoods since  In a study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association they found that the elderly were almost   compared with those without this condition   When vulnerable seniors come to his attention we try to treat the underlying issues depression the side effects of medication the need for supportive community services Dr Dong said  But if an older adult is mentally competent and refuses help nothing can be done If this is how a person chooses to live and theres no issue of safety or incompetence you have to respect that said Ann Wohlberg program director of the Chicago chapter of Little Brothers a social services agency that sees several cases of selfneglect every month When an individual is deemed to lack mental capacity a public guardian will typically be appointed to make decisions on his behalf if a relative does not come forward   Often it is not easy to figure out whats a reasonable choice for an individual  what constitutes selfneglect and what constitutes neglect by caregivers Dr Dong tells a story about a mentally alert obese woman with diabetes in her s who kept returning to Rush Medical Center complaining about pain that was poorly controlled   We thought she was a noncompliant diabetes patient who was neglecting herself he said That perspective changed when a physical therapist from Rush visited the womans house which was in shambles and learned that her adult children who lived with her were selling her narcotic medications It was very complicated Dr Dong said She was choosing to live in that terrible environment because her kids had mental illnesses and she felt it was her fault Once Dr Dongs team began dealing with the womans social circumstances she actually became a very compliant patient he said She wanted someone to understand the daily stresses she was living with The doctors bottom line If you have an older person who youre concerned about raise the red flag Call adult protective services if youre worried All of us have a significant role to play in watching out for our neighbors
