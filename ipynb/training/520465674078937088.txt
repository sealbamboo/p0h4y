Mental health is still an issue that some people are reluctant to talk about despite the fact that one in four people will be affected in some way  So it may come as a surprise that the world of professional football  often seen as macho and tough  is taking the mental health of the young men who play the game at the highest level increasingly seriously  The rain is lashing down on a wet and windy afternoon at Evertons Finch Farm training ground where young footballers from the clubs academy are honing their skills on the pitch Its a friendly game against Walsall but while it might not look like a high pressure environment these   and  year olds are competing to become the best players of their generation The stakes are high A career in professional football with all the rewards that can bring is the prize But staff at the club know the toll that pressure can take so increasingly the mental health of these young men is as important as their physical fitness Inside Evertons impressive academy building a classroom session is under way led by Dean Smith the founder of the charity   There are times in life where things will come at us from different directions Dean tells the class We cant be expected to deal with everything all at once Dean mixes humour and short quizzes with some thoughtprovoking and moving testimony not least when he tells the teenagers how he fell into depression after his son took his own life nine years ago The aim is to help the young players think about the sort of problems they might encounter and to whom they should turn if they need help  These are important lessons to be learned for young men starting out on their careers If youre not talking about it it will just get worse so best to talk about it as Dean said explained Spencer Myers a yearold scholar at the Everton academy  Its helped me to realise who I can speak to if I need to go and speak to them and not keep it all inside me because youve got more chance of suffering added fellow scholar Ciaran OLoughlin  The fact that football is now dealing headon with mental health issues has been welcomed by former player Paul Lake At the age of  Paul had the world at his feet playing for Manchester City and talked of as a future England captain But in an instant his career was ended by a nasty knee injury leaving him to cope with the devastating aftermath on his own Twentyfive years later he believes the culture has now shifted Its been a seismic shift The perception of it being such a macho environment and boys coaches and staff alike not really opening up as regards their emotional state being able to cope with the challenges and stresses that are all around us  Because these young men ultimately have their dreams to be in the first team of that particular club So what happens if they dont quite get there Who do they speak to  At Everton the person they speak to is David Porter the clubs mental health first aider trained to provide immediate help and support should it be needed Every one of the  Premier League clubs now has someone like David in place  Martyn Heather of the Premier League says the clubs realise they have a duty of care to the young people who play for them We have over  players between the ages of nine and  in the Premier League academies and it would be unrealistic to think the issues young people have in society wouldnt be reflected in our own football environment I think its about recognising how different aspects can affect performance In the same way an injury can affect performance and you can physically see an injury when it comes to a mental health issue you might not see them but they need to be recognised  Its about creating an environment and culture where players arent afraid to admit they might need help  This is not just about the pressures around football  experts say a quarter of us will experience some kind of mental illness But attitudes are changing  And football clubs are now taking seriously their duty of care towards the mental health of the young men in their charge
