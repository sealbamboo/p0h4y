At first Gillians hacking cough seemed like nothing more than the product of a mild cold that had gone straight to her chest Her next symptoms though proved my theory wrong The whites of her eyes turned bright red  conjunctivitis  and her temperature shot to  degrees then  Her little voice was hoarse The most alarming thing was that my baby refused to drink anything Usually Gillian was a good eater who looked forward to her morning milk Not that morning I couldnt get her to swallow milk baby acetaminophen or even apple juice her favorite drink other than the CocaCola she was always trying to sip out of my glass  Definitely the measles a doctor said after looking inside of Gillians mouth Her reddened eyes were swelling and she was increasingly listless Her temperature reached  dangerously close to the point where she could suffer permanent brain damage We had to act fast You must go directly to the hospital he told me Dont even stop by home Go to the emergency room now So how did I get into a situation in which my baby was suffering from the measles years after a vaccine became available A few months before when Gillian should have gotten that vaccine I decided against making an appointment We were about to change to new insurance that would pay for all of her wellchild health care expenses including the vaccine that would prevent the measles Although I had every intention of getting her shots up to date I let life get in the way No harm I thought Measles hadnt been eliminated in the United States in  but by then most babies started MMR shots by  months Neither my older daughter nor any of her day care friends had ever gotten the measles I couldnt even remember the last time Id even heard of a case I figured we had plenty of time  January came and went and I still hadnt gotten around to finding a pediatrician who took our new health plan So there I was that February morning heading to the hospital with my blazing hot baby trying to tempt her to drink milk apple juice anything She needs intravenous fluid a nurse told me I remember her kind eyes the only part of her face that wasnt covered by a white medical mask The doctor is in there she pointed toward a closed door ready to put in an IV Do you want to come in and hold her I looked at my baby girl and shook my head I knew that Gillian would fight the procedure and I was chicken I didnt want to see her suffer Two points against me for a Mother of the Year award As I waited alone in the hall I couldnt catch my breath Guilt and fear consumed me  As predicted I heard her scream in pain Soon after the nurse put my daughter back in my arms and then led us to where we would stay for the next few days It was an isolation room a small glassenclosed space that held a crib a television and a comfortable chair Attached to the crib were bars to keep children from climbing out The room reminded me of a zoo exhibit The only thing missing was a sign saying Beware human baby with measles In that moment I couldnt believe how my lack of awareness had led to such a frightening situation  I wondered how could I ever have thought that measles was no big deal With medication and fluid pumping into her small body I could see my child returning The nurse came to take her temperature which had come down to a manageable  degrees within an hour She was still weak and refusing baby food and bottles She slept most of the two days we spent at the hospital I sat up in the chair watching old sitcoms until I was blearyeyed In the darkness I made a pact with God that if Gillian got better Id never again lose sight of my priorities  On Saturday afternoon a doctor knocked on the glass window and asked me to come outside to speak with him Im the oncall pediatric resident this weekend he explained but Ive never had the measles so I hope that you dont mind if I dont come in He looked sheepish Ive read your daughters records Looks like you got here just in time Now that everything is under control shell be fine  Hearing his assurances the tension Id felt in my chest since Gillians diagnosis began to dissipate He was right Gillian was getting back to her old self I held her into the night then put her back into the crib When the nurse came in to check Gillians liquid intake I explained that she had taken only a couple of sips from my can of Coke I guess that is a liquid the nurse said with a shake of her head as she noted Gillians chart On Sunday my little girl was discharged and we went home A rash had spread across her body but she seemed to feel better Since my older daughter has been vaccinated we had no fears of a family outbreak But on Monday morning the phone rang and a woman from the Maryland health department was on the phone My next call was from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention I had to answer questions about Gillians child care providers and whether any other children we knew had gotten sick Thankfully no more children we knew came down with it We still dont know where Gillian was exposed Over the next few weeks they regularly checked on Gillians progress After a week she was almost back to normal and the week after that she went back to day care I was already back to work so my mother took care of her during the day for most of those two weeks Without her assistance I would have had a real problem So what did I learn from this experience I never again took my three childrens good health for granted and found a wonderful pediatrician whom we kept until they aged out of his care When I had my next child two years later I followed his vaccine schedule faithfully Gillian is now a teacher at an early childhood center she has remained up to date on vaccines since and receives a flu shot every year While many things have changed in the decades since her illness there is still no cure for the measles The recent measles outbreak that sprang from Disneyland made me think back to my many Disney park visits I recall seeing hundreds of babies and toddlers happily exploring the Magic Kingdom from the comfort of their strollers Not once did I consider how their health might be compromised simply by being at the Happiest Place on Earth and I bet their parents didnt either I hope that the current measles outbreak gives pause to the parents of little ones who reject vaccines I wonder if those who choose not to vaccinate their children realize the gravity of the situation they might face While every parent has the right to make personal decisions about their childrens health care parents need to know that not vaccinating their babies can also have scary and dangerous consequences
