The chairman of Englands health watchdog has told the BBC there are hospitals where you would not want to go as a patient David Prior said the Care Quality Commissions main finding from new inspections had been the huge variation between hospitals Mr Prior said there was an NHS postcode lottery in standards of care He told BBC Radio s PM programme England had probably some of the best led best run hospitals in the world Speaking in an interview to mark his first year at the CQC Mr Prior said In those hospitals where you would not wish to go you have a very poor damaged culture where employees feel they cant raise concerns where patients are not listened to When asked which hospitals he would not want to attend as a patient he said the CQC had identified a number of hospital trusts as inadequate Barking Havering and Redbridge is a good example he said Heatherwood and Wexham Park would be another one But he added It is important to make the point that many of these hospitals are good in parts There are some AE departments you would not want to go to and others have got poor maternity departments but those would be two hospital trusts that overall would come out to be inadequate The CQC has published inspection reports about both hospital trusts over the last few months It did not use a ratings system but did raise concerns  Barking Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust   Its AE departments were found at times to be unsafe The trusts new chief executive Matthew Hopkins told the BBC I am working with our new chair Dr Maureen Dalziel and all our staff to implement the trusts improvement plan to resolve the issues raised in the Care Quality Commission report Both Maureen and myself have a clinical background and are passionate about providing high quality care which will make Queens and King George hospitals a provider of choice In January Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust   at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough  The trust told us it did not wish to respond to Mr Priors comments Mr Prior used to be the chief executive of the Conservative Party and is a former MP for North Norfolk  He was also the chairman of a hospital trust before joining the CQC in January  Mr Prior told the PM Programme the kind of service which patients receive will depend on which hospital they go to He said We have postcode lotteries in the NHS because the quality of care in one hospital can be very different from the quality of care in another hospital And I think by exposing those variances we can address them   Mr Prior said if there was one common reason for a hospital failing it was poor leadership  Sometimes thats because the leadership has been changed very often and the organisation has got no stability he said  Sometimes its because the leadership cant engage with the clinicians Sometimes its because the leadership is not visible Sometimes it is because the leadership is not strong he added The CQC took over the regulation of health and social care services in England in  and has faced strong criticism  It now has a chief inspector of hospitals and has introduced a new more rigorous type of inspection  Mr Prior has described the inspections as deep dives  Last year Mr Prior told the PM programme the acid test of success was to be able to ensure the CQC could identify hospitals which are at risk of failing very early on He does not believe his organisation is there yet and explained Weve got this new intelligent monitoring sort of screening system and then we go and inspect on the back of that screening tool Were never going to be  We have come a long way But the new inspection methodology  the new risk screening tool  is still bedding down he added  Next week the CQC will begin what it calls its formal consultation on new detailed guidelines about inspections and ratings  The documents will explain how it hopes to regulate a range of health and social care services including hospitals mental health services GP practices and care homes
