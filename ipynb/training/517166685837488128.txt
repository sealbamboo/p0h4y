David Cameron has pledged to cut taxes for thirty million people if the Conservatives win next years election In a speech which ended his partys conference the PM said he would raise the taxfree allowance from  to  by  He also said the threshold for the p income tax rate would be raised from  to  by the end of a fiveyear Conservative government The changes would back people who do the right thing he said Both tax reform proposals  the timing of which the party said depends on economic circumstances  received lengthy ovations Mr Cameron also promised Increasing the personal allowance would take one million of the lowestpaid out of income tax and give a tax cut to  million more Mr Cameron said Somebody working a hour week on the minimum wage would pay no income tax he said Nothing zero zilch The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the combined cost of the tax changes would be bn by  Raising the threshold for the p tax band would be worth  a year to those earning  benefiting an estimated  taxpayers  The NHS pledge is a repeat of the policy on which the Conservatives fought the  general election He was given a standing ovation as he criticised what he said were complete and utter lies from the Labour Party on the NHS A future Conservative government would protect the NHS budget he said adding You can only have a strong NHS if you have a strong economy Mr Cameron hailed NHS advances in DNA research  and paid tribute to the NHS treatment given to his profoundly disabled son Ivan who died in  For me this is personal he said and with both he and his watching wife Samantha looking close to tears he added that his family knows more than most the importance of relying on the health service He said How dare they suggest I would ever put that at risk for other peoples children It was the tax cut promise a Conservative conference has waited years to hear  Raising the p income tax threshold to  was a pledge that lifted the roof Tory candidates and canvassers have been given an easy to understand middle class tax cut to take into the general election next May  And this speech framed the election as a sharp choice between two parties The Conservatives and Labour There was barely a mention of UKIP The central message was simple Britain is on the right track dont turn back  The attack on Labour was ferocious and David Cameron tried to seize large chunks of their traditional territory The PM also spoke of his pride in Britain after the Scottish referendum result and the DDay anniversary In his speech he made a vow to deliver reforms to ensure there were English votes for English laws in Parliament following the No vote in the Scottish independence referendum He also said there was no walkonby option in the battle against the evil Islamic State adding that if the UK did not deal with them they will deal with us In an attack on Labour Mr Cameron said the Conservatives were the real party of compassion and social justice and promised a crackdown on zerohours contracts Unveiling a plan to build  new affordable homes only available to firsttime buyers Mr Cameron said the Tories were the party of home ownership once again Help for people trying to get on the housing ladder was also pledged and Mr Cameron said people would have to work a bit longer and save a bit more David Camerons two big tax promises address some of the burning issues for taxpayers One is that those on low incomes are struggling to meet their commitments because wages continue to rise much more slowly than prices The prospect of a significantly higher personal allowance shows them a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel It could take a million out of tax altogether At the other end of the tax spectrum the government has faced criticism that increasing numbers are being drawn into the  income tax bracket even though they would not think of themselves as well off A  threshold would pull hundreds of thousands out of the teeth of the higher rate trap But as with all tax measures it will be vital to watch how they are implemented The longer it takes to bring them in the less they are worth As things stand many of the low paid will continue to pay National Insurance even if they escape income tax And many will worry that other taxes including National Insurance might be raised to finance these two giveaways Mr Cameron also paid tribute to House of Commons Leader William Hague who is stepping down as an MP next year calling him our greatest living Yorkshireman Referring to planned spending cuts of bn in the first two years of the next Parliament he said Thats a lot of money but it is doable Turning to the issue of Europe Mr Cameron said he would not take no for an answer in EU negotiations ahead of a referendum in  When it comes to free movement I will get what Britain needs he said asking people to judge him by his record in vetoing EU treaties and supporting a budget cut Around the table in Europe they know I say what I mean and I mean what I say Addressing the issue of UKIP to which two Tory MPs have recently defected Mr Cameron said If you vote UKIP that is really a vote for Labour And heres a thought for you On  May you could go to bed with Nigel Farage and wake up with Ed Miliband The Conservative Party has unveiled a string of policies this week  on health housing and pensions  that it hopes will show voters it is on their side Chancellor George Osborne announced a twoyear freeze on workingage benefits criticised by some as an attack on the poor The conference has also been overshadowed to some extent by rumours about possible further defections after MP Mark Recklesss surprise decision to jump ship to UKIP After Mr Camerons speech former Conservative Party donor Arron Banks announced he was donating m to Nigel Farages party He had been intending to give  but had raised that to m after he said William Hague suggested he was a nobody The former foreign secretary said he had never heard of Mr Banks who previously gave  to the Tories The prime ministers task was to banish the defections from his partys mind and give them a clear message to sell to voters on the doorstep next May If our economic plan for the past four years has been about our country and saving it from economic ruin our plan for the next five years will be about you and your family and helping you get on he said Mr Cameron chose to deliver his speech from behind a lectern with notes  in contrast to Labour leader Ed Miliband who last week was criticised for forgetting key passages of his memorised speech to his partys conference But after the prime ministers address Mr Miliband said David Cameron doesnt realise what is happening in our country The NHS is sliding backwards people cant get to see their GP people are waiting for hours in AE Mr Miliband said the Conservatives had decided to hit the incomes of working people by freezing their tax credits and had then offered unfunded vague pieinthe sky commitments Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander criticised what he called a shameless attempt to copy Liberal Democrat tax policy Tax cuts in this parliament had only been delivered because of the determination and commitment of the Conservatives coalition partners he said UKIP economic spokesman Patrick OFlynn said Mr Cameron was imitating his partys taxcutting agenda and challenged the Conservatives to scrap inheritance tax The Green Party said the pledge to freeze the NHS budget was largely meaningless saying the government had inflicted deep wounds to the service Robert Joyce of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the tax cuts would cost more than twice the amount raised by the benefit freeze announced by Mr Osborne And he said other departments would feel the squeeze as a result of health spending being protected Business group the CBI backed stronger incentives to get people into work while the Taxpayers Alliance said the tax changes were incredibly good news
