With a Swiss forensics investigation   as a possible cause of Yasser Arafats death the radioactive element is back in the news Confirming whether the Palestinian leader died from an assassination attempt will be difficult given poloniums short halflife and the fact that Arafat has been dead nine years science writer Deborah Blum says Whatever happened to Arafat polonium does have a deadly history Polonium only really came to public attention when we started using it to kill each other says Blum author of   One such incident took place on a chilly November afternoon in  in Londons Grosvenor Square That day three Russians ordered drinks at the upscale Pine Bar in the Millennium Hotel Its very hushed Full of shadows and whispers dark wood paneling and leather seats says Will Storr author of Bad Blood an essay published earlier this year in   Its very discreet Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun ordered gin and a yearold Russian dissident named Alexander Litvinenko drank green tea As far as Litvinenko was concerned it was a business meeting with two old acquaintances He goes home to his little house with his wife Marina has a chicken dinner watches the Russian evening news and goes to bed Storr says It was just a normal night But within hours Litvinenko began having bouts of severe vomiting Litvinenko knew immediately that he had been poisoned His wife called for an ambulance He goes to the local hospital in Barnett and tells the doctors there Ive been poisoned by Russian spies And of course they suggest that he calls for a psychiatrist because he had sushi for lunch Storr says So they were like Its food poisoning Youve just been poisoned by some bad sushi  But days passed and Litvinenkos condition worsened He was put on a feeding tube and started losing his hair Antibiotics were administered and tests for AIDS and hepatitis came back negative Doctors were at a total loss It took over two weeks to finally discover the culprit Tests showed polonium coursing through Litvinenkos body Blum says death comes quickly because polonium has a halflife of just  days For a while its hissing and spitting with radiation and energy and then it burns itself out she says As it stabilizes the polonium emits alpha particles Alpha radiation is not highly penetrating radiation Blum says If I was standing in front of you with a container of polonium I could hold this in my hand and it would not go through my skin So for it to be dangerous you have to swallow it All the assassin had to do was put the odorless polonium in Litvinenkos green tea From the moment he took his first sip he was doomed If you can imagine that you swallow an element thats basically radiating you can almost visualize this as a tiny dot with sparks shooting out in all directions like a sparkler Blum says Minutes after ingestion it would have already begun to destroy the lining of his stomach It embeds in those tissues it goes into your blood stream and what happens quite often with particularly these elements that are in that radium decay chain as polonium is the structure is a little bit like calcium Blum says So the body loves to deposit them in the bone Once it settles in the bone marrow the victim begins to die Your hair falls out you cant eat you cant breathe it damages your lungs you are hugely subject to infection its phenomenally destructive once its in your body she says Even if doctors discovered the poison sooner polonium has no antidote Litvinenko died three agonizing weeks later As the polonium underwent alpha decay it was a race against the clock to solve Litvinenkos murder Blum says forensic investigators tracked the poison by following the radioactive trails it left all over London  restaurant seats airline seats tea bars sushi bars They were trails not only left by Litvinenko but also by the killer himself You turn off all the lights in London because polonium has this faint blue glow says Blum Pale blue glowing trails lighting up the path of murder Andrei Lugovoi one of the Russian men at the Pine Bar that afternoon became the prime suspect But he was never convicted Lugovoi pulled out of the Litvinenko inquest in London and has since become a wealthy Russian politician This has been written about as the firstever successful nuclear attack on the West by Russia says Storr Its a major situation Despite the evidence for the Litvinenko case you cant say that was a case that resolved with justice Blum says As for Arafat Blum says the likelihood of finding an assassin  if there is one  is even slimmer
