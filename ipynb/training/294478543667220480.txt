 Got something to report about yourself An opinion perhaps or a status update Nobody may care except you but new brain research suggests you can make yourself feel good simply by sharing Participants who talked about themselves showed signs of activity in the areas of the brain that are linked to value and motivation said Diana Tamir lead author of a study published in this weeks issue of the   This helps to explain why people so obsessively engage in this behavior Its because it provides them with some sort of subjective value It feels good basically said Tamir a graduate student in the Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab at Harvard University Indeed the researchers found that the regions of the brain that are activated by talking about oneself are also responsible for the thrills of food sex money and drug addiction Tamir said The findings are more than a scientific curiosity Tamir said considering how much time people spend discussing themselves By one estimate  percent to  percent of your speech has to do with you Selfdisclosure is a behavior that we do all of the time day in and day out When you talk to people theyll often talk about themselves Tamir said On Twitter and   people are primarily posting about what theyre thinking and feeling in the moment This is one piece of evidence about why we may do that In the study Tamir and a colleague conducted several experiments on subjects whose brains were scanned as they were told to do various things In one experiment  participants alternately disclosed their own opinions  about things like whether they preferred coffee or tea  and judged the opinions of others whose photographs they looked at In another experiment  people alternately talked about their   among other things declaring whether theyre curious or ambitious and those of the US president at the time either George W Bush or Barack Obama The researchers found that certain parts of the brain were more active when people talked about themselves In terms of monetary value participants valued being able to share a thought as being worth about a penny Tamir said We like to call it a penny for your thoughts So why did evolution encourage humans to feel good when they talk about themselves Were doing some tests to see what larger role this behavior may play whether peoples motivation to selfdisclose changes depending on their motivations to bond with someone Tamir said Some studies show that the more you selfdisclose to someone the more you like them the more they like you It may have something to do with forming social bonds Paul Zak a brain researcher and founding director of the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies at Claremont Graduate University said the findings are very convincing and offer insight into human evolution If a social creature did not disclose information then other creatures might stop interacting with it he said Animals do this with smells and movements and humans do this with language This study reveals how our brain evolved to motivate sociality which is pretty cool
