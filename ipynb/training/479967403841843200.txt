Last month Luis Suarez was photographed in a wheelchair after knee surgery The Uruguay strikers two goals in Sao Paulo left England on the verge of a World Cup exit  How did he recover so quickly Suarez injured his left knee while training for the World Cup and an MRI scan on  May found some damage to the meniscus  The yearold Liverpool star had keyhole surgery soon afterwards Although he missed his countrys opening match in Brazil  which they lost  he was ready to face England on Thursday A common sports injury particularly in footballers a tear to the meniscus can take up to six weeks to heal There are two menisci within each knee and these are essentially pads of cartilage or tough flexible tissue  The menisci are cupshaped and sandwiched between the bones of the lower and upper leg They help to stabilise the knee joint and act as shockabsorbers Adrian Wilson a specialist knee surgeon with Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is not overly surprised by Suarezs speedy return There are other examples of athletes who have had this type of knee surgery and made similarly fast recoveries he says It is possible to do minor tidyuptype surgery and to be back performing at a high level within a few weeks Ian McDermott a knee surgeon with London Sports Orthopaedics takes a different view He says Suarezs recovery is bonkers To be playing the way he did within four weeks of surgery is unheard of But there may be some longterm implications he suggests As a football manager youd be delighted by his recovery but as a doctor youd be horrified It leaves him very vulnerable in the future By playing football regularly with a trimmed or damaged meniscus he could run the risk of getting arthritis in his knee or suffering more serious knee problems in the future Mr McDermott says The operation would have involved an arthroscopy of the knee also called keyhole surgery  This is a relatively minor procedure performed under a general anaesthetic and normally lasts about half an hour There is no indication as to how serious the strikers injury was However Mr Wilson says surgery which involved repairing the meniscus  rather than simply trimming it  would have been more lengthy and complex and would have resulted in a longer layoff Either way Suarezs high fitness levels would have helped his recovery Dr Kal Parmar a sports physician at University College Londons Institute of Sport Exercise and Health says Suarezs injury must have been operated on very quickly within a day or two of the injury Physiotherapy and strength conditioning would then have played a key part in his recovery after surgery  The focus at that stage is on controlling the swelling and increasing the function of the knee joint he explains Suarez is very well conditioned anyway and his muscles are in good shape He must have flown through rehab I wouldnt say he looked like he had a knee injury in the game For an ordinary mortal rather than a fit international footballer at least six weeks would be needed to return to a normal level of basic activity  even after minor surgery Ironically a calf strain or pulled hamstring  also common football injuries but which cannot be resolved quickly by surgery  would have taken much longer to heal and would probably have kept him out of the whole tournament Suarez was taken off on a stretcher before the end of the match visibly tired and clutching his left leg It was no surprise that he was not  fit after several weeks of rest and rehabilitation Yet depressingly for England supporters he still found the energy and resilience to all but extinguish their World Cup hopes
