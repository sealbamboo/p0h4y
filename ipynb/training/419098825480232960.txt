People are getting fatter around the world And the problem is growing most rapidly in developing countries researchers reported Friday Over the last  years the number of people who are overweight and obese in the developing world has tripled says   of the Overseas Development Institute in London Onethird of adults globally are now overweight compared with fewer than  percent in  the report   And the number of overweight and obese people in the developing world now far overshadows the number in rich countries As countries go from being lowincome to middleincome and heading towards highincome people earn more money and they can eat the foods that they find tasty says Wiggins who coauthored the report Many foods people find tasty are also often the most fattening Globalization has made highcalorie snack foods readily available at low cost almost everywhere Take   for instance which Wiggins calls a poster child for the global obesity problem If you walk into a Mexican village store he says youll be confronted with lots of tasty offerings of potato chips nice cookies with lots of fat and sugar in them and lots of sweetened carbonated drinks  all kinds of stuff which is terrific in small quantities but not when you start to eat it in large quantities In  less than  percent of Mexican women were overweight By  almost  percent were In some Pacific Island nations more than  percent of men are now considered overweight The Middle East is also seeing a boom in chubbiness Its something like  out of every  adult Egyptian women are now overweight or obese Wiggins says This rapid growth in waist sizes poses huge challenges for health systems especially those that are already overburdened in poorer countries Excessive consumption of fat salt and sugar are significant contributory factors to some cancers cardiovascular disease and diabetes the report noted These diseases are costly to emerging economies not only because of increased health care expenses but also because of lost productivity Its a personal and societal problem of considerable magnitude Wiggins says Reversing this global trend he says could be accomplished with small changes to peoples diets In particular public health campaigns could encourage families to substitute fruits and vegetables for highcalorie snacks But the report concludes theres been little political will in developing nations  where workers are finally enjoying a bit of disposable income  to tell people what they should or shouldnt be eating
