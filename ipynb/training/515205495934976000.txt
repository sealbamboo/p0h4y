Deborah Swackhamer a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota decided last year to investigate the chemistry of the nearby Zumbro River She and her colleagues were not surprised to find traces of pesticides in the water  Neither were they shocked to find prescription drugs ranging from antibiotics to the anticonvulsive carbamazepine  Researchers realized more than  years ago that pharmaceuticals  excreted by users dumped down drains  were    But though she is a leading expert in socalled emerging contaminants Dr Swackhamer was both surprised and dismayed by the sheer range and variety of what she found Caffeine drifted through the river water testament to local consumption of everything from coffee to energy drinks There were   the overthecounter painkiller Acetaminophen causes liver damage in humans at high doses no one knows what it does to fish We dont know what these background levels mean in terms of environmental or public health she said Its definitely another thing that were going to be looking at  Or she might have said one of many many other things The number of chemicals contaminating our environment is growing at exponential rate scientists say A team of researchers at the US Geological Survey tracks them in American waterways sediments landfills and municipal sewage sludge which is often converted into agricultural fertilizer  Theyve found   and   in sewage the   and compounds from both birth control pills and detergents   in streams  Were looking at an increasingly diverse array of organic and inorganic chemicals that may have ecosystem health effects said Edward Furlong a research chemist with the USGS office in Denver and one of the first scientists to track the spread of pharmaceutical compounds in the nations waterways Many of them are understudied and unrecognized  In an essay last week in the journal Environmental Science  Technology titled   editorinchief Jerald L Schnoor called attention to both the startling growth of newly registered chemical compounds and our inadequate understanding of older ones   The American Chemical Society the publisher of the journal maintains the most comprehensive national database of commercially registered chemical compounds in the country The growth of the list is eyepopping with approximately  new chemicals and biological sequences registered every day Dr Schnoor wrote  Not all of those are currently in use he emphasized and the majority are unlikely to be dangerous But for better or worse our commerce is producing innovative challenging new compounds he wrote Dr Schnoor a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa also noted rising concern among researchers about the way older compounds are altered in the environment sometimes taking new and more dangerous forms   Some research suggests that   or PCBs are broken down by plants into even more toxic metabolites  Equally troubling scientists are finding that while PCBs are banned they continue to seep into the environment in unexpected ways such as from impurities in the caulk of old school buildings  PCBs have   but not every contaminant is so risky Dr Schnoor emphasized Out of the millions of chemical compounds that we know about thousands have been tested and there are very few that show important health effects he said in an interview  But he added the development of new compounds and the increasing discovery of unexpected contaminants in the environment means that the nation desperately needs a better system for assessing and prioritizing chemical exposures  That includes revisiting the countrys antiquated chemical regulation and assessment regulations The   went into effect in  almost  years ago and has not been updated since  The law does require the Environmental Protection Agency to maintain an inventory of registered industrial compounds that may be toxic but it does not require advance safety testing of those materials Of the some  compounds registered only a fraction have ever been fully tested for health effects on humans The data gap includes some materials like creosote and coal tar derivatives which are currently    Not surprisingly Dr Schnoor and other scientists want to see the act updated and transformed into a mechanism for sciencebased risk assessment of suspect compounds Indeed everyone from researchers to environmental groups to the American chemical industry agree that the law is frustratingly inadequate  Our chemical safety net is more hole than net said Ken Cook president of the   an advocacy group The Food and Drug Administration for instance doesnt regulate the environmental spread of pharmaceuticals And the toxic substances law ignores their presence in waterways  Where does that leave us in terms of scientific understanding of what drugs to regulate Mr Cook said Anne Womack Kolton vice president for communications at the American Chemistry Council an organization representing chemical manufacturers agreed Think about the world  years ago she said It was a vastly different place Its common sense to revise the law and make it consistent with what we know about chemicals today The two sides dont agree on what standards for chemical testing are needed or what kind of protective restrictions should be put in place for chemicals deemed hazardous And they are in deep disagreement about whether a revised federal law should preempt actions taken by toughminded states like California   The council argues for federal standardization as the most efficient route environmental groups believe that such an action would weaken public protection Legislators have so far not been able to resolve those differences This month yet another proposed update to the act     Congress has not sent an environmental law to the presidents desk in  years Mr Cook said And in the current environment its very difficult to get something through Still Dr Swackhamer who recently stepped down as chair of the EPAs science advisory board notes that despite the lack of legislation scientists have been working toward better ways to assess the risks posed by the increasing numbers of chemicals in our lives Some may help whittle the  inventory of TSCA compounds down to a priority list that focuses on    Thats still a daunting number of chemical unknowns But given the tens of thousands of materials in the inventory its a start
