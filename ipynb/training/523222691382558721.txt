Ornish is talking about his ideas at the ninth annual Health Freedom Expo in Long Beach March    Whats love got to do with it Well my program is much more than a lowfat diet It includes a whole food plantbased diet for people trying to reverse heart disease moderate exercise stress management techniques including yoga and meditation and love and support Study after study has shown that people who are lonely and depressed and isolated  and I think thats a real epidemic in our culture  are three times more likely to get sick and die prematurely than those who have a sense of love and connection and community In part this is because when you are feeling lonely and depressed youre more likely to smoke overeat drink too much work too hard abuse yourself in different ways as a way of just getting through the day We have support groups that are more intentional communities We create a feeling of safety that enables people to let down their emotional defenses and talk openly and authentically about whats going on in their lives with other people who are able to do the same Its very powerfully healing I think were seeing both ends of that spectrum The forces of light and the forces of darkness are both growing stronger in every sense of the word And so some people are even less interested in eating and living more healthfully But many people are I think thats one of the reasons why heart disease rates have gone down so significantly in the last  or  years For reversing heart disease thats one thing but the approach I take is a spectrum approach wwwornishcom Its based on the idea that in all of our studies we found the more you change the more you can improve In ways we can measure and in how you feel At any age  The more they change their diet and lifestyle the better they get at any age Thats a very hopeful profoundly hopeful message we can give to people Ive found that if I tell somebody Eat this and dont do that its not only not helpful its counterproductive because even more than being healthy we want to feel free and in control and as soon as somebody tells us to do something theres a tendency to do just the opposite The fact is that the first dietary intervention was Dont eat the apple and that didnt turn out very well and that was God talking So I cant do better than that What matters most is your overall way of eating and living When I began doing this work  years ago there was a lot of criticism and disbelief But since weve been able to prove using these very hightech expensive stateoftheart scientific measures how powerful these very lowtech and lowcost and often ancient interventions are thats changing Its all happening at a time when the limitations of hightech conventional medicine are becoming clear at the same time that the power of these ancient and lowtech interventions is becoming more documented  The studies are showing that bypass surgery and angioplasties and stents dont really prolong life or prevent heart attacks in people unless theyre in the midst of having one which the vast majority of people are not who undergo those procedures  which we spent  billion on last year And Medicare is now covering my program Its the first time theyve ever done anything like that When you eat mindfully by paying attention to what you eat you get more pleasure with fewer calories Weve all had the experience of eating mindlessly like watching a movie and eating a bag of popcorn You look down and the popcorn is gone and its like Who ate this because you were not really paying attention you were engrossed in the movie and not in what you were eating But if you are eating mindfully then you can really enjoy what you are eating much in the same way as you might savor a fine wine I love chocolate dark chocolate in particular So I can savor the dark chocolate and enjoy it and get an intense amount of pleasure in just a few calories
