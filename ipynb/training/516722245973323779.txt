After surgery some patients rebound quickly and some endure weeks of fatigue or pain What if a blood test could predict which path recovery will take Surgery could be planned better and recuperation strategies could be made more effective or less expensive A new   opens a door to such prediction tools By analyzing blood from patients having hip replacements scientists and doctors found that certain activity in patients immune systems correlated to different recovery times In the study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine scientists tagged proteins in patients blood with isotopes and analyzed thousands of signals using a tool related to a mass spectrometer called a mass cytometer Changes in levels of three proteins appeared to correlate with how long it took patients to walk proficiently recover from pain and regain energy The study was small with  patients and recovery times varied from virtually immediate to six weeks The protein levels did not tell the whole story but they seemed to account for about half the variation in recovery time researchers reported Capturing such a finegrained picture of blood cell activity and linking it to patient outcomes marks a new milestone along the road toward individualizing medical treatment experts said This is by far the most detailed and deep analysis of whats going on in your blood which is in essence the highway of a whole country said Tak W Mak a biochemist at the University of Toronto who was not involved in the study I think the promise is in the future that we can get one complete synopsis of all the cars and trucks and bicycles and people on the highway and profile all their characteristics He said much more work remains including testing the immunological signature theory on more patients and seeing if predicted outcomes hold true In this study the data does not blow me away he said but the potential of what it can do is enormous The study involved  men and  women ages  to  who had a hip replaced They were otherwise relatively healthy Researchers sampled blood from patients one hour before surgery and one hour  hours  hours and six weeks afterward The immune signals scientists measured were like pulses along an earthquakes path or the incremental mobilization of a National Guard reserve unit said Garry Nolan a Stanford microbiologist and a study author He is an inventor of the mass cytometer and earns proceeds from it Most cells in the immune system are in a state of quiescence not running around with their hair on fire all the time he said But when trauma or illness strikes some cells mobilize and the scientists could assess what they are thinking on their way to the invasion site what they are preparing to do Patients answered questions every three days for six weeks to gauge how long it took to reach three milestones regaining most of their hip function eliminating most of their pain and regaining half their energy The researchers found that three proteins transcription factors that switch genes on or off rose or fell to correlate with these milestones For example said Dr Martin Angst a Stanford anesthesiologist and a study author if the signal from the protein CREB measured an hour before surgery increased by  percent an hour after surgery the patient took about  days to regain most hip function If the signal decreased by  percent it took about  days If the signal did not change it took about  days Levels of another protein STAT  correlated to recovery from fatigue which ranged from zero to  days And levels of a protein called NFkB  correlated with lessening of pain which took two days for some patients and  for others Patients age body mass index pain medication or type of anesthesia made no difference On average for unclear reasons women regained energy about twice as fast as men Dr Angst said One study participant Michael Hall  a retired teacher in Merced Calif used a walker for two weeks and  a cane for two more and took Vicodin for pain for about a month But Sam Salmon  a lawyer in Windsor Calif who described himself as healthy but not a dude needed one crutch for little more than  a week had virtually no fatigue and was painfree after about  days Now though Mr Salmon is recovering from rotator cuff surgery and says its just the opposite with pain and fatigue having lasted for nine weeks so far The researchers speculate that some differences between patients might reflect immunological variation caused by genetic environmental or health factors Differences in the same patients reaction to different operations might relate to immunological activity beforehand If tests show someones immune system is battling an invisible infection for example perhaps surgery should be delayed Dr Jon Hyman an orthopedic surgeon in Atlanta not involved in the study said the research deserves a lot more investigation But he said clinical use would require the precision to predict when patients could stop physical therapy return to work or quit painkillers to show that having this information results in saving money somewhere Dr Brice Gaudilliere an anesthesiologist and study author said studies  that were underway aimed to  expand these results to other types of surgery and other types of trauma Ultimately before surgery a blood sample could be exposed to stress or trauma in a test tube and its response could help predict a patients recovery or whether surgery is even advised the researchers said Dr Mak said the technology might eventually be used as a prediction tool in conditions besides surgery to anticipate a relapse for example of cancer septic shock or embolism Its a new frontier said Dr Laurie Glimcher dean of Weill Cornell Medical College who was not involved in the research If such a signaling fingerprint could predict recovery or relapse its an interesting and unusual example of what I would call precision medicine
