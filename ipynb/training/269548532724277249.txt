When it comes to tallying our liquid calories were not always so accurate Does that tiny ounce serving of wine really count as a glass of wine The answer is yes So as the season of celebrations heats up and holiday cheer is delivered in the form of bubbly beer or booze just how many calories are we consuming from alcohol on a random Tuesday night Almost as much as we get from soda apparently  an average of about  calories a day That may not sound like a lot but it can add up A new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   provides some more insights into the nations drinking habits If youre a guy in your s or s the average intake is about  calories per day from alcoholic beverages Thats the equivalent of about two light beers And for women the average is lower at about  calories per day So spread over a week were talking  calories or about four glasses of wine Women in their s and s tend to drink a tiny bit less about five calories fewer per week And what are our favorite drinks Perhaps not surprisingly beer reigns with men guys drink three times more beer than wine But heres a surprise Ladies seem to be equally partial to beer wine and spirits Yes women are consuming about as many calories from hard liquor cocktails and beer as they are from wine Could it be the Skinny Girl Margarita effect Or is the growing   bringing in the ladies And interestingly the big drinkers seem to be outliers Only  percent of men and  percent of women are drinking  calories or more from alcoholic beverages daily This analysis comes from a new CDC report based on findings from a large national health and nutrition   Another interesting finding There appear to be more teetotalers and occasional drinkers than many people realize On any given day in the US about onethird of men and  percent of women drink an alcoholic beverage This means far more people are abstaining on a typical day than imbibing These numbers may seem low but theyre similar to the findings of the  s National Eating Trends survey We show that  percent of adults over  years old report having an alcoholic beverage at least once in a twoweek period during the year ending May  says   of NPD Group  And he says for each of the  years before the number hovered between  percent and  percent I think the most interesting thing for the general public to think about is one ounce beer has on average  calories the same as one ounce can of soda Samara Joy Nielsen a senior fellow at the CDCs National Center for Health Statistics tells us in an email Alcohol according to her findings accounts for about  percent of an adults total caloric intake Thats about the same percentage that kids get from sugar The   recommend that just  percent to  percent of calories come from added sugars and fats And as the researchers point out since alcohol is considered part of this added sugarfat category the percentage of total calories from alcohol is slightly above the recommended level Now its important to point out that these caloric estimates of alcohol are based on selfreported surveys and its possible that people are underestimating by a lot says   of the University of Pittsburgh People also dont count their drinks correctly She says a  ounceserving of wine may not look like much so when you fill your glass to the top you may have consumed closer to whats considered two glasses of wine The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is conducted by asking thousands of participants representing a crosssection of Americans about everything theyve consumed in the past  hours As Nielsen explains participants report all the foods and beverages they have eaten from midnight to midnight the previous day
