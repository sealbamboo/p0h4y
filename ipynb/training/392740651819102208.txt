Girls who were more physically active at age  did better at school as teenagers a study finds And the most active girls really aced science Its become pretty much a given that children do better academically when they get regular exercise even though schools continue to cut or even eliminate recess time But theres surprisingly little   to back that up This investigation used data from a   that has been following the health of a large group of parents and children since  They measured almost  childrens physical activity at age  by having them wear an acclerometer for a week Few of the children were getting the recommended  minutes a day of moderate to vigorous exercise Boys clocked  minutes a day on average while girls managed just  minutes The more active the yearolds were the better they did on standardized school tests of English math and science The surprise was that physically active girls were much better at science than their peers That held true for five years when the children took other standardized tests at age  and  Were not sure why that would be   a lecturer in developmental psychology at the University of Dundee and lead author of the study told Shots It could be important given that both Europe and the United States are trying hard to get more girls involved in science It could obviously be a chance finding Booth adds Wed like to have a chance to look further into it The researchers did adjust the results to account for factors that could affect school performance including birth weight current weight a mothers smoking while pregnant and the familys socioeconomic situation The   were published in the   This study doesnt prove that the increased exercise was what improved the childrens test scores but parents arent off base in thinking that it could help Randomized controlled trials have shown that exercise improves brain function in older people and a   have shown that in children too Until Booth or other scientists can manage a randomized trial on girls exercise and science well have to just hope that bicycling or running will help our daughters become future Nobelists Ill hold off on booking my ticket to Stockholm for the awards ceremony Theres certainly an association between more physical activity and better academic achievement Booth says If parents can get their children to meet that goal of  minutes a day its going to be beneficial for a range of factors
