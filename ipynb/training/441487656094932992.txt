The High Court will rule later on a widows attempt to prevent her dead husbands sperm from being destroyed Beth Warrens husband died from a brain tumour two years ago and she has been told that his sperm cannot be stored beyond April   The Birmingham womans lawyers say the regulations defy common sense  Warren Brewer  had his sperm frozen before having radiotherapy treatment for cancer and signed forms saying his wife could use it if he died Regulations state sperm and eggs can be stored for decades but individuals must update their consent every few years That is no longer possible since Mr Brewers death  so under current rules if the sperm is not used within  months it will be destroyed The couple had been together for eight years and married in December  six weeks before Mr Brewer died Mrs Warren who uses her late husbands first name as her surname said she was not yet ready to have his child and may never decide to But the yearold physiotherapist wants to be able to keep her options open She told BBC Radio  live I cant make that decision and certainly cant start doing it at a time when Im still grieving and professionally trying to establish myself financially and so on She said her husband had signed every form he was given including one a month before he died and that the couple had not realised there could be a time limit on how long the sperm was stored  We thought wed done everything that we possibly could said Mrs Warren  She said any child she had using the sperm would be brought up surrounded by photographs and videos of her late husband and would have two families in their life Of course its not ideal she added Thats something Ive got to go over in my head at a time when Im not so emotional and not still grieving so painfully over my husband Mrs Warren told the BBC that if she failed in her current court challenge her options were to try to get pregnant straight away ask to have the sperm exported and stored abroad or undergo IVF treatment  Any embryos created using IVF could be stored until  she said   The fertility regulator the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority says it has no discretion to extend the storage period  The case reopens a longstanding debate about the ethics of posthumous conception In  the courts ruled Diane Blood should be allowed to take her dead husbands sperm abroad In that case there was never any written consent Ms Blood went on to have two sons
