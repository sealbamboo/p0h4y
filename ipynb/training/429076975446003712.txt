Many children with peanut allergies who were fed small but escalating amounts of peanut flour were eventually able to eat a significant quantity of peanuts with no reaction, a new study has found. . Six months after the treatment started, more than 80% of the children in the trial could safely eat the equivalent of five peanuts a day. That is at least 25 times the quantity of peanut protein that they could tolerate before the therapy.
