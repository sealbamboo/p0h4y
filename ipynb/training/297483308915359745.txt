The people on the front lines of tuberculosis control have their hands full but their biggest challenge for the moment may be containing strains of the disease that are resistant to drugs Worldwide the number of TB cases is going down The bad news is that the number of drugresistant cases is going up The World Health Organization   that the number of reported TB cases that were multi extremely or totallydrug resistant doubled between  and  Until recently it was extremely difficult to even diagnose drugresistant TB particularly in developing countries where the disease is most prevalent Tests had to be sent to fancy labs and could take up to three months to process But hope arrived a few years ago in the form of a new screening tool called   It was designed to identify TB bacteria and the most common form of drug resistance in only two hours But as a new technology no one was quite sure how effective it was Now a comprehensive analysis of Xperts performance   Thursday in the influential Cochrane Library validates the test as an accurate tool for detecting resistance to one of the leading TB drugs rifampicin At  for the machine and  for each test Xpert is   But this stamp of approval could encourage more health departments in TB endemic countries to spend the dough on this new method of testing In the study researchers at the University of Washington and McGill University analyzed  previously published studies involving almost  TB patients They found that compared to the conventional methods Xpert could accurately detect a TB infection  percent of the time and rifampicin resistance  percent of time Health workers in the field are a fan of it too Doctors in Cape Town South Africa working with Doctors Without Borders tell Shots the Xpert is a game changer in TB control They say that by identifying drugresistant TB earlier these highly dangerous strains of the airborne bacteria can be contained and kept from spreading The Xpert machine examines the nucleic acid in a patients sputum  the mucus coughed up from the upper respiratory tract The spit is put in a cartridge which is then stuck into the Xpert machine Within two hours a doctor will know if the patient has TB and if that form of TB is resistant to rifampicin In the conventional TB test still widely used today a medical worker looks for the bacteria under the microscope If there are signs of an infection the sample is then sent out for confirmation by culturing the bacteria in a laboratory This can take up to six weeks to get results and testing for drugresistant strains of the bacteria takes even longer TB is the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease after HIV killing an estimated  million people around the globe in
