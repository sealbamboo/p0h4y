Obesity is a global issue caused by a multitude of factors  Experts agree that urgent action is needed and that everyone has a role to play in finding a solution  But which single action stands to make the biggest impact Terry Jones director at the   says consumers need to brush up on their health knowledge and shop savvy  There is no simple or single solution to tackling obesity and we all need to play a role For our part manufacturers are changing product recipes creating new healthier options investing in consumer education and providing clear nutritional information to enable healthier choices We must help people gain a realistic understanding of the foods and drink that they consume and how they can fit into a healthy diet Making greater use of nutrition labelling can help us all to manage our intake of calories and certain nutrients over the course of a day We agree that more needs to be done to ensure that both adults and children take advantage of the opportunities to fit exercise into their everyday lives Sabrina Bushe of the  says much of the problem boils down to poverty Obesity is a general problem  present at all levels of society  but also one that becomes more likely the lower a persons household income  Taking yearolds as an example official statistics for England show that around  of children in the richest fifth of households are obese compared with  of children in the poorest fifth The overall percentage for this age group is around twice that for fiveyearolds  What we know now as far as obesity among children is concerned is that it worsens during the time of primary school  so it is in no sense just an early years problem  and that poverty makes it a lot worse Poverty reduction and lower levels of income inequality more widely are part of the answer Prof Sheila Hollins chairwoman of the   Board of Science says  a complete ban on advertising junk food would make a real difference Environmental factors including the promotion of unhealthy food and poor infrastructure for active means of travel have had a negative impact on peoples eating habits and activity levels and have exacerbated the UKs obesity problem  With an alarming rise in the levels of obesity among children the BMA is urging the government to introduce a complete ban on the advertising and marketing of unhealthy foodstuffs and make more extensive use of the media to promote healthy lifestyle messages  Improved and consistent food labelling is fundamental in enabling consumers to make informed dietary choices which is why the BMA has repeatedly called for the introduction of a standardised consistent approach to labelling based upon the trafficlight frontofpack labelling This is something that the   also puts at the top of its wish list  Coordinator Malcolm Clark says A significant dent on obesity levels is unlikely to happen until the government ensures all companies are changing their marketing habits and faster and further than they would otherwise have done  is hoping its latest initiative which asks people to make simple swaps like substituting sugary fizzy drinks for sugarfree or diet alternatives will help stem the obesity crisis  This likeforlike swap could save a family up to threequarters of a kg bag of sugar over four weeks according to the ChangeLife Smart Swaps campaign Prof Kevin Fenton director of health and wellbeing says PHE are committed to helping to tackle obesity through a range of approaches that support action on the local environment to make eating less and being more physically active easier The   says greater availability of interventions to help people to lose and manage their weight is key   This ranges from simple and lowcost programmes for most with more intensive support available for people who have more severe and complex obesity  In too many towns GPs cannot discuss obesity with their patients because there is nowhere they can refer their patients if patients want help Evidencebased programmes are available  they just need to be made available everywhere   At the same time the heavy marketing of energydense foods and drinks needs to be halted to both support weight loss efforts and to prevent the development of obesity in currently healthyweight individuals
