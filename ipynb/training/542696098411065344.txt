Most women with early stage breast cancer are receiving long courses of radiation after a lumpectomy even though shorter courses using high dose radiation are just as safe and effective and easier for patients to handle a new study finds It should be a winwinwin and yet were not using it coauthor Dr Ezekiel Emanuel of the University of Pennsylvanias Perelman School of Medicine told NBC News Most women with early stage breast cancer opt to have breastconserving surgery or lumpectomy Studies show that this surgery combined with radiation gives women the same chance of survival as if they were to choose a mastectomy in which the whole breast is removed Conventionally radiation treatment is given over the course of  weeks with daily visits to the doctors office But several large studies have found that an accelerated radiation treatment given at higher doses over a course of  weeks is just as effective as the longer course at preventing breast cancer recurrence But the new study published Wednesday in JAMA finds that twothirds of women are still getting the longer course of radiation I think radiation oncologists know they should be using it but its very very slow uptake whereas in other countries  percent of women are getting this accelerated treatment Emanuel said So why are women still getting the longer treatment The motivations are complex said Dr Ben Smith a radiation oncologist at MD Anderson For decades radiation oncologists were taught to give low daily doses of radiation treatment over a prolonged period of time to limit the longterm side effects of their treatment This higher daily dose makes a lot of radiation oncologists nervous given prior teaching and I think this feeling accounts for the reluctance to embrace the newer shorter approach to breast radiation Stacey Naggiar
