The   in which Brittany Maynard explained her decision to end her life under Oregons Death With Dignity Act put a human face  and a very young one  on a sometimes abstract debate  Viewers saw her walking in the woods with her husband There were glimpses of the small purse that held bottles of legally prescribed barbiturates and the sunny bedroom where she intended to take a lethal dose They heard her mother tearfully support her decision As mournful piano music played they heard Ms Maynard  express relief that she would be able to die peacefully when she chose rather than wait for an aggressive brain tumor to kill her And they heard her offer hope that her story could influence the nations endoflife discussion She had moved from California where physicians cannot legally prescribe drugs to end the lives of patients to a state where terminally ill patients have had that option since  I would like all Americans to have access to the same health care rights she said Advocates say that Ms Maynard who   has indeed advanced that cause The two videos  shot for   a national organization supporting legal aid in dying and released in early October and then last week  have drawn more than  million views on YouTube Ms Maynard appeared on the cover of People magazine and on CBSs morning and evening news programs and made headlines internationally More than five million people visited her page on the Compassion and Choices website  signed an online card On Sunday as news of her death spread the website drew  visits an hour the organization said Our phones are ringing ringing ringing said Peg Sandeen executive director of the   in Portland Ore We see people having conversations around dinner tables or with friends at work and this time we see those conversations among young people In Compassion and Choices year history Nothing has touched as many people as Brittanys story and changed the dialogue around death with dignity the way this has said Mickey MacIntyre the groups chief program officer We saw people running for office put this story on their Facebook pages or talk about it when they were campaigning which isnt usually the case Action to allow doctors to prescribe lethal medication for dying patients has spread slowly to five states Oregon in  and Washington in  approved it by referendum Oregons law was upheld by   In  after a decadelong effort Vermont   Court decisions have made   where legislators twice voted not to recriminalize it and in New Mexico where the state attorney general has appealed the ruling But the effort has met with notable defeats as well In  early polls showed majority support for a Massachusetts referendum after opponents primarily Roman Catholic organizations spent close to  million the referendum   This year legislatures in Massachusetts and Connecticut held hearings about aid in dying but took no action and a bill legalizing it was trounced in the New Hampshire House of Representatives A New Jersey assemblyman believes he has the votes to pass a law in both legislative houses this session  but if he succeeds Gov Chris Christie has said he wont sign it Will even the wellpublicized case of an articulate young woman with a terrible disease lead to political change Public opinion remains divided as   last year demonstrated Twothirds of Americans agree there are situations in which patients should be allowed to die and a growing proportion   percent  believe a person has a moral right to suicide when suffering great pain with no hope of improvement up from  percent in   But respondents were less certain about laws to allow doctorassisted suicide for the terminally ill with  percent disapproving and  percent approving Youll have to see how state legislators and voters react said Joe Baerlein whose public relations firm marshaled the opposition to the Massachusetts referendum Its a very raw situation right now You dont think in terms of politics You think of sympathy for a family Appearing to exploit her experience could backfire he warned Moreover however sympathetic to Ms Maynard and her family opponents of what they call physicianassisted suicide will hardly evaporate The American Medical Association and its state affiliates still regularly fight legalization attempts though the American Public Health Association supports them along with Catholic archdioceses and some Protestant evangelicals and disability groups A Vatican official   as reprehensible But Compassion and Choices says the landscape may be shifting Legislators in Colorado California Nevada and New Hampshire have contacted the organization Mr MacIntyre said In Pennsylvania an aidindying bill was pending in the State Senate a Statehouse companion was suddenly introduced as well Editorial columns last month in   and   called for California to revive aidindying legislation Kathryn Tucker the former legal director for Compassion and Choices and a lawyer representing aidindying plaintiffs in New Mexico predicted that doctors and patients would also bring suits in several other states and that Ms Maynards story would have impact It galvanizes public opinion which can change how legislators see the issue she said I think it influences courts too Of course most people who avail themselves of lethal medication from doctors even where thats legal are not like Brittany Maynard In Oregon which keeps careful records on the  participants who received prescriptions from  through last year and the  who used the medication to die a majority  percent are over age  But youth  Ms Maynard said farewell via Facebook  was part of what made this public crusade so gripping When you add a face a compelling face an interesting story a young family people get much more engaged Ms Sandeen said I think well see vocal groups working to push this forward
