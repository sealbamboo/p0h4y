It sounds like something out of Dr Seuss but artist   is developing a tree that blooms in pink fuchsia purple and red in the spring  and that is capable of bearing  different kinds of fruit No its not genetic engineering Van Aken an associate professor in Syracuse Universitys art department used an ageold technique called grafting to attach branches from  different kinds of stone fruit onto a single tree Its called the Tree of  Fruit   Arun Rath spoke to Van Aken about the project and what inspired it Im an artist So the whole project really began with this idea of creating a tree that would blossom in these different colors and would bear these multitude of fruit he says But he soon discovered that it was actually pretty hard to find so many distinct varieties of stone fruit in New York he explains in his   at TEDx Manhattan I realized the extent to which weve created these massive monocultures Most grocery stores and markets only stock a few varieties  and most of them are grown in California But then Van Aken came across the New York State Agricultural Experimentation Station It was the largest orchard of its kind in the Northeast perhaps even east of the Rockies he says The acre plot contained all sorts of varieties of stone fruit he says And they all had these amazingly different tastes Thats when he started to understand the history behind these fruits he says Then the project really became about preserving some of these antique and heirloom varieties The state wanted to close the operation down due to a lack of funding so Van Aken purchased it in  His  trees around the country are composed of mainly antique and native stone fruit varieties including peaches plums apricots and nectarines In his TEDx talk Van Aken says hes worked with  varieties of stone fruit at this point Im working with cherries Ive had limited success with that he says I also graft almonds to them because the almond blossoms are just absolutely amazing The process of building up these trees has taken years and a lot of patience Van Aken starts with whats called a stock plan He then inserts small budding branches from other trees at strategic points throughout the stock tree He tapes these grafts in place and lets them heal and and bond with their new base over the winter months If all goes well the grafts will start to grow in the spring The technique has been around for thousands of years Van Aken says It appears on hieroglyphs in Egypt These days many commercial fruit trees are grafted  growers choose base trees that work well in their climate And Van Aken says nurseries now what theyll do is theyll sell combination trees which are two varieties that will crosspollinate each other so youll get a better fruit set As weve   a group of dedicated fruit fans in San Francisco are even using the technique to get the barren trees along city sidewalks to bear cherries pears and apples Van Akens trees are still quite young  his rendering shows what he expects them to look like in a few years For now he says hes battling the squirrels chipmunks deer and groundhogs that are threatening his labors of love I get very   he says laughing Im a lot like Bill Murray during the summer
