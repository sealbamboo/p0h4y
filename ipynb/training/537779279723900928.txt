 Avanir Pharmaceuticals Inc., which previously said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had questions about “human factor” study data for a migraine treatment, said Wednesday that the agency has issued a complete response letter.. The FDA has “requested that Avanir assess the root cause(s) of device-use errors observed in the previously conducted human factors testing,” which the company said was consistent with preliminary feedback announced Nov. 7.
