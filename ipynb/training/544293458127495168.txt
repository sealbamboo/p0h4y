Higher rates of obesity and illhealth have been found in shift workers than the general population   showed they were in worse health despite often being young The lead researcher told the BBC that the rise of zerohours contracts may be increasing the numbers doing shift work and could raise pretty serious problems for the nations health Scientists said it was fairly clear now that shift work was unhealthy The report by the Health and Social Care Information Centre showed  of men and  of women of working age were doing shift work They defined shifts as employment outside  Rachel Craig the research director for the Health Survey for England told the BBC Overall people who are doing shift work are not quite as healthy as their counterparts doing regular working hours The data showed  of shift workers were obese compared with  of men and  of women doing normal hours Meanwhile  of men and  of women on shifts had longstanding health conditions such as backpain diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease compared with  and  of the rest of the population Shift working is most common in the  age group with nearly half of men and a third of women having this working pattern The rates fell with age so that fewer than a third of men and a fifth of women were working shifts after the age of  Ms Craig said that overall young people should be in better health Youd expect less illhealth and fewer longstanding conditions that reflect lifestyle like obesity so it makes it an even stronger relationship between shifts and poor health There is mounting scientific evidence on how disrupted sleep affects the normal rhythms of the body clock and leads to a widerange of diseases However other factors that are at play include people from lower incomes who already have higher rates of poor health being more likely to do shifts Ms Craig raised concerns that the situation was getting worse She told the BBC News website It looks as though shift working is slightly higher than in  and that may be a move to more parttime and zerohours contract working There is evidence to suggest that may be having an influence It potentially does raise pretty serious problems and throws a challenge to employers to support shift workers and come up with ways to mitigate the effect of working shifts If a larger proportion of people are doing shifts it is likely to result in greater demand on healthcare systems It is something to think seriously about Dr Simon Archer a body clock scientist at the University of Surrey said the data was fascinating He said teenagers and young adults were generally more eveningtype people as their body clock runs later He suggested this might explain why there were more young shift workers The young people are coping but they shift more to morningness as they get older and they cant hack it He added that smoking is also more common in eveningtypes also known as owls which was reflected in the health survey data He told the BBC News website that shifts were bad for the body The body isnt designed to eat in the night It doesnt clear fat very well and shift workers tend to want to eat high calorie foods and that translates into things not so good for you Obesity is the clear link and that also leads to type diabetes Shift work is becoming increasingly common and its causing a lot of problems to a lot of people and in particular the link with cancer is becoming stronger
