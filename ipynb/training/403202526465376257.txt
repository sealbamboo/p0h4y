If a woman is physically active during pregnancy she may boost the development of her unborn childs brain according to a hearttugging new study of expectant mothers and their newborns The findings bolster a growing scientific consensus that the benefits of exercise can begin to accumulate even before someone is born    It has long been suspected that a mothertobes activity  or lack of it  affects her unborn offspring which is not surprising given how their physiologies intertwine Past studies have shown for example that a babys heart rate typically rises in unison with his or her exercising mothers as if the child were also working out As a result scientists believe babies born to active mothers tend to have more robust cardiovascular systems from an early age than babies born to mothers who are more sedentary  Whether gestational exercise similarly shapes an unborn childs developing brain has been harder to quantify although recent studies have been suggestive An   this month at the   in San Diego for instance reported that pregnant rats allowed to run on wheels throughout their pregnancies birthed pups that performed more dexterously in early childhood on a tricky memory test  having to identify unfamiliar objects in a familiar environment  than pups born to sedentary moms These clever rats retained their cognitive advantage into adulthood meaning for rats weeks later  But this and similar experiments have involved animals rather than people Many of these studies also began comparing the creatures cognitive abilities when they were old enough to move about and respond to their world by which time they potentially might have been shaped as much by their environment as by their time in the womb  So to minimize these concerns researchers at the University of Montreal in Canada recently recruited a group of local women who were in their first trimester of pregnancy At that point the women were almost identical in terms of lifestyle All were healthy young adults None were athletes Few had exercised regularly in the past and none had exercised more than a day or two per week in the past year  Then the women were randomized either to begin an exercise program commencing in their second trimester or to remain sedentary The women in the exercise group were asked to work out for at least  minutes three times a week at a moderate intensity equivalent to about a six or so on a scale of exertion from one to  Most of the women walked or jogged  Every month for the remainder of each womans pregnancy she would visit the universitys exercise lab so researchers could monitor her fitness All of the volunteers including those in the nonexercise group also maintained daily activity logs  After about six months and following the dictates of nature the women gave birth All thankfully had healthy boys or girls  which the scientists gently requested that the mothers almost immediately bring in for testing  
Within  days of birth in fact each of the newborns accompanied his or her mother to the lab There each baby was fitted with an adorable little cap containing electrodes that monitor electrical activity in the brain settled in his or her mothers lap and soothed to sleep Researchers then started a sound loop featuring a variety of low soft sounds that recurred frequently interspersed occasionally with more jarring unfamiliar noises while the babys brain activity was recorded  We know that babys brains respond to these kinds of sounds with a spike in certain types of brain activity said Elise LabonteLeMoyne a PhD candidate at the University of Montreal who led the study and also presented   at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting This spike is most pronounced in immature brains she continued and diminishes as a newborns brain develops and begins processing information more efficiently It usually disappears altogether by the time a baby is  months old she said  In this case the relevant brainwave activity soared in response to the novel sounds among the children born to mothers who had remained sedentary during pregnancy But it was noticeably blunted in the babies whose mothers had exercised In essence their brains were more mature Ms LabonteLeMoyne said   How gestational exercise can remodel an unborn childs brain is not clear Ms LabonteLeMoyne admits since unlike circulatory systems a mothers brain is not hardwired directly to that of her child But we suspect that when mom exercises she generates a variety of chemicals including many related to brain health which can move into her bloodstream and eventually mingle with the blood of her baby  But that possibility is only theoretical for now It is also unclear whether the precocious brain development seen in newborns with active mothers will linger into their later lives Ms LabonteLeMoyne and her colleagues plan to retest the children on various cognitive tests once they are a year old   But for now the lesson is clear If a woman can be physically active during her pregnancy she may give her unborn child an advantage in terms of brain development Ms LabonteLeMoyne said And the commitment required can be slight We were surprised she said by how much of an effect we saw from barely an hour of exercise per week
