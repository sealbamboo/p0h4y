Most of that time he did not wear a mask  In retrospect he said We were ingesting whole buildings Less than four years later at age  Meyers was diagnosed with stage IV oropharyngeal cancer  One tumor had formed in Meyers throat and two on his lymph nodes  An ultrasound later revealed another tumor near his collarbone All four were malignant said Meyers who choked up as he recalled being diagnosed I asked Whats my chances No one could give me an answer According to the most recent data from the World Trade Center Health Program there are nearly  cases of   police officers contractors and civilians who worked or lived near the site of the attacks   A growing number are being diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer but some  including Meyers  are being denied insurance coverage because their cancers were diagnosed too soon after  The minimum latency period for oropharyngeal cancers  in other words the minimum time period required to prove a link between exposure to toxins at ground zero and a diagnosis of that type of cancer  is four years  Absent this type of dramatic environmental exposure oropharyngeal cancers in most cases take one or two decades to develop although   suggest that cases are being diagnosed at younger ages and more frequently Meyers was diagnosed three years and  months after his work at ground zero about eight weeks shy of eligibility for cancer coverage or compensation  We got screwed he said They dont know what the latency period should be four years may be right or it may be wrong The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined the latency periods for   including oropharyngeal now covered under its WTC Health Program In a statement the institute said it selected minimum latencies informed by the available science and that it erred on the memberfavorable side to avoid false negatives for coverage  In documents outlining its process the agency acknowledged that for the most part data in this area are scant At the time they came up with the latency period there was nothing unreasonable about it said Noah Kushlefsky a partner at the Kreindler  Kreindler law firm in New York which is representing thousands of  responders including Meyers   That is because it was not known what effects cancer would have on this population But in the two years since latency for cancers was spelled out  and many cases later  Kushlefsky says it has become an inescapable fact that the latency period has to be wrong  Wrong he says because of the sheer number of oropharyngeal cancer cases he is seeing cross his desk Kushlefsky along with colleagues at another New York law firm represents about  people exposed to toxins while working at ground zero He says  have been diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer  About onequarter of that group was denied coverage because of the fouryear latency rule To have so many cases of a rare cancer  diagnosed in an unusually young population according to data provided by Kushlefsky  should he says spur a reexamination of the data by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Dr Otis Brawley chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society says that oropharyngeal cancer in this population absent risk factors like drinking smoking or a human papillomavirus infection is unusual  Still determining an accurate latency window is an exceedingly complex process Four years is a group of peoples best guess its literally that said Brawley a practicing oncologist I dont know of any animal models for cancers developed after sucking in that much soot and smoke from collapsed buildings so people have to make a guess  Brawley added that four years is probably a fair  perhaps even generous  timeline for developing oropharyngeal cancer even considering the unique circumstances surrounding   Not everyone agrees I think the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health made a terrible mistake said Michael Banahan a firstresponder diagnosed with stage III oropharyngeal cancer at age  three years and five months after    Like Meyers he was denied coverage because he was diagnosed too soon Im going to die knowing I got my cancer from  I dont care what NIOSH says Advocates for responders including medical experts say that they will petition the institute to amend its rules concerning coverage for oropharyngeal cancer  In a statement the institute indicated that as new scientific information becomes available it could modify minimum latencies for certain cancers  This has to be a dynamic process where they look at whats going on this community and say Maybe we need to change this  Kushlefsky said Banahan and Meyers have been in remission for several years yet both remain hypervigilant about cancer as it could one day reappear   Compensation they say would provide some comfort that their families would be supported if they die But it is less about money Meyers says than about not being forgotten   There is an abnormal amount of cancers amongst us that arent in the general population he said  This is something that has to be looked at
