Losing sleep tends to make people eat more and gain weight and now a new study suggests that one reason may be the impact that sleep deprivation has on the brain The research showed that depriving people of sleep for one night created pronounced changes in the way their brains responded to highcalorie junk foods On days when the subjects had not had proper sleep fattening foods like potato chips and sweets stimulated stronger responses in a part of the brain that helps govern the motivation to eat But at the same time the subjects experienced a sharp reduction in activity in the frontal cortex a higherlevel part of the brain where consequences are weighed and rational decisions are made The findings suggested that one unfortunate result of sleep loss is this double hit in brain activity said   an author of the study and a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of California Berkeley A sleepy brain appears to not only respond more strongly to junk food but also has less ability to rein that impulse in Some experts have theorized that in a sleepdeprived state people eat more food simply to make up for all the calories they expend as they burn the midnight oil But the new study showed that the changes in brain activity were evident even when the subjects were fed extra food and not experiencing any increased sensations in hunger Their hunger was no different when they were sleep deprived and when they had a normal night of sleep Dr Walker said Thats important because it suggests that the changes were seeing are caused by sleep deprivation itself rather than simply being perhaps more metabolically impaired when youre sleep deprived The relationship between sleep loss and weight gain is a strong one borne out in a variety of studies over the years Large   show that both adults and children are more likely to be overweight and obese the less they sleep at night In smaller   scientists find that when people are allowed to sleep eight hours one night and then half that amount on another they end up eating more on the days when theyve had less sleep One   at the University of Colorado in March showed that losing just a few hours of sleep a few nights in a row caused people to pack on an average of about two pounds Other   that the underlying effects of sleep deprivation on the body can in many ways be pronounced The stress hormone cortisol climbs and markers of inflammation rise Hormones that stimulate appetite increase while hormones that blunt it drop People become less sensitive to insulin raising their risk of Type  diabetes But until now few if any studies have looked at precisely what goes on in the brain when people are starved of sleep and then faced with food decisions In the new study which was published in   Dr Walker and his colleagues recruited  healthy men and women and assigned them to two different regimes each separated by about a week On one occasion the subjects came into the lab and got a normal night of rest  roughly eight hours  before waking up to a small breakfast of toast and strawberry jam The subjects then looked at  pictures of a variety of foods and were asked to rate how strongly they wanted them while an imaging machine measured brain activity The subjects were told that after looking through the pictures they would receive one of the foods that they rated the highest On another occasion the subjects followed the same routine but this time instead of sleeping they stayed awake through the night They were also given snacks  like apples and peanut butter crackers  to offset any extra calories that they burned while staying awake The research showed that when the subjects were blearyeyed and sleepdeprived they strongly preferred the food choices that were highest in calories like desserts chocolate and potato chips The sleepier they felt the more they wanted the calorierich foods In fact the foods they requested when they were sleep deprived added up to about  calories more than the foods that they wanted when they were well rested At the same time brain scans showed that on the morning after the subjects sleepless night the heavily caloric foods produced intense activity in an almondshaped structure called the amygdala which helps regulate basic emotions as well as our desires for things like food and experiences That was accompanied by sharply reduced responses in cortical areas of the frontal lobe that regulate decisionmaking providing top down control of the amygdala and other primitive brain structures One expert who was not involved in the new study   called the findings exciting and said that they help explain why people make poor dietary choices and eat much more than they need to when fatigued Theres something that changes in our brain when were sleepy thats irrespective of how much energy we need said Dr Wright the director of the sleep and chronobiology lab at the University of Colorado at Boulder The brain wants more even when the energy need has been fulfilled But why would a lack of sleep disrupt the brain response to food Dr Walker said he suspected that one factor that plays a role is a substance called adenosine a metabolic byproduct that disrupts neural function and promotes sleepiness as it accumulates in the brain One of the ways that caffeine stimulates wakefulness is by blocking adenosine Adenosine is also cleared from the system when we sleep Without enough rest adenosine builds up and may start to degrade communication between networks in the brain Dr Walker said Getting sleep may be the equivalent of rebooting the brain I think you have about  hours of optimal functioning before the brain needs to go offline and sleep he said If you go beyond these  hours into the realm of sleep deprivation then those brain networks start to break down and become dysfunctional Dr Walker said it was increasingly clear from the medical literature that there is not a single tissue in the body that is not beneficially affected by sleep Its the single most effective thing people can do every day to reset their brain and body health he said
