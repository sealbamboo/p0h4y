Before I go running I tear off several threeinch strips of first aid tape and carefully place them along the perimeter of my breasts two under each armpit one underneath each breast and then four in the middle of my chest I also stick an oversized BandAid on each shoulder  It is a timeconsuming ritual but one that is necessary The tape protects the places where my sports bra which I intentionally wear one size too small rubs against my skin Its all part of an ongoing effort to limit the bounce of my very large breasts during exercise Ive always had large breasts By the time I graduated high school I was a C With aging and weight gain Im now a DD compounding what was already a physical nuisance When I see my reflection in shop windows Im struck by my stout carriage and the resemblance to my great grandparents from the Lithuanian shtetl  Its not just that my breasts are heavy combined they weigh nearly five pounds its that they move about a minute after I do Some of my largebreasted friends wont even consider running because of the physical and mental discomfort  Those who still try to run dont always find the support they need When my friend Rina Plapler  of New York City went to a sporting goods store to try to find a running bra the salesperson took one look at her large breasts You might want to consider another form of exercise the salesperson said  Ms Plapler tried to address the issue herself by wearing two bras at once to eliminate the bounce factor She also tried wearing a size too small but like me she suffered from painful chafing  Chafing for those who havent experienced it can be excruciating I once thought I pinched a nerve while running because when I took my postrun shower I felt a stinging in my back so sharp it was as if that spot was on fire It wasnt until I noticed it happening with every postrun shower that I realized it was just the water hitting a place where my bra had rubbed the skin raw One solution to chafing is to use a lubricant like Bodyglide in the spots where the skin and fabric rub together But for wellendowed athletes a lubricant can compound the problem by creating additional moisture When you have large breasts moisture in the fold under your breasts can lead to yeasty rashes  To deal with moisture Ms Plapler said she once placed cotton balls under her breasts before going on a run Unfortunately the cotton balls began to move during the run By the end of the run they had all moved into the middle and made this big blob like a third boob Ms Plapler said And its not just women of a certain age who struggle Jenna a yearold on my nieces hockey team in upstate New York tells me that its not easy to be an athlete with large breasts  When playing ice hockey Jenna had to choose between an expensive set of female chest protector pads molded for the curves of her body or wearing more affordable mens padding like the rest of her female teammates She chose the mens padding to save money but the illfitting gear gaps due to the size of her breasts leaving her vulnerable to being hit with a wayward puck So far shes already been hit in the arms and shoulders and rib cage She tried a smaller size but it was too constricting Jenna plays rugby too She wanted to play wing a player whose job it is to attack and defend up and down the edges of the field But because of the size of her breasts she couldnt bear all the running involved Instead she plays fullback which still requires some running but is more focused on defense and reading the game But she still remains selfconscious when she is running with friends particularly male friends I feel like theyre looking at me she says My yoga teacher is buxom and very fit Despite having large breasts she can twist and bend and stretch into any number of difficult yoga poses It makes me happy to see that a woman with oversize breasts can excel at yoga I asked her if she ever felt selfconscious about having such large breasts in the yoga world If I ever get enough money I want to get a breast reduction she told me Ive toyed with the idea of a breast reduction myself but I could never do it Id feel like I was cutting off a part of my body that makes me well uniquely me like my long toes or my wiry hair that frizzes at the hint of rain Perhaps one day a sports apparel maker will come up with the perfect sports bra for wellendowed athletes Until then I will just keep taping and binding and applying a couple of wellplaced bandages And it helps to know that Im not alone that there is a sisterhood of largebreasted women like me out there who still find ways to run skate twist and tackle Because for now that may be the strongest support Im going to find
