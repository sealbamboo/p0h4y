Scientists reported Thursday they had figured out a way to make primitive human sperm out of skin cells an advance that could someday help infertile men have children I probably get  emails a year from people who are infertile and very often the heading on the emails is Can you help me says   of Montana State University who led the research when she was at Stanford University In a   published in the journal   Pera and her colleagues describe what they did They took skin cells from infertile men and manipulated them in the laboratory to become induced pluripotent stem cells which are very similar to human embryonic stem cells That means they have the ability to become virtually any cell in the body They then inserted the cells into the testes of mice where they became very immature human sperm cells the researchers report Its much easier than we actually expected Pera told Shots Other researchers caution that theres still much more research that is needed to prove these cells would actually become healthy sperm that could make a baby But they said the report was intriguing Its one step closer to being able to make sperm in a petri dish says   a stemcell researcher at Harvard So I think thats very provocative But others worry the techniques could be misused Its opening up a brave new world says   a bioethicist at Dartmouth If this works he says someone could steal other peoples cells  even from a hair  to make their sperm without their permission So it is not impossible in the future that a movie star may find some of his hair follicles purloined and then on the market as donor sperm Green says You can imagine some clandestine sperm bank saying Were selling George Clooneys sperm  Thats not all Green says Posthumous reproduction becomes a possibility he says which would mean that people who are dead or long dead  so long as there is a live tissue sample somewhere being preserved  could be the parents of children This might appeal for instance to the family of a man who died in a war Green says Society should take steps to prevent that kind of thing from happening he argues I think were going to have to craft a new human right he says And that is the right to consent to being a parent So I think were going to have to put rules into place to make this an offense  a criminal offense Pera acknowledges her research could be misused But shes optimistic that it wont With any technology there really is a worry about misuse But there does seem to be a natural inclination in people to do the right thing she says Most people want to have their own child Its not that they want to have somebody elses child  even George Clooneys child in my estimation
