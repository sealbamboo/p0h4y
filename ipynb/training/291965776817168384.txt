When I was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago it was clear that I would be thinking about a lot of things  myriad doctor visits multiple tests surgeries and chemotherapy Here are some things I knew about chemotherapy going in it is unpleasant it poisons your body it makes you nauseated But there was also something I wasnt quite as aware of it plays havoc with your taste buds and even impacts your reaction to food smells and food textures In short eating can become an unpleasant chore As someone who both loves food and loves to cook I prepared myself to enter a period of not eating or at least not enjoying eating But does it have to be that way Not necessarily Here are four tips I learned to help cope with treatment    Pay attention to the list your doctors give you of what you cant eat It took me some time to realize that this list resembles the list of things to avoid when pregnant unwashed fruits and vegetables raw and undercooked meat raw milk products salad bars among others Rather like in pregnancy your body is undergoing a chemical change during chemo and with a compromised immune system you have to be careful not to expose yourself to unwanted pathogens    No duh But this involves not just the amazing drugs you can now get as part of your treatment it can also involve some homemade remedies which offer a nice break from all the medications you will be on For me that old standby ginger really did work One of my favorite   to use was  by Rebecca Katz with Mat Edelson I found the   quite the tonic along with her Magic Mineral Broth recipe below I would say these were staples In fact that broth dont let the secret ingredient  seaweed  scare you is still standard repertoire in my cooking long after the end of treatment    Depending on which chemotherapy regimen you are on you may find yourself with extreme dry mouth and also a metallic taste in your mouth If you eat with metal flatware the metallic taste will be worse Time to get out the plastic forks This doesnt last forever but it really makes a difference    Does it taste good If it does eat it If it doesnt dont Could this be more obvious Well you will be surprised at how much you will resist this seemingly simple bit of advice Oh but I must eat X because of its anticancer fighting properties youll say When you are in the throes of treatment you dont really have to worry about that because well you already have cancer and you are fighting the cancer by going through treatment Eating should be a pleasure and we tend to lose sight of that fact In fact eating should be as much about pleasure as it is about health So dont destroy the pleasure by now forcing yourself to eat something that doesnt smell or taste good to you I continued to eat yogurt during my treatment because I thought it was good for me The texture was unbearable and my gag reflex would kick in but I soldiered on Now I cant eat yogurt without loading it with granola or fruit to distance myself from that unpleasant memory that I associate with its texture And lets go back to the pregnancy analogy When I was pregnant I could not drink tea because it tasted bad to me and that is exactly what happened during chemo so I stopped Im glad I did because now I have no bad associations at all when it comes to my   My apologies if you were expecting something more profound from a veteran of chemotherapy The good news is that as far as food and chemotherapy goes it is not as complicated a problem as it could be But while it is not complicated it is hard to get right Everyone reacts a little differently so there is trial and error involved I ate a lot of peanut butter and chicken and drank proteinfortified smoothies Thats what worked for me What works for you will be different but attainable and that is even better news because you will have plenty of other stuff to deal with during your treatment So will a cancer cookbook or even an   help you through this period Well usually the recipes are common sense nutritious foods that you might have been cooking already and will certainly want to continue to cook What a cookbook can do is help you organize A new   that just crossed my desk  has a table of contents ordered by ailment Sore Mouth Nausea  Vomiting Constipation etc This seems particularly useful when you are juggling so much else in managing your treatment and the recipes look good too There are a range of books to choose from but actually the best thing you can do with a cancer cookbook is give one to your caregiver or whoever else is preparing meals for you while you are focusing on healing Dont be embarrassed to do so People want to help you and if this is the help you need from them go ahead  it sure beats a    The CancerFighting Kitchen Nourishing
