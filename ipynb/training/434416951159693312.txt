Most parents prefer that their children pick up a book rather than a game controller But for kids with dyslexia action video games may be just what the doctor ordered Dyslexia is one of the most common learning disabilities affecting an estimated  to  percent of the worlds population Many approaches to help struggling readers focus on words and phonetics but researchers at Oxford University say dyslexia is more of an attention issue So programs should emphasize training the brains attention system they say something that video games do These video games require you to respond very quickly to shift attention to one part of the screen to another says   an experimental psychologist and lead author of the study When people with dyslexia had to shift their attention between sight and sound their reaction was delayed And they had significantly more trouble shifting attention from visual to audio than the other way around Its not just shifting attention from one location to another but we should also be training shifting attention from sound to visual stimuli and vice versa Harrar who is dyslexic herself tells Shots She adds that at least for some people making the association between a word and how it sounds might be easier if they hear it first and then see the corresponding symbols Scientists today still dont agree on what causes dyslexia but one theory says it has something to do with a faulty nerve pathway from the eyes to the back of the brain that is responsible for guiding both visual and auditory attention When this network malfunctions people cant properly combine what they hear and see for the brain to process the information To test this researchers asked  people with dyslexia and  control participants to press a button as quickly as they could each time they heard a sound saw a dim flash of patterns on the computer screen or experienced both together The results showed that the dyslexic group took longer than typical readers to respond when they had to alternate their attention between a sound and a flash What really stunned researchers was that the group reacted much more slowly to a sound if it followed the flash We were very surprised by this result that there was sort of this asymmetry that only occurs in one direction Harrar says The   was published Feb  in   One explanation for this may be what psychologists call visual capture says   an expert in language and learning disabilities at the University of California Merced As human beings we prefer visual stimuli Gilger who was not involved in the study tells Shots When youre trying to listen to someone on TV and the sound doesnt match the mouth moving it throws you off Youre trying to get the sound to align with the vision not the vision with the sound he adds Since this was an unexpected outcome Harrar says more research is needed to see if the asymmetrical delay is true for all people with dyslexia and if video games that require quick shifts of attention would be helpful in overcoming it While the study did not directly test the effect of video games her suggestion echoes the results of a    done in Italy That study found that dyslexic children showed improvements in reading speed and attention skills after having played video games with lots of action Gilger cautions that while some dyslexic people do have attention deficit it is not the underlying cause of every type of dyslexia Some people may appear to lack focus but that doesnt necessarily signal that they have attention problems The reason they look that way is because theyre disinterested in perhaps what theyre doing in school or they dont want to stay on task he says But that has nothing to do with the neurological problems thats causing the reading disability He does agree with Harrar however that the study demonstrates a need for advanced and individualized training programs based on solid research Unfortunately even though we are beginning to understand more about what causes these learning disabilities including dyslexia  treatment is way behind Gilger says
