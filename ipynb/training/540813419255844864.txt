All patients should be given a brain scan after a stroke even if it is a ministroke say Canadian researchers writing in the journal Stroke This is because images of the brain can help doctors assess the damage done and predict the risk of another stroke occurring In the UK guidelines recommend urgent treatment of highrisk stroke patients But the Stroke Association says thousands of lives could be saved by treating ministrokes within  hours The research team led by Dr Jeffrey Perry associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of Ottawa in Canada tracked more than  patients who received CT scans within  hours of a transient ischaemic attack TIA or nondisabling stroke  A TIA is caused by restricted blood supply to the brain and symptoms can last only a few minutes A CT scan combines a series of Xray views to give doctors crosssectional images of the brain The scans revealed that  had brain damage due to impaired circulation  Doctors were looking for signs of newly damaged tissue due to poor circulation previously damaged tissue and damage to any type of small blood vessel in the brain such as narrowing of the small vessels A quarter of the patients showing all these types of damage to their brain in the scans had another stroke within  days This compared with  of people in the study group as a whole making the scans a useful prediction tool Dr Perry said During the day period and also within the first two days after the initial attack patients did much worse in terms of experiencing a subsequent stroke if they had additional areas of damage along with acute ischemia He added that doctors should be willing to use CT scans on patients within  hours of a mild stroke even if symptoms do not last long These findings should prompt physicians to be more aggressive in managing patients with TIA or nondisabling stroke who are diagnosed with acute ischaemia Other measures to prevent further stroke can include cardiac monitoring or medication to lower blood pressure treat high cholesterol or prevent blood clots  Chris Larkin regional head of operations at the Stroke Association said a ministroke can often be a warning sign that a major stroke is on its way Each year around  people in the UK have a ministroke transient ischaemic attack or TIA  A quick response to stroke can significantly reduce the risk of death and disability   If patients with ministroke are assessed and treated as an emergency within  hours the risk of a major stroke is reduced by    This could prevent around  strokes each year in the UK and save over
