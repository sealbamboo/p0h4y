A Boston hospital is starting the worlds first hand transplant program for children and doctors say it wont be long until face transplants and other radical operations to improve appearance and quality of life are offered to kids too  The move shows the growing willingness to do transplants to enhance a patients life rather than to save it as donated hearts livers and other organs have done in the past More than  hands and at least  faces have been transplanted in adults and doctors say its clear these operations are safe enough to offer to children in certain cases too   We feel that this is justifiable said Dr Amir Taghinia who will lead the pediatric hand program at Boston Childrens Hospital   Children will potentially benefit even more from this procedure than adults because they regrow nerves more quickly and have more problems from prosthetic hands he said   Only one hand transplant is known to have been done in a child  a baby in Malaysia in  Because the donor was a twin who died at birth her sister did not need to take drugs to prevent rejection   Thats the main risk in offering children hand transplants  the immunesuppressing drugs carry side effects and may raise the risk of cancer over the long term   However one independent expert thinks the gains may be worth it in certain cases   We understand so much more about immune suppression that its less of a risk to put children on the drugs said Dr Simon Horslen medical director of the liver and intestine transplant program at Seattle Childrens Hospital This is never going to be done as an emergency procedure so the families will have plenty of opportunity to weigh the options   Also a hand can be removed if rejection occurs and that would not leave the child worse off than before the transplant Horslen said   Several types of kids might be candidates  those born without hands children who lose them in accidents and children with infections that wind up requiring damaged hands to be amputated   Quality of life is a key concern for people missing arms and hands  prosthetics for those limbs are not as advanced as those for feet and legs In December doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore did a doublearm transplant for former soldier Brendan Marrocco who lost all four limbs while serving in Iraq It was the seventh doublehand or doublearm transplant performed in the US   For a child missing two hands the qualityoflife issues are a big deal said Dr Douglas Diekema of the Center for Pediatric Bioethics at Seattle Childrens Hospital and a member of the American Board of Pediatrics ethics committee   In terms of how we interact with the social world its mostly our face and our hands so a transplant is a reasonable thing to offer a family he said   Boston Childrens Hospital plans to make its first cases healthy children  or older who are missing both hands   Some of them cant feed themselves they cant go to the bathroom someone needs to assist them with almost every activity Taghinia said   The hospital also will consider children missing one hand who already are taking immunesuppressing drugs because of transplanted organs or those with only one hand that doesnt work well   The hospital will cover the cost of the operation and care for three months afterward then ask insurers to pay for immune suppression and followup
