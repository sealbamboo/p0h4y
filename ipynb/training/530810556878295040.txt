Once again the Supreme Court will decide whether the Affordable Care Act lives or dies Defying expectations the court announced Friday it has agreed to hear a case that challenges the heart of the law subsidies that help people pay their insurance premiums In about three dozen states the federal government runs the online marketplaces exchanges where individuals can find health plans At issue is a phrase in the law stipulating that subsidies to help those with incomes under  percent of poverty are available only in exchanges established by a state The   that the rest of the statute makes it clear that subsidies are available not just in staterun exchanges but also in those where the federal government is doing the work of the state When the law was written most people expected that states would want to run their own exchanges It was a surprise when most opted to let the federal government do it instead A decision to strike down the subsidies in federally run exchange states could end up making insurance unaffordable for millions of people and threaten the viability of the laws entire health insurance program In a rare Friday afternoon notice following their closeddoor conference the   with no further comment that they have agreed to hear   That is the case in which a threejudge appeals court panel in Richmond ruled unanimously that Congress did intend to allow subsidies to be available nationwide The same day that the Richmond court ruled a panel in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled  the opposite way But that case   was vacated when the full appeals court agreed to rehear the case That hearing is scheduled for   Because there are not yet contradictory decisions by appeals courts most observers thought the Supreme Court would at least wait until the lower courts were finished considering the case before weighing in We are disappointed that at least four justices decided to hear this case despite the lack of a circuit split and while this issue is still being actively litigated in the lower courts said Doug Kendall of the   which is representing the members of Congress who wrote the law But we remain very confident that the court will ultimately find that both the text of the ACA and the intentions of Congress mandate a ruling for the federal government Those who argue that the federal subsidies are illegal however say time is of the essence In  there is a serious argument that it would be better to resolve the underlying question of statutory interpretation sooner rather than later wrote Jonathan Adler a law professor at Case Western University in   last week The resolution of this litigation will alter the calculus for many political and private actors considering how to respond to the PPACA and the statute contains various deadlines and time frames that may become harder to navigate the longer this litigation drags on The White House press office released a statement that said in part This lawsuit reflects just another partisan attempt to undermine the Affordable Care Act and to strip millions of American families of tax credits that Congress intended for them to have
