Do you ever feel like your job is killing you If you work long hours your job might be giving you diabetes Health experts have noticed for years that people who spend a lot of time at work are more likely to have various types of health problems including stress cardiovascular disease and depression But efforts to find a direct link between work hours and Type  diabetes have been mixed For instance a study of manual laborers in Japan found that those who worked more than  hours a week had a higher risk of diabetes while Japanese office workers who logged more than  hours a week did not To get to the bottom of this an international team of researchers scoured the medical literature and found reliable data on  adults from the United States Europe Australia and Japan Many of them were hard workers Â  depending on the study they were involved in up to  of them worked long hours generally defined as more than  hours per week A total of  of these men and women were diagnosed with Type  diabetes during the time they were tracked by researchers But not everyone had the same risk of getting that diagnosis Compared with people who worked  to  hours per week those who worked at least  hours per week were  more likely to develop the metabolic disorder in which high blood sugar can lead to serious problems like stroke kidney failure or blindness When the researchers accounted for workers socioeconomic status the results were more striking For those with high incomes there was no link between hours worked and diabetes risk The results for people in the middleincome territory were weak but suggested a link between hours worked and diabetes risk However for those with low incomes working long hours was associated with a  increased risk of developing diabetes After the researchers adjusted for other demographic factors the risk dropped slightly to  The researchers noted that the link held up for lowincome workers regardless of which study they were in how they were diagnosed fasting glucose test glucose tolerance test or selfreporting or their age gender or obesity status The   were published online Thursday by the journal Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology The study couldnt determine why longer hours would make some people more prone to Type  diabetes but the researchers offered some possible explanations For instance people who spend more time at their jobs may have less time to exercise take part in stressreducing social activities or sleep Other research has shown that sleepdeprivation and fragmented sleep can interfere with the bodys ability to make and use insulin which leads to high blood sugar On the other hand highincome workers who put in long hours have more resources to help them deal with the stresses caused by having less free time  paying for child care household help and prepared foods to name a few examples But if there were anything inherently dangerous about a long work week then highincome workers should see their risk of diabetes increase too at least a little In a   that accompanies the study a pair of Harvard researchers wrote that its too early to rule out the idea that working long hours per se is toxic The influence of sleep is probably important the Harvard researchers added Perhaps people who work long hours in wellpaid jobs have more predictable schedules than people who work in lowerpaying jobs and wind up working overtime
