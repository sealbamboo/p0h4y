Greg LeMond Americas original superstar cyclist is back After years of being shunned by the cycling world for asserting in  that Lance Armstrong was using performanceenhancing drugs the nowvindicated threetime Tor de France winner   and  is on a roll He hosts two Tourrelated telecasts founded and sold LeMond Fitness maker of several topranked home exercise products is rebuilding his longshuttered brand of highend road mountain and adventure bikes and has cowritten The Science of Fitness with biologist Mark Hom The book focuses on mitochondria the tiny motors in each cell that power muscular movement The topic is close to LeMonds heart as he was forced to retire early because his own mitochondria was and still is being poisoned by  lead pellets that were embedded in his heart lining and liver during a  hunting accident He had some removed the remaining pellets are in risky spots such as in his heart lining Today the yearold father of three plays tennis flyfishes lifts weights and limits his intense riding and crosscountry skiing to about  minutes at a time to minimize toxic lead shedding Theres been a lot of smoke and mirrors in cycling the last  years a lot of junk science And my problem is that I know the science I knew that Armstrongs aerobic capacity  your VO max your engine  was  below that of the average pro  To explain how he could consistently win people would say that Lance was more mechanically efficient than everyone else because of his new training secrets I found this insulting to other athletes Are you telling me that Lance made up a  to  aerobic deficit on mechanical efficiency in a sport that has been around for a hundred years The human body doesnt change Suddenly he discovers this new revolutionary technique Come on There are no secrets Im just happy its over  You know psychological stress is many times worse than physical stress Posttraumatic stress syndrome is when youre highly under stress for more than  or  days and I went through quite a few years of that It affects your health pretty dramatically Id get worn out fatigued Everything gets you  and you cant just hypercompensate through exercise And as much as Id love to I cant just hop on the bike and ride the stress away for four or five hours anyway That is physiologically bad for me I can but whenever I do the lead pellets in my body leak essentially poisoning me If I ride hard they leak more If I ride hard for over an hour way more so my doctors warned me to keep it to an hour I keep doing research to figure out how to get the lead out after activity my wife has got me taking pectin because a Russian study finds that it binds to lead Ive read about some toxinremoving nanotechnology out of the Bay Area that sounds hopeful Ironically when I broke my neck in a car accident last year and was laying in bed for three months my blood was cleaner than it has been since I retired in  In an hour Ill do five six seven second sprints Very specifically  seconds builds your endurance and power and has lots of hormonal system benefits Remember that sprints work for everybody Theyre hard but over fast and effective in every aerobic activity  cycling running swimming crosscountry skiing Just  minutes a day of second sprints puts much greater demands on your body than a long slow hour I think cycling is the ideal workout for most because it has the addictive inertia rhythm fun social interaction that makes it very doable for outofshape people to get their heart rates up whereas running hard takes a pretty physically fit person On a bike just find a hill nearby and climb it fast or input more resistance on your exercise bike and go for it Intensity changes your hormones your insulin resistance your mitochondria raising their density and efficiency upgrading your muscle power within a couple days And it has a huge effect on brain function People dont know this but all aerobic exercise actually makes you smarter more organized and more successful Well I know it personally I was an energypacked kid I had ADD attention deficit disorder  I was bouncing off the walls School was painful for me My fifthgrade teacher started crying when I saw her  years later when I had become a champion cyclist She said I thought youd end up in prison  and wasnt joking Exercise and cycling saved my life Exercise is great for kids  helps them focus calm down do better in school stay healthy Its why Im such a big advocate of restoring PE classes to schools across the country
