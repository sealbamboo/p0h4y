Hospitals in the UK have a fraction of the number of doctors on site at weekends as they do during the week figures obtained by the BBC suggest On average doctor staffing levels at weekends were  of those in the week Medical director of NHS England Prof Sir Bruce Keogh said changes to weekend services were needed with urgency NHS acute trusts were asked by BBC Radio s You and Yours programme for figures for Wednesday  December  and the weekend of  and  December The figures also showed a difference in terms of the grades of doctors on duty  Hospitals in England had an average of  consultants on a Wednesday compared to just over eight in the afternoon at the weekend One mediumsized hospital St Marys on the Isle of Wight had  consultants in the building during the week but none on a weekend afternoon The hospital said it had  consultants on call who could come in  The NHS published its last figures about patient mortality in   The survey of  million admissions showed that a patient is  more likely to die if admitted on a Saturday and  more likely to die if admitted on a Sunday than during the week  The NHS also reports on patient outcomes  Overall patients stay longer in hospital when they are admitted at weekends  They wait longer for a diagnosis and part of the reason for that is that there are not the senior doctors around in the departments that do the blood tests Xrays and scans Prof Sir Bruce Keogh has set out a point plan to achieve hour seven day a week staffing in hospitals He wants to see it in place by  He told You and Yours Its a bold plan because the NHS like other parts of society has not functioned the same at the weekend as it has in the week  but we need to do it with urgency  The rest of society has moved on all other service industries are starting to address how they provide more routine services at the weekend and its time we did so in health But Sir Richard Thompson of the Royal College of Physicians thinks it will take longer  I think were heading in the right direction but I think the plan is optimistic Without getting a large extra number of staff of all grades and all types I cannot see how we can get a full equal service on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday According to the research the Royal Liverpool Hospital has  of the level of staffing for doctors at the weekend compared to a Wednesday afternoon  Sharon Duffy has been a patient on the haematology ward at the hospital for six weeks  Its quiet at the weekend but everything is still available There is no anxiety because theres always a button to press There is just less staff  if anything its a bit of a rest The hospitals medical director Dr Peter Williams said that while its mortality rates do not change at the weekend the whole system needs to be improved Weve got to change the balance of the service between the junior doctors and the senior doctors  There are not enough trainees in the system to deliver the kind of seven day service that we would all like to see  Another sticking point for Dr Williams is the attitude of staff There may be some reluctance It becomes more difficult when you tell people they will be on call  on site Thats a big step  Some of our specialties have already done it but if Im going out to consultants in their late s and s and saying I know youve been on your contract for  years but I would now like you to be up all night on a Saturday or Sunday thats a big ask  Dean Royles chief executive of NHS Employers said changes were needed to consultant doctors contracts to make working at weekends more cost effective for the NHS However Dr Mark Porter chairman of the British Medical Association said structural change was needed across the service He stressed that the NHS worked to safety standards formulated by the medical Royal Colleges The BBC investigation sent Freedom of Information requests to all of the NHS acute trusts in the UK and received full responses from more than half of them
