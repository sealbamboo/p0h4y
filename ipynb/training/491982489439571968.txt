The famously grueling cycling race involves about  miles of furious pedaling huge mountain climbs and downhill sprints at plus miles per hour But the Tour de France now in its final days is also an epic marathon of eating The cyclists now competing in the   rendition of the race are burning an average of  calories per hour while riding and to keep their weight up and maintain their health through the threeweek event they must eat  to  calories every day The almost nonstop eating begins with juice as soon as the athletes wake according to Nigel Mitchell head of nutrition for   After joining their teammates in the hotel dining room they devour a massive buffetstyle breakfast heavy on carbs and sugar and moderate in fiber which can add unwanted bulk to the cyclists bellies When theyve finished this matinal meal they pile into a bus and keep eating taking in hundreds more calories in energy drinks and bars before arriving at the starting line Once they begin pedaling team support vehicles shadow the riders and assistants hand them   homemade rice cakes and Panini sandwiches Still some of the cyclists actually shed pounds during the Tour Keeping up with the energy demands of the race is a balancing act Mitchell says  calories is about as much energy as an athlete can absorb in one hour and yet the cyclists are burning up to  calories an hour  as some of them surely did during Tuesdays arduous mile ride through the Pyrenees Its the first of three days in the mountain range and one of the hardest days in   The body uses fat stores while the guys are riding Mitchell says By the end of the days ride the cyclists have built up a major calorie deficit Back on the bus they eat boiled potatoes rice canned tuna and capsules of fish oil as theyre driven to the next hotel When they arrive they dig into a calorie dinner always heavy in meat fish and other sources of protein  important for helping repair and rebuild the athletes stressed muscles  followed by a fruitbased dessert Before bed the cyclists eat a bowl of cereal or yogurt A few hours sleep is the only break they get from this demanding schedule of eating Mitchell says Calories should come from the right mix of sources fat protein carbs and on good days a little alcohol Traditionally if you win a stage you have a bottle of Champagne Mitchell says Chefs face challenges in cooking for cycling teams as there may be competitors from multiple nations each with their own preferences Mitchell says this years Team Sky cyclists hail from South America North America and Europe This year there havent been any major disagreements over food he says Sports physiologist Allen Lim has worked with Tour de France cyclists since  and makes naturalingredient sports drinks at his company   He says a good chef knows each riders tastes what foods they like what they hate and what they wont eat for health or ethical reasons Sometimes Lim says the dietary choices of the riders prove too challenging  or annoying  for a teams chef In  when Lim was traveling with the   team all the cyclists decided they would ride the race on a glutenfree diet The chef  a Frenchman  wasnt happy about this He was angry that the guys wouldnt eat pasta or bread Lim recalls The Garmin team now works with chef Sean Fowler an American who lives in Spain Fowler has been more willing to experiment with fusion recipes and some glutenfree items Lim says Fowler   his culinary wins on the Tour like glutenfree toast with salmon caviar baked salmon with avocado mousse glutenfree coconut cake with sheeps milk yogurt and baked curry with marinated turkey skewers and prunes While nutritionists like Mitchell accompany the teams to help direct meal prep and make sure all essential vitamins minerals fatty acids and other nutrients are served in adequate proportions Lim says many teams have also hired chefs Unless the cyclists love what theyre eating unless they can celebrate dining with one another and enjoy what theyre eating then they just wont perform Lim says If the food is bad they wont ride well Staying hydrated is important too Lim says there was once a prevailing element of machismo among some professional cyclists who abstained from drinking water as long as possible during a hard ride Now theyve wised up he says and may drink well over two gallons of water and hydrating energy drinks per day When nature calls during the race they make a gentlemens agreement to pull over all at once drain their bladders and get back on the bikes when all are finished Lim explains But there is one thing just as important as eating Lim says showering When these guys are done each day theyre so freaking dirty he says They have road dirt all over them Before eating they need to wash off Showers he says are provided at each teams finish line station If they dont shower right away it can make them very susceptible to getting sick
