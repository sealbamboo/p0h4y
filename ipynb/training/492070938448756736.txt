Trying to maintain their weight helped lowincome overweight African American women stave off depression researchers reported The researchers looked at the confluence of two debilitating health issues Depression is among the most common and disabling mental health conditions in the United States and nearly  of African American women will experience major depression in their lifetimes Additionally depressed African American adults are less likely to get treatment for depression than are white people Obesity is also disproportionately prevalent among African American women At the start of the study about  of the  participants reported symptoms of moderate to severe depression Among the group in the weight management program that number fell to about  after a year and after  months Among the control group there was no change This equates to an almost  reduction in the proportion of intervention participants with moderate to severe depression the Duke University researchers wrote in the study published July  in the American Journal of Public Health It is exciting that we improved depression among a population that is severely socioeconomically disadvantaged and has limited access to depression treatment the lead author Dori Steinberg a research scholar with the Duke Digital Health Science Center said in a statement Half the women drawn from community health centers in North Carolina were enrolled in a weight management program that included counseling education health goalsetting and selfmonitoring That program called the Shape Program included no mention of mood The other women received the usual care which included newsletters covering various health issues and a brochure on healthy weights The women were ages  to  with a body mass index  a measure of weight compared with height  that put them in the overweight to obese category Eight percent of them had less than a college degree and most were employed though nearly threequarters reported an annual income below  After a year  of the women in the weightgain prevention program were at or below their beginning weight compared with  of the group of women who got the usual care The results were similar at  months At that point  of the women in the usual care group and nine in the intervention group reported taking a depression medication Depression was assessed using a standard questionnaire and the womens heights and weights were taken by trained staff Other studies have shown that African American women have a more difficult time losing weight than women in other groups its not clear why the researchers said But Steinberg said differences in norms about weight and physical activity as well as other stresses may be partly at the heart of it These higher occurrences may also have an impact on psychosocial outcomes such as depression Steinberg said So interventions that focus on behavioral weight control may present a useful opportunity to address both obesity and depression
