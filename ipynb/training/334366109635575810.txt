of   with disfiguring results But today the pendulum has swung the other way A new generation of women want doctors to take a more aggressive approach and more and more are asking that even healthy breasts be removed to ward off cancer before it can strike Researchers estimate that as many as  percent of women with     a year  opt to have both breasts removed up from less than  percent in the late s Notably it appears that the vast majority of these women have never received genetic testing or counseling and are basing the decision on exaggerated fears about their risk of recurrence In addition doctors say an increasing number of women who have never had a cancer diagnosis are demanding mastectomies based on genetic risk Cancer databases dont track these women so their numbers are unknown We are confronting almost an epidemic of prophylactic   said Dr Isabelle Bedrosian a surgical oncologist at M D Anderson Cancer Center in Houston I think the medical community has taken notice We dont have data that say oncologically this is a necessity so why are women making this choice One reason may be the neverending awareness campaigns that have left many women in perpetual fear of the disease Improvements in breast reconstruction may also be driving the trend along with celebrities who go public with their decision to undergo preventive mastectomy This month Allyn Rose a yearold Miss America contestant from Washington DC made headlines when she announced plans to have both her healthy breasts removed after the pageant both her mother and her grandmother died from breast cancer The television personality Giuliana Rancic  and the actress Christina Applegate  also talked publicly about having double mastectomies after diagnoses of earlystage breast cancer Youre not going to find other organs that people cut out of their bodies because theyre worried about disease said the medical historian   author of    Because breast cancer is a disease that is so emotionally charged and gets so much attention I think at times women feel almost obligated to be as proactive as possible  thats the culture of breast cancer Most of the data on prophylactic mastectomy come from the University of Minnesota where researchers tracked contralateral mastectomy trends removing a healthy breast alongside one with cancer from  to  Dr Todd M Tuttle chief of surgical oncology said double mastectomy rates more than doubled during that period and the rise showed no signs of slowing From those trends as well as anecdotal reports Dr Tuttle estimates that at least  percent of women who receive a breast cancer diagnosis will have the second healthy breast removed Its younger women who are doing it he said The risk that a woman with breast cancer will develop cancer in the other breast is about  percent over  years Dr Tuttle said Yet a   found that women estimated their risk to be more than  percent I think there are women who markedly overestimate their risk of getting cancer he said Most experts agree that double mastectomy is a reasonable option for women who have a strong genetic risk and have tested positive for a breast cancer gene That was the case with Allison Gilbert  a writer in Westchester County who discovered her genetic risk after her grandmother died of breast cancer and her mother died of   Even so she delayed the decision to get prophylactic mastectomy until her aunt died from an aggressive breast cancer In August she had a double mastectomy She had her ovaries removed earlier I feel the women in my family didnt have a way to avoid their fate said Ms Gilbert author of the  book   about how losing a parent influences ones own style of parenting Here I was given an incredible opportunity to know what I have and to do something about it and God willing be around for my kids longer Even so she said her decisions were not made lightly The double mastectomy and reconstruction required an initial  hour surgery and an intense recovery She got genetic counseling joined support groups and researched her options But doctors say many women are not making such informed decisions Last month   on a study of more than  women who had breast cancer Four years after their diagnosis  percent were considering removing their healthy breast and  percent had already done so Notably most of the women who had a double mastectomy were not at high risk for a cancer recurrence In fact studies suggest that most women who have double mastectomies never seek genetic testing or counseling Breast cancer becomes very emotional for people and they view a breast differently than an arm or a required body part that you use every day said Sarah T Hawley an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan Women feel like its a body part over which they totally have a choice and they say I want to put this behind me  I dont want to worry about it anymoreÂ
