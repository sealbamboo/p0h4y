Our hope is that if we could identify patients who are developing the disease early it would give us a much better opportunity to intervene with treatments and its much more likely for those treatments to be effective says Dr Keith Black chairman of neurosurgery at CedarsSinai Medical Center But while early diagnosis leads to early intervention some news out of the  Alzheimers Association International Conference is troubling An expert panel found  online tests for Alzheimers disease scored poorly on scales of overall scientific validity reliability and ethical factors Selfdiagnosis behavior  is increasingly popular online and freely accessible quizzes that call themselves tests for Alzheimers are available on the Internet says Julie Robillard who presented the data this week in Boston However little is known about the scientific validity and reliability of these offerings and ethicsrelated factors including research and commercial conflict of interest confidentiality and consent Frankly Robillard adds what we found online was distressing and potentially harmful Robillard and her colleagues at the University of British Columbia found that unique monthly visitors for the parent sites hosting the online tests reached as high as  million  At the same conference another study concluded that the misdiagnosis of Alzheimers disease in Medicare patients who actually have vascular dementia or Parkinsons disease leads to substantial excess costs of care The study conducted by Analysis Group Inc and Eli Lilly and Co found the costs of erroneous care to be in excess of  a year per patient  The silver lining Those excess costs decline and eventually dissipate following a correct diagnosis Recent developments in technology have greatly improved our ability to properly diagnose patients with cognitive impairment said Analysis Groups Noam Kirson Our results suggest that there are economic benefits to properly diagnosing  as early as possible  the cause of the cognitive impairment If you suspect a family member or friend is developing Alzheimers take a look at these  warning signs of Alzheimers Disease put together by the Alzheimers Association  Memory changes that disrupt daily life  Challenges in planning or solving problems  Difficulty completing familiar tasks at home at work or at leisure  Confusion with time or place  Trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships  New problems with words in speaking or writing  Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps  Decreased or poor judgment  Withdrawal from work or social activities  Changes in mood and personality Rather than diagnose Alzheimers disease at home head to your doctors office You can also find more information at   or by calling the Alzheimers Associations hour hotline at   The importance of early detection and early intervention cant be stressed strongly enough It could mean added years of lucidity and life for you or someone you love
