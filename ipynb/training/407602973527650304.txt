Over the weekend I heard from a New York Times picture editor SooJeong Kang who was involved in the publication of a photograph that generated a great deal of discussion when it appeared on   PDF last Wednesday Ms Kang assigned the photo shoot that resulted in that muchdiscussed image of an Israeli womans upper torso including incision scars a portion of her areola and her Star of David tattoo It did not show her face I   that day after hearing from readers who were upset by it and who found it offensive or insensitive It also generated a great deal of discussion within The Timess newsroom with varied points of view The post brought plenty of response with most of the reader comments defending the photo choice  Ms Kang offered me this statement from the unnamed yearold woman in the photograph written after she became aware of media and reader reaction I thought it was interesting enough to share
