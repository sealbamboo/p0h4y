GPs with a poor record in spotting signs of cancer could be publicly named under new government plans Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt wants to expose doctors whose failure to spot cancer may delay sending patients for potentially lifesaving scans Labour called the idea desperate and accused Mr Hunt of attacking doctors The Royal College of GPs said it would be a crude system and one that could lead to GPs sending people to specialists indiscriminately It warned this could result in flooding hospitals with healthy people The move is part of the health secretarys plans to make the NHS more transparent Ranking GP surgeries on how quickly they spot cases of cancer and refer patients for treatment is among proposals being considered  The information could eventually be published on the NHS website This follows a survey for the NHS last year which suggested that more than a quarter of people eventually diagnosed with cancer had seen their GP at least three times before being sent to a specialist We need to do much better the health secretary    Cancer diagnosis levels around the country vary significantly and we must do much more to improve both the level of diagnosis and to bring those GP practices with poor referral rates up to the standards of the best Doctors found to be missing too many cases of cancer or with patients who are forced to make repeated visits before being referred for tests would be marked with a red flag Susan has a sister with terminal cancer  She told the BBC My sister was first told she had a prolapsed womb then piles  By the time she was seen by an oncologist eight months had elapsed  She has terminal squamous cell anal cancer  completely curable if caught early enough   She is  and now has a few months to live  One of the classic mistakes the GP made was to diagnose anal bleeding as piles It wasnt  it was the tumour  This doctor has condemned my sister to a year so far of terrible suffering and a death which is too dreadful to contemplate when she could have been completely cured  Prognosis is something like  complete cure if treated early Susan believes her sisters GP should be named and shamed but thinks each case should be considered on an individual basis  As a retired teacher I know what being continually maligned judged overlooked and overloaded can do to morale and performance she added  Those found with quick referral times for patients would be given a green rating Shadow health minister Jamie Reed said the government would not take responsibility for problems it had created in the NHS David Cameron wasted billions on a reorganisation nobody wanted and left cancer patients waiting longer for tests and treatment He should be ashamed of his own record  not attacking doctors he said This government has thrown away progress made on cancer care It is proof of why the Tories cant be trusted with the NHS Dr Chaand Nagpaul chair of the British Medical Association general practitioners committee said to name and shame doctors would not help patients  He said it was important to understand why there were delays in making referrals and to raise public awareness about the signs and symptoms of cancer We need to look at the whole system and if you simply name and shame GPs the tendency would be for us to refer everyone he told the BBC And that can be a disadvantage because if we clog up hospital outpatient clinics well get patients who need to see their specialist actually having to wait longer  Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston a former GP who chairs the Commons health select committee said the government needed to be careful not to wrongly label people as poor doctors  She too warned there was a danger of automatically referring everyone to a specialist and creating impossibly long waiting lists which could harm those needing to be seen urgently Dr Wollaston added that she could not see how GPs could maintain current levels of service amid rising demand without a funding injection The NHS budget has been protected in line with background inflation but that does not keep pace with inflation in health costs from rising demand and demographic changes she said I dont want to see any reduction in services I would like to see further improvements and that will require an increase in funding Dr Wollaston joined Conservative former health secretary Stephen Dorrell and Lib Dem former health minister Paul Burstow in calling for increased funding for the NHS Mr Burstow warned that the NHS was in danger of collapse within five years without extra spending He said the health service needed an extra bn over that period in order to function properly Mr Dorrell said he would be ashamed if the government failed to increase NHS funding at a time when the economy was growing I am in favour of the government not denying what  years of history tells us is true which is that every time a society gets richer it spends a rising share of its income on looking after the sick and the vulnerable
