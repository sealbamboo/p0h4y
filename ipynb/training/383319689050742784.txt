Millions of Americans have seen the fictional world of meth use and production in AMCs   but journalist   has spent a lot of time in the real world of meth In a   in   Engle looks at the explosion in the number of meth addicts who cook their own drugs with ingredients available in drug stores and supermarkets Meth production is dangerous for the cookers and corrosive to their communities Engle says law enforcements efforts to curb the problem by limiting access to a key ingredient  the decongestant pseudoephedrine  have been opposed and largely thwarted by big pharmaceutical companies Engle is based in Montreal and has written about drug policy for a number of publications He now covers the issue for the online news site   His piece in   called   was supported by the   at the Nation Institute Engle tells  s Dave Davies about how the shake and bake method of cooking has changed meth production and the discovery that pharmaceutical companies were lobbying against state restrictions on the sale of pseudoephedrine Its remarkably easy to make meth this way  The one thing you have to have is pseudoephedrine which is the decongestant that is easily obtained in cold and allergy medicines You crush it up and add a handful of other chemicals you shake it together and in a separate bottle using other overthecounter products you create a gas and basically that crystallizes the solution youve made  It has really put meth production in the hands of meth addicts So while I said its easy it doesnt mean its without its tremendous risks If all goes well  and that is to say if theres no fire or explosion because were talking about highly volatile chemical reactions contained in nothing but a pop bottle If that doesnt blow up or catch fire it still produces toxic gases and byproduct which goes into the carpet goes into the paint People find meth labs in hotel rooms they found one in a WalMart bathroom in cars So wherever these meth labs are found you have these bad gases and byproduct So in a house where there are young kids they crawl around on the carpet they are breathing this stuff in From that stem a whole bunch of problems for law enforcement for foster care services for the whole community in effect   Its a highly risky process and often you have meth cooks who havent slept in days so they shouldnt be operating a vehicle let alone engaging in volatile chemical experiments And were seeing it play out in Kentucky I went to one of two hospital burn units in the state and burn victims from meth accidents have tripled in the past few years Their injuries are usually much worse than the average burn victim Theyve got both chemical and thermal burns theyre often abusing prescription painkillers which makes their pain management much more complicated None of them are insured Shake and bake is concentrated in some of the poorest counties in the US So you have counties with relatively few resources and theyre just completely overwhelmed with having to clean up meth lab after meth lab  The highest numbers of meth labs for the past five six years are clustered in the Midwest and also the Southeast of the US So consistently Missouri Indiana Tennessee and Kentucky are in the top four Theres a great book called   by Nick Reding which looks at the impact of meth in Iowa And he talks about how meth has followed the hollowing out of rural America so places where people are used to working hard for a living where a lot of union jobs have left where people have to work really hard to get by Whats really interesting is speaking to meth addicts in Kentucky They talked about how in the early days of their use it actually made them superhuman it made them better employees if you will  You find it in places where people rely on their physical labor   In  Oregon successfully made pseudoephedrine a prescription drug and the number of meth labs in the state has fallen over  percent so folks all over the country looked up and took notice And so they said Look if it can work in Oregon why cant it work here We clearly cant arrest our way out of the problem And thats what happened in Kentucky back in    Over at the Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission which tracks lobbying spending a secretary looks at the filings for the month and this number jumps out at her and she sees that over  has been spent by an organization called Consumer Healthcare Products Association Shes never heard of this group before and in the span of three weeks theyve set a new lobbying spending record She looks into it it turns out CHPA is the trade association for makers of overthecounter medicines and dietary supplements representing companies like Johnson  Johnson Pfizer and so on So what it turns out has happened is that they have not only hired one of the states top lobbyists but the bulk of that money has been spent on producing robocalls So these recorded messages that go out to thousands of homes in Kentucky with the pharmaceutical industrys slant on the issue saying The government wants to take your cold and allergy medicine away Press  and well put you through to your legislator  It has happened all over the country Since   states have tried to follow Oregons lead and  have failed And this is the playbook of CHPA They blanket the state with these robocalls they hire the top PR and lobbying firms and they have a remarkable track record Its important to say that the degree to which they deploy these resources depends on the state In my reporting the most aggressive and highestspending campaigns have been states with the highest number of meth labs where presumably their chances of losing would be higher therefore requiring a greater effort
