It is a highly infectious virus that can kill up to  of the people who catch it causing terror among infected communities  MSF says  The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever which   refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding The virus is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo formerly Zaire where one of the first outbreaks occurred in   The World Health Organization says there are five different strains of the virus named after the areas where they originated Three of these have been associated with large outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in Africa Of Ebolas five subtypes the Zaire strain  the first to be identified  is considered the most deadly The WHO said   suggested that the outbreak there was this strain though that has not been confirmed  Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever weakness muscle pain headaches and a sore throat These symptoms can appear two to  days after infection The WHO says these nonspecific early symptoms can be mistaken for signs of diseases such as malaria typhoid fever meningitis or even the plague MSF says some patients may also develop a rash red eyes hiccups chest pains and difficulty breathing and swallowing The early symptoms progress to vomiting diarrhea impaired kidney and liver function and sometimes internal and external bleeding CNNs Dr Sanjay Gupta says that if a patient is going to die from Ebola he or she usually does so within about  days Ebola can only be definitively confirmed by five different laboratory tests There are no specific approved treatments for Ebola MSF says patients are isolated and then supported by health care workers This consists of hydrating the patient maintaining their oxygen status and blood pressure and treating them for any complicating infections it says Two American missionary workers infected with Ebola were given an experimental drug called ZMapp which   The drug developed by a San Diego firm had never been tried before on humans but it showed promise in small experiments on monkeys The Americans who received it have since been declared healthy and   in Atlanta ZMapp was also administered to three Liberian health care workers who contracted Ebola At first they showed very positive signs of recovery according to the Liberian Ministry of Health but   of the disease  An ethics panel convened by the WHO concluded it is ethical to give experimental drugs during an outbreak as large as this one but that doesnt mean it will happen Rolling out an untested drug during a massive outbreak would be very difficult according to MSF Experimental drugs are typically not massproduced and tracking the success of such a drug if used would require extra medical staff where resources are already scarce ZMapps maker says it has very few doses ready for patient use  There is currently no approved vaccination against Ebola  At least one potential Ebola vaccine has been tested in healthy human volunteers according to Thomas Geisbert a leading researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch And last week the   of another Ebola vaccine will start as early as September In March the US National Institutes of Health   to establish a collaboration between researchers from  institutions who were working to fight Ebola  Humans contract Ebola through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or the bodily fluids of infected humans like blood sweat and feces  MSF epidemiologist Kamiliny Kalahne said outbreaks usually spread in areas where hospitals have poor infection control and limited access to resources such as running water People who become sick with it almost always know how they got sick because they looked after someone in their family who was very sick  who had diarrhea vomiting and bleeding  or because they were health staff who had a lot of contact with a sick patient she said MSF says that while the virus is believed to be able to survive for some days in liquid outside an infected organism chlorine disinfection heat direct sunlight soaps and detergents can kill it This is not an airborne transmission said Dr Marty Cetron director of CDCs Division of Global Migration and Quarantine There needs to be direct contact frequently with body fluids or blood While the CDC acknowledges its possible a person infected with Ebola in West Africa could get on a plane and arrive in another country the chances of the virus spreading during the journey are low  Its very unlikely that they would be able to spread the disease to fellow passengers    The Ebola virus spreads through direct contact with the blood secretions or other body fluids of ill people and indirect contact  for example with needles and other things that may be contaminated with these fluids Travelers should take precautions by avoiding areas experiencing outbreaks and avoid contact with Ebola patients  It is highly unlikely that someone suffering such symptoms would feel well enough to travel  In the rare event that a person infected with the Ebola virus was unknowingly transported by air WHO advises that the risks to other passengers are low Nonetheless WHO does advise public health authorities to carry out contact tracing in such instances This means determining who had contact with the affected person  Not likely says Gupta  Ebola is not the great plague theres no question about that he explained The grim reality is that it often kills so quickly that people dont have time to spread it Its a myth that Ebola is the most dangerous disease that humans have ever encountered he added HIVAIDS for example certainly has killed more people and up until recently there was no treatment for that disease either Rabies something that you can get from animals as well if you develop symptoms youre very unlikely to survive With Ebola right now about seven out of  people are dying in Guinea but not everybody Doctors believe surviving Ebola leaves you immune to future infection Scientists have found that people who survive Ebola have antibodies in their blood that would provide protection against that strain of the virus in the future and possibly against other strains as well But as you can imagine they havent tested this theory by infecting survivors with the virus again CNNs Nima Elbagir who has been reporting on the outbreak in West Africa says those lucky enough to survive the disease frequently find that the stigma attached to Ebola means they are ostracized once they recover They find it very difficult to come back to their communities and be accepted because people just dont believe that they have been cured she explains Theres a lot of superstition a belief that Ebola is almost a curse and that makes it much more difficult to deal with The WHO says it is believed that fruit bats may be the natural host of the Ebola virus in Africa passing on the virus to other animals
