Which comes first the probiotics or the prebiotics Could prebiotics the food for the good bacteria known as   have more benefits than a dose of the microbes particularly for people with serious health problems like preemies Thats a question   a professor of nutrition at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign is trying to figure out When she tested fructooligosaccharide a prebiotic carbohydrate also known mercifully as FOS in baby pigs she found that it helped their small intestine grow and better digest and absorb nutrients When Tappenden tested probiotic bacteria they didnt show any benefit for the pigs Using probiotics actually had negative effects she told Shots Her work was   in the   Probiotics are marketed with abandon for ailments from colitis to eczema but theres   that they actually help Prebiotics such as FOS and inulin another carbohydrate are starting to be pushed with similar sales pitches Baby formula manufacturers have started adding prebiotics with  l for one touting its Natural Defense Dual Prebiotics Blend designed to help support your babys natural defenses Inulin and FOS are different versions of the same molecule that ferment in different places in the gut Inulin is found in foods like garlic and leeks The inulin added to processed foods is usually extracted from chicory root Its considered a soluble fiber since most of it doesnt get digested It can cause gas and bloating in some people Manufacturers are also adding inulin to products aimed at adults including juice yogurt and fiber bars Tappenden acknowledges that theres still a lot we dont know about the plusses and minuses of prebiotics but she thinks they have big potential for therapies If we can find a way to fortify the gut it would have tremendous benefits Other scientists are trying to figure out whether prebiotics could be used to treat infection by salmonella and other deadly foodborne microbes Although shes all for more fiber in a healthy diet Tappenden doesnt think people should be blithely stuffing themselves full of biotics be they pro or pre Consumers and doctors tend to think all probiotics and prebiotics are beneficial she says but its becoming clear that they have different effects And when it comes to gut microbes its not a onespeciesfitsall proposition We cant use them indiscriminately she says
