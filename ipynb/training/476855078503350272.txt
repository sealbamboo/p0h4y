Flu experts have made a mutant version of the  Spanish flu virus that killed tens of millions of people sparking a new debate over whether such work is too dangerous Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin says the experiments are important for helping scientists understand how new pandemics start and for designing better flu vaccines  Because avian influenza viruses in nature require only a few changes to adapt to humans and cause a pandemic it is important to understand the mechanisms involved in adaptation and identify the key mutations so we can be better prepared Kawaoka said in a statement Previous similar experiments by Kawaoka and other flu researchers raised such an outcry that the US government also asked all flu researchers to hold off on genetically changing flu viruses until ground rules could be agreed on The worry was that the virus could escape and accidentally cause a pandemic or worse that terrorists could somehow get hold of the work and use it to make a biological weapon The moratorium was lifted in  and researchers started their work again last year The risk exists in nature already and not doing the research is really putting us in danger Kawaoka   The worstcase scenario is the emergence of a novel avian influenza virus that exhibits high pathogenicity in human like highly pathogenic avian HN viruses and efficient transmissibility in humans like seasonal influenza viruses   in the journal Cell Host  Microbe HN has shown up again  it caused the socalled swine flu pandemic in  It wasnt nearly as deadly as other new flu viruses that cause pandemics probably because it was a mutated form that included bits and pieces of flu viruses that had been infecting people for decades But  worry experts HN has  in  countries killing  of them since  The   appeared a year ago in China infecting more than  people and killing more than  of them Flu viruses are very prone to mutation and experts say any of the various bird flus could evolve into a strain that infects people easily   that could kill millions of people To understand what this might look like Kawaokas team first searched a giant database of known bird flu viruses taken mostly from ducks to find those whose genetic elements most closely matched those seen in the  flu They found plenty Our study demonstrates the continued circulation of avian influenza viruses that possess  viruslike proteins and may acquire  viruslike properties they wrote They made a few genetic tweaks to create a version that easily passed in small airborne droplets to infect ferrets in different cages Ferrets are the animals that are most like humans when it comes to catching flu Dr Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard School of Public Health and Dr Alison Galvani of the Yale School of Public Health called for limits on such experiments last month Potential pandemic pathogen experimentation poses a significant risk to public health arguably the highest level of risk posed by any biomedical research in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Medicine
