In America when a woman goes to her gynecologist she is typically given a pelvic exam whether or not she has symptoms or concerns that might warrant one Thats one reason an estimated  million pelvic exams are performed annually in this country Now a growing number of experts are   This is not the case in other countries that get better results without doing routine pelvic exams   a gynecologist at Columbia University Medical Center said in an interview Im an American gynecologist and thats how we were trained It took many years for me to ask Why are we doing this  For most women Pap smears are now recommended just once every three to five years  and for some not at all No doubt many women would be delighted to skip the routine pelvic exam too which many find uncomfortable and embarrassing A woman undergoing the exam is bare below the waist She lies on the examining table on her back with her knees bent and legs spread apart her feet in stirrups and her buttocks near the end of the table The doctor inserts a lubricated gloved finger into her vagina and with the other hand presses down on her abdomen to check the shape and size of her uterus and ovaries Its called a bimanual exam Dr Westhoff is among an increasing number of experts now challenging the value of this timehonored practice which is done as a matter of course when women come in for routine gynecological checkups or Pap smears These experts say that for women who are well a routine bimanual exam is not supported by medical evidence increases the costs of medical care and discourages some women especially adolescents from seeking needed care Moreover the exam sometimes reveals benign conditions that lead to followup procedures including surgery that do not improve a womans health but instead cause anxiety lost time from work potential complications and unnecessary costs The number of women who follow this unfortunate path each year is unknown but is likely sizable given the sheer number of pelvic examinations performed each year in the United States     in December  In my experience as a practicing gynecologist I frequently have had to take patients into the operating room because I found an enlargement during a bimanual pelvic exam Dr Sawaya a professor of obstetrics at the University of California San Francisco said in an interview I then follow up with a sonogram which shows a mass but I cant tell what the mass is without surgical exploration Yet nearly always its benign Dr Sawaya says its time to change this practice in which doctors put patients in a perilous situation and then act like theyre rescuing them He admits that his position wont win any popularity contests but Im trying to do whats right for patients Dr Westhoff and colleagues   Frequent routine bimanual examinations may partly explain why US rates of ovarian cystectomy and  are more than twice as high as rates in European countries where the use of the pelvic examination is limited to symptomatic women She and others say that the justifications gynecologists typically offer for doing the pelvic exam  screening for a sexually transmitted infection and   early detection of   and evaluating a woman for hormonal    either do not require a bimanual exam or are not supported by research In a multicenter trial supported by the National Cancer Institute for instance   alone The test sometimes did produce suspicious findings that resulted in further procedures The pelvic examination is not an effective screening tool for ovarian cancer Ms Analia Stormo a researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and colleagues   Yet Ms Stormo also found that almost  percent of obstetriciangynecologists reported believing that a pelvic examination is an effective means of screening for ovarian cancer To screen for sexually transmitted   and   tests done on a urine sample or vaginal swab obtained by the patient have numerous advantages over the pelvic exam Ms Stormo and colleagues noted Although a pelvic exam has been traditionally coupled with prescriptions for contraception both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the World Health Organization have said that hormonal contraceptives like the   pill can be prescribed without first doing a pelvic exam Whenever doctors are doing things by rote we have to rethink whether what theyre doing is really helpful Dr Sawaya said Dr Westhoff concurs We should limit the wellwoman checkup to proven procedures That is likely to be an uphill battle Recent surveys by Dr Sawaya and colleagues among others have shown that most gynecologists in the United States consider the routine bimanual exam of internal reproductive organs an important part of a wellwoman visit The practice is endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists which nonetheless admits that medical evidence to justify it is lacking In the latest study published online in November in the colleges journal Jillian T Henderson an assistant professor of obstetrics at the University of California San Francisco Dr Sawaya and colleagues examined the circumstances under which a national sample of obstetriciangynecologists   The doctors were presented four vignettes about healthy patients ages    and  who come for a routine health visit Nearly all  doctors who took the survey said they would conduct bimanual pelvic examinations in routine visits with asymptomatic women across the life span even in a yearold woman described as having no ovaries uterus or cervix Most of the clinicians surveyed said the exam was important to identify benign   even though the value of this finding in women lacking symptoms is unclear the team reported Most clinicians also maintained that the pelvic exam was important to reassure patients of their health How important is this exam to a doctors income Slightly more than half of those surveyed ranked ensuring adequate compensation as very important or moderately important One of the most vexing problems in medicine today is the fact that doctors get paid only for performing procedures not for the time they spend talking with patients to discuss issues of possible medical importance The next time you see your gynecologist for a routine checkup ask if a pelvic exam is planned and if so what the doctor expects it to accomplish
