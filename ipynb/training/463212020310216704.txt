Since  more than  million cases of childhood disease in the US have been prevented through vaccination programs Yet new findings show that when an epidemic is in full swing and serious illness could be averted immunization rates do not increase Researchers compared rates of infant immunization during an outbreak of whooping cough also called pertussis in the state of Washington in  Despite efforts by public health officials encouraging vaccination the researchers found no difference in vaccination rates before and during the epidemic among the  total infants included in the study to be presented Monday at the Pediatric Academic Societies annual meeting in Vancouver BC Pertussis which takes a hard toll on infants is a highly contagious disease marked by uncontrollable often violent coughing Immunization is achieved with a combination shot called DtaP which protects against diphtheria tetanus and pertussis The vaccine is given in several doses with the first dose at two months of age The percentage of infants who were uptodate with a pertussiscontaining vaccine was  percent preoutbreak and during the outbreak  of infants were immunized a  percent difference which is not statistically significant explains lead researcher Dr Elizabeth R Wolf the Ruth L Kirschstein National Research Service Award Fellow in General Academic Pediatrics at University of Washington Seattle Childrens Research Institute Vaccination rates in the US are still below public health goals and we dont fully understand what improves vaccine acceptance she says although conventional wisdom would state when the when the risk of disease is high acceptance of a vaccine should increase especially if that vaccine has proven effective Doctors arent sure why the vaccination rate did not increase although they have their suspicions One possible explanation is that parents fear of adverse events still outweighed the fear of disease even in the face of an epidemic Wolf says And although DTaP is a wellestablished vaccine with very few side effects it is possible that parents may have generalized concerns about vaccine safety
