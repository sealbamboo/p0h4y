  It may sound like something out of a comic book but villainous drugresistant   known to many as superbugs may have finally met their match  detoxifying robots the size of washing machines Manufactured by Bioquell Inc of Horsham Pa the robotic devices are currently in use in  hospitals throughout the country Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore have been studying the machines which release disinfecting agents specifically hydrogen peroxide vapor  essentially bleach  into the air of patient rooms while simultaneously decontaminating the chemical to minimize exposure and health risks for patrons and employees   microbial organisms brought in by patients and spread among other patients that ultimately find permanent homes in hospital rooms The longer you stay the greater your risk of getting a hospitalacquired infection The vapor is expected to be highly effective at killing and preventing the spread of superbugs which are resistant to most standard drugs Hydrogen peroxide vapor as spread around patients rooms by these devices represents a major technological advance in preventing the spread of dangerous bacteria inside hospitals and especially from one patient occupant to the next even though sick patients were never in the same room at the same time senior epidemiologist at Hopkins and study leader   Such cleaning devices were first seen during the  war on SARS in Singapore and got more attention shortly thereafter in the United States as a potential response to anthrax threats For two and a half years Hopkins researchers tracked roughly  patients half of whom were admitted to vaporcleaned rooms Of the bacteria found in Hopkins hospital rooms in the course of the research the majority was on surfaces that had not undergone the vapor treatment Among the wards in the treated rooms Hopkins experienced a  percent reduction in patient infections and a  percent decrease in aggressive bacteria colonizations in patients according to the study published in   Our goal is to improve all hospital infection control practices including cleaning and disinfection as well as behavioral and environmental practices to the point where preventing the   also minimizes the chances of patients becoming infected and improves their chances of recovery said Dr Perl
