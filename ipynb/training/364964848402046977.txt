Over the past decade in study after study in animals and people exercise has been shown to improve the ability to learn and remember But the specifics of that process have remained hazy Is it better to exercise before you learn something new What about during And should the exercise be vigorous or gentle  Two new studies helpfully tackle those questions with each reaching the conclusion that the timing and intensity of even a single bout of exercise can definitely affect your ability to remember  though not always beneficially  To reach that conclusion scientists conducting the larger and more ambitious of the new studies   first recruited  healthy young women who were native German speakers and randomly divided them into three groups Each group wore headphones and listened for  minutes to lists of paired words one a common German noun and the other its Polish equivalent The women were asked to memorize the unfamiliar word But they heard the words under quite different circumstances One group listened after sitting quietly for  minutes A second group rode a stationary bicycle at a gentle pace for  minutes and then sat down and donned the headphones And the third group rode a bicycle at a mild intensity for  minutes while wearing the headphones and listening to the new words  Two days later the women completed tests of their new vocabulary Everyone could recall some new words But the women who had gently ridden a bicycle while hearing the new words  who had exercised lightly during the process of creating new memories performed best They had the most robust recall of the new information significantly better than the group that had sat quietly and better than the group that had exercised before learning Those women performed only slightly better than the women who had not exercised at all That result contrasts tellingly with the findings of another new study of memory formation and exercise   of the American College of Sports Medicine in Indianapolis During this study  female collegians read a dense chapter from a college textbook on two occasions once while sitting quietly and on a separate day while exercising vigorously on an elliptical machine for  minutes Immediately after each session the students were tested on the material theyd just read They were then retested the next day  In this study exercise did not help the womens memories at least in the short term Their test scores were actually worse on the memory test conducted immediately after theyd exercised while reading compared with their scores taken soon after theyd been sitting quietly and studying  But the recall gap disappeared the next day when the women were retested At that point there were no differences in their scores whether theyd vigorously exercised while learning the new material or not  The message of these studies would seem to be that exercise timing and intensity interact to affect memory formation said Maren SchmidtKassow a professor at the Institute of Medical Psychology at Goethe University in Frankfurt Germany who led the study of gentle bicycling and memory Exercising during learning was in her study significantly more effective than exercising beforehand or not exercising at all But that beneficial impact probably depended on the mildness of the workout she said Lightintensity exercise will elicit low but noticeable levels of physiological arousal she said which in turn presumably help to prime the brain for the intake of new information and the encoding of that information into memories  If the exercise is more vigorous however it may overstimulate the body and brain she said monopolizing more of the brains attentional resources and leaving fewer for the creation of robust memories  This theory also helps to explain why in both studies memory recall was best a day or two after exercise by which time Dr SchmidtKassow said physiological arousal would have dissipated  Of course the mysteries of human memory remain by and large mysteries These new studies dont explain how for instance at a molecular level exercise affects the creation of individual memories It is likely that as part of the arousal process exercise stimulates the release of certain chemicals in the brain that affect memory formation Dr SchmidtKassow said But that idea has yet to be proven although she and many other scientists have applicable studies underway  For now though there is some practical takeaway from the current studies said Walter Bixby an associate professor at Elon University in North Carolina who oversaw the study of vigorous exercise and reading If you have an exam or other activity that involves memorizing and recalling information in a few hours you would probably be better off sitting quietly and studying he says However if the exam is the next day it wont hurt you to study while exercising And if your workout is gentle it could even help
