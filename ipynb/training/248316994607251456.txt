When scientists were looking for the first person to test a new superfast way of deciphering someones entire genetic blueprint they turned to   the guy who shared a   for discovering the structure of DNA They had to sequence someone so they got me he says     The results helped solve a mystery Watson had never understood why he had so much trouble controlling his blood pressure with beta blockers They put me to sleep he says The sequencing revealed that he had genes that made him more sensitive than most people to the drugs Now I can take them once a week he says so my blood pressure is better controlled now because of my genome This is one of the big benefits doctors expect to get from sequencing a whole new way to figure out which drugs work for their patients which dont which are safe and which are dangerous The doctors of the future when you start to prescribe a drug for which you have a genomic variation that would give you a side effect a flag will pop up and say Maybe you ought to you know consider another drug  says   a geneticist at Harvard Medical School Overall though Watson didnt end up learning all that much from his DNA Really nothing came up he says Skeptics say thats probably the case for most people at this point Sequencing gives you all  billion letters in your genome but scientists still know so little about how to interpret the data that most people will get little if any useful information out of it Thats one reason some scientists are sequencing themselves  to learn how to use this flood of information When   who chairs Stanford Universitys genetics department decided to become his own sequencing guinea pig the results were dramatic  and shocking Snyder learned he was at risk for Type  diabetes It didnt seem to make sense Snyder had no family history of diabetes he wasnt overweight There was no reason he should get the disease Still just to be on the safe side Snyder asked a colleague who specializes in diabetes to monitor his blood sugar levels At first she was skeptical The person doing the test said Theres no way youre at risk for Type  diabetes And I said Well I dont think so either But my genome says theres something interesting about my glucose metabolism so I think we should do this test  Snyder said So everyone was stunned when his blood sugar started rising  and then kept rising Within months it spiked They had literally watched him become a diabetic in real time So in fact my genome then did predict I was at risk for a disease which by following the various markers for that disease I did discover I did get Snyder said Snyder jumped on it He completely transformed his diet and kicked up his exercise After about six months his blood sugar gradually fell back to normal Thats the power of genomics is to help you catch things as early as possible So some people might say that actually my genome saved my life he said Stories like Snyders are feeding the buzz about sequencing and raising the prospect that it could one day become as routine as running through your family history with your doctor getting your blood pressure checked or testing your cholesterol I think its going to be part of the every day medicine sooner than most of us can actually imagine Green says For example genome sequencing could spot whos going to get breast cancer escape prostate cancer or need to watch their heart I think its one of the most exciting frontiers in science and society Green says But even people pushing those frontiers acknowledge there are limits to what people want to know about themselves When Watson was asked to volunteer for sequencing he had one condition I didnt want know its prediction for   says Watson who had watched his grandmother die from the incurable brain disease Theres nothing you can do to prevent it so why would you want to know Watson told the geneticists they could tell him and even publicize everything else that showed up in his genes except that That type of reaction isnt surprising says   a geneticist at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Your genome is a complex and not necessarily a real warm and fuzzy place he says Some people will want to know everything But a lot of people wont And what do we do if we stumble across something we werent looking for Plus Evans says there are plenty of chances for bad or misleading results that could end up doing more harm than good Medical tests have the power to help Evans notes But they also have the power to confuse In Watsons case the first interpretation of his genome indicated he should already be dead killed by a terminal illness It was a nasty condition I purposefully didnt think about it he says because I figured I would wonder why I wasnt sick Well it turns out I shouldnt have been Doctors quickly realized they had misread his genome Luckily Watson hadnt gotten too worked up about the mistake But there are also potential drawbacks to getting it right Snyder got a glimpse of that himself After sequencing revealed his high risk for diabetes his wife tried to increase his life insurance But because of that high risk the price shot through the roof So the bottom line is my life insurance  essentially became prohibitively expensive Snyder says Federal law bans health insurance companies and employers from penalizing people based on genetic information but the law doesnt apply to life insurance or longterm care insurance  leaving people like Snyder vulnerable to discrimination Despite that Snyder is convinced sequencing has more upsides than downsides And despite his false alarm Watson agrees I think many people would benefit from having their DNA told and that would more than compensate for the occasional mistakes he says Others arent so sure They wonder Is it far too soon for most people to venture into the dark corners of their DNA
