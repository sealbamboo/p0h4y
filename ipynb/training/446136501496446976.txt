Women are carrying the bigger burden of Alzheimers disease in the US according to a new report  making up not only most of the cases but paying more of the cost of caring for the growing population of people with the minddestroying illness The new report from the Alzheimers Association paints Alzheimers as a disease that disproportionately affects women both as patients and as caregivers It points out that women in their s are about twice as likely to develop Alzheimers over the rest of their lives as they are to develop breast cancer So women are at the epicenter of Alzheimers disease today not only by being most likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimers but also by being the caregiver most of the time said Maria Carrillo vice president of the advocacy group  more than  million Americans a number projected to  over the next  years A study published earlier this year suggested its a big killer taking down  Americans every year Three out of five of those living with Alzheimers are women the report finds The surprising statistic we pulled out of this report actually is that women over  have a one in six chance of developing Alzheimers disease in comparison to one out of  in men Carrillo said And that compares to a one in eight lifetime risk for developing breast cancer Even if they escape the disease themselves women often are burdened in another way by having to care for afflicted loved ones There are more than twice as many women as men taking care of someone with Alzheimers all day every day the report finds One of them is Angie Carrillo of San Jose Calif Carrillo  no relation to Maria Carrillo  was stunned when her thenyearold husband John Wallace was diagnosed with Alzheimers in  Things went downhill quickly and Wallace an accountant lost his job John and I had a whole plan And all of a sudden that was not going to happen Carrillo now  herself told NBC News He had longterm disability but in order to qualify for that you had to be disabled for  days So for  days we didnt have his income and not that we were living large but we were spending our paycheck They had to dip into retirement savings It was a scramble to keep my job go to all of these doctors appointments to verify that John indeed was disabled Carrillo added Its a pattern the Alzheimers Association sees across the country The report finds that  percent of women cut their working hours from fulltime to parttime while caring for someone with Alzheimers while just  percent of men did Federal survey data show that  percent of caregivers for patients with dementia are women The group analyzed data from federal health surveys the Census Bureau National Alliance for Caregiving AARP and its own poll of  people to show that  percent of women have taken a leave of absence to care for someone with Alzheimers and  percent of men have Eleven percent of women say they have quit their jobs while  percent of men have Ten percent of women say theyve lost job benefits because of time taken to care for an Alzheimers patient And at the same time theyve often lost income from a disabled spouse Were still dipping into our retirement funds Carrillo said Someone told me You need to go talk to a good CPA and I said I have a good CPA Unfortunately he has dementia Carrillo said The disease also hits family life including grandchildren We were the family hub Carrillo remembers All of the birthdays happened here all of the holidays  we had six grandchildren sleeping in the den Dementia changed that It went from a really happy place to a place thats not so happy Papa all of a sudden wasnt able to drive a car and take them to the skate park  or to go play miniature golf with them  so our life became smaller and smaller she said This can leave women feeling alone the report finds The higher caregiving burden placed on women has many consequences including higher emotional and physical stress strained family relationships and lost employment opportunities it concludes Carrillo eventually had to put Wallace into a fulltime care facility He would wander and get lost and couldnt be left alone for a moment The memory care facility hes in now is  a month Carrillo said Carrillo who  about her situation I dont quite know where Im going to get that money she added So Im in the process right now of creating a rental space in my home Medicaid will help but only once Carrillo is broke And that often happens the report finds Given the high average costs of these services adult day services  per day assisted living  per year and nursing home care  to  per year individuals often deplete their income and assets and eventually qualify for Medicaid the report reads Medicaid is the only public program that covers the long nursing home stays that most people with dementia require in the late stages of their illnesses The Alzheimers Association says the total national cost of caring for people with Alzheimers and other dementias is projected to reach  billion this year The report calculates that unpaid caregiving by family and friends would add up to another  billion In  the cost to Medicare and Medicaid of caring for those with Alzheimers and other dementias will reach a combined  billion with Medicare spending nearly  in every  on people with Alzheimers or another dementia the association says Right now there are no good treatments for Alzheimers and certainly nothing even close to a cure The biggest advance lately is  that appears to show whos likely to develop symptoms  but researchers say all that really does is provide a way for people to prepare for the inevitable and perhaps for their doctors to try treating them earlier to see if current lessthanuseful medications might do better in someone who hasnt begun to show memory loss yet Despite being the nations biggest health threat Alzheimers disease is still largely misunderstood Everyone with a brain  male or female family history or not  is at risk for Alzheimers said Angela Geiger chief strategy officer of the Alzheimers Association Although millions of Americans are in the same situation as Carrillo Its a lonely journey she said
