Ecigarettes contain some toxic chemicals and are not a safe alternative to smoking tobacco US research suggests In experiments on mice scientists found that ecigarette vapour could harm the lungs and make them more susceptible to respiratory infections The PLOS One study also found traces of free radical toxins similar to those found in cigarette smoke A lung charity said more research on the health impact of vaping was needed There has been   over the safety of ecigarettes since they were introduced  Although they are generally thought to be less harmful than smoking real cigarettes because they contain no tobacco they do still contain the addictive chemical nicotine However this study which looked at the effects of ecigarette vapour on mice says it still appeared to damage the lungs Thomas Sussan lead author and assistant scientist in the department of environmental health sciences at Johns Hopkins University said Ecigarette vapour alone produced mild effects on the lungs including inflammation and protein damage However when this exposure was followed by a bacterial or viral infection the harmful effects of ecigarette exposure became even more pronounced When the study divided mice into two groups and exposed one group to vapour from ecigarettes for two weeks it found that the mice in the exposed group were not as good at clearing the bacteria from their lungs As a result the viral infection led to them losing increasing amounts of weight which in some cases killed the mice This was because they had a compromised immune system and could not fight off the infection The scientists said further research in people with a lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD was needed to see how they were affected by switching from cigarettes to ecigarettes The study also discovered the presence of free radicals in ecigarette vapour although at  of the level found in real cigarettes These free radicals are highly reactive toxins which can damage DNA or other molecules within cells leading to cell death Dr Sussan said he was surprised by the finding considering the fact that ecigarettes do not produce combustion products Granted its  times lower than cigarette smoke but its still a high number of free radicals that can potentially damage cells Tom Pruen chief scientific officer for ECITA Electronic Cigarette Trade Industry Association criticised the way the research was conducted He said the mice were exposed to a vapour dose intended for humans not mice And the cartomisers in the ecigarettes were not changed often enough in the study which would expose the mice to significant amounts of thermal degradation products He added In reality this research indicates that for people using the products as intended ecigarettes really do offer significant harm reduction compared with smoking and appear to have a remarkably low toxic effect  Dr Penny Woods chief executive of the British Lung Foundation said While there is still little doubt that ecigarettes are far less harmful than regular cigarettes this study in mice is yet another reminder of the lack of conclusive evidence currently available on the longterm health impact of vaping in humans  She said more research should be conducted on ecigarette use by people with COPD Quitting smoking is the most effective way in which someone living with COPD can slow the progression of their disease  With as many as  people dying of smokingrelated COPD in the UK each year greater certainty is urgently needed over whether ecigarettes are safe to use by COPD patients looking to quit smoking Among the wider population we know many smokers have found ecigarettes a useful aid to quitting  However until such time as more research has clarified the longterm health impact of vaping we wouldnt advise their use by nonsmokers
