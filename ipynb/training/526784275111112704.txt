So its AD  and youve just had a long day at the gym or   thrusting and parrying with your fellow Roman gladiators What do you reach for to replenish your sapped strength A postworkout recovery drink of course Modernday athletes often nurse their muscles with supplement shakes or   after a workout Similarly gladiators the sports stars of the Roman Empire may have guzzled a drink made from the ashes of charred plants  a rich source of calcium which is essential for building bones researchers   this month in the journal  Plant ashes were evidently consumed to fortify the body after physical exertion and to promote better bone healing Fabian Kanz a forensic anthropologist at the Medical University of Vienna who led the research said in a   Things were similar then to what we do today Evidence for this ancient dietary supplement comes from a secondcentury cemetery for gladiators in what was once the great Roman city of Ephesus in modernday Turkey Kanz and his colleagues have been studying the remains buried there to unravel how these athletes lived To figure out what they ate the researchers examined the remains of  gladiators using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratio analysis Carbon can tell us about the plants these people ate while nitrogen offers hints of their animal protein consumption The gladiators were eating a pretty varied diet the analysis showed Some went heavier on the grains and greens some ate more meat When the same tests were run on the remains of  regular folks from that era and region they found the same sorts of variation In other words gladiators seemed to be eating the same way as everyone else But the researchers also decided to look at the trace elements of strontium and calcium in those old bones And thats where a huge difference jumped out Compared with the regular Joes the gladiators had a much larger ratio of strontium to calcium This is strong evidence that the gladiators were consuming something high in calcium to replenish their calcium stores that other people werent and that didnt show up in the isotopes  says   a biological anthropologist at the University of West Florida who studies imperial Rome through ancient bones The researchers wondered If the gladiators werent eating more meat than their contemporaries then where was this calcium boost coming from A nearly yearold encyclopedia offered a tantalizing clue In his   published in the first century Pliny the Elder    our hearth should be your medicine chest Drink lye made from its ashes and you will be cured One can see how gladiators after a combat are helped by drinking this  Using ash in food and medicine wasnt limited to the Romans The   from burned plant leaves and pea pods to prepare blue cornmeal foods like   bread and  dumplings  The ash provided essential elements like calcium manganese copper and iron Its a neat bit of detective work and it ties in nicely with historical accounts Killgrove says but the case isnt closed Its entirely possible gladiators were drinking ash drink she says but they havent proven it The problem Dairy doesnt show up in isotopes so the gladiators could have been chowing down on more cheese and yogurt than the rest of the population One other thing to note Ancient texts dont always agree on the finer points of gladiator diets For instance Pliny credited the warriors diet  a bean and barley mash was standard fare  for their endurance and toughness in battle But Galen a famous secondcentury physician who also did a   complained that this diet made the men soft and flabby The thinking is that gladiators loaded up on carbs to create a layer of fat to protect them from cuts and slashes in the arena says   a classics scholar at Cornell University and author of   about the most famous gladiator of them all Call it a spare tire if you will he says Hmm thats a far cry from the rippling muscles Russell Crowe sported in the  film   So were these ancient warriors more hunky or chunky By and large we are seeing them with their armor on Strauss says Theyre not showing their abs so I dont think we know We   know they were sex symbols  theres a lot written about noble women hanging out with gladiators   The Prince of Medicine Galen And The Roman Empire
