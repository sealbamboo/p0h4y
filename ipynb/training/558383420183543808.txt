A California measles outbreak that has been traced back to Disneyland in Anaheim is prompting concern over the growing trend among some parents to avoid immunising their children against infectious diseases  According to state officials there are currently  cases of the highly contagious disease in California which can be spread through the air and results in a fever cough and rash that can be lifethreatening  Of the confirmed cases  have been linked to an initial exposure in December at Disneyland or Disney California Adventure Park in Anaheim California the California Department of Public Health writes in a   There are eight additional cases connected to Disneyland in other western US states and Mexico Public health experts say the disease was probably brought to the amusement park packed with holiday tourists by a foreign visitor but it has spread in part due to the lower numbers of Americans who have been opting to receive the immunisation shots  The US government announced in  that measles had been eradicated in the country but the disease has seen a steady rebound since then The US Centers for Disease Control reports there were  new measles cases in  states last year  the highest number since the early s The   for children ages  to  months in the US stood at  in  below the  rate that ensures herd immunity that offers protection for those who cant get immunised for medical reasons and adults whose immunisation has worn off In Colorado where two of the Disneyrelated cases have appeared the rate was a nationallow  Perhaps not coincidentally Orange County  where Disneyland is located  is home to one of the more active antivaccination communities led by Dr Bob Sears a paediatrician who caters to parents suspicious of the immunisation shots While the vast majority of physicians are troubled by the antivaccination movement Sears  lends a sympathetic ear Los Angeles Times reporter Paloma Esquivel   in a September  profile About half his patients forgo vaccines altogether To others he offers Dr Bobs alternative and selective vaccination schedules which delay or eliminate certain immunisations She writes that at some Orange County public schools up to  of students had personal belief exemptions to required vaccinations The unfortunate reality   Cornell University immunology Prof Cynthia Leifer for CNNcom is that more and more parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children for nonmedical reasons Some refuse vaccines on the grounds of religious beliefs others refuse on the repeatedly disproved argument that vaccines contribute to autism She compares parents who decide not to vaccinate their children to a drunk driver who makes a socially irresponsible decision that can endanger not only his life but also the lives of the other drivers and passengers on the road  While the danger is real some wonder if this highprofile outbreak could be the wakeup call that prompts action  For much of human civilisation that was how we lived and with measles outbreaks at Disneyland and elsewhere were getting a taste of what our infectionplagued existence was like before routine vaccination   Paul Thornton of the Los Angeles Times Fears over children falling seriously ill after standing in line for Space Mountain could take hold Perhaps we ought to start listening to credentialed researchers and mainstream doctors instead of celebrities who studied at the University of Google and the fringe physicians and activists who enable them He quotes one letter to the Times that disagrees with this view however emphasising that the decision not to vaccinate is one of parental freedom It is my choice whether or not I want to be vaccinated Clayton Graver writes It is your choice whether or not to wash your hands or take basic public health precautions It is an individuals choice whether he or she wants to gamble with their childs life It is not your place to say what they have to do There may be growing consequences for parents who make the choice not to vaccinate however In the California town of Huntington Beach a high school in which a student was diagnosed with measles    classmates for three weeks when they could not prove they had been immunised  In Utah more than  people   to selfquarantine after being exposed to two children who returned from Disneyland with the disease A Washington state doctor   a conversation with a father whose monthold daughter who had yet to be immunised contracted measles during a vacation to Disneyland I told him he should channel that energy and speak out to support immunisations as a matter of public health Neil Kaneshiro writes in the Seattle Times Healthcare providers continue to voice support but clearly that has not been adequate to stem the tide of antivaccine sentiment that continues to grow The most recent outbreak has renewed calls to make vaccination waivers  which allow parents to send unimmunised children to public schools  more difficult to obtain such as adding informed consent clauses or having them expire at the end of every school year If only we could say we didnt see this coming   the editors of the Sacramento Bee But its no
