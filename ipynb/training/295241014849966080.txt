As the Kama Sutra  that ancient Indian book on sexuality  shows us sexual activity is a pursuit of infinite variety There are hundreds of ways in which male and female bodies can come together for mutual pleasure If youre in a heterosexual relationship knowing a variety of   positions can help you be a better and more inventive lover for your partner That answer is different for every couple Every two people fit together differently says   a sex therapist and the director of psychological services at the New Jersey Center for Sexual Wellness in Bedminster Experiment and see what works but dont get stuck too early with any one position because over time that will get boring There are nonphysical factors to consider too TakeÂ   for example For many people especially women intimacy can lead to better sexual experiences because partners are comfortable and trusting enough to ask for what they desire and to try new things Its a simple sex position The woman lies on her back with her legs spread and her knees bent slightly The man lies between her legs and guides his   into her vagina supporting his body weight with his arms or elbows The problem with this sexual position is that the missionary position is not as good at delivering pleasure to women The mans pelvis does stimulate the clitoris in this position and it offers great intimacy through facetoface contact But the angle of the penis does not allow for deep penetration or stimulation of the   a location on the front wall of the vagina thats believed by some experts to be a stimulus for orgasm in women Some women also complain that this sex position doesnt provide enough clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm While the missionary position is a popular sexual position in the United States it is not that popular worldwide Alfred Kinseys   on sexuality in the midth century found that as many as  percent of US men reported using just this sex position to the exclusion of all others In most cultures it is  the most used position says   a certified sexuality educator and professor emerita at Rutgers University in New Jersey Cultures would laugh when they saw the missionaries having sex in that position Thats why it was called the missionary position If you are looking to spice up your sexual experience and enjoy better sex try some of the following sex positions Woman on top is better for women who want to be in control and guide the stimulation Dr Leiblum says The angle of the penis allows for deep penetration and Gspot stimulation and the male partner can contribute to the womans pleasure by using his fingers to rub her clitoris Plus men are very responsive to visual stimuli and this sex position allows the man to lie back and watch his female partner In this sex position the man lies on his back and the woman faces him and kneels straddling his pelvis and guiding his penis into her vagina She can sit up or lie down on him She also can move in an upanddown motion or roll her hips around Also referred to as doggy style this is the best sex position for deep penetration of the vagina It gives the man freedom to thrust his pelvis hard and fast and allows him to caress much of the womans body The position also allows for good Gspot stimulation The woman kneels on all fours supporting herself with her hands and knees The man crouches behind her and enters her vagina from the rear One drawback Some women complain that this sex position is too impersonal because theres no facetoface contact This position allows for slow and romantic sex The partners are facing each other and can kiss and caress each other during lovemaking The sex position is relaxing and doesnt require a lot of stamina from either person Its also good for people who are   If one or both of the partners is extremely heavy side to side may be better so that no one partner has to bear the weight Leiblum says There is good clitoral stimulation in this position but penetration is limited During sidebyside sex the man and woman lie on their sides facing each other The woman lifts her top leg so the man can insert his penis She can then wrap the leg around his waist or lay it across his top leg If youve been using the same sexual position with the same partner for some time maybe its time for a little variety which its been said is the spice of life Keep brainstorming communicating and experimenting
