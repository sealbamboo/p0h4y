The move ends one chapter of a weekslong struggle between the hospital which sought to remove Jahi from a ventilator after doctors and a judge concluded she was braindead and her relatives who fought in court to keep her on the ventilator and contended she showed signs of life As a family we are definitely relieved that shes no longer at Childrens Hospital but were all emotionally drained Omari Sealey the girls uncle told CNNs Piers Morgan Live on Monday night This has been an incredible rollercoaster ride of emotions He said so long as his nieces heart is beating Jahi is alive Shes moving a lot more She responds to audio and touch and more compelling evidence is the fact that she can move her head and neck Sealey said The hospital released Jahi on Sunday to the Alameda County coroner who then released her to her mothers custody said Dr David Durand the hospitals chief of pediatrics The hospital had previously said it needed the coroners consent for the transfer because Jahi was legally dead  Jahi  who was declared braindead December  after postsurgery complications that her family says included severe bleeding and cardiac arrest  was moved from the hospital Sunday accompanied by a criticalcare team She was attached to a ventilator but with no feeding tube in place On Monday Dolan said Jahi was being given antibiotics to fight infections and nutritional support Theyre giving her everything that a person who would have a chance to live would be getting he said He declined to provide details about the type of facility citing privacy and security concerns Shes where shes going to be for a while he said She needs to be medically stabilized medically treated On Sunday   that the facility would gladly accept Jahi But Dolan said the family has no plans to give more details about her location Weve had people make threats from around the country Its sad that people act that way Dolan said So for Jahis safety and those around her we will not be saying where she went or where she is At least five different facilities that originally offered to care for Jahi fell through he said But ultimately the family chose from a number of offers There were other facilities that still had their hand extended he said But we took the first one that we knew would pull us in Jahis case drew national attention and fueled debate as a fierce court battle unfolded between devastated family members fighting to keep her on a ventilator and doctors arguing shed already died Family members say the eighthgrader was alert and talking after doctors removed her tonsils adenoids and extra sinus tissue in a surgery at the Oakland hospital on December   Doctors had recommended the surgery to treat pediatric obstructive sleep apnea a condition which made her stop breathing in her sleep and caused other medical problems Before the surgery Jahi said she was worried that she would never wake up according to her uncle She seemed fine after the surgery but asked for a Popsicle because her throat hurt Not long afterward something went terribly wrong In an intensive care unit the girl began bleeding profusely the family said According to family members Jahi went into cardiac arrest Days later she was declared braindead Hospital officials have said privacy laws prevent them from discussing details of the case The family and the hospital disagreed over whether to disconnect her from a ventilator and the issue wound up in Alameda Superior Court In court documents and public comments the hospital maintained that theres no doubt that McMath is braindead describing the condition as irreversible  No amount of prayer no amount of hope no amount of any type of medical procedure will bring her back Childrens Hospital Oakland spokesman Sam Singer said last month The medical situation here in this case is that Jahi McMath died several weeks ago A judge on December  appointed Dr Paul Fisher chief of pediatric neurology at Stanford Childrens Hospital to evaluate Jahi  Fisher concluded the next day that she met the criteria for brain death According to a court filing Fisher found that the girls pupils were fully dilated and unresponsive to light and that she did not respond to a variety of intense stimuli  His report also says Jahi showed no sign of breathing on her own when a ventilator was removed Patient failed apnea test The report says her heart was beating only because of the mechanical ventilator  In addition an imaging test showed no blood flow to Jahis brain while another showed no sign of electrical activity  Fishers conclusion Overall unfortunate circumstances in yearold with known irreversible brain injury and now complete absence of cerebral function and complete absence of brainstem function child meets all criteria for brain death by professional societies and state of California  After seeing Fishers report Alameda Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo concluded on December  that Jahi was brain dead But Grillo twice ruled that the hospital had to hold off on disconnecting Jahi from life support ultimately giving the family and the facility until January  to come to a resolution The Alameda County coroner issued a death certificate for Jahi on Friday listing December  as the date of death The certificate still needed to be accepted by the health department to become official Medical ethicists meanwhile say the highprofile case fuels a misperception that brain death is somehow   The case is giving the impression that dead people can come back to life Arthur Caplan director of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center told CNN last month Jahis family members maintain that theyre hoping for a miracle  Her mother told CNN last month that shed seen improvements including indications from a hospital monitor that she said suggest her daughter was trying to breathe on her own The girls uncle Sealey told reporters last week that a pediatrician has seen Jahi and has sworn she is not dead When asked about the girls possible movement Singer the hospital spokesman said he would not comment directly on any claims the family makes citing privacy laws However Singer said it is quite common for the muscles of brain dead patients to move stressing its not a sign of life So far the family has raised more than  on GoFundMecom to move her   more than  people have donated money in  days  Were very grateful very proud said Sealey We want to thank everyone that supported us everyone that stood in our corner everyone that prayed for us everyone that helped donate to make this possible Without you guys none of this would be possible He didnt rule out the possibility that the family could eventually file a lawsuit against the hospital But he dismissed concerns that details about what happened during and after Jahis surgery could be lost if she remains on a ventilator Thats pretty much saying that shes evidence and shes a body and we dont look at it that way Sealey said Were not worried about accountability Were worried about survival In releasing Jahi the hospital said Our hearts go out to the family as they grieve for this sad situation and we wish them closure and peace
