In many ways my uncle was demonstrating a concept known as the moral hazard  this exact scenario  in   They found that many men at the time they obtained Medicare started behaving badly Moral or morale hazard is a term largely used by economists to describe the actions of people more willing to take risks because they are insulated from the cost of their actions in this case because of their recently obtained health insurance In the case of these men when they got Medicare they took worse care of themselves they actually exercised less Among those who didnt visit the doctor after getting insurance the effect was dramatic Their overall physical activity dropped by  they were  more likely to smoke cigarettes and  more likely to drink alcohol  Even if that seems extreme its still worth asking Does health insurance make us healthier The past five years have seen a tumultuous battle over Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act culminating in the bitter recriminations this fall over lost policies and the disastrous launch of the HealthCaregov website When   at the end of October she downplayed the concerns and seemed certain the site would be up and running by the end of November  The website may be working better now but to me thats not the most important issue In my mind the real suspense comes from whether Obamacare will really make us a healthier America even if it succeeds in its ambitions to dramatically expand coverage  A healthier America That is the goal we should share as Americans but access alone wont get us anywhere close This past spring the New England Journal of Medicine followed up on  The state created a remarkable strategy to do a minimal expansion of Medicaid It decided to conduct random lottery drawings to allocate the limited spots  While it was controversial in its implementation the situation was a goldmine for researchers It offered something very rare in these types of studies a unique opportunity for researchers to compare the newly insured to their highly similar counterparts who remained uninsured The results were surprising and mostly disappointing  The newly insured Medicaid population did go to the doctor more often used more preventive health services and received more medications Problem was in nearly every area they werent any healthier The scientists sat down with more than  people and compared some of the most important health indicators They found having insurance did not improve measures of blood pressure cholesterol or how well diabetics controlled their blood sugar Furthermore the year risk of having a heart attack didnt change in those who had Medicaid It wasnt at all what the proponents of universal access to health insurance hoped they would see The results remind me of a column I wrote a few years ago shortly after my own marriage It seemed like a good time to explore the question of whether marriage was in fact good for ones health I spent a fair amount of time researching the topic and one of the experts I interviewed gave me an answer I have never forgotten Marriage is good for your health long pause  as long as its a good marriage  It was a terrific answer and a metaphor for so many aspects of our lives As you might imagine I had quite a bit of fun with that article on marriage but it taught an important lesson There is almost always a second beat to any story Being married all by itself isnt necessarily good or bad for your health It was the effort required to make it a good or bad marriage that made up the entire difference The same can be said about health insurance In this case I dont mean that good or bad insurance is the critical factor but that health insurance alone doesnt lead to better health None of this works unless we all take personal responsibility and hold ourselves accountable To be clear there will always be some baseline benefit to being insured versus not being insured even if you account for the moral hazard A major   in  found that uninsured adults are more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage of cancer more likely to die from a heart attack and less likely to recover from a serious injury  Even in Oregon the newly insured enjoyed some benefits For example they were nearly a third less likely to suffer from depression perhaps because they had more peace of mind from being insured And there were significant benefits in nonmedical areas Whereas more than  of the uninsured faced catastrophic medical expenses in a year  defined as greater than  of their income  those catastrophic expenses were virtually eliminated in the group on Medicaid But strictly in terms of health insurance like marriage doesnt guarantee good health After all I am sure you can think of people right now who have terrific health insurance and terrible health It seems the benefits pale in comparison to what we can gain with a few simple personal decisions about our health  A good example comes from a study in the journal Circulation   that if all Americans exercised  minutes a day we would reduce the number of cardiovascular events  heart attacks and strokes  by a third A third  Just  minutes a day and suddenly we are starting to get serious about a more healthy America  You can break up the exercise into minute chunks according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and you dont even have to knock yourself out Just go hard enough that your breathing is slightly labored enough that it would keep you from singing if you suddenly got the urge  Problem is that as things stand now   at most exercise that much  While we are fond of comparing ourselves to France a place that was ranked as having the best overall health care system in    theres a huge difference between the United States and France that has little to do with the health care safety net We Americans are three times as likely to be obese as the average French person  and    I think about this all the time and here is what I tell my own patients It is time to stop merely playing defense when it comes to your health and time to start optimizing yourself Yes of course we are desperate to stamp out disease when it occurs but we are more desperate for those diseases to never occur in the first place I say that as a neurosurgeon someone who is often called in to extinguish the brightest of fires I also say this however as a yearold dad who wants to be around for a long time I have been fortunate to have always had health insurance but a few years ago I decided to strive for something more I wanted to optimize myself I wanted to be the best that I could possibly be instead of waiting around for the seemingly inevitable diagnosis of heart disease or diabetes I found that it wasnt that hard I became diligent about breaking a sweat every day I made it as important as a meeting with my boss or a dinner date with my wife  Also as a student of neuroscience I know the brain isnt particularly good at distinguishing thirst and hunger so most people eat when they should drink As a result we walk around overstuffed and dehydrated Drinking fluids all day long has cut my calorie consumption by a third Studies of the mindbody connection also remind us that it takes about  minutes for the brain to know the stomach is full Stop eating when you are  full and you will likely take in the right number of calories The Japanese call it hara hachi bu To help we use smaller plates in our home to trick the brain into believing we are eating more  We eat meat occasionally but no longer serve it in our home I eat seven different colored foods a day and try to buy locally grown vegetables whenever I can These are simple strategies that have made me biologically younger than I was nearly five years ago At  I have the biological age of someone in his mids It is true that the American Medical Association supports the aspects of Obamacare that expand insurance coverage as do many others in the medical community even if they arent convinced that it will reliably lead to better health It appeals to a sense of justice and a desire to prevent the awful situation of people being turned away when they need help the most But as we follow the story of Obamacare over the coming years its important to understand and agree on the true measure of success As a doctor I think a healthier America is the rallying cry we can all get behind We have had a rocky yet still vitally important start but the point is that access to health care insurance is not nearly enough  If we are serious about a more healthy America the real change starts in each and every one of us and its not that hard to do
