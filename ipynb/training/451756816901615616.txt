Hes back my colleague asked eyes widening as she passed the patients room Hes in the hospital   Slender pale and in his late s the man had first been admitted nearly a year earlier with pressure in his chest so severe he had trouble breathing When his heart stopped doctors and nurses revived him by injecting the latest lifesaving medicines into his veins and applying the newest electrical defibrillator paddles to his chest  Within minutes the cardiology team arrived but when the blockage in the arteries of his heart proved too extensive for even their stateoftheart techniques and equipment they handed him off to the waiting surgeons The surgeons in turn cooled down his heart until it stopped beating sewed in bypass conduits with threads finer than human hairs restarted the heart with a few wellplaced jolts of electricity and then transferred the patient to the cuttingedge intensive care unit to recover  The man survived Sort of  Weakened by this string of emergencies he required a breathing machine for several days When excess fluid in his lungs caused shortness of breath he needed intravenous diuretics When his heart began beating erratically he was obliged to take a finely tuned cocktail of heart medications And when his chest wound became infected he had to return to the operating room Finally after nearly two months in the hospital he was discharged to a skilled nursing center But then a urinary tract infection made him dizzy and confused and he went right back to the hospital beginning a cycle of discharge and readmittance that would persist for almost a year To many of us who had cared for the man it seemed as if he had spent more days in the hospital than out  What kind of life is that my colleague asked as we stood in the hallway and watched the mans wife help him once again put on his hospital gown and pack away his street clothes Youve got to wonder she whispered did we really do him a favor when we saved him I was reminded of the frail man and the many patients like him whom I have known when I read a recent Perspective piece in The New England Journal of Medicine titled  Over the last  years American hospitals have become a showcase of medical progress saving lives that not long ago would have been lost  Rapid response teams drilled in precision teamwork and the latest techniques of critical care have become commonplace Cardiac and respiratory monitors once found only in intensive care units are now standard equipment on most wards and even in many patient rooms CAT scanners and MRI machines once rare have become de rigueur with some hospitals boasting duplicates and even triplicates  But up to onefifth of patients treated with these new medical advances and then deemed well enough to leave the hospital end up being readmitted within  days of their discharge at considerable cost Insurers and thirdparty payers have begun penalizing health care systems for these quick readmissions and hospitals in response have begun  significant efforts to improve the transition from hospital to home creating clinics that remain open beyond usual working hours and marshaling teams of care coordinators postdischarge pharmacists and care transition coaches  The problem persists though because our spectacular advances in medical science have led to a growing population of patients who are hospitaldependent according to the authors of the Perspectives article Hospitaldependent patients are those who a generation ago were doomed to die Now they are being saved But they are not like   a group of patients more commonly associated with frequent readmissions who return to the hospital because of inadequate followup care failure to take prescriptions correctly or difficult socioeconomic circumstances Instead hospitaldependent patients come back because they are so fragile their grasp on health so tenuous that they easily decompensate  or deteriorate under stress when not in the hospital  Medical advances can snatch them from the clutches of death but not necessarily free them from dependence on nearconstant hightech monitoring and treatments  They are like a house of cards said Dr David B Reuben lead author of the article and chief of the division of geriatrics at the Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles  When one thing goes wrong they collapse  Not surprisingly hospitaldependent patients feel more secure and are happier in the hospital than at home While clinicians and even family members may judge theirs a diminished existence these patients find their quality of life acceptable relishing their time with friends and family or engaged in passive hobbies like watching sports or reading the newspaper albeit in the hospital  Over time however their recurring presence can result in conflicted feelings among those who were responsible for saving them in the first place Some clinicians even begin to resent their obligation to continue administering resourceintensive care Physicians are socialized to cure patients then move on Dr Reuben observed They want to treat patients not adopt them  Dr Reuben and his coauthor offer potential solutions such as specialized wards or facilities that would be more intensive than skilled nursing homes yet less costly than a hospital But they are quick to add that more research must also be done Their concept of hospitaldependency is a new one so no research is available to help identify patients at risk of becoming hospitaldependent estimate the percentage of early readmissions they are responsible for or calculate the costs they incur  Even without studies its clear that the numbers of these patients are increasing With every triumphant medical advance there are patients who are cured but who remain too fragile to live beyond the immediate reach of the technology that saved them Until we begin making different decisions regarding how we allocate our resources their presence will be a constant reminder of which medical research and health care we consider worthy and which we do not
