fear of dying at so young an age Even with an excellent chance of being cured teenagers with cancer face myriad emotional educational and social concerns especially missing out on activities and losing friends who cant cope with cancer in a contemporary Added to that are the challenges of trying to keep up with schoolwork even as cancer treatment steals time and energy and may cause

Im weak and need special care she said in an interview Having cancer puts other issues into perspective she added I feel like I have to do as much as I can Ive gotten involved in so much I try to enjoy myself more And I dont regret for a minute how Ive been spending my time Sophies determination to do the most she can and her desire for normalcy are hardly unusual said  who directs an extraordinary program for teenagers with cancer and their families at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles Dr Kuperberg who has a doctorate in social work started the program called   in  It operates with the support of donations and grants and deserves to be replicated at hospitals elsewhere The greatest challenge teens with cancer face is social isolation she said in an interview Many of their peers are uncomfortable with illness and many teens with cancer may withdraw from their friends because they feel they are so different and dont fit in In the popular young adult novel  a teenager with advanced cancer says That was the worst part of having cancer sometimes The physical evidence of disease separates you from other people Within the family too teenagers can feel isolated Dr Kuperberg said Patients and parents want to protect one another They keep up a facade that everything will be OK and feelings of depression and anxiety go unexpressed Teen Impact holds group therapy sessions for young patients parents and siblings so they dont feel alone and realize that their feelings are normal Dr Kuperberg said The goal of the program which also sponsors social activities is to help young cancer patients  some still in treatment others finished  live as normally as possible For many cancer is a chronic illness with echoes that last long after treatment ends Dr Kuperberg said There are emotional side effects  a sense of vulnerability a fear of relapse and death and an uncertainty about the future that can get in the way of pursuing their hopes and dreams And there can be physical and cognitive side effects when treatment leaves behind physical limitations and learning difficulties But she added there is often posttraumatic growth that motivates teens in a very positive way Theres a lot of altruism she said a desire to give back and empathy a sensitivity to what others are going through and a desire to help them Sophie for example took notes for a classmate with   caused by chemotherapy She recalled her gratitude for the friend who was there for me the whole time I was in treatment who would come over after school and sit on the couch and do puzzles

Gynecologists urged doctors to address the effects of cancer treatment on puberty ovarian function menstrual bleeding sexuality contraceptive choice breast and   screening and fertility With survival rates pretty high now for childhood cancers we should do what we can to preserve future fertility said Dr Julie Strickland the chairwoman of the colleges committee on adolescent health care Were seeing more and more cooperation between oncologists and gynecologists to preplan for fertility preservation before starting cancer treatment The committee suggested that when appropriate young cancer patients be referred to a reproductive endocrinologist who can explore the full range of reproductive options including the freezing of eggs and embryos For boys who have been through puberty it has long been possible to freeze sperm before cancer treatment Although some female patients may be unwilling to delay treatment even for a month to facilitate fertility preservation at the very least they should be offered the option Dr Strickland said in an interview She described experimental but promising possibilities like freezing part or all of an ovary and then implanting it after cancer treatment ends It is already possible to move ovaries out of harms way for girls who need pelvic radiation
