When the head of the agency responsible for the troubled   went before Congress for the first time since its foibles became apparent Oct  she probably didnt expect that many questions would be on something else altogether But the website turned out not to be the focus of questions for Marilyn Tavenner by Republicans at the   hearing Tuesday They were more interested in asking about   being received by people who purchase their own insurance Unlike the computer contractors who   before a separate House committee Tavenner who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services offered a formal apology for the websites dismal performance We know that consumers are eager to purchase this coverage Tavenner told the committee And to the millions of Americans whove attempted to use HealthCaregov to shop and enroll in health care coverage I want to apologize to you that the website has not worked as well as it should But most of the hearing was consumed with Republicans repeating a vow President Obama made often during the debate over the health law and ever since If you like your health care plan you can keep your health care plan period said Rep Peter Roskam RIll quoting the president No one will be able to take it away no matter what Thats turning out not to be the case Its not yet clear exactly how many people will lose coverage but likely millions of people who buy their own insurance are now getting letters saying their insurance plans are ending because they dont meet the requirements of the new law Many members of the committee including Roskam read letters from constituents who say theyll have to pay more for new coverage Can you understand the level of frustration and concern about what many Americans perceive to be a false claim from the administration he asked Tavenner said its not that simple and its not all bad Many people who say they like their current plans dont realize how little they cover Sometimes they were in plans that they thought were fine until they actually needed hospitalization she said Then they found out it didnt cover hospitalization or it didnt cover cancer Now she told the committee health plans will have to meet the   of the health law You cant be denied you wont be kicked off a policy because you develop a problem she said You may be eligible for tax credits depending on your income So these are important protections that are now available through the Affordable Care Act And I think thats important At the White House spokesman Jay Carney pointed out that not everyone will pay more by changing plans For some people he said Youre actually going to pay less for better coverage than what youre paying now How many will pay less is not yet clear Back at the hearing Republicans also pressed Tavenner on when the administration will release figures on how many people have managed to successfully enroll in health plans so far To each question she gave the same answer That number will not be available until midNovember That number is important because its a key measure of the success or failure of the entire enterprise Altogether the administration is counting   between now and the end of March But its not just the number that will determine the viability of the insurance plans but who signs up as committee Chairman   RMich pointed out I think critically important of that  million  million of those need to be young and healthy he said Thats so there are enough healthy people in the insurance market to balance out those with preexisting health conditions who insurers will be required to cover Tavenner said she wasnt concerned about a slow start even with the computer problems The Massachusetts experience was very slow initially and then it started to ramp up over time We expect the same type of projections She said Massachusetts implemented the   for most people to have insurance or pay a fine back in  Tavenner repeated the administrations promise to have the websites problems cured by the   Tomorrow its Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebeliuss turn to testify before Congress
