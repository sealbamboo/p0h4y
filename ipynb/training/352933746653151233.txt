Its a sweaty summer all across the country  its still early but even Alaska and the reliably cool Pacific Northwest have had hotter than usual days with temperatures    And as the temperature gets hotter  so do our tempers Summer heat waves make us act like cranky whiny toddlers experts say and studies have even shown that as the degrees tick up so do crime rates  If someone cuts you off in traffic youre much more likely to honk at them or flip them off if its a hot day rather than a cool day says Brad Bushman an Ohio State University psychologist An increase in body temperature causes an increase in physical arousal  your heart rate goes up and your blood pressure rises as your poor body tries to cool itself off explains Dr Jeff Borenstein president of the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation in Great Neck NY And that can be bad news for your behavior because increased physical arousal is known to be linked to aggressive behavior  But when were overheated and annoyed we dont  like were worked up Thats really an interesting phenomenon about temperature  as temperature increases perceived arousal decreases says Bushman who has studied the link between hotter temperatures and criminal behavior He adds that you might say to yourself Oh man I feel drained I feel sluggish Im dragging But if you measure their physical arousal it actually increases with increase in temperature And thats a recipe for disaster  We know that arousal is linked to aggressive behavior he continues So if people think theyre not aroused what they end up doing is overreacting Ellen Cohn a criminologist at Florida International University has studied the link between higher temperatures and an increased crime rate since grad school Generally what we find is as it gets hotter crime tends to go up says Cohn coauthor of a  that looked at two years in Minneapolis and found that more crimes were reported during summer than other months There are some caveats here she says In the summertime more people are on vacation leaving their homes empty And vacationbrain can lead to lessthancautious behavior like leaving your wallet on the beach when you take a dip in the ocean Whats more even mild dehydration can alter a persons mood as a  published last year showed After losing just  percent of the bodys normal water volume the study participants were fatigued they had difficulty concentrating and their heads ached  and they were more tense and anxious  When its very hot people have a tendency to get dehydrated or underhydrated and that can certainly result in becoming anxious and irritable so its very important to maintain hydration Borenstein says Thats something to remember when youre downing iced coffee after iced coffee because caffeine acts as a diuretic Youre walking down the street and you see a million people drinking iced coffee Borenstein says That can increase the heart rate and it can cause some irritability and some anxiety
