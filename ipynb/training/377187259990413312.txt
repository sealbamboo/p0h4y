States that have refused to expand Medicaid as requested as part of the Obamacare health reforms say they cant afford to cover all the old sick people who will be just waiting to get their free health care  But a new study contradicts this argument saying the people who would become newly eligible for Medicaid are going to be younger white males who arent sick yet but who are more likely to be smokers and drinkers who would benefit from getting medical care now There are going to be many more males They are going to be younger says Dr Tammy Chang of the University of Michigan whose study is published in the Annals of Family Medicine This could mean that   could cost less than forecast Chang said They are using what the Medicaid population looks like now she said But the study she did with colleague Dr Matthew Davis shows those who will become eligible for Medicaid for the first time may be a healthier batch than the  million people who are now covered Medicaid the statefederal health plan provides minimal coverage in many states to those deemed in the most need of help Pregnant women make up a large percentage in most states as well as children and the very poor The  Affordable Care Act was designed to transform health care in the United States providing health insurance for just about everyone The law required states to extend Medicaid to people earning up to about  percent of the federal poverty level or about  for single people and  for a family of four In return the law pledges that the federal government will pay  percent of the additional costs for the first three years of the program States will have to kick in a very small percentage more each year after that But after a series of challenges to the law the US Supreme Court ruled in June  that the   States cant be forced to add more people to Medicaid the court ruled Now the Congressional Budget Office   will become newly eligible for Medicaid in the   their offerings by  The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation   this would cost states  billion more between now and  But it may be less Chang and Davis looked at a large health survey called the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Participants answer detailed questions about themselves their health and their health coverage They compared current Medicaid patients to people who would be eligible for the program based on income Currently the average Medicaid patient is  years old If all the states expanded Medicaid  and not all will  the average age would go down to  Right now a third of patients are male under a full expansion  percent would be Right now almost precisely half of beneficiaries are white under the expansion nearly  percent would be Overall potentially eligible adults are expected to have better health status  percent excellent or very good  percent good than current beneficiaries  percent excellent or very good  percent good they wrote Fewer would be obese and fewer would be depressed But more would be smokers and heavy drinkers Because these potential patients said their health was good this could mean theres an opportunity for doctors to help them stop smoking and cut back on their drinking before they do get sick Chang says According to the Advisory Board Company  states   to more people and four states are leaning that way Sixteen are definitely not and another seven probably wont
