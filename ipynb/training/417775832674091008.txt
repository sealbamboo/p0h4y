On the November day in  when Michael Bloomberg was elected mayor two things were prominent in New York Citys air fumes from the World Trade Centers smoldering remains and tobacco smoke in the citys bars restaurants and other public spaces Now theyre both gone Bloomberg helped the city rebuild after the attack on Sept   And he led the charge against smoking As a philanthropist Bloomberg had been interested in public health for a decade But as mayor he was in a position to take the advice of experts and turn it into law affecting how millions of people live their lives Dr Alfred Sommer from Johns Hopkins University led Mayorelect Bloombergs search for a health commissioner Sommer interviewed   for the job Unlike other candidates Frieden didnt want to talk about bioterrorism Sommer recalls the conversation Tobacco Tobaccos the big thing And I said Ummm Tom have you heard about  And he said Oh yeah sure and thats an issue we have to deal with but I guarantee that tobacco use is going to kill far more New Yorkers than bioterrorism ever will  Bloomberg bought it beginning a push that made the city an incubator for often controversial public health experiments He hired Frieden to crusade against tobacco raise the stature of the Health Department and focus on chronic health problems like diabetes obesity and heart disease The department became a hotbed of research and   on the health of New Yorkers Meanwhile Bloomberg swung into municipal action raising taxes on cigarettes and proposing a widespread ban on public smoking indoors At a hearing in late  Bloomberg spoke in front of the City Council There were some protests but the smoking ban passed by an overwhelming margin in the City Council Resentment festered though Take yearold Elizabeth Lane of Harlem That Bloomberg I was so angry at him she says If he was in the same room as me I could have choked him I thought he was a dictator I said Is this right Can he really tell people what to do and how to do it  Lane had smoked for  years and couldnt quit But the high tobacco taxes got to her and she found herself dropping hundreds of dollars a month on cigarettes Lane says family pressure and a lot of prayer moved her to put on a nicotine patch It worked She quit which has helped her indefinitely postpone surgery to open her blood vessels and reduced her risk of cancer stroke and heart disease It has also potentially saved taxpayers tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars And quitting smoking changed Lanes mind about Bloomberg He knew what he was doing He did the right thing And Im thankful to him now she says Curtailing smoking has been Bloombergs signature public health achievement Other cities around the world followed New Yorks lead including London and Paris But the dramatic success with smoking has been difficult to replicate Take his   Over the past eight years the Bloomberg administration has banned trans fats required food establishments to post calorie counts encouraged green markets and produce carts and started the countrys first largescale registry of people with diabetes Theres been some improvement among schoolchildren Overall obesity rates in Kthrough children ages  to  has   over the past  years Bloomberg reported in  But among adults rates of diabetes and obesity have increased The initiative that garnered the most attention by far was attempting to limit the size of sodas and other sugary beverages served in restaurants cafes movie theaters and sports venues Compared to smoking this is an easy battle to win and nobodys going to stop this is my impression Bloomberg announced the day before his soda ban hearing started in the City Council Bloomberg and his aides argued that people could buy as much soda as they wanted that the new rule would just reset the default portion size from  or  ounces back down to   forcing people   before gulping down hundreds of calories from a single cup But opponents quickly got the label soda ban to stick And they got help lobbying against the measure from the food industry Six in  New Yorkers oppose Bloombergs sugary beverage initiative according to a     Two state courts so far have rejected the rule and another court appeal is pending Bloomberg biographer   says the backlash might have had as much to do with Bloomberg fatigue as anything It was the third term and here he was doing it again she says So beyond the opposition of the beverage industry I also think that it was Enough already Youve done this too many times Im getting sick of you Im getting sick of your policies Leave me alone  Bloombergs successor Mayorelect   has said he supports the sugary beverage initiative though he hasnt said much about other efforts Public health experts arent sure what to expect but they doubt that anytime soon theyll have another ally like Bloomberg an activist policy wonk with a fat checkbook and a willingness to take unpopular political risks
