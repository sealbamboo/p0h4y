A controversial statistic suggests that in the near future our country will be in desperate need of more doctors The Association of American Medical Colleges has   that by  we will be about  short thanks primarily to an exploding older population Ten thousand Americans now turn  every day entering their golden years of disproportionate consumption of medical care Not all the experts agree with these calculations A   for example has countered that geographic variability always undermines these dire predictions with a reliable glut of physicians persisting in some places and reliable shortages in others The real problem they say is a profession topheavy with specialists leaving too few to provide primary care I have no particular professional expertise to inform an opinion on these matters I do however have a pertinent personal perspective having lived in a miniature version of our soontobegeriatric nation for most of my adult life Thanks to extremely longlived parents who married late in life with a sizable age difference between them it is now closing in on three decades that our nuclear family has contained an extremely old person to worry about So heres the bottom line We have had no doctor shortage In fact even with just the one permanently oncall house doctor me I would say we have actually had enough doctors Maybe even a surplus My mother ever the comic used to drag out an annoying little routine at dinner parties to the effect that she and my father sent me to medical school specifically to supervise their old ages After many years chewing that one over I am forced to conclude that the joke is on her Not the best choice Mom It would have been better by far to send me to nursing school Talk about shortages  how our little world could have used an inhouse individual formally trained in patience and small acts of kindness one whose knowledge of health care reflected the more practical symptomfocused schematic that distinguishes nursing from medical education Certainly doctors are now making tentative forays into this territory We have for instance added the concept of comfort care to our knowledge base and we use the term freely But most of us are not too clear on the actual techniques It would have been better to send me to   school No surprise there A doctors familiarity with obscure diagnoses  and the ingrained habit of reviewing them compulsively when something goes wrong  is considerably less helpful for the old than an understanding of some normal activities like sitting standing and tottering around Unless you are a rare physician indeed you know nothing about the process of rising from a chair except to politely conceal your impatience while it is accomplished It would have been better to send me to design school given the fact that every single item marketed to help old people stay in their homes is uglier than ugly making their reliable decision to have nothing to do with it cane walker bathing aids you name it particularly difficult to countermand Furthermore nowhere in the universe does there exist a portable slim elegantly designed mechanically sound reasonably priced chair that a person with no strength or balance can spend a lot of time in and then actually get out of It would have been better much better to send me to clown school to pick up some validated tools for amusing and distracting people It turns out that when a lifelong worker no longer works a reader no longer reads a person who never took a vacation is on a long one miserably elastic time stretches long and wide and heavy in every direction The days may be running out but there are still too many of them and they are all much too long An oncall juggler would be just the ticket Best of all I think would have been the decision to send me to graduate school in philosophy to observe wiser minds making sense of it all possibly to absorb some rudimentary techniques for soaring high above the small sad details to a serene understanding of the bigger picture Or perhaps a few years in aviation school would have provided the same perspective You could certainly say that our family has experienced serious decadeslong shortages of various professionals But doctors  those valiant but limited warriors schooled to think only about their own tiny little battles in an irreversibly lost war  were not among them We probably had one too many of those
