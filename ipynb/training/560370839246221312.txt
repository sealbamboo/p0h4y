David Cameron and Ed Miliband have clashed in the Commons over the NHS amid a row about guidance to hospitals over when they call major incidents Mr Miliband said ministers were making it harder for hospitals to deal with demands on them for political reasons  The NHS was in crisis he said and Mr Cameron had broken a promise at the last election to save  NHS units But Mr Cameron said ministers had not given managers any instructions and Mr Miliband was clasping at straws The future of the NHS dominated Prime Ministers Questions as the Conservatives and Labour continue to argue over the relative performance of the health service in England and Wales in the runup to Mays election In the Commons Mr Cameron brought up figures published on Wednesday showing the proportion of ambulances in Wales where the health service is run by Labour meeting the target response time for the most urgent calls was the worst on record  The prime minister said this was evidence that the NHS was worse in Wales than in England and that cuts to the health service budget in Wales had cost it dear He claimed Mr Miliband was in a desperate mess over the NHS and urged him again to withdraw remarks he reportedly made last year about weaponising the health service as an election issue But the Labour leader said Mr Cameron should apologise for breaking promises on health made in  and accused him of making political propaganda out of the difficulties facing the NHS in Wales Mr Miliband pressed the prime minister on the news that the West Midlands NHS region has issued guidance to hospitals GPs and Ambulance Trusts in their area  which includes Birmingham Coventry and Wolverhampton  on declaring major incidents Todays revelation shows once again that the NHS is in a crisis of his own making on his watch and that is why noone will trust him on the NHS ever again he said But Mr Cameron insisted that ministers had not exerted any pressure on hospitals   It is perfectly clear what is happening he said He is clasping at straws because he is in a desperate mess on the NHS Hospitals in the West Midlands were sent a checklist of criteria to consider before opting to declare a major incident Factors to be weighed up included whether elective operations have been cancelled so staff can be redeployed for emergency care how many ambulances are waiting to deliver patients and the position elsewhere in the surrounding area and whether all alternative bed spaces have been utilised and are staffed The document states this should be used as a guide to the level of information that a trust should have in place before raising any further steps required An internal major incident is activated when a Trust is under significant pressure that is internal to the organisation  and is not the result of an external event   It is a business continuity arrangement where a decision is taken to reduce some services to support higher priority ones A major incident is a significant incident or emergency that cannot be managed within routine service arrangements  It requires the implementation of special procedures and involves one or more of the emergency services the NHS or a local authority   In an email exchange seen by the BBC a head of operations at one NHS Trust in the West Midlands region says he believes the guidelines have been introduced to effectively stop trusts from calling a major incident He writes This is the enhanced criteria that have been introduced by NHS England to effectively stop trusts from calling a major incident Worth sharing with emergency department consultants as our hands will be tied in most cases if they wish to call a major incident for capacity reasons In the same email exchange an AE consultant says It strikes me as an attempt to dampen down the heat and media attention on the emergency departments and their major incidents Answering an urgent question in the House of Commons Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted that he had nothing to do with the move This is a local NHS doing its best to get good guidelines out in a difficult winter he told MPs We must trust the managers and clinicians in our local NHS to take these decisions and support them in doing so Brandishing what he said was a document containing official guidance in the Commons shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said suggestions it was a local matter would not wash as the guidance stated that major incidents must be approved by the on call director at NHS England a national public body Will you today instruct NHS England to withdraw this guidance and issue more appropriate instructions to the NHS in the region he asked  NHS England said the document Mr Burnham had referred to was a national incident response plan it had drawn up in conjunction with the Cabinet Office in January  and sent to every health trust in England The checklist it added was a separate piece of work produced for clinical commissioning groups and oncall area managers in the West Midlands in response to pressures over the recent Christmas holiday period  And a senior NHS executive insisted decisions on major incidents were not taken by ministers but by management locally Before doing so best practice dictates that they take account of the wider impacts on other parts of the NHS so that patient safety in the round is protected said Dr Barbara Hakin National Director of Commissioning Operations for NHS England Thats why NHS Englands local area team in the West Midlands decided to issue these guidelines The government has acknowledged the NHS is facing acute pressures this winter but has defended its performance and said additional funding is being made available  Labour is also facing questions over its health policy with former health secretary Alan Milburn warning it risks retreating into a comfort zone where it is focused on resources rather than reform
