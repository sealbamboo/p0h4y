People born by Caesarean section are more likely to be obese later in life than those born naturally a large analysis suggests The analysis of  births   showed the odds of being obese were  higher The UK researchers say it is important women are informed about the longterm consequences of Caesarean section But experts said it was unclear what was really going on The study showed that for every  vaginal births  adults would go on to be overweight or obese But out of every  born by Caesarean section there would be  On average being born by Csection added half a point to a persons body mass index BMI One of the researchers Dr Matthew Hyde from Imperial College London told the BBC It is an increase of five in  which is a significant concern  It is only a half unit increase in BMI but if you have that increase across a population youll see a large increase in weight and the well publicised sideeffects He said advice around childbirth was tailored to the immediate consequences for baby and mother but longterm issues needed to be raised as well  Previous research has hinted that other conditions such as asthma may be more likely after Caesarean birth There are two main theories about how vaginal birth could protect against obesity However the study cannot prove that Csection makes people fatter as other factors could be at work This could include obese women who are more likely to have obese offspring being more likely to need a Caesarean  Either way researcher Prof Neena Modi said There are good reasons why Csection may be the best option for many mothers and their babies and Csections can on occasion be lifesaving  However we need to understand the longterm outcomes in order to provide the best advice to women who are considering Caesarean delivery Commenting on the study Patrick OBrien a consultant obstetrician and a spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists told the BBC It is important and interesting to flag up this association but it is important to realise that it is hard to know for sure if it is the Caesarean section that led to this or whether something else was the cause He said it was important to be fair to women when advising them about the pros and cons of different methods of delivery and that the theoretical longterm outcomes from vaginal birth would need to be discussed equally
