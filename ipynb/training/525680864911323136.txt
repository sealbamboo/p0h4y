Anyone who has spent much time in Minnesotas Med City cant help but notice that wheelchairs are everywhere From city parking ramps and downtown sidewalks to park trails and the local mall the chairs have an inescapable presence More than likely that has do to with the fact that Rochester is home to Mayo Clinic visited by thousands of patients every day Many of them use wheelchairs to get around So its not surprising that they exist in big numbers The big curiosity is how they end up all over the city with their users nowhere in sight  a fact that some local residents can be oblivious to Denny and Carol Scanlan say empty wheelchairs are just part of the Rochester landscape I never even thought of it until just now Denny Scanlan says over a drink at American Legion Post  where he is a member Well I see them kind of everywhere we go I guess  where you least expect them Yes says his wife with a laugh At the mall In a restaurant  She adds Were so used to it that I dont even notice it But some people do notice the big blue chairs At the Blue Water Salon on the skyway level of the Doubletree Hotel owner Shelly Joseph often sees them just outside her door in a public stairwell largely used by hotel staff I dont know why theyre in here but randomly theyre in this stairwell she says Its a fire exit basically At the Starbucks across the hall manager Dawn LeeBritt sees wheelchairs outside the employee entrance at the back of the coffee shop at least a couple of times a week Sometimes we cant get out she says Im getting used to it because we see them so often She adds Its like they dont need it anymore or its time to go Mayo Clinic has  wheelchairs in its Rochester fleet largely for patient transport It loses up to  chairs each year says general services manager Ralph Marquez who oversees patient equipment At  each that could be as much as  a year Yes its a financial burden to us from that standpoint but its also a service we provide Marquez says And if the patient you know truly comes first sometimes thats the expense of the business Because the clinic does not want to keep patients from leaving the campus the clinics courier service rounds up wheelchairs weekly mostly from hotels and other places that alert them But the chairs can travel much farther than that Weve gotten calls from Orlando Airport Goodwill up in Duluth had one of our chairs and luckily we were able to retrieve that one Weve had them in Denver out east in a few airports Marquez says They get back to us dirty and needing to be cleaned People may take them home for a while They wind up everywhere That includes the Rochester Public Library where communications manager John Hunziker considers wheelchairs normal Im sure if you arent used to Rochester seeing somebody going down the skyway you know pushing an IV on a rolling stand looks kind of weird he says But its just part of living in Rochester And on some days part of Hunzikers job is to let the Mayo Clinic know theres a blue chair to pick up in the lobby
