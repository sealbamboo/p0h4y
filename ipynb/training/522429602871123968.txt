The band Shinedown has been around for more than a decade selling more than  million albums worldwide In  they launched their fourth album Amaryllis which made its debut at No  on the Billboard  But the last year has been more than just about launching a new album for Brent Smith the bands lead singer After battling drug and alcohol addiction becoming obese and being insulted on national television for his weight a loving woman and the inspiration of his son and fans straightened him out he said He traded mindaltering substances for buttkicking workouts and a clean diet dropping almost  pounds The weight came on about four years ago Ive toured for over  years and for the first two records I was doing tons of shows all the time And for those two records I was addicted to cocaine OxyContin and alcohol The coke and the Oxy kept my weight down but for the third album I quit the opiates and started to crave sugar I was still drinking a lot of alcohol and started to pack on the pounds It really stung Im a fan of Meat Loaf but she wasnt talking about a musical comparison It was national television and my heart kind of fell on the ground Im not trying to be disrespectful to Meat Loaf at all because Im a fan But here I am barely  years old and thats the one thing that she says It was like the performance didnt even matter Ill never forget the day my girlfriend Teresa sat me down on the first of November last year and said Listen to me I love you and Im not going anywhere but this lifestyle that youre leading is not going to work She found me a trainer near our house and on Nov  I remember walking into that gym with a bit of a hangover It was a different feeling because I was in really bad shape Im  foot  and weighed  Teresa had told me it was time to get my life back I felt like Id been in a death spiral and I realized I needed to be healthy and strong for my family I have a yearold boy and he was a huge motivation and so were the fans I had an epiphany working out with my trainer that day and I havent had a drink since My trainer asked me what I wanted to accomplish and I knew I was going to be on camera in two months and I told him I wanted to lose  pounds by then He explained that  of my weight loss was going to come from diet and we really cleaned that up You can work out three hours a day but if you live off chili dogs and cheeseburgers it doesnt work My trainer developed a program I could do on the road because right now Im on the road about  days out of the year I do a lot of core and circuit training When youre traveling your backstage and your hotel rooms are where you get your workout in When I get to a gym its good but I do the Insanity DVDs on the road too and the rest of the band does them with me As a band we have done the entire day Insanity program three times now One thing is I look completely different on stage now The stamina I have in my lungs is so much better Now I dont have to wear a big jacket to cover the fat and get overheated Im way more conditioned for the stage and I have a lot more power behind my voice Things that used to be really hard on stage arent as difficult now because Im now in the best shape of my life Its amazing how much clarity I have and how my body feels so much better Health is such a big part of who I am now
