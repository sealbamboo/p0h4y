A new smartphone app that aims to turn ordinary bystanders into heart attack heroes did just that last month saving the life of a yearold truck driver from Portland Oregon who had collapsed outside a gym Drew Basse is the first highprofile rescue attributed to   a free mobile app that alerts users when someone is in cardiac arrest nearby Without people like Scott Brawner I wouldnt have had a second chance said Basse referring to the offduty local firefighter who answered the PulsePoint ping Basse a father of two and grandfather to four is recovering in a Portland rehabilitation center after the May  incident that Brawner said was the highlight of his year career I cant believe that it worked said Brawner  of Tualatin Oregon It was just awesome It still gives me chills Created on a shoestring budget by Richard Price a former San Ramon California fire chief who didnt want to miss an emergency call PulsePoint has gained slow traction since  rolling out to  dispatch centers that now cover some  US cities Weve found that people are very willing to put their hand up and say Ill help said Price More than  people have signed up for PulsePoint so far and more than  have responded to nearly  alerts Every year in the US there are about  outofhospital cardiac arrests or about  a day Experts who research the problem say PulsePoint may be one way to boost the ranks of those who can perform bystander CPR which doubles or triples the chances of surviving Its a great use of technology to enlist the aid of people who are willing and able to help save lives from cardiac arrest said Dr Michael Sayre an emergency medicine doctor with the University of Washington in Seattle and an leader in resuscitation medicine In Basses case he was saved by Brawner who happened to be working out at the same gym Brawners fire district signed up for PulsePoint about a year ago But even he wasnt expecting the alert that showed up on his phone as he walked on the treadmill telling him that someone needed CPR or cardiopulmonary resuscitation right away He saw a map an icon of where he was an icon showing the closet AED or automated external defibrillator  and an icon showing a victim He quickly ran down two flights of stairs I saw a security guard standing in the parking structure and it just didnt look right to me Brawner said Thats where Drew Basse was He was literally sitting in his car unconscious not breathing no pulse In fact Brawner thought he looked like a fresh code firefighter slang for someone who is already dead Brawner pulled Basse out of his car and started performing CPR Within minutes emergency crews arrived and took over but the time that Brawner kept Basses blood pumping was crucial doctors said Thats just what PulsePoint founder Price  had in mind He was a veteran of  years as a firefighter and fire chief focused on improving bystander CPR and rapid response He was at lunch one day when he heard sirens and saw a fire truck pull right up to the business next door I wasnt even aware of it he said I was actually in uniform I had an AED in my car We just werent plugged into those types of calls Using technical skill gleaned from years of operating dispatch centers Price worked with engineering interns from Northern Kentucky University to develop the app Now its updated and maintained by the firm Workday which provides technical services for free Communities from Anaheim California to Orlando Florida have signed on to PulsePoint but progress has been slow There are some worries about the costs of implementing the app  about  per center  and about paying for the marketing necessary to set it up Some experts worry about invading peoples medical privacy by responding said Sayre Others wonder whether rescuers will really get to patients first and whether enough people will sign up to make it worthwhile Still Price hopes the app is gaining favor with folks who like the odds of directing willing bystanders to the exact site of an emergency instead of just hoping someone will step up We really do have the chance to make a huge impact on a daily basis he said
