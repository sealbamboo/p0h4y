In a major milestone Aimee Copeland the Georgia graduate student who contracted flesheating bacteria after a ziplining accident is learning to use two stateofthe art prosthetic hands  The hightech hands may one day allow her to do the kinds of things most of us take for granted cooking cleaning driving a car  In May  a wound Copeland sustained in her accident developed necrotizing fasciitis the clinical name for flesheating bacteria That infection nearly killed her To save Copelands life doctors had to amputate her left leg right foot and both hands  Its been a long road coming back from that  Sometimes I wake up and Im just like Oh my God is this my life Copeland laughed as she spoke to NBCs Gabe Gutierrez in a segment that aired on TODAY Friday This is crazy The good news for Copeland is the field of prosthetics has made remarkable advances in recent decades Eventually she should be able to do with her prosthetic hands pretty much whatever she wants to Robert Kistenberg her prosthetist told TODAYcom Kistenberg is the codirector and prosthetics coordinator at Georgia Institute of Technology  In the TODAY segment Copeland showed off what shes already learned to do with her new hands such as sign her name slice strawberries and chop cucumbers She also shook hands with Gutierrez being careful not to grip so hard that shed squash his hand Over time Copeland is learning how to control her hands by flexing and contracting the muscles in her residual limbs In time shell learn not only how to move the hands and their fingers but also how to modulate how hard they grip  Each time we flex or contract a muscle there is a chemical and an electrical reaction Kistenberg explained to TODAYcom That electrical signal is very very slight he said But our electrodes are sensitive enough to pick it up through the skin Copeland has to learn which muscles she needs to use to get the hands and fingers to move where and how she wants Right now that means a lot of trial and error Its almost like a muscle memory with these things Copeland said You know its like you got to find the sweet spot and be able to pick things up naturally And thatll come with time  Eventually Kistenberg told TODAYcom many of the everyday movements will become second nature for Copeland and she wont have to consciously think about them  Copelands prostehtic hands are made by Touch Bionics and would normally cost  each But because Copeland will serve as a spokesperson for the company shes getting them for free  Since Copelands arms were amputated above the wrist Kistenberg had to create new partial forearms that contained custom sockets that fit over her residual limbs like gloves over hands The forearms will contain the electrodes that read the electrical signals from Copelands residual limbs as well as the batteries that power everything Copeland is a fast learner Kistenberg said There are things that shes done in two days three days that it takes other people  months or a year to gain control over these devices How long before shes good at maneuvering them  Shes very smart and very adept Kistenberg said I wouldnt be surprised if in the next month or two shell be able to use them without thinking about it Copeland is excited about how the new hands will change her life Im really looking forward to cooking with these and to cleaning my house she told Gutierrez Im sort of OCD so it seems like a weird thing to want to do but I really want to clean At the same time Copeland has been finishing off her masters degree in psychology After that she plans to start a program in social work  Copeland never forgets that shes been given a new lease on life  Sometimes honestly I look at pictures of how I was before and I feel almost disconnected from that person because my perspective now is so different than the point of view of that girl she told Gutierrez And so in a way it almost feels like I died a year ago and I was reborn as someone different Related
