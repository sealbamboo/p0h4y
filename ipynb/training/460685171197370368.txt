Men seek it out to combat low energy and decreased sex drive Prescription testosterone has become so popular that socalled low T clinics are becoming common sights in cities and suburbs The number of testosterone prescriptions written in the US more than tripled in the past decade But researchers suspect that much of the testosterone dispensed at lowT clinics isnt tracked since its often bought with cash This unfettered flow of testosterone  officially a controlled substance  has raised concerns among doctors who specialize in hormonal problems In most doctors offices you dont see a big shingle over their door saying Get your testosterone here  says  a board certified urologist and the medical director of the   at El Camino Hospital in Los Gatos Calif Karpman says lowT clinics arent in the business of treating the complex medical problems that often masquerade as low energy and decreased sex drive Those can include sleep apnea depression and perhaps most importantly heart disease Any man who presents especially in his s and s with new onset erectile dysfunction is at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and even heart attack or myocardial infarction says Karpman Hormone treatment itself isnt without risk A recent  of more than  men found a doubling of heartattack risk among older men who used testosterone Younger men who had a history of heart disease had a higher incidence of nonfatal heart attacks In addition men who are on prolonged highlevel testosterone replacement therapy can experience testicular shrinkage Yet even as calls for closer scrutiny of the treatment intensify the clinics continue to draw in men like Greg Lucas At  Lucas was single and a rising star at a Dallas software company But he didnt quite feel right  his energy his sleep his libido were all lagging He was having trouble managing his weight too His symptoms sounded a lot like those described in an  for low testosterone So Lucas decided to do what the ad recommended talk to his doctor His first response was OK lets do a blood test and see where youre at  recalls Lucas Following that my blood test returned a rating that was in the normal range for the lab and he said that was fine Lucas protested His levels after all were in the bottom  percent of normal  that seemed out of step for a yearold man Lucas was seriously overweight and his doctor advised him to diet and get more exercise The problems persisted though and Lucas pressed his doctor for the next three years or so about testosterone treatment Each time he got the brushoff Lucas did manage to start exercising at a gym but he wasnt losing much weight Then a coach mentioned that testosterone treatment could be the answer to his mothballed mojo and suggested he get a second opinion at a lowT clinic He started searching online and ended up calling a clinic in Dallas He was impressed Finally it seemed someone was listening to him They did a blood test and found my testosterone level to be even lower than the last time I had it tested and they said We would absolutely recommend that you start treatment right away  Lucas says Lucas says the testosterone therapy changed his life He lost weight and got his energy back He only wishes his regular doctor would treat him for low T so that his insurance would cover the bills Despite Lucas positive experience the risks and health benefits of longterm testosterone therapy are not well understood The   is reassessing the safety of testosterone products A spokesperson reiterated the agencys own guidelines None of the products approved by the FDA should be prescribed unless low testosterone is associated with a medical condition Some doctors warn patients to stay away from lowT clinics   is one of those doctors He heads the   part of the professional association for endocrinologists which has released clinical   for testosterone therapy Anawalt calls the lowT clinics sex hormone factories that promote all the potential virtues and great myths about how testosterone may solve all problems Theyre really out to prescribe as much testosterone as they possibly can and its not clear that all these practices are completely safe he says But theres no evidence that the clinics are unsafe either State medical boards typically investigate only when patients file complaints and there hasnt been an outpouring of accusations against the clinics But a review of physicians working for a number of lowT clinics found that very few specialized in urology or endocrinology Instead one doctor at a Chicago clinic and another in Fort Lauderdale were anesthesiologists in Houston an allergist in Phoenix an osteopath and in Washington DC an obstetriciangynecologist There is some hope that state or federal governments will start to crack down and regulate unscrupulous prescription of testosterone to men and perhaps they will review the practices of these clinics says Anawalt The clinics themselves say theyre legitimate medical practices Dr Bill Reilly is the chief medical officer at   one of the largest chains of lowT clinics based in Southlake Texas His company has  offices and some  patients Reilly says patients must have a diagnosed medical condition Our No  complaint at Low T is Why wont you treat me We just dont see a patient Hey here you go Heres some testosterone  Reilly says They go through a complete history physical thorough evaluation We go through their symptoms Reilly says some  men have been turned away from his clinics with no treatment because they dont meet the medical definition of low testosterone And those with sleep apnea or high blood pressure or other serious illnesses are encouraged to see their family doctor Before joining Low T Center Reilly was a joint surgeon He doesnt believe medical training in urology or endocrinology is necessary to do the job well You dont need to be an endocrinologist You dont need to be a urologist says Reilly Were all doctors And we study more about testosterone than they do We basically follow the national endocrinology guidelines Reilly says the growing criticism from others in the medical community is perhaps just ignorance and fear of competition After all Low T Center expects to more than double its number of sites in the next year reaching perhaps as many as  patients
