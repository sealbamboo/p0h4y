Patients should be moved out of busy AE units when they become so overcrowded or so short of nurses that their safety is in danger the governments health advisers will urge hospitals The recommendation is contained in advice from the National Institute for   and Care Excellence Nice on how the NHS can ensure that AE departments always have enough nurses on duty A surge in the number of patients turning up at AE should also prompt hospitals to put in place emergency measures including bringing in extra staff from other wards it says In its draft guidance Nice tells hospitals that they should develop escalation plans to address risk to patient care posed by variation in demand for AE services variation in nursing needs and departmental overcrowding Those contingency plans could include moving patients out of the AE department to an appropriate alternative location and sourcing extra staff for example using an oncall system according to Nices advice published on Friday It does not specify what other types of ward or department AE patients could be taken to but some hospitals already operate overflow wards near their AE  are also told to ensure that escalation plans mean that they can make the AE department safe if departmental crowding cannot be resolved and respond to deficits in AE nursing staff without compromising patient care in other parts of the hospital Nices advice is likely to result in hospitals increasing the number of nurses on duty in AE more than they already have since Robert Francis QCs report in February  into the  Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal The watchdog also set out the minimum number of nurses it believes are needed to look after certain types of patient For example there should be one registered nurse for each cubicle in triage one for every four cubicles containing patients with minor or more serious illnesses and one for every two cubicles in the resuscitation area Even more nurses are needed to ensure that the most unwell patients receive safe highquality care Nice adds It recommends that two registered nurses should be on duty to look after every patient who has suffered a major trauma or a cardiac arrest and that one nurse look after every patient who has arrived as a priority ambulance call AE units in England are coming under unprecedented pressure stemming from rising demand driven by the ageing population and people with longterm conditions Earlier this month AE units recorded their worst ever performance against the target of treating  of patients within four hours In a note to colleagues passed to a local newspaper earlier this week a senior hospital nurse at Cardiff University Hospital said that the pressures of working in AE were worse than when she had worked in Iraq during the second war there Questions are already being asked about how hospitals will manage to hire more AE nurses given that many are already having trouble recruiting and retaining as many as they need at a time of growing demand for AE care Dr Peter Carter chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing warned that an existing chronic lack of AE nurses could take years to resolve Stafftopatient ratios are important but we may be years away from having a permanent solution to this problem even if the level of demand stays the same If it rises further this will be even more difficult he said Andy Burnham the shadow health secretary said This clear guidance is welcome but many hospitals are nowhere near this level The government needs to set out how it will meet this plan
