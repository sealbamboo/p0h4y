The real important issue is that he hit his head multiple times  small hits big hits in baseball and outside of baseball said Robert Stern cofounder of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at BU When it comes to the development of CTE our current sense is that it requires repetitive brain trauma and not just a couple of big concussions Freel committed suicide last December at the age of  Testing of his brain tissue after death  the only way to definitively diagnose CTE  found that he had Stage  CTE which is associated with erratic behavior and memory loss  Stage  the worst possible expression of the disease is associated with fullblown dementia aggression and paranoia The brain tissue of people found to have CTE displays an abnormal buildup of tau  a protein that when it spills out of cells can choke off or disable neural pathways controlling things like memory judgment and fear Freels stepfather Clark Vargas said on Sunday that the new diagnosis confirmed what he suspected already It provides some solace that there is a reason now for Ryan having done what he did Vargas said Knowing that hes been suffering for  years and that CTE is a progressive disease it gives explanation for some of the irrational things that he may have done You know he had a reason The disease tends to be associated with bruising sports like football and hockey where repetitive brain trauma is part of the game But Freels case suggests that professional baseball a somewhat punishing sport in its own right may have a growing concussion problem We count everything else We count the atbats We count the  hitter We count the number of pitches and the pitcher cannot go more than a certain number of pitches Why not count the number of concussions and pay special attention to this like everything else his stepfather said This season  baseball players were placed on the disabled list after concussions   of them were catchers  In   players were placed on the DL after a concussion and in  the number was  according to MLB data I think people dont realize that baseball players get hurt as much as they do said Freels mother Norma Vargas Baseball is just as dangerous as other sports and she added affords players less protection Its just a helmet and thats it And players wear the helmet only when batting  I cringe when I see two guys going after the same ball said Stern a professor of neurology and neurosurgery at BUs School of Medicine  Is baseball as significant a concussion sport compared to others No Is it a concussion sport Yes In a statement issued Sunday evening Major League Baseball said it was working with experts to remain proactive on concussions and head injuries Major League Baseballs thoughts remain with Ryan Freels family friends and all those he touched throughout his life the league said Ryan played baseball with love and passion and made a lasting impression on and off the field We recently met in person with Ryans mother and stepfather and expressed to them our feelings about Ryan and discussed MLBs continued efforts to provide a safe environment for our players In response to increasing concussion diagnoses the sport is instituting educational programs and rules changes like a ban on home plate collisions beginning as early as  Ryans life and death ought to mean something and because of him we can institute changes how baseball is played Clark Vargas said Its going to take some time to do it in the major leagues but certainly we can do something about it next year  about the kids playing Pop Warner and Little League Freels mother is unsure whether those types of changes had they happened sooner might have altered her sons fate It could have said Norma Vargas  I think it would have been a good idea if they would have educated players However she said I dont think that would have changed his style of play Freels style was relentless and fierce During his eightyear career with five MLB clubs Freel estimated that he had  concussions Family members say it was likely higher than that His concussion history started young  He was only  years old when he ran into the side of a moving car  Age  marked the first time that he lost consciousness after a concussion when he injured himself jumping from a bed He lived life at one speed and that was a fast speed said his mother Suspicions that he could have CTE began percolating among family and friends after Freel killed himself a year ago But he had had problems for a long time before he died For several years he struggled with depression and drug and alcohol abuse  And only months before his death he and his wife of  years divorced These types of problems  which are echoed in other CTE cases  raise questions about how big a role the disease plays in suicides among players and how things like preexisting mental health problems or postcareer adjustment issues influence the cause of death Among the football players who showed signs of the disease and took their own lives are former Philadelphia Eagles defensive back Andre Waters who shot himself in  Terry Long a former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman who killed himself by drinking antifreeze and Junior Seau the former linebacker who killed himself last year at the age of  Former NFL players Dave Duerson Shane Dronett and Ray Easterling also committed suicide and were later diagnosed with CTE If you hit your head a lot it may increase your risk for this disease said Stern  Whether or not the disease was the cause of or accentuated the depression and substance abuse and impulse problems Freel had we dont know But he required more attention and treatment than he got Because of limited data and a study population that is skewed toward people exposed to repetitive brain trauma scientists   including BU researchers  caution against overinterpreting case studies like Freels We can learn a lot about diseases by studying these higherrisk populations said Dr J Clay Goodman professor of pathology immunology and neurology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston  Until we know much more about CTE however it is not possible to generalize about the risk of development even in elite athletes much less more casual athletes or the population at large Freels family including his exwife had said that a CTE diagnosis would tie up loose ends emotionally  and give them muchneeded closure Norma Vargas says a big concern for her is how the CTE diagnosis will affect the narrative of Freels life for his three young daughters Hes gone no matter what she said  But I want that closure for his daughters She wants them to know that he didnt kill himself because he didnt love them or he did it because he was mad at the world It was not that way he was killed by the disease
