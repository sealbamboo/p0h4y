Antipsychotic drugs have helped many people with serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder But for older people with Alzheimers or other forms of dementia they can be deadly The Food and Drug Administration has given these drugs a   saying they can increase the risk of heart failure infections and death Yet almost  nursing home residents still get them So in  the federal government started a campaign to get nursing homes to reduce their use of these drugs But an NPR analysis of government data shows that the government rarely penalizes nursing homes when they dont get with the program Take Texas for example More than a quarter of nursing home residents there still get antipsychotic drugs Since the beginning of the federal initiative the nationwide average has dropped below  percent That puts Texas in last place compared with other states and the District of Columbia So Texas is playing catchup The state recently conducted a series of trainings to teach nursing home employees that there are alternatives to giving residents powerful drugs Nursing home activities director Roxanne Stengel attended a session in Houston Shes been in the business for a long time So it was not a surprise to her that Texas was in last place I saw my fair share Stengel says of seeing the drugs used as a form of control and restraint in some of her previous workplaces Thats pitiful she says Theres got to be a better way In fact the point of the Houston training event was to show that there   a better way to manage the anxiety or aggression that sometimes goes with dementia Its one element of the national campaign started by the federal   to reduce the use of antipsychotics in nursing homes The approach being taught is sometimes called individualized care The idea is that if nursing home employees know enough about a resident they can figure out the reason behind challenging behavior and deal with it without resorting to antipsychotic drugs For example what should you do if youre caring for a resident who wont go to sleep and wanders the halls all night Well if you know he used to be a night watchman you can just continue to treat him like one The world wont come to an end if you deviate from the schedule and let him sleep during the day These principles should not have come as a surprise to the people at the training session in Houston CMS sent out a series of DVDs with similar training to every nursing home in the nation two years ago But for whatever reason most Texas nursing homes lost the DVDs according to Carmen Castro the nursing home ombudsman for Harris County She has offered to bring her DVDs to nursing homes and conduct onsite training but shes had few takers Maybe less than  Castro says and we have  nursing homes here in Harris County The federal government calls its campaign to reduce nursing homes use of antipsychotic drugs a partnership And the partners are the states like Texas as well as nonprofit groups and the nursing home industry itself I think the program is an example of a real success between the government and the private sector says   Hes the president and CEO of the American Health Care Association which represents more than twothirds of the nations nursing homes The statistics in Texas may not be good but Parkinson is focused on the bigger picture Nationally the use of antipsychotics in nursing homes has dropped by more than  percent since the partnership with the federal government began I think that the data will continue to show that collaboration works says Parkinson and that conflict and fighting dont work  But considering the poor showing in Texas maybe collaboration doesnt always work either An NPR analysis of federal government data found that even though Texas nursing homes have the highest rate of antipsychotic drug use in the nation they are   likely to be censured for it than nursing homes in most other states No surprise there says   a senior policy attorney with the Center for Medicare Advocacy We havent seen any evidence that in this particular area of antipsychotic drugs the CMS is taking action against states Edelman says that what the government needs to do is enforce the   that was passed  years ago That law says residents have a right to be free from chemical restraints It also says that nursing home residents should only receive antipsychotics if the drugs are medically necessary And remember the drugs are not approved by the FDA to treat symptoms of dementia Edelman says the government needs to stop thinking of the nursing home industry as a partner The initiative has been all about training teaching cajoling encouraging but not enforcing the law she says But   chief medical officer of the CMS says that the government takes its regulatory and enforcement duties incredibly seriously Its the strongest lever we have The penalties for giving residents unnecessary medication can range from a plan of correction to civil fines to being kicked out of the Medicare and Medicaid programs We try to use the full array of enforcement Conway says including harsh penalties But again NPRs analysis of CMS data found that harsh penalties are almost never used when nursing home residents get unnecessary drugs of any kind Inspectors grade these deficiencies according to the severity of the offense And only  percent of the infractions were ranked at a level that might trigger a fine or worse Conways explanation There are many near misses whether its hospitals or nursing homes where medication might be given thats not needed and doesnt cause permanent harm We view that as a learning opportunity Conway points out that the initiative is ongoing The agencys new goal for nursing homes is an additional  percent reduction in antipsychotic drug use by the end of  But even if that goal is met it will mean that after a fiveyear effort almost a quarter of a million nursing home residents will still be getting largely unnecessary and potentially lethal antipsychotic drugs
