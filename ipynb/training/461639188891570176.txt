Its a rock adage that if the musics too loud youre too old but a new study finds that all that sound adds up Professional musicians are almost four times more likely to suffer noiseinduced hearing loss than other people Thats according to whats likely the largest study to date of hearing disorders linked to people who pursue music as an occupation German researchers who combed through health insurance records of  million people from  to  found that working musicians topped the charts for hearing loss The professionals were also about  percent more likely to suffer tinnitus  constant ringing in the ears  as a result of their jobs according to scientists at the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology Given the number of professional musicians and the severity of the outcome  hearing loss in professional musicians is of high public health importance Dr Wolfgang Ahrens and his colleagues concluded In the German study of the  million people aged  to  more than  were professional musicians Some  cases of hearing loss were logged with  cases among musicians Overall the pros were  times more likely to suffer noiseinduced deafness The data may be new but the problem isnt according to experts and advocates whove warned about noiseinduced hearing loss for years Im an old punk rocker Ive dedicated my life to it said Kathy Peck executive director of HEAR  Hearing Education and Awareness for Rockers  who founded her group  years ago with help from Pete Townshend of The Who When I started no one believed it even existed Townshend is one of several Alist rockers who has publicly discussed hearing loss and tinnitus Others include Ozzy Osbourne Neil Young and Phil Collins who quit music in  because of medical issues including losing hearing Hearing loss wasnt regarded as a serious problem years ago certainly not with the same priority as losing sight said NBCs Dr Nancy Snyderman an ear nose and throat specialist But it was happening just the same Weve known for decades now that noiseinduced hearing loss especially in rock concerts predisposed a new generation to hearing loss said Snyderman who wasnt surprised at the latest findings Noiseinduced hearing loss can be caused by sudden loud sounds such as explosions or gunfire but it can also be caused by repeated exposure to loud noise Whether its orchestra players on stage or in the pit or rock musicians near loud speakers professionals are constantly exposed to levels of sound loud enough to threaten or actually harm hearing Hearing loss starts with long or repeated exposures to sounds at or above  decibels according to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders Consider that a symphonic orchestra peaks at  decibels to  decibels and a fullthrottle rock concert tops  decibels and you can see the problem Loud sounds can damage microscopic hair cells known as stereocilia that line the ear Those hair cells dont grow back so the loss is permanent the NIDCD says In many people it leads to muffled or distorted sounds or the need to use hearing aids to amplify sound Thats certainly the case for Trevor Specht  of Lutherville Maryland who has been a professional musician for  years including the past  with Chopteeth an Afrofunk big band He was diagnosed with significant hearing loss a year ago and also has mild tinnitus I play saxophone but Im standing next to the drums and the cymbals are at ear level he said Almost every musician I know has hearing loss even if they wont admit it He wears musicians ear plugs now devices that protect the ears from loud sounds while also allowing the wearers to hear clearly But he didnt wear them when he was younger and didnt think about protecting his hearing Now over the course of a gig it gets louder until at the end of the night oh my ears feel really messed up he said Recent studies had suggested that musicians have better hearing overall than the general population and that their occupation actually increases sensitivity But the German researchers said the risks posed by hearing loss far outweigh the benefits of enhanced hearing ability The German study authors also stress that the high incidence of hearing loss in musicians calls for preventive actions and internationally accepted standards Musicians should be offered protective ear plugs but also soundprotecting shields between the sections of an orchestra they said For musicians hearing loss is a particularly ironic problem Specht said Its the primary tool of a musician he said No matter what kind of music you play or what kind of instrument you play you need your ears
