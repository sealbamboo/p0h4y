If you turn on a radio in Zimbabwe these days it wont be long before you hear a public service spot featuring the voice of a deejay who goes by the name Napster the Radio Master  tells his audience that just before he got married he decided to get circumcised so that my wife would find me clean and desirable He also notes that he later found out that circumcision helps protect women from contracting cervical cancer  adding Well that was just the cherry on top The ad is a centerpiece of an unprecedented campaign in Africa over the past several years to promote circumcision as a way to prevent HIV This week researchers announced that the program has reached a   Six million men and teenagers were convinced But the goal is to get  million more to sign up by  and even at the current pace public health officials are not on track to achieve that number So they believe they need to change their message Thats why Napster doesnt mention the words HIV or AIDS in his radio spot The drive to circumcise men kicked off in  African countries after studies demonstrated that getting circumcised reduces a mans chances of contracting HIV by   Removing the foreskin creates a less hospitable environment for the virus Health officials then ran the numbers They determined that if  percent of teenage and adult men in  countries in Southern and Eastern Africa  where circumcision is not commonly practiced  were to get the cut by  there would be  million fewer new infections through  At first just stating the purpose of the campaign seemed sufficient But for a lot of men the downsides of going under the knife just dont seem worth the benefit Its not an easy sell you know Its probably the greatest marketing challenge of all times says Dino Rech head of the   who has helped lead the effort to circumcise men in South Africa Rech says men fear circumcision will be painful Theyre also deterred by the prospect of having to wait six weeks before they can have sex again Men in Zimbabwe had similar complaints says   Some men also worried about the HIV test that everyone must take before the operation Mahvu notes Others told him their wife objected  asking their husband why he would worry about HIV unless he were planning to cheat Then there were the rumors that the circumcision drive was a plot to sterilize men Or that the foreskins could be used for witchcraft But Mahvus research also pointed to a way forward He asked those men who did volunteer why they signed up While a lot of them talked about HIV they also gave reasons that had nothing to do with the disease Being circumcised is more hygienic they said They also believed women would find them more attractive and that they would last longer during sex Thats essentially the message Zimbabwes campaign is now focusing on Over the past five months officials have enlisted a whos who of celebrities to spread the word that circumcision is cool Along with Napster theres a famous footballer a major gospel singer an eminent poet and   who is perhaps Zimbabwes most famous musician He produced a procircumcision song that became an instant hit On top of their radio and television spots the celebrities are appearing at concerts and touring clinics Its working Zimbabwes men are showing up in droves   a month All of which raises a question Is it fair to promote an operation for reasons different from the true motives behind the campaign Its not lying to people We have to promote getting circumcised says Karin Hatzold a public health physician with   who helped shape Zimbabwes marketing campaign She points out that HIV rates there have fallen significantly over the past decade So while its still a problem HIV may not be the most pressing concern on peoples minds And for a circumcision campaign to work Hatzold concludes you have to talk to people about what worries them  not what you think they should worry about
