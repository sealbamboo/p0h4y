The latest information comes from   The nonprofit ranked hospitals based on the number of Csections performed at each Looking at hospital billing records the authors found the number of procedures performed vary wildly  even at hospitals in the same town   In Texas for instance  of births at El Pasos University Medical Center are Csections four miles away at Sierra Medical Center the rate is more than double that at    The Denver Health Medical Center earned Consumer Reports highest rating for low rate of Csections Doctors delivered  of babies by Csection at Denvers PresbyterianSt Lukes Medical Center by comparison  of the lowrisk deliveries were Csections The report looked at more than  hospitals in  states Not all states make such information available  something Consumer Reports said it hopes will change   Overall  of the hospitals in the report earned the organizations lowest or secondlowest rating for a high rate of Csections Only  got either of the organizations top scores for a low rate  The variation is what gets you that really is the thing said   director of Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center If you compare peer hospitals in urban areas that treat the same kind of patients  meaning they share similar socioeconomic issues  to have wildly different rates suggests that there is a problem here Sometimes Csections are medically necessary meaning either the life of the mother or her fetus would be endangered by a vaginal birth But several studies found surgical births are being performed for lowrisk pregnancies too  Csections are generally considered safe compared with vaginal births but the surgery carries risks including infection increased bleeding reactions to anesthesia and blood clots    The rates vary  as well according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention More Csections are performed in the South compared with the Mountain States the West Coast and the Upper Midwest which tend to have the lowest rates   The South does have higher diabetes and obesity rates Both lead to more medically challenged deliveries as does the mothers age The older she is the more complications she may have Overall nearly  women now give birth by Csection according to the CDC That number has made medical associations uncomfortable Making note of other studies that look at regional variations in surgical birth rates the   and   issued guidelines in March  doctors make more informed decisions about which mothers need Csections   The high number of surgical births plus the fact that fewer women or children die these days during the childbirth process raises significant concern that cesarean delivery is overused according to the recommendations  lead author of the report and recommendations said he hopes these guidelines will raise awareness about this issue Over the next five years I would hope we will see a slow decline in the rate Caughey said But it will be contingent on more people embracing the message and will have to involve people at the grassroots level doing things in their practice that changes this trend  The medical community started to see the number of Csections going up during the s when there was an increase in the ability to monitor the fetus heartbeat We didnt always know precisely how to interpret the data Caughey said adding at the time there was a general abandonment of more aggressive vaginal deliveries The medical community still needs better research on fetal heart rates he said Monitoring the heart rate can tell a doctor if a fetus is in distress   Doctors also do Csections if they believe labor is going on too long according to the recommendations However that decision may be based on outdated research according to Consumer Reports and other studies The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for MaternalFetal Medicine do recommend that normal labor should be a longer process than initially thought and concluded doctors should be more patient in the first and second phase of labor  Doctors should not induce labor unless its an absolute medical necessity according to the recommendations Encouraging a woman to give birth before her body is ready increases the likelihood shell need a surgical birth Doctors often perform Csections if there is a possibility the baby will be large The new guidelines said that may not always be warranted A baby should be more than  pounds before inducing labor Everyone can do better Caughey said   Consumer Reports Peter agrees saying that the women she talks to often dont know the extra health risks of having a Csection    We want to get a dialogue going Peter said We want the patient to go to her doctor and say Id like for us to find ways to avoid a Csection if possible Find a doctor that meets your needs in all practice patterns Most doctors likely will not know the number of Csections they perform Caughey said  Even if a doctor does know it the rate of the surgical deliveries they perform still may not give patients the perspective they would need A doctor doing general rounds for instance could have to finish up a procedure another doctor started  Or a doctor could be seeing a disproportionately older heavier and sicker population which would affect his or her rates of Csections  Caughey suggests women ask doctors about their general philosophy on Csections   I think a healthy dialogue is always important for any kind of medical care he said
