A growing number of high school seniors are getting into cars after smoking pot or with someone who has a distressing trend that reflects misperceptions about the dangers of marijuana researchers said Thursday An estimated  percent of high school seniors reported riding in a car in the past two weeks with a driver who had used drugs or alcohol or said they had driven after using drugs or alcohol themselves researchers found While driving after drinking has declined in recent years driving after use of marijuana has increased from  percent in  to  percent in  according to the most recent survey data from from the Monitoring the Future project in which  high school seniors at  schools nationwide are interviewed every year A higher percentage of students reported driving after using marijuana than after having five or more alcoholic drinks the researchers wrote in a report published in the American Journal of Public Health Its a big deal the sheer numbers Patrick OMalley a research professor at the University of Michigan told NBC News It has been increasing steadily and looking down the road it seems likely to get worse We are concerned The confidential questionnaires did not ask seniors about the amount of marijuana smoked or who they got in the car with like a parent or friends Another problem confounding researchers is how to determine how much marijuana is too much there is no comparable DUI standard We dont have any good degree of impairment OMalley said adding that the country remains a long way off from setting such standards Its almost impossible to say what the level of marijuana in your system is The study sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found it didnt matter where the students lived The increases in marijuana use were the same in four geographic regions  The behavior was fairly widespread throughout society the researchers reported  OMalley said the trend is troubling reflecting a softening in the attitudes against marijuana that has got to be filtering down to the kids Although marijuana is illegal under federal law Washington and Colorado permit  and  states plus Washington DC allow    One of the messages is that kids dont see these things as as dangerous as they should he said Its distressing certainly concerning worrying Its a matter we really need to pay more attention to Stephen Gray Wallace a senior adviser for Students Against Destructive Decisions said the report only strengthened his own groups concern Im very concerned when you do the math which we did Wallace says That means of  million driving age teenagers as many as  million impaired teenagers may be on the road Thats a problem Wallace added particularly with the disturbing tendency of teenagers who say they dont think pot is a problem with driving Its a real call to action for parents they need to get young people to hold the line on the legal drinking age and know what constitutes safe driving behind the wheel
