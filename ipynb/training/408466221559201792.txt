As far back as the s couples have been asked to strap on monitors bloodpressure cuffs oxygen masks and other paraphernalia and copulate to scientifically quantify the impacts of sex The focus is often on whether sex can kill you by precipitating a heart attack Happily these studies generally show that heart rates rise during intercourse but tolerably In a  study middleaged subjects heart rates jumped at the point of orgasm by only  beats per minute in men and  in women about the same response as if theyd just done a few jumping jacks The risk for sexrelated cardiac arrest is in fact vanishingly small statistics show though it may be greater when the act is extramarital The issue of sex as exercise however has remained largely unexplored There are these myths including that sex burns at least  calories per session said Antony D Karelis a professor of exercise science at the University of Quebec at Montreal who undertook a study   to look at how much energy is actually exerted during sex But nobody had tested those assumptions To do so Karelis and his colleagues recruited  young heterosexual committed couples from the local area and had them jog on treadmills for  minutes while researchers monitored their energy expenditure and other metrics in order to provide a comparison for the physical demands of sex The scientists next gave their volunteers unobtrusive armband activity monitors that gauge exertion in terms of calories and METs or metabolic equivalent of task a physiological measure comparing an activity to sitting perfectly still which is a MET task Then the scientists sent the couples home instructing them to complete at least one sex act a week for a month while wearing the armbands and to fill out questionnaires about how each session made them feel physically and psychologically especially compared with running on the treadmill When the researchers analyzed all of the resulting data it was clear Karelis said that sex qualified as moderate exercise a MET activity for men and MET activity for women Thats the equivalent according to various estimates of playing doubles tennis or walking uphill The jogging by comparison was more strenuous an MET activity for the men in the study and  for women Though some men according to their activity monitors used more energy for brief periods during sex than they did jogging The sex also burned four calories per minute for men and three per minute for women during sessions that ranged from  to  minutes including foreplay The average was  minutes Men burned about  calories per minute jogging and women about  Over all the data reveal that sex can be considered at times a significant exercise Karelis said worth encouraging in people who otherwise balk at working out Ninetyeight percent of Kareliss volunteers reported that sex felt more fun than jogging The other  percent I suspect will be back in the dating market soon
