To clamp down on health care costs a growing number of employers and insurers are putting limits on how much theyll pay for certain medical services such as knee replacements lab tests and complex imaging A recent study found that savings from such moves may be modest however and some analysts question whether reference pricing as its called is good for consumers The California Public Employees Retirement System CalPERS which administers the health insurance benefits for  million state workers retirees and their families has one of the   More than three years ago CalPERS began using reference pricing for elective knee and hip replacements two common procedures for which hospital prices varied widely without discernible differences in quality says Ann Boynton who helps set benefits policies at CalPERS Working with Anthem Blue Cross the CalPERS set  as the reference price for those two surgeries in its preferred provider organization plan Members who get surgery at one of the  hospitals that charge  or less pay only their plans regular costsharing If member choose to use an innetwork hospital that charges more than the reference price however theyre on the hook for the entire amount over  and the extra spending doesnt count toward their annual maximum outofpocket limit Boynton says Were not worried about people not getting the care they need says Boynton They have access to good hospitals theyre just getting it at a reasonable price In two years CalPERS saved nearly  million on those two procedures and members saved  in lower cost sharing according to   by James C Robinson a professor of health economics at the University of California Berkeley and director of the Berkeley Center for Health Technology Most of the savings came from   at expensive hospitals The agency recently set caps on how much it would spend for cataract surgery colonoscopies and arthroscopic surgery Boynton says Those who have studied reference pricing say it is most appropriate for common nonemergency procedures or tests that vary widely in price but are generally comparable in quality Research has generally shown that higher prices for medical services dont mean their quality is higher Setting a reference price steers consumers to highquality doctors hospitals labs and imaging centers that perform well for the price proponents say Others point out that reference pricing doesnt necessarily save employers a lot of money however A   released earlier this month by the National Institute for Health Care Reform examined the  claims data for  autoworkers and their dependents both active and retired It analyzed roughly  highvolume andor highpriced inpatient and ambulatory medical services that reference pricing might reasonably be applied to The overall potential savings was  percent the study found It was surprising that even with all that pricing variation reference pricing doesnt have a more dramatic impact on spending says Chapin White a senior policy researcher at RAND and lead author of the study Even though the results may be modest a growing number of very large companies are incorporating reference pricing according to benefits consultant Mercers annual employer health insurance survey The percentage of employers with  or more employees that used reference pricing grew from  percent in  to  percent in  the survey found Thirty percent said they were considering adding reference pricing the survey found Among employers with  or fewer workers adoption was flat at  percent in  compared with  percent in  This spring the Obama administration said that large group and selfinsured health plans   The health law   on how much consumers have to pay out of pocket annually for innetwork care before insurance picks up the whole tab  in  its  for an individual and  for a family plan But if consumers choose providers whose prices are higher than a plans reference price those amounts dont count toward the outofpocket maximum the administration guidance said Leaving consumers on the hook for amounts over the reference price needlessly drags them into the battle between providers and health plans over prices says White You expect the health plan to do a few things negotiate reasonable prices with providers and not to enter into network contracts with providers who provide bad quality care White says Reference pricing is kind of an admission that health plans have failed on one or both of those fronts
