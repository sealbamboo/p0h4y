A liberal thinktank closely allied with the Obama administration is proposing a health care spending plan it says could save hundreds of billions of dollars in entitlement spending without hurting middle and lowincome patients The   from the   comes as Congress prepares for a battle royal over the socalled   Thats the combination of tax increases and spending cuts that happen automatically unless lawmakers and the president can reach a deal before the end of the year Democrats have been demanding higher taxes on the rich while Republicans say they wont budge without big changes to programs like Medicare and Medicaid Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell didnt mince any words in his first floor speech of the lameduck session Tuesday afternoon Republicans like me have said for more than a year now that were open to new revenue in exchange for meaningful reforms to the entitlement programs that are the primary drivers of our debt And meaningful reform is exactly what the authors of the CAP plan said they are proposing If entitlement reform is simply code for dismantling Medicare and Social Security were not at the table and we should oppose that with everything weve got said   a senior fellow with the group who helped put the proposal together On the other hand he added if entitlement reform is Were going to transform the system modernize it so it can deliver highquality lowercost care thats where we are And thats what we think weve got here Now the Center for American Progress isnt just any group Its considered something of the White Houses reserve corps Emanuel for example is the brother of former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and a former White House health staffer himself CAP President   is also a former White House health staffer And this new plan is notable not just for potential savings of a halftrillion dollars but for what some of those savings are They include many things that build on savings included in the   like cutting waste and encouraging more efficient care as well as lowering payments to some providers But there are also some controversial items Like asking wealthier Medicare beneficiaries to pay more out of pocket for their care And limiting the taxfree status of health insurance for people who earn more than  a year These are not easy proposals said Tanden They are definitely not easy proposals for the progressive side Indeed tampering with the socalled tax exclusion for employerprovided health premiums in even the most minor way in the Affordable Care Act   for organized labor whose members tend to negotiate for more generous taxfree benefits rather than taxed wage increases But they are things that both liberal and conservative economists agree would start to rein in health spending as  million baby boomers start to migrate onto Medicare And Emanuel says they werent included in the plan just to try to win Republican votes for a budget deal The US health care system is the fifthlargest economy in the world   trillion Its as big as the French economy he said Its slightly   actually Youre not going to transform it overnight You need however to put in place the structures that will transform it over a decade Thats what weve tried to do and I think this is the legacy for the president But will the plan really impress any of those Republicans who are clamoring for entitlement reform Early indications suggest not The idea that you can shoot at everyone in a crowd and not hit a beneficiary is ridiculous scoffed Tom Miller a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a former Republican congressional staffer Miller suggests that by cutting payments to health care providers the plan cant help but result in some care disruptions for patients Its just a continuing combination of further payment reductions  relatively arbitrarily he said Rather than letting the market determine how the health care system works youre going to see what command and control really looks like for the health care system he said And there are some places even the liberal Center for American Progress wouldnt go For example raising    as some have proposed  is a nonstarter We believe raising the Medicare age simply shifts costs to states seniors and private employers Tanden said Likewise the plan rejects most cuts to the Medicaid program Reducing funding for Medicaid right now would undermine the very strong case the administration is making each and every day for governors to  do their Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care Act Tanden said
