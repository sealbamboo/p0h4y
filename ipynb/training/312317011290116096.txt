Wisconsin has the highest number of binge drinkers in the nation   in  adults And binge drinking    as five or more alcoholic drinks in a short period of time for men and four for women  cost the state  billion in  That breaks down to about  per person in higher taxes more health care and other costs according to a   from the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute       who coauthored the study spoke with host Audie Cornish on   Thursday To understand how big an economic toll binge drinking takes Black and her colleague Jason Paltzer divided the costs into different categories The largest portion of the economic burden comes from lost productivity according to Black That includes missing work premature mortality incarceration and absenteeism In  there were  hospitalizations due to binge drinking  part of the increased health care costs And with more than  arrests of binge drinkers in  the criminal justice system is also taking a hit But how did the researchers account for Wisconsins large population of   Surely they have something to do with the states binge drinking rate So if you took those students out of the equation would the numbers look different Black says yes and no We know that binge drinking is a huge problem in the  to yearold population but in Wisconsin specifically that behavior continues past college she says And its really kind of a norm And thats why we are No  in the nation as far as binge drinking rates Unfortunately Wisconsins alcohol problem extends beyond binge drinking The general alcohol consumption rate for the state is  percent higher than the national average Black tells Cornish there are a lot of reasons that account for how Wisconsin became the booziest state in the nation A lot of it is availability Black says Alcohol is available at every event  church event school event sporting event We have local control here so there is no monitoring of the number of licenses that are allowed for people to sell alcohol The state also has one of the lowest taxes on alcohol in the country In  Wisconsin collected  million in alcohol taxes which covers just  percent of the  billion in costs detailed in the report Many of the states public health experts including Black have argued for raising the tax to temper the problem We know that increased prices are a deterrent for younger drinkers so it would help on front end in that it would reduce some drinking she says And then on the other end it would help pay for more of the problems that are caused by excessive alcohol use If youre curious about how other states rank you can check out   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put together in  It seems theres something regional about the problem Nebraska and North Dakota are No  and  respectively But youll also find a lot of people overdoing it in New England the District of Columbia Alaska and Hawaii
